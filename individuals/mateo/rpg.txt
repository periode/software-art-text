												Well, my review is mainly for beginners who have just started this game or willing to buy it
This is also for them who had stopped playing it after some trivial hours of trying
A great game but yet I think the enjoyment will depend on how you are playing it! All that I mean, if you want to get the fullest essence of this game then play with suitable co-op partner(s)
Some who enjoys solo, they may say different but as I played solo because I had none to play with, so I felt even boring in some point and so also I felt how much the experience would be better with suitable co-op partner(s)
This is a hard-core game for hard-core gamers
Death and incapability may happen every now and then… but again the number may be reduced dramatically if you have your co-op partner(s)
There are some other advantages too to play co-op (such as, better loot, or think that while you are reloading your gun, your co op partner still firing and thus you will be less hurt by enemies) and the game itself prompts for co-op although everything can be done in solo except few achievements
This is a long game, including DLCs and need patience to finish them all
However, as I said before, this is a hard core game with almost a lot enemy everywhere, so, at some point you can feel frustrated if you don’t have proper levelled equipment and so you should farm for right things enough
Here again comes the advantage of co-op; such as you 4 people if farm for 4 weapons and then you can make duplicate of those [though it is a glitch] and you 4 can be well equipped… which chance does not exist in solo and so can be a lot time consuming and monotonous to be advanced
For new players, as I was when I started this game… may be a problem to understand the architecture of the game
At the very beginning the game starts in NORMAL mode
Once you will finish the main game… then TVHM [True Vault Hunter Mode] will be unlocked which you can take as medium difficulty
Re-playing the game in TVHM mode from the beginning once you reach at level 50 and then so also if you have finished the last mission of main story, then UVHM [Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode] will be unlocked for you
So take this as hard mode
There are over power [OP (1 to 8)] mode also where you can think it as very hard difficulty mode where enemy is up of your level
but that can be unlocked once you reach the ultimate level of the game, i
e
level 72
So, the main game will take you upto the level 50; The UVH pack 1 will take you upto 61 and UVH pack 2 will take you to level 72
Addition as on 30th June: Since I have just finished the main mission of main game in UVHM mode so I shall suggest you if you are playing UVHM then you must carry 2 blue pistols: Potent Rubi and Potent Gorg Nozzle and always keep one of these at your one slot
Whenever you are low in health start shooting using it
This is the review basing on my present experience of nearly 400 hours; I can update this review in the future as I shall get new experience

												Borderlands 2 is a game for those that enjoy the feeling of finding awesome equipment hidden in a massive pile of other stuff
Sure, you don't NEED to go in-depth with this game
 On the first playthrough you can get by with just picking up gear as you travel along, choosing stuff that looks better than your current gear, and maybe occasionally buying something in the vendor that looks handy
 The deeper you go down the rabbit hole however, the more there is to discover
The story is decent for a First Person Shooter (albeit one with RPG elements), and dialogue is often amusing to a degree
 Handsome Jack, the main antagonist is a cartoon villain with M rated attitudes
 He believes, or at least pretends to believe that he is the good guy, and you are just a "Filthy Bandit
"
Graphically, the game has a lot more variations in design and color scheme than it's predecessor (which was brown, brown, and a bit of color here and there)
 Cell shaded graphics with thick, graphic novel like outlines is the style of the game, and does a good job of separating it from the average FPS
Now, on to the gameplay itself!:Action is often fast paced and exciting
 So long as you don't allow yourself to get too far ahead of the enemy levels, you'll find battles where you have to fight hard to win
 The game does a decent job of easing you into the various elements, such as different gun types (Pistol, SMG, Assault/Combat Rifle, Shotgun, Revolver, Rocket Launcher, and Sniper Rifle), the importance of a good shield, grenade mods (alter the way your grenade behaves, including damage bonuses and special effects), Class Mods (Class-specific devices which can boost skills, and have other effects like increasing fire rate with specific weapon types), and lastly Relics (Device which generally boost damage or defence in some way)
 Equipment rarity is also made fairly clear
 It goes White, Green, Blue, Purple, Magenta, Orange, Seraph, and Pearlescent
 The final two rarities (Pearlescent and Seraph) are special
 Seraphs require you to have at least one of the season pass DLC to obtain (and you need all 4 of the Season Pass DLC to obtain all the Seraph rarity items), and as to Pearlescent rarity weapons, you need to be in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (Playthrough 3) for them to have a chance of being spawned
 Don't assume that a blue is automatically better than a green rarity item, even at the same level
 Experiment!Playable Characters and Skills:There are 4 included playable characters, and two DLC characters
 Each class has it's ups and downs, and a special game changing skill unique to them
 For example, Salvador (Gunzerker) will dual-wield guns when his action skill is active, meaning TWICE THE FIREPOWER
 Axton (Commando) drops a turret, which damages enemies and draws aggression away from you
 Maya (Siren) locks an enemy's movements for a short time, allowing you to get in free hits
 Zer0 turns invisible for a few seconds and launches a decoy, and his first attack made whilst in this mode does increased damage
 The DLC characters are Gaige (Mechromancer) who launches a flying robot that attacks nearby enemies, and Kreig (Psycho); a schizophrenic musclebound maniac that will whale on everything within reach with increased offensive and defensive capabilities and can even throw his axe at more distant targets
Aside from the action skills unique to the character, there are various other skills that you can put points into, and have an effect on gameplay in some way
 For example, increasing fire rate or damage for a few seconds after a kill is made
 Each character has 3 skill trees, each ending with a final gamechanging skill modifier
 For example, Zer0's Bloodlust (Melee) tree ends with the Many Must Fall perk, which will instantly re-deploy the hologram if he kills the enemy with one melee strike
 As mentioned before, Class Mods unique to a character class will boost certain skills
 It's possible for them to go as high as +6, meaning some skills can be boosted to 11, as the normal limit on points you can put into most skills is 5, though some skills are only 1 (those usually affect the way you play)
Plus, there is a gun that shoots swords



EXPLODING swords


In DLC4 (Tiny Tina's Assault on the Dragon Keep)
 So yeah, there is that too
I hope you found my review useful, even if it might be a bit messy XD

Borderlands 2 - Excellent Story, Solid Gameplay, Great Characters and one of the very best Coop experiences around
 || 9
5 || Score Comment   Graphics 8 Borderlands 2 has a visual style all its own, it may not initially impress some used to a "next generation, high definition, ultra realistic landscape", but it is nevertheless very appealing and detailed
Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora (the world on which the story takes place) are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere
Characters and enemies are detailed and extremely varied in appearance
You can customise your characters appearance with a large selection of outfits and heads which you can collect throughout the game
  Audio 10 No real killer soundtrack here (apart from the the introduction video), just really good atmospheric music throughout
Where this game really shines is the voice acting for characters, enemies, audio logs and even weapons (yes some of them can talk!)
The dialogue is often very funny, helping to explain and drive the story, fill in background and really adds the the immersion
  Gameplay 9 A mix of FPS and RPG, Borderlands 2 is a lot of fun to play
So many missions to complete, so many enemies to kill, so much loot to grab
You are given massive area's to explore all over the world of pandora filled with creatures, quests, secrets and homages to lots of popular culture
Controls are responsive, intuitive and the game mechanics (even at higher difficulties) feel fair and well thought through
As you progress through the game you will earn xp and levels which allow you to customise your characters skills giving a large variety of gameplay styles
  Story 9 The story in Borderlands 2 is rich and engaging
The action is character driven, and while the main story is fairly linear, the open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora
It also has one of the most badass, charasmatic and handsome villians of all time


   Replayability 9 So many reasons to replay this game
Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards
There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different
Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore
Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character
These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text)
   Multiplayer 10 For me, this game remains simply the best cooperative multiplayer experiences you can have
Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team
Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels
The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication
   Overall 9
5 I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters
So much fun to pick up and play with friends
- I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game
To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more
 More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree? Please leave me a comment 
Posted: 27 June
Edit: Please stop joining my game, my anxiety can't handle itI've been avoiding reviewing this game, being my number one favourite I couldn't think of a way to make it unbiased
But after the resurgence of Open world games, the downfall of AAA and the battle between TF2 and Overwatch, I think I can finally pinpoint what makes it so beautiful
The art style is an obvious starting point
Everything is cartoony and exaggerated, it's filled with colour and despite being cartoony it feels more realistic than the grim grisley greyness of Skyrim, Morrowind, Witcher etc
It's not perfect of course, with clipping and terrible lip sync but with the cartoony atmosphere it adds to the exaggerated charm that it provides
The characters themselves are also important
If you compare how they were designed to Mass Effect: Andromeda, the way it has been presented is genius
There are a lot of gay characters, black characters, female characters- but these characteristics do not define who they are
The characters still have peronalities, they just happen to be these things- they are not just addons, it just adds to the depth of the world
I suppose the most important thing in a game is the gameplay, and this Borderlands nails too
A lot of games can't tell whether they want to be simple or complicated, they can't tell what gimmicks they want to use, so they use everything and it turns into an incoherent mess like Undertale
Borderlands knows exactly what it wants to do
It's a Single Player or Co-Op FPS with RPG mechanics with levelling and loot systems
The RPG mechanics make it feel more open worldy than most open world games
It defines what towns exist, and gives you fast ways to get to them, and while games like Skyrim use the open world idea to make you travel for hours, Borderlands 2 just adds a lot of depth with; secret loot boxes, experience, Cult of the Vault logos or mini easter eggs
Something that I noticed in my most recent playthrough is how much freedom you have throughout and how this can appeal to both new players and veterans
One example is the first area, the entirety of Southern Shelf
You fight Knuckle dragger, to a new player they find out how brilliantly designed the bosses will be: They aren't walls of health, they aren't stupidly damaging, they are balanced with weaknesses and phases
An expert player on the other hand could then debate whether they would want to farm Knuckle Dragger for the legendary pistol Hornet, or just move on
This can also be seen in Southern Shelf Bay when you have to kill Midgemong
A new player could rush right towards Midgemong or maybe explore the boats, while an expert player would take the long route around for some extra loot and instead of calling the bridge over to get across the lake, they can just run across the chain, significantly increasing the pacing and replayability of the game
Of course Borderlands 2 isn't perfect, the majority of the fun is in the UVHM playthrough which is a DLC
The bugs might throw people off while I enjoy discovering two or three new ones every new playthrough
Even despite this, just the first playthrough with a friend is highly worth your time
Let's hope Borderlands 3 will be another great one
Iron out the issues of Borderlands 2, while still being able to provide replayability where Borderlands: The Pre-sequel couldn't

												There is something to be said for a game that I just don't get sick of
I have owned this on console and played through TVHM at least 4 times with 4 different characters there
Played all the DLC except Tiny Tina on console, but when the GOTY edition became so cheap on PC I jumped at it and bought all the Headhunter DLCs, and the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack as well
So I can now play through the game THREE times on a character
DarI'm so addicted to this game still, but the funny thing is that I don't even finish it, or even come close to it now
I'm in a mass addiction to boosting my Badass Ranks so I just keep trying to "prestige" it instead of moving on and going towards UVHM
xDI feel like I can pick this game up and play it at any time
Do a few things, and then quit playing
Unfortunately, for me anyways, I don't do that
I keep playing for hours, and I let all the other hundreds of games in my library continue to pile up
I play this game EXCLUSIVELY in SINGLE PLAYER
People will tell you that it is much more fun playing with friends, and truly it can be, but don't disregard this game as a single player game
It is insanely addictive, and it actually poses some slight challenges to you to play it solo
Beating Raid Bosses solo is actually a genuine accomplishment, if you can actually do it
They are meant to be beaten witha 4 player team, but you CAN beat many of them solo
The new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM) makes it an even more insane challenge to play solo just for the regular game enemies
Needing to pump them full of slag just so you can actually get ready to start damaging them with any real power
Of course all this is basically a math problem of damage output vs
damage defense
Borderlands 2, simply put, is one of the best games ever made in my opinion
The sheer addictiveness and fun in playing it are jsut off the charts
I recommend this to anyone, even if you think you won't like it
I thought Borderlands 1 looked stupid for years until I bought it for $5 with everything and realized how amzing the concept is and how it was made for OCD gamers
Now they are both 2 of my most played games ever, and I don't see myself stopping BL2 anytime soon
After all I ahven't even used The Psycho yet!Buy the GOTY Edition
It is the best deal by far and has most of the relevant content you will want
Forget about the Season Pass and regular game
GOTY has all that stuff and more
Then buy the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack to get extra level sand a 3rd round
The headhunter DLCs are worth it too for the cheap prices
Only thing not to buy are the stupid skin packs
Unless you like that sort of thing
Wait for it to go 75% off and you can get GOTY, UVH Pack, and allt he Headhunter DLCs for less than $20
BTW


these DLCs are legit and worth buying
This isn't some garbage map pack DLC, or jsut skins
These are high quality and large DLCs on the scale of the FAllout DLCs, and add even more than that in some of tehm
GOTY edition has almost too much content
>_>

												Definitely one of the best "new" games I have played
This game is fun to play solo or over the net with friends
The characters are witty, yeah even Claptrap :) Graphics are beautiful


Even after playing this game over 3000 hours; the game gives wow-moments to me
And every time there's something new



and the vast choice of weapons, shields and other gadgets
So I full-heartedly recommend Borderlands 2
And yes, I will play co-op with you :)

												This game is infinite
You can play it whatever you like and it's always fun
I've said enough
			
Posted: 16 January, 2015
												I had played 1200 hours before I even tried any of the DLC
Now, if that doesn't speak to the incredible level of fun and depth that this game brings, well, I just don't know that anything can
Sometimes I wonder how much better my life would be if I had spent those 1400 hours doing something constructive like studying my trade, helping the poor, or working on my home
But not often
Second best game ever made
Absolutely terrific
Life ruiner
Go for it

 Hello fellow gamers and curious consumers, take this honest but probably biased and most importantly very unprofessional review as a friendly advice  Performance  - The developers promised that the PC version was being developed in parallel with the other versions and their words seem to hold ground, I am seeing almost limitless settings to choose from and the game performs very good on my rig (i7 4790 + GTX 970) on High-Very High mixed settings
Surprisingly the Anti-Aliasing can only be set from Off to High, it doesn't specify what you are choosing (FXAA,SMAA), same thing goes for Shadows which can only be set from Very Low to Ultra High, I am not seeing TXAA or PCSS GameWorks and honestly I am glad about it
You can also customize the HUD Presets where you can turn off the damage numbers for example and generally reduce the amount of feedback you are getting on your screen
There is love displayed for the PC version and I am very thankful about that :) Controls  - I am playing as usual using Mouse and Keyboard and the controls seem responsive


at least for me, as for controller support I don't know much (since I play almost all my games using M+K) other than there seems to be Xbox controller support



as expected I guess? Gameplay  - It is the first time Assassin's Creed goes RPG and loot-based (I don't count Unity and Syndicate despite them apprehending some watered down RPG elements) and I can't say if this is good or bad for the series since taste is subjective so you be the judge, however the game hasn't fully departed from its stealth and action-adventure roots
The previous Ubisoft mechanics are still present, some of them implemented in their own interesting and different but yet familiar way
For example the horse carriage riding from Assassin's Creed Syndicate is present as a chariot racing minigame, or the drone/owl as your pet eagle etc
There are some minor bugs and glitches here and there (at least what I have encountered so far) but in my book they are acceptable for a game of this scale and they don't really bother me that much
However the AI needs some improvement because it can be really dumb sometimes and ruin the immersion for me, also some of the animations are weird and stiff, nothing game breaking but it would be nice if these issues get sorted out with a future patch
Combat  - Now this is the biggest change in Origins, the combat has shifted from animation-based system (or unscripted QTE if you will) to a hitbox-based system and I repeat, taste is subjective so whether you will enjoy or hate the new combat system is up to you, but I can tell you this much, it plays and feels better than it looks
Story  - Ubisoft over the last few years have been submissive (unfortunately) to a certain demographic and have been delivering some really lame story writing and shoving completely unneccessary modern political beliefs down our throats
As a result of this, the ''charming and intriguing mystery'' as I like to call it that the previous Assassin's Creed stories built is gone
I don't use this term often but I cringed through my entire playthrough of Assassin's Creed Syndicate and Watch_Dogs 2, both having the weakest writings in Ubisoft's catalog and their Disney bubbly characters with their over the top forced positivity made me sick, but hey Ubisoft, it's fine



you do you
I brought all that up because in this game they have ditched the Disney part at least, with Bayek being more mature, reliable and interesting than the previous sitcom toddlers Jacob and Marcus, anyway I won't go deeper than what you already know and have seen so far on YouTube due to spoiler issues so I will leave that experience and judgement to you
Graphics  - Amazing graphics as expected with no downgrades whatsoever, what was shown on E3 is delivered here
A joy to look at that beautifully rendered draw distance, and the beautiful color palette choice makes this game look absolutely stunning
Ashraf Ismail and his team have really created the best looking Egypt themed game on the market currently
Soundtrack  - I don't think the Assassin's Creed franchise has ever disappointed me in this regard, from trailers to ingame, the music has always been beautiful, eargasmic and most importantly fitting, and Ubisoft has delivered the all said points with this one as well
Thanks for taking the time to read this review but I would strongly recommend you read more detailed and professional reviews regarding the PC port (benchmarks), check gameplay footage on YouTube to see if the game appeals to your taste and make up your own mind instead of having your opinion swayed by ''game journalism-ing''			
Posted: 31 October
												I thought the other reviews were being hyperbolic but this game really does suffer some serious performance issues
Maybe its the DRM, I don't know but this is the first game in a long time that I've seen give my PC problems even at lower settings
			
Posted: 31 October
												The game itself is brilliant from what I have played but I stopped before my CPU consumed itself
I'm getitng 60% CPU usage on the Title screen
I-5 3
2ghz Quad Core8GB RamGTX 1080 Asus Strix (Oc'd)100% usage on all cores and 40% usage on GPU
60 FPS in the desert and 30 fps in towns and cities
			
Posted: 31 October
												VMProject and Denuvo using 40% of CPU while we are playing this game haHAA clapChange that and I'll change the rate
Edit: Running on:intel i5 4690k @ 4
3GHzMSI nvidia GTX 97016GB ramSamsung SSD 850 EVOThe game is going on high settings except for AA wich is on low(in the cities go from 45-60fps), is sad to see that my gpu doesn't even go further 80% of usage and 70% power while the CPU is running all the time at 100%, not even BDO take that much CPU
Well, the game is really good on itself from what I've played, if it wasn't for that excessive use of CPU everybody would be happier, and if everybody is happier, that mean more sells wink wink
			
Posted: 31 October
												Bought and refunded
Listen to everyone people
My computer has more than enough for this game and my Fps was clipping down to 15 every 5 seconds or so
After about 15-20 minutes in the lag and black screen flicker was too much to even get to enjoy playing the game
SO;Do not buy till they fix the anti piracy software (by removing it) because it will run like trash
The game it self seemed kind of fun for the five minutes I got to actually enjoy
			
Posted: 29 October
												I'll just say it, I love this game
If you've played Assassin's Creed games in the past, you pretty much know what to expect here
It's not doing anything we haven't seen in other games or pushing any boundaries, but it's a ton of fun and well worth your time and money
Pros+ Beautiful world set in a truly interesting setting (ancient Egypt)
It's a joy to get lost in exploring
I've had many times where, on the way to a quest objective, I've run off to see what's going on over there and suddenly it's an hour later and I'm no closer to my quest objective
+ Open-world stealth done well, though not quite up to the outstanding MGSV
I love assaulting forts, taking my time in picking off all the guards one by one
Using Senu (your pet hawk) to scout is a neat way to prepare your infiltration
+ A TON of things to do
Side quests are (mostly) well-written, varied, and fun
The main story so far (I'm 20 hours into the game at the time of writing) is intriguing, and I'm excited to see where it leads
+ RPG-lite mechanics
XP from kills, loot, ability points for new skills
Again, nothing too complex but it fits the game well
Cons- Overall it feels like they played it safe and went for accessibility over complexity
Like I said before, there's not much new here that we haven't seen
- Melee combat can be clumsy
I appreciate that they went away from the Batman style to a more dodge and position based combat system, but it doesn't feel entirely


finished
- Occasional graphics glitches
I had to restart the game once, and it went away
- Uplay
If you've enjoyed other Assassin's Creed games, and like the idea of exploring ancient Egypt, pick this game up
			
Posted: 4 November
												So this installment is about as close to perfect as you could expect
With about 35 hours in the game so far, I personally believe this is the best of the series
The map is immense, the graphics stunning, and the story line is quite awesome
 There are so many side quests, it's hard to decide which one to do next
I found the underwater swimming easier to navigate this time around as well as the character movement
 In short, it is very hard for me to find a solid complaint about this game that would not sound like nit-picking
 
Posted: 7 November
												THERE IS A LAUNCHER, I REPEAT THERE IS A LAUNCHER! Right click the game in your steam menu and click 'launcher' to change resolution and settings
It's a back-asswards way of doing it but you can change the resolution and other settings that way
EDIT: At release, the launcher didn't


well


launch, so a lot of people were having issues, they seemed to have fixed it
Regardless, I still recommend this game; it's Samurai Dark Souls with a touch of Samurai Warriors influence thrown in; what's not to love?EDIT 2: Apparently i need to clarify this
When I say 'Samurai Warriors Incluence', I'm refering to the Character designs, especially Nobunaga's
Some are saying that they see more Onimusha in this but I don't remember Onimusha ever being quite like this
Maybe it's just been a while
Hopefully I don't have to edit this review any further
			
Posted: 7 November
												Game is cool, port - not so much
Better wait for patches
Or if you are determined to play:- Game occasionly crashes when loading level
- Mouse is not supported in any way
Not even in menus
Gamepad all the way, unless you want to go mad (like I did with DS1) and play on keyboard
In that case you may want to use Autohotkey to reassign the buttons to your liking (not sure if that's considered cheating though)
- For your graphical settings to be applied properly: start the game as is
Exit the game
Start with game launcher (right click on game in the steam games list) and set your settings there
That way works fine so far except few graphical glitches here and there
- If you managed to set game to fullscreen at it got minimized without the way to get back - navigate to your Documents\KoeiTecmo\NIOH and delete config
xml or the whole NIOH folder alltogether (if you do not have any saves yet ofc)
It should reset your settings to default
Do not try to use fullscreen mode until it's patched
- If during the game the whole screen suddenly turns gray - open game settings menu and close it, the camera will reset and be back to normal

												I know Koei Tecmo has a rep of having lavishly horrible PC ports, but after 10+ hours of playing (with only 1 soft crash), I have had the smoothest gameplay experience: Stable frames, alright controls, little to no glitches


Tecmo has done an alright job with this 


so far
Though the game isnt "optimized" to give a geniuine pc experience ( graphics, uncapped frames, etc
), it still does live up to be the souls-like witcher game I imagined it be

												I usually don't write reviews but can't stand all those negative comments regarding optimization
I'll just put my computer specification below and settings on which I have tested first area (due to rain is supposedly more demanding on graphic card) and you'll decide what to think
Computer:i5 2500K 3
3GHz so no OC16 GB DDR 3and the winner: GTX 770 2GB which is below minimal requirementes!Settings:1920x1080High rendering and shadowsAmbient Occlusion and Dynamic Reflections ON while Blur OFFResult:no lagin first area between 40-60 FPSin area after training 55-60 FPS at the beginning section (I didn't have time to play further)It's far from professional test but to be honest first I tried this game with all mentioned settings but Ambient Occlusion and Dynamic Reflections OFF and was suprised how it plays
After all comments about optimization I though I won't be able to launch it and play comfortably but I was positively suprised

												running on a 970GTX and a i7 4790k and haven't had any issues so far on 1080p with everything maxed and a stable 60 fpsit seems that most issues are occuring with people that wanna go above 1080p so if you are not one of those people that wants to go above 1080p u should not have any problems
also i see a few bad reviews about the resolution being bad or it keeps resetting, this is easily fixed by doing the following :-start your game once (wich most of you probably already did) and then close it again-restart your game but this time open the nioh launcher, you can adjust your settings there and the game wont look like a ps2 game anymore after you've done thatHave fun !

												Fps is maxed at 60 but thats not much of an issue for the average person
Game is running steadily at 60 with an RX-480 and i5-4590; no clue why within 5 minutes of the game's release there was a onslaught of reviews stating the game is unplayable with a GTX 1080
The game is alot better than the mixed reviews would make it seem
Definite buy if you have a average pc as it doesn't take advantage of ultra wide monitors and such
			
Posted: 9 November
THIS IS NOT A REAL REVIEW YET IT'S JUST TO SHUT SOME PEOPLE UP SINCE ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES IN PC GAMING IS USUALLY IN FRONT OF THE MONITOR
So this is the rumored launcher[i

com]Everything on max and the game runs smooth af on 60fps
So yes go and buy it
It's good
It runs good
It plays good
Will update the review at some point into a real one

												Hand of Fate 2 is a real sequel, with massive improvements, but no drastic changes to the core gameplay (which is good)
If you liked the 1st one, you will definitely like this one even more
-Combat gameplay improved but can get repetitive
-More gambits (Dice, precision, spin wheel) apart from the Chance cards-Companions, challenges, different ways to play each timeGreat game overall ! I'm really looking forward to playing Endless mode (to be released soon, but there is already PLENTY to do at the moment)
PS : Luck is still a very important factor to win
It is a double edged sword
Sometimes it will make you go insane, but it can also be a great weight off your shoulders

General thoughts:Exactly what I wanted
Similar to the first game but does enough different to make it feel like a new game
A lot of the systems have been improved upon and I'm enjoying some of the new mechanics
If you liked the first hand of fate then I fully recommed you buy the game
They updated some of the features in the last game and improved them for example the combat which some people didn't like in the first game
The Levels:Unlike the first game where all the levels were pretty similar in this one they are very different
On each level you have a mission to achieve as well as an optional objective to get a gold clear on that level such as getting every relic, keeping potato boy alive or rescuing a certain amount of people in a level
The levels are really fun and are different to each other and by getting gold clears on levels you unlock additional cards
Weapon systems:The new weapon systems make the combat a lot better
Unlike the first game where you went for the best damage you have weapons that counter specific enemy types such as dual wield weapons against thieves and heavier weapons against armoured opponents
Companions:The companion that you choose on the card selection will follow you into combat as well as give you skills
The first companion you get will give you a Force Shield around you that blocks a hit if you use the companion skill button
They also help out in the board section of the game such as giving you an additional dice if you mess up or allowing you to have a retry on the card wheel
I found them to be very fun and helps swing the RNG in your favour
Last thoughts:So far everything is just a better Hand of Fate 1 which is what I wanted
It sticks to the original theme but implements new systems and I'm sure there are more to find as I get further into the game
The game runs very well for me on Ultra and I haven't bumped into any bugs/glitches except for a little fps drop on combat sometimes

												Is HoF2 perfect? No
Is it a vast improvement from HoF? Yes
Is it FUN? Heck yes!Honestly, I tend to be very weary of sequels; especially when they're sequels for games I adore
Hand of Fate is already a great game, so I was both excited and cautious when 2 was going to be different from what I already knew
Well, turns out it was different in mostly -good- ways
HoF2 is definitely more story-driven than the first, and even when you pull your random encounter cards, it doesn't derail the story that's currently happening
Rather, it just adds another layer to the story being told in that particular campaign, I think
There's also the addition of companions and their stories, which was a nice touch, I'm glad they got stories instead of just being 'cards' played in battle
The new chance mechanics are interesting, I actually really like the dice and card wheel as additions
The pendulum has a weird reaction time (more on reaction times in a bit), but it isn't a deal breaker
The addition of Fame and its requirements to use certain equipment is pretty cool, too
There's also a lot of entirely new encounters that add a new level to the gameplay, rather than the regular success/failure mechanic in HoF
Of course the Dealer is back and as sassy as ever, along with some other familiar faces
I'm also liking that we can customise our player, even if it's as basic as skin tone, hair/hair colour and armour pattern
However it's not all good news, the battles feel a little too unresponsive and 'loose', I prefered the battles in HoF by far
As I said earlier, the reaction times are pretty off
I have a really hard time dodging and parrying because I'm constantly 'missing' the prompts
Again, the pendulum chance suffers the same problem
If you're expecting tight action controls, unfortunately, you won't find them here as of this review
(Hopefully they'll be fixed up soon!)Probably the MOST annoying thing however is the little 'warp' cutscene that happens when you enter and exit battles
They're far too bright and too flashy/busy, so if you're sensitive to bright lights and effects, it's something to keep in mind
And as of right now there's no Endless Mode (although hardly an issue, there's PLENTY of story content to work through!)
But overall, if you enjoyed Hand of Fate, it's definitely worth picking up
It's not perfect but it's FUN and you can tell that a lot of love and dedication has gone into making it
			
Posted: 7 November
												Definitely an improvement over the first game
- Combat feels more challenging because it's quicker- More gambling options like Dices- Great environmentThe only thing I'm missing is 21:9 Ultrawide support
	21:9 support since first update!I can only recommend this game, especially to the ones who l oved the first one
Great work Defiant!

0/10Bad news first: I've taken off 1 point from a perfect score because of slight flaws
Although the combat was generally improved, the targeting and camera controls can sometimes still feel a bit unresponsive
Also, the Dealer seemed to be a stronger character when he was purely your adversary; it's slightly less fun to hate him now that he's technically on your side as your trainer
But don't worry; unlike what Rock Paper Shotgun's review claims, he's still ultimately the same character you know and love (to hate)
Even with these flaws, Hand of Fate 2 remains only 1 point away from a perfect score, simply because it's so fantastic overall
It improves upon its already-excellent predecessor in every way it possibly could
It is more streamlined and elegant, yet simultaneously more diverse and replayable
I won’t elaborate on its mechanics, as there are many other reviews which explore them in detail, but suffice it to say that at only 5 hours in, I feel safe in my prediction that this game will eventually be recognized as one of the best roguelites of all time, and quite possibly the single best digital board game ever created
Not convinced yet? Why, is “one of best roguelites of all time, and quite possibly the single best digital board game ever created” not good enough for you? Then allow me to persuade you further by contrasting this game with the general state of the AAA gaming industry in late 2017:“In Call of Duty: WW2, loot boxes drop from the sky onto Normandy beach and open in front of other players”That is a real headline from Eurogamer
It is referencing a $60 game, which constantly tempts you to spend yet more of your money in exchange for dropping you some loot boxes out of the sky onto Normandy beach, so you can open them in front of other players, and show them what absolutely-worthless piles of digital feces you got for indulging your possibly-very-real gambling addiction in the hopes of getting slightly-less-worthless piles of digital feces
Everyone runs around Normandy beach and watches everyone gambling with crates of digital feces, in a manner that I might honestly say is not all THAT tasteless, were I for some reason to completely ignore the fact that it actually exists, as well as any and all of its discernable attributes
Hand of Fate is half the price of CoD:WW2, not even including the loot boxes
They will soon be releasing an Endless Mode DLC, which will be well worth their asking price of absolutely nothing
You get an Endless Mode, you get an Endless Mode, all of you get an Endless Mode, because you were smart enough to support the developers that actually think of their customers and community members not as whales, dolphins, and minnows, but as ACTUAL, SENTIENT, HUMAN F***ING BEINGS
TL;DR: Boycott loot boxes
Buy the best digital board game in the history of video games

												Ok, so I will give you guys the run down of what I thought of the game; Though I have not played the first game
- Battles: The battles I found to be pretty easy most of the time
- Story: From what i have seen the story is quite enjoyable
- Characters: many of the companions are fun to have around
- RNG: 








I am almost positive the dude gave me loaded dice
- Graphics: HAHAHAHAHA
I Wouldn't know if it did or not
I play on the graphic setting of the lowest of the low
ok for those of you that would like some elaboration, I will do that down below
the Battles: [8/10]When I first Bought the game, I went through the reviews and thought "oh god no!" but after launching the game I found that the battles were almost laughably easy
After the first chapter though things got a bit harder
now we had a SECOND type of attack to watch out for
OH NO!When a Green Light pops above anyones head, Mearly block and then just spam attack
If it is a Red Light dodge in any direction and then spam attack
Or you know, you could just dodge every type of attack and spam attack







At the start of the third episode, they start adding More types of enemies which make it slightly difficult at worst
Story: [6/10]Ok, so I did not play the first game
so i'm not entirely sure of the story but I feel like I picked up most of the backstory
I can't say i'm deeply involved in the story
It's OK
Not award winning from what I have seen but it is enjoyable
Characters: [7/10]- First, the Main Character
Your MC is the typical Blank slate of this Genre
he/she has some slight customablity
unless  you choose to be a girl, then it's either: shaved head, mohawk, mohawk with Braids, or mohawk with short pony tail
- The Companions from what I have seen are useful and make the game more enjoyable
when you enter a battle they make remarks that make them feel more alive and made me laugh a few times
thier skills are useful in battle and on the tabletop
- The wizard is that friend who makes D&D great adding extra info and funny quips every now and again
he will also do his best to kill you
you have been warned
THE RNG:  (Roll the dice, if you roll higher than an 11, you recieve [8/10] if not [5/10]-RNG is a thing where you forget your good luck and nurture your memories of bad luck
If i was to be a fair and impartial observer, I would say the game's RNG is well done
though im not






ITS RIGGED!!!!!!!-the encounters that are not combat related are probably the things that kill me the most in the game
[#/#]My Computer is from the dark ages
It cannot run most games on anything above low graphic settings
Playing this game on low graphics, I have not had a problem with anything
I would rate [8/10]A solid good game
			
Posted: 8 November
Pros for HoF1 fans:-Same voice actor for the dealer (aw yis)-Holy cheese though, look at him-That poor hooded man-Get him some skin lotion-We did this-More of the same HoF1 formula-Improved combat system-Companions (they're not bad!)-Compelling plot-The soundtrack is everything you would hope it would be-Defiant is still doing their thingPros for everyone else:-Roguelike card game hack and slash roleplaying game with resource management-Play through your own character's story through cards representing events and fate-Fighting is entirely skill based-Certain encounters require luck (dice minigames, picking the 1 success card out of a shuffled hand of 4 that you can track with your eyes reliably with practice, etc
)-Complete game for $30, free endless mode coming (which will be amazing, if the first game is any indication)-Developer is known for consistently delivering quality product, and fixing bugs and offering free DLC when possible (in the first game, 1 DLC required money, the other 4 or 5 were free, and all had a good deal of content)-Gentle learning curve that gives plenty of chances to relearn important information (like special attacks!  And finishers!)-Playing first game is not required, but highly recommended-Intuitive gameplay, despite the massive amount of information to process, which is actually pretty impressive
-Beautiful soundtrack and flawless voice acting-Trustworthy developerCons:-Honestly, if you liked the first one, you'll like this one
-The loading screen tends to scorch my eyes with the pure whiteness of it
-Seriously, imagine a sudden bright flash of light, followed by enemies swarming in trying to kill you-Oh, hey, Defiant made their load screen a flashbang-Game took too long to release-idk man, this game is pretty close to perfection so far, though I'm only an hour in at the time of reviewing
Overall: Hokay, so
 If you haven't played the first game, you should
 This game is basically the same as the first, only better
 If you have played the first game, that should be enough to sell you
For those of you who sorta stumbled onto this in the new releases section, here's what you're looking at
You look at a map
 There are areas you can explore
 Each area has a storyline and quests and so on
 You go to an area, and the dealer sets up the area's board, which has lots of face down cards
 You control your miniature, which then moves from face-down card to face-down card, turning each one over and resolving the encounters they represent as you move
One face down card might contain a shop where you buy supplies
 One face down card might have a thief, who takes some of your gold, and you must chase him to get it back
 Maybe you come across peasants fending off highwaymen, and you decide which side to help, if any
 Depending on your choices you may have to face a chance-based minigame, such as rolling three dice and trying to get at least 12 on them all combined across 2 rolls
 Or picking from 4 face down cards, and finding the one "success" card rather than the 3 "failure cards"
Sometimes there's combat
 Then you zoom in, and your miniature comes to life, and suddenly you have to use it to fight off the enemies
Sometimes you have allies
 Eventually you also get companions who help as well
 Your equipment is gained through shops and rewards from encounters, and is also visually represented as cards showing stats like defensive or offensive power, and special attributes
 Some types of weapons are better against some types of enemies
 It's very involved, but very intuitive for how much there is to process, and Defiant did a fantastic job streamlining things to be more intuitive than the first game
You also have three resources: Health, Food, and Gold
 You use a food each time you move to a new encounter (but not for retracing your steps over old encounters), and moving with no food results in losing health each step
 Health, if it reaches zero, kills you
 Duh
 And gold is used for shops
 Many encounters interact with your resources in some way, such as villagers giving you food for saving them from bandits, or a nobleman paying you to save him instead of the commoners
That's just the surface level view, though, and the gameplay is very deep and takes a lot of effort to really master
 There's enough new in this version that I'm relearning a lot
 But the first game was fantastic, and this one lives up to the legacy
 So I really recommend you give it a shot if you're at all interested
 This game hit all the right notes with me when I was burned out on just about everything
As an aside, Defiant really deserves a shout out for going above and beyond to make quality products and to respect the money their customers are paying for their games
 I have yet to encounter any bugs
 But if I do, I know with a good deal of confidence that they'll have it patched within a month, because that's the type of developer they are
 They deserve your money, and they'll earn every penny
Bottom Line: Easy Recommend

												It's even better than the first game, which was already an amazing game
The only thing this game needs is some quality of life updates, such as right click to back out, left click anywhere on the screen to advance text, A-D keys to scroll through cards, skippable pre-combat animations, etc
The devs already said we could expect some QOL updates after the first few weeks, so there is no reason not to buy the game right now

												Just played the first mission+ Game is way more focused at storytelling+ Combat system has been improved+ Old characters make a return (the maiden for instance)+ Game looks way more polished that HOF 1+ The Narrator is still cool- 45 minutes in, had my first crash after winning a fight in the second mission
Do keep in mind that this is 4 hours after launch, I'm expecting bugfixes later this week like with all new games today
If you want a sequel that improves on the older Hand of fate give this a try
			
Posted: 14 September
												Let's see:-Game releases in Early Access with a lot of promise-As it does Larian constantly outdo them selves with updates-They vastly increase the complexity of the AI-Improve the progression in several ways-Give us two well developed and deep extra skill trees-Create a truly grand undead race with interesting mechanics-AGAINST ALL ODD include full voice acting for a game with the amount of dialogue-And include a fully orchestral soundtrackAnd the reviews for this masterpiece of a game are going down because some Russians got salty over the translations being delayed a bit
This game lost it's Overwhelmingly Positive rating simply because they didn't manage to translate all of the 80,000 or so lines of dialogue in time for the release
Seriously
EDIT: To everyone asking, the game is FULLY voice acted, every NPC, no matter how insignificant has a voice
That is somewhere in the area of 80,000 voices lines, where a lot had to be recorded 8 times for each one of the player voices

												I'm 48

Posted: 19 September
												I'm 72 years old and these have been the best 20 hours of my life
EDIT::After playing through the game multiple times, including finishing it on Honour Mode, I have to say that my opinion of this game is even higher than it was after those first 20 hours
After finishing this game, it feels like my life is complete and there's nothing left to live for
This may be the last game I ever play and review I ever write
I would like to thank Larian for filling a void that has been plaguing me for more than half a century
I found the main story as well as every single side quest/story to be fun and interesting
There are no boring fetch quests as far as I can tell
How you handle side quests and whether you complete them or not 'does' affect the ending; as such, they could be considered extensions of the main story
(You could be unsatisfied with the ending if you just rush through and skip things
)You can build your characters any way you see fit and almost any build is completely viable
If you don't like the way you built your characters, just wait until you complete Act 1 and you can rebuild them any way you want as frequently as you want all the way up to the very end of the game; this is very good for testing new things out
By the end of the game my main character was a fire breathing Geo/Pyro battle mage that wielded a fire staff, used Warfare skills and showered my enemies in meteors with some necromancy for physical damage in case the enemy had too much resistance to those elements; she was pretty godly
I plan on trying a solo Honour mode run next with a similar but more diverse build
(I love the lizards!)For me, the best part of this game is the combat
It's extremely well done and very fun
I can't really say any more than what the other reviews cover though
Just know that if a fight seems absolutely impossible, that it really isn't
I've gone into fights where half my party was annihilated before I got to do anything, yet I still emerged victorious
There's always a way to win even if the enemy has you outnumbered and outleveled; just gotta think!Like many reviews state, there are still some bugs
As far as I can tell, they are all minor
After multiple play throughs on multiple difficulties I have not experienced any major bugs
Nothing game breaking and nothing that really affected my gameplay much
The few bugs I've experienced: - Many unvoiced lines in Arx
- Incorrect journal entries
- Sometimes a character would act blind in combat even though they weren't (could't use any ranged skills, couldn't see around themselves, but this was rare and only lasted a single turn
) - Sometimes the enemy AI would derp out and they'd just run around or repeatedly climb up and down a ladder until they were out of AP
- Custom undead characters do not receive the appropriate immunities, such as bleeding and suffocation
(though I don't recall any of my characters ever being afflicted with Bleed


) (Fane does receive these immunities) - Undead afflicted with Decay will not attempt to avoid poison puddles (Not sure if this is a bug or an oversight)
- Altitude does not affect many player or enemy melee attacks
(Entities 10+ meters above can be struck with melee
) But it does affect some skills, such as Dragon's Blaze, Laser Ray, charging skills, Battle Stomp, etc



I think that's about it
I'll add more if I remember them
Some reviews complain about enemies being omniscient and knowing all of your strengths and weaknesses (including whether you're undead or not), which is true, but it's also true for players
Any player with Loremaster on one of their characters can examine any NPC or enemy to gain insight into their strengths and weaknesses
Only one of your characters needs Loremaster
If you examine with someone that doesn't have it, they use the skill level of whoever does, even if that person is dead
(This even works on the final boss, at no point in the game is it unfair that enemies can spot your weaknesses
)So in summary, very fun game, great character customization, great combat, good story, a few minor bugs
It can be challenging in some scenarios but it's supposed to be; that's at least half the fun
I could mention the poor inventory management but countless reviews already cover that
Tip: Carry a couple pieces of +Thievery and +Loremaster gear with you to make sure you can pick any lock and identify any item
There may be times when your base skill isn't sufficient
TL;DR: Recommended, as shown above
10/10 on the Completely Subjective, Arbitrary and Useless rating system

Early Access Review
								You will love this game if


- You like games that don't hold your hand- You like games that allow you freedom to customise your characters and experiences- You like games that TRULY reward exploration and investigation*Legit, if you don't sit there scrolling over the map looking for hidden chests, ladders, ledges, etc, you're doing it wrong*- You like high strategy, turn based combat that rewards forward thinking and planning- You like finding, using, selling or collecting loot- You have 1 or more friends that will play with you
This game shines in multiplayerThe handful of little annoying bugs and glitches are completely and utterly outweighed by how captivating and enthralling this game is


And it's still in Early Access


I see a lot of complaints that the story isn't long enough, or really focusing on the bugs, lets get real
Bugs:- Sometimes your helmet will blink and flicker a bit- Sometimes your characters won't be within range, or have line of sight on a target they clearly should- Accuracy percentage seems to be a bit off, 80% chance to hit is more like 30%; anything under 90% is troubleThat's


About it


Story is too short? Well then play the rest of the game kid
You can speed run the "story" in like 20 minutes if you wanted, the real fun comes from exploring the world and finding everything else there is to do
I honestly can't believe how good this game is for an EA release and I can't wait for the full release come September
Could not recommend highly enough
Things I would like to see in future:- More races
- More in depth customisation options for spells and abilities
Think Champions Online or the Oblivion Spell-Creation
(asking for a lot, I know)- A little control over what armour looks like on your character
- More spells, more synergy between spells
This is already great, but why stop at great!The more points I list, the more I realise I'm just asking for more of the game
Give me more of the game mate

Early Access Review
								If more game developers had HALF the talent and attention to detail that Larian does, the market wouldn't be so saturated with garbage today
Larian is one of the best and the Divinity series proves it
By far one of the best RPGs I've ever played
KEEP IT UP

												I was tired of games that only tests your reaction skill
I was tired of games that say it's 60 dollars, only to have randomized loot boxes or micro-transaction implemented later in time
I was tired of games that were advertised to be wide as an ocean but ended up being shallow like a puddle
Then Divinity Original Sin 2 came out
Each encounter is well executed and designed flawlessly
Enemy design  is varied and leaves my friend and I saying "WTF is that!?" often
Every time my friend finds some epic loot, we cannot wait to identify it to see who can make use of the item
Quests are a joy to do and often leads you to find more quests that's filled with important decision making
Every choice you make has an impact on the world and I have been sent to jail multiple times for making the wrong decision
For $44
99 you are not buying a game but an experience
An experience to truly go on an epic adventure
Fights are never easy but once you learn the satisfaction of besting the enemy combatant that you failed to take down multiple times, you are left leaving for more glory
(Currently playing on Tactician Mode) I am not sure if anyone is going to read this review since this is my very first review with a positive rating (My other review is for Fallout 4 CREATION CLUB so you already know what rating I gave) but if you are looking for a game with challenge, depth, and quality give this game a try
I have been playing this game for over 102 hours and I have a feeling that this is only the beginning
			
Posted: 20 September
												I just bought this game yesterday and today I've already clocked 21 hours on it
I'm a grown man
I have a job, responsibilities, things to do
But all I did was sit in my damn chair in my underwear playing morning to night, stopping only to eat, sleep and use the toilet
10/10 would let this game suck my life away again

												Best strategy RPG in the 21st century
Beautifull story, wicked and funny as hell
Challenging, even on the lower difficulties
My 43 young brain rejoiced the golden area of  games like Baldurs gate, planescape torment and neverwiner nights
Only Con:The weekend has never passed so quickly!

												if ur not playing the first one (original fairy fencer f) , then skip that game and just go for this one
there is many aspect that really similar to original one (the whole first half actually)
maybe anyone who have the original fairy fencer f could say this is DLC for additional route (like me) and dissapointed
if u ask is this worth the price? well if ur not play this series yet, then yes if you ignore the original fairy fencer f and go for this one instead

												Oh boy if it isn't a great JRPG Yes i would recommend to anyone who is interested in JRPG and good content story then this game is for you, the only bad thing about this game is that sometimes u can get constant drop on fps and weird graphics when playing on dungeons
Also, take note that this game has lots of farming to do as well especially on gold,wp and exp if u wan to max out everything


Overall would r8 it 8/10P
S

												Way better than the original game but my issues is that if you listen/follow to the tutorial instructions, the game becomes too easy
I only hit level 10 recently and all of the mobs are too easy
Mobs either miss me and bosses only hit me for 100 damage max
Might have grinded too much but I only do each encounter per dungeon once, so all of my "levels" come from doing WP skill point increases
I also don't have any of the DLC so I am using the standard gear
If you are alright at being super massively overpowered at the start, then this is the JRPG for you

												If you've played one JRPG from Idea Factory, such as the Hyperdimension Neptunia series, then you already know what exactly to expect from FFF Advent Dark Force
Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force is like an enhanced version of Fairy Fencer F but with more contents
The amount of storyline gets tripled and has numerous of endings
The combat system is same as always but you're able to add up to 6 characters in your party! However, all of the enemies have higher stats just for this occasion, some were too OP
The soundtrack is really incredible especially the songs from the ending of each routes
The story is somewhat predictable but it didn’t bother me too much
Overall Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force is an excellent game with solid improvement over the original game that other JRPG fans will enjoy
Looking forward to the possible sequel!

Top Nep
Free product does not equal biased review
If I put a thumbs up, it's because I think the pros outweighs the cons, but that doesn't mean the game doesn't have flaws (which are written down)
This review pretty much mirrors what I've said in my review of the original Fairy Fencer F game, with some more things on the plus side, hopefully
You'd probably want to read it first if you've never played Fairy Fencer F games before, otherwise just read below
The good- True HD, say goodbye to the (720p?) upscale
It's extremely striking when you do a side-by-side comparison between the old graphics and the new ones
It's not just the textures, there are more flora and stuff overall
Colors are more vivid, and the world feels more vibrant
I won't post any more screenshots for now, I'll let you discover/enjoy the rest
- 60 FPS, stable (if you care about that)
- Whole new story route, and slightly revised story routes for the old ones
- New playable characters
- Party size increased from 3 to 6
- Menu interface slightly revamped (recolor mostly I'd say)
- New easier and harder modes
- New dungeons & enemies
- New story artworks
- Tuned down gold achievement (was 100M in the previous series, which was ridiculous)
- The new, highest difficulty setting can be a challenge if you go commando
- Fast loading times
The less good- Game still suffers from the "Mash the attack button and that's pretty much it" syndrome, albeit a bit less now
I still didn't feel the need to rely a lot on magic, although I recall using it more times than in the previous series
- Criticals from enemies are a joke
Normal attacks = 300, crits = 3000
Logic?When you're going for the 0 deaths/0 defeats/0 retreats stats, it's a real pain
- Elemental mechanics are barely, if at all, exploited in this game, which is a shame
Same thing for the formation feature
- No real incentive to play on high difficulties (higher than Hard especially), since the game doesn't provide any incentive to do so (higher difficulties do not give you more XP/Gold/BP, just "better drops"


apparently
Maybe
)
Enemies on high difficulties are just bullet sponges and all you'll be doing is wasting your free time pointlessly leveling to try to kill that boss that stops your progression
This is probably the aspect I regretted the most with this new iteration
- You'll have to do a lot of new game+ iterations to complete the gallery
Closing wordsOverall, the game left me with a positive impression, although I still feel that most mechanics are just an excuse for the story
But since the latter is enjoyable, I guess that's excusable
If you've never played the original FFF game, this is the iteration to get
If you've played the first iteration and wonder if you should get this one, I'd say go for it
I played the first one quite a while ago now, and I enjoyed coming back to it once again, replaying the story with better graphics, solid FPS, new route and all the stuff
A pretty decent expansion to the original game, for newcomers and returners alike

 Definitely a True Remake from its Original Counterpart 2 hours into the game, the first thing you'll notice is the graphical upgrade
Not the upscaled resolution from the Original game
This game offers a  true native 1080p  support and better textures
(For those who play games in 4K, you would have to wait for mods) As for language


 Englsih, Japanese, Chinese  are available for you to choose from!I'm sure most of the players who played the Original are much more interested on the new routes this game had to offer
Or you are me who just want to revisit the same route and see how much has changed
Everything feels much more satisfying than I expect to be
 Better gameplay, more party members, much more detailed story  (which is quite lacking from the Original) and so much more
For those who are new to the game, I would say if you are looking for a in depth JRPG, this is not for you
It's basically a visual novel with some light JRPG element (Pretty much like Neptunia if you ever play one before) PC Optimization I would say its way better than Megadimension Neptunia
Everything is stable,  no random stutter  (which is most likely the game is using Adoptive V-Sync)
Maximum Frame Rate is still  60 fps , don't expect something crazy like 144 hertz
MORE IMPORTANTLY,   DEDICATED PC CONTROLS 
Something that I always complain about an Iffy PC Port (although I use controller)
For some reason there is not much graphical settings for you to tweak in the game, lets hope for an update to enable us to tweak what we wanted it to be (just like Nep VII)
So for  lower end PC's , plz  do not buy this  for this very moment
It is much more intense than Nep VII
I saw the reviews saying that the game is buggy etc
For  NVIDIA users , try  add the game  in  Nvidia Control Panel 
If it doesn't work, try  uninstall GeForce Experience  (if you don't use ShadowPlay) because that thing is a bloatware! Unfortunately for  AMD users , there are a lot of times Iffy games just won't work properly with AMD cards
Your best shoot is to  wait for an update 
Plz Rate this up for the bug Steam is currently having on this Game Apparently if you buy the  Normal ver  of the game, you will get the  Full Deluxe Pack  for free
(Just check the Game Folder before you start rating down)EDIT: The bug has been fixed

												Despite not meeting the minimum system requirement, the game still runs smoothly on my sluggish MBP 2012 with an integrated intel hd 4000 graphic processor chip
Is that enough ?Edit: For anyone who can't start the game, change your system date time setting to any date that is before July 1st

												Pros1-6 character battle system2-Enhance battle system3-enchance graphics4-Dynamic character interactions/pairings5-Comedic dialog6-Dozens of hours of fun
7-Customizable combat8-New story paths are great and expand the overall experienceCons1- Cliche Character Personalities, 2-Linear, hallway like dungeons3-Despite strong on simple levels, many character interactions fall flat due to lack of meaning on a broad scale
4-Overly repetitive, bland side quests5-Predictable stories (if you have play the original game)For the fans of that series and its comedic tone, you will find the same style of comfort here
For newcomers, if you can put up with how contrived the story can be, it may be worth a shot thanks to the exclusive content
Fairy Fencer F: Advent Dark Force added much needed and requested changes, but not everything seems to have been addressed with this re-release
The different paths you are able to take add more depth to the already well told story
Though it more often feels like a Director's Cut than a true remake, 'Advent Dark Force' nonetheless turns a flawed PS3 RPG into a stronger experience overall, making it the absolute best way to play 'Fairy Fencer'
The story has been made a great deal more interesting, playing with concepts that the original only hinted at, and the combat has been given a big shot in the arm thanks to the expanded party sizes and rebalanced difficulty
The game's biggest issue is that it feels like it could've been improved a great deal more than it has, leaving us with a game that's good, but falls just short of greatness
Still, it's a worthwhile adventure that lays down enough strong groundwork that could lead to a truly excellent sequel
FINAL VERDICT: 4/5Advent Dark Force went all-out in order to make the most definitive version of Fairy Fencer F that it possibly could
This title should be a no-brainer for fans of the original Fairy Fencer F, and I would also recommend it to anyone in the market for a good JRPG
Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force provides enjoyable gameplay, memorable characters, and a branching story good enough to warrant multiple playthroughs – and hey, isn’t that all that matters?

												This review will attempt to be as spoiler-free as possible, although it may get a bit long
Full Disclosure: I received the game for free for participation in IFI's closed beta testing, although I purchased the original FFF myself over a year ago
What's New?For those who played the original FFF, this will probably be important
The entirety of the original game basically exists within ADF as the 'Goddess' route, which you'll naturally enter unless you do some very specific things early on
There are some slight differences with respect to dialogue, event details, and character introduction timings in order to facilitate better story flow, but the overall story is exactly the same
The 'New Stuff' is mostly the two new story routes
There are mechanical changes as well, with the most obvious being the doubling of the party size to an incredible six(!) characters, and a change in the way that Avalanche Attacks are triggered
There are also two new recruitable characters when you get to the third route
The story routes themselves are all separate from each other
I thoroughly enjoyed each of them, as they forced you to come to terms with, and get used to things you may not necessarily be used to doing
Some may dislike the fact that character rosters change (temporarily,) but in my opinion, the new routes are best taken in as the game providing you with "what if" scenarios
Each route also has its own set of character-specific endings
They each contain their own set of dungeons; Some are new, others are 'new' with recycled assets, and some are repeats of earlier dungeons
The game has also been rebalanced a bit from FFF
Should I Get It?I enjoyed the game, but I cannot overwhelmingly recommend it
For players who are familiar with other CH/IF titles (e
g
Neptunia series, or the original FFF,) you'll be familiar with how ADF plays out
For these players, I'd recommend it if you are interested in the story it tells, as I feel that the story is much better, and more coherent, than Neptunia's
For players who are not familiar with similar titles such as the Neptunia series, it's tougher to recommend
The problem is that this game (like most of their other RPG's) is not a very deep or complex RPG
If you are looking for a 'good' RPG for the 'RPG,' then I cannot recommend this game, as you will be let down
This game, instead, plays much closer to a Visual Novel with light RPG thrown in between
The majority of the game time will be spent experiencing the story through dialogue/event sequences, before running off to clear simple dungeons, then repeating the process
Thus, the focus is much more on the telling of FFF/ADF's story, than it is about playing an RPG
If this idea of a 'casual RPG' with a storytelling focus sounds appealing, then by all means, I would recommend the game
Price, however, is a contentious point
Certainly, there is enough content in ADF to justify being pricier than FFF; The new stories easily more than double the amount of content in the game compared to FFF
Couple that with the new visual upgrades, as well as re-hiring voice actors to voice entirely new scripts, and you come up with improvements that are more than trivial
However, the price is still on the high end (comparable to Megadimension Neptunia VII rather than the Re;Birth series
) Whether or not these improvements are worth the extra cost is up to you, but I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in the game, and it's on a decent discount
Why Are The Requirements So High?The required specs can appear to be fairly high, although that's the hardware IFI wants to recommend in order to reliably achieve 60+ FPS throughout the game
I have been running the game on an nVidia GTX-670 and i7-3770k at 1920x1200 with maximum graphical settings, and I was able to largely get 60 FPS almost everywhere
The exceptions were certain dungeons with heavy particle effects where I would dip to the mid 40's
The Bottom LineUltimately, I ejoyed the game, and I helped to beta test the game because I thoroughly liked the original FFF's story, and really wanted to see the new stories present in ADF
Story-wise, I can say that I was not disappointed; I loved every minute of it
However, I cannot provide a blanket recommendation because this game still hits somewhat of a niche audience, and you'll have to decide based on my comments above whether or not this is for you
If you are at all interested, though, I would say definitely!

												The main problem with the game is that it had to live up to Borerlands 2, and unfortunately it didn't
To put it simply
Positives;+ It's fun + Last half of the story is very good+ New fighting mechanics such as using the OZ kits+ Bad loot isnt obsolete with the grinder+ Character actually has personality and belongs in the campaign+ Cryo element and laser weapons+ You can feel the characters changing as the story develops+ Final Boss has new and interesting mechanics+ Great ending setting up for B3Negatives;- Alot of the missions early on are the same, you go to a place to try and find something, turns out you cant get it that way, have to find another way to get there (can happen up to 3 times), kill a weak bandit boss and get poor loot- Bugs, the new jumping mechanic means that enemies get stuck in walls even on flat ground- Needless running to areas- Fairly short story and not alot of side missions (35-40% of what B2 had to offer)- Alot of enemies use DOT weapons meaing you die after you cleared out an area with no way to get back up- DLC characters seem to be alot more powerful- Some of the mini bosses seem like reskinned versions of B2 bosses (BNK3R is pretty much in the game)Overall the game is enjoyable but I can only reccomend it to people who have played the earlier games in the franchise
If you are looking to play a game get Borderlands 2 as it has more value of enjoyment attached to it
Borderlands 2 > Pre Sequel > Borderlands			
Posted: 13 November, 2015
												Since the opinions on this game are really mixed, I decided to compare it to BL2
And make an acutal review about it with that
Obviously these points are my opinion, so don't judge it
Pre-Sequel Pros:- Classes are more interesting- Cyro is probably better than Slag (in game design)- Cars are faster- Early game is more fun- Vault hunters actually say things to the story- Butt SlamsBorderlands 2 Pros:- Longer story- Better DLCs- Not as much walking- More guns- Maps are more colorful- Better characters and humor- No annoying oxygen mechanic- More types of enemies- More Bosses/post story content- Better side quests- Less expensiveSo, overall I'd say BL2 is better
If you already played BL1 and BL2, buy TPS if you liked them
Even though you might wanna wait for a discount
As for people who are new to the series, I'd play BL1 or BL2 first, since this one is more expensive, and probably the worst one of the three
			
Posted: 2 August, 2015
												I would recommend to buy this game during a sale if you liked Borderlands 2, but this game isn't nearly as good as Borderlands 2
			
Posted: 16 April, 2015
												NOTE; Most of the other reviews are outdated
They were right at one point, but the game has taken a turn for the betterIf you haven't played Borderlands 2 yet, I highly recommend at least playing through the main story of that game before picking up this one
The game takes place on Pandora's moon, Elpis, and just like the games before it, you take control of one of four Vault Hunters, and you shoot your way through waves of bandits, psychos, hostile wildlife and an entire military force to open a vault
However, this game does have many different features to it that make it unique, and a lot of returning features
Pros;+Lazer weapons
A very welcome tool for your arsenal
They range from rapid fire assault rifles to shotguns to railguns+Cryo weapons
I wanted these very badly in 2, and my wish got granted
They restrict affected enemies movements and makes them vulnerable to melee attacks (mind that it does the same to you)+Vending Machines are now somewhat relevant
In 1 and 2 I didn't even bother looking in gun vending machines, but now that you're able to buy purple and orange rarety weapons, they actually have a purpose now+Manuverability
This is what really defines this game out of the series
The low gravity on Elpis allows acrobatic gunfights and more importantly; butt slams (or ground pounds
But butt slam is more fun)+Grinder
You can grind lower rarety weapons into better weapons of a higher rarety
Not an 100% chance of a higher rarety, but its a good way to get rid of some of your white and green guns+Classes
Skill trees are the same setup (I mean that as a good thing), and the classes are very unique


hopefully they'll have enough ideas for threeCons;-Side Quests
While the main quest's dialouge is interesting, and the gameplay is great, most side quests are just flat out dull in speech and gameplay
Too many fetch missions, that lead to more fech missions
Granted some do reveal how things came to be in time for 2, and others are funny enough to be redeemed, most aren't worth the EXP
-Lazy Raid Boss
Bosses now respawn (that was an issue for a while), but the first and only raid boss of the base game is the final boss with more health and higher damage output
While I still did enjoy murdering it, I would much rather prefer something new and fresh
-Shorter than 2
It has 13-14 chapters versus the 18 chapters 2 had
-Terrain
The game has many cool areas, with multiple ways to kill you
The only problem is, falling to your death is a little too easy at times
The manuverability I talked about before helps this, unless you're in a vehicle
Neutral things*Oxygen
When in a vacuum, you must rely on your oxygen supply to live (surprising right)
Oxygen also allows you to double jump and butt slam, so be sure to keep an eye on it
*Many returning weapons
A lot of weapons are similar to 2, so it should be a somewhat familiar experience with the loot
*Moonstones
The new Eridium
Used for ammo upgrades, moonstone chests (spend them to get purple rarety weapons/gear) or that lame raid boss I was talking about earlier
So mostly ammo
If you loved 2, you'll love this game
I love this game, so it pains me to say this; buy it on sale
Sure the gameplay is great, but the quests seem tedious and lack luster, and while the Claptastic Voyage DLC redeems this, a game shouldn't rely on DLC to fix itself
(This is my first review, so please give me some feedback on how I could improve my writing, or any spelling or gammatical errors
)

												If you enjoy the gameplay from Borderlands 2, and want some additional content, I highly recommend this
 However, I would also recommend you only purchase this on sale because it is not worth $40 in my honest opinion
			
Posted: 21 November, 2014
												Edited on 03/29/2015: The changes are made to reflect the most recent patch released on 03/24/2015, focusing on respawnable bosses
I DO NOT have Claptastic Voyage, so this review still only covers the base game
I thank the 2000+ readers who have given their time to rate my review
 More thanks to those who left comments
I don't want to write lengthy reviews since they take a lot of time; time that could be spent on playing my backlog of games
I love Borderlands
 I want to continue loving it
 The Pre-Sequel (TPS) is the 3rd game, and I have expectations
 At $60 I would expect more creativity, more risks, further embrace what BDL2 did successfully and remedy the areas that needed correction
What TPS offered, however, seemed to be a mediocre effort on the fronts that mattered that warranted a detailed review
TPS does do some things right:Classes: Although it still follows the archetypes of assault, offense, support and general purpose, there is enough variation and changes to make the classes feel different
 For instance, meleeing in BDL2 was very unsafe; Zer0's Deception covered too many areas to make melee effective (Slag, movement speed, dashing attack, damage output and more
) TPS introduced a much more flexible melee style through Athena, where she could close in distance very quickly, dashing across the area and capable of surviving through firefights
 TPS also expanded the use of stacks in all characters and eliminated overpowered damage increases from the likes of the Gunzerker
Money and Vending Machines are relevant: In BDL2, money was useless on any mode
 Vendors continued to sell white items even at OP8
 I rarely saw Purples and Legendaries never appeared
TPS vendors have Purples and Legendaries much more often, so money does play a role to help you gear up, and you'll want to treat death seriously to prevent being unable to afford said items
Moonstones: The eridium equivalent and this resource is constantly used
Players will be using it on multiple things, such as the Grinder to enhance the chance of improving the rarity of the weapon generated and adding an additional effect on the final product
Grinder: All weapon have a use
You can recycle unwanted weapons in hopes to get something new
Given that the vendors have better gear often, there's a bit of resource juggling where there's a choice to sell the item or craft a new one
Slamming: A crouching mechanic, for all classes, used in midair to drop quickly to the ground to create an AoE slamming strike
 This opens up new combat tactics and variations
 It should be a new staple
Lasers: A very welcome addition to the player's arsenal
All barrels function differently (with varying strengths and weaknesses,) and combining with the weapon brand gimmicks, lasers are the most varied weapon in the game
Different brands could enhance the strength AND negate the weaknesses
The rest of the game is where it starts falling apart:Writing: I wasn't impressed with the writing
Censoring profanity is fine to a degree, given that profanity shouldn't be the dictating factor to provide humour
But when you replace the profanity with words that don't even seem to match the harshness, the potential seriousness of the Borderlands world, it sounds weak
  Many characters seem to lack impact due to the limited influence they play throughout the story, and when a lot of the humour from the predecessors is also ripped out, the game fails to make a good lasting impression
 More often than not, I found myself being bored of the tales I was presented because the game couldn't make me care
Terrains: Lots of death pits
 Auto-save beacons were rare
 It's almost designed to ensure players died often
Side Quests/Main Quests/Padding: There are game designs that are generally despised; RPGs fail to make Charisma have impact; obscene amounts of QTE's that add nothing to spark interest; poor autosave location etcs
 There are also bad quest designs
 TPS embraced one of the least liked quest designs and amplified the worst aspects of it
TPS adores Fetch Quests, but it's done in a way that quickly loses its welcome
 You have a fetch quest that midway branches to another fetch quest, then this branch opens up to another series of fetch quests
 The objectives have objectives within the objectives to reach the objective!  Multiple fetch quests in the span of only ONE quest, effectively doubling to tripling this dull experience
 Rinse and repeat multiple times in multiple quests
 The experience becomes infuriating when you add in the poor terrain, killing legions of enemies that drop no good loot to show for your efforts under agitation, painfully dragging yourself through this boredom all in hopes of there may be something better later on
This is padding in the worst way -forcibly lengthening a game with minimal effort and creativity
 The game acts like it hates and mocks your free time
Lack of Creativity: For a $60 game, I expected that 2K Australia (2KA) came up with more content with BDL2 as a foundation
Hyperion could have their own Assault Rifles again
  Atlas could have hid a stash of guns to preserve their brand
 How about a new gimmick in existing brands? Instead, 2KA did little, if anything, to the existing BDL2 weapon pool, thus all weapons felt exactly what I expected without additional testing
TPS uses 90% (estimation only) of BDL2's legendaries, creating very few originals for a new experience
 No praise should come from this lack of effort
DLCs: DLC business practices are judged very unfavorably when the game is threadbare
It puts me at a moral standpoint where I am morally unable to want to buy the DLCs when more work needed to be focused on the main game
DLCs are welcome additions when the main game has substance, but in TPS's case, these DLCs may serve as the surgery needed to revive it
So why not put more energy in the main product? Why must I feel cheated of a better experience?And the very worst:Bosses are now Respawnable: For 161 days until March 24th 2015, bosses didn't respawn
 Players had to "ALT+F4" their game to prevent saving or duplicate their save files to fight minibosses
 Despite that this is remedied, that does not excuse the incompetence of 2KA for removing the said feature of to begin with
161 days
2KA knowingly took out a crucial feature that effectively killed the game's longevity
 2KA doesn't understand Borderlands
 The spirit of the franchise is noticeably absent
 2KA deliberately made a choice to make the game less fun for players, making the already hollow game offer even less
 Why?  Who approved of such a thing?Raid Boss:  The raid boss is the final story boss that has more health and deals more damage
At best, the raid boss is a lazily slapped together effort that lacks any innovation and originality
 At worst, it's open contempt to the fans who had any expectations
This is 2KA's way of saying that the players, who paid them $60 for this game, aren't worth their time to create a brand new boss fight
 2KA is giving no respects to the players who love the franchise, as if poorly reusing an existing boss meets the requirements of having a new boss, arrogantly attempting to justify that this mediocre amount of effort is suffice
This is taking incompetence to a whole new level
 2KA has taken a new step on to directly insult players
 It took out the middle man that is the gameplay and questing, and found a way to get players to feel shocked, appalled and disappointed just by looking at the boss
Final Verdict: 5/10 at the very best
2KA has offered us a game that meets the minimum expectations that fans have come to expect from a Borderlands game
This plays like a $30 DLC that costs $60
I cannot justify the $60 value with the experience TPS provided
 I do not pay money to feel insulted
 I do not reward such contempt and incompetence
If you must give TPS a try, buy it on a steep sale

												(Updated review
Went from about 9 hours gameplay when I first wrote this to 30),Well I guess I'm just not having the same experience as most of the top commenters
So far I've really enjoyed the game
Does it feel like it is a huge DLC? Yes
The menus are the same thing, the main screen when you start the game is the same thing (Your character, Claptrap doing stupid stuff in the background, same layout exactly just a different setting)
Does driving suck? Sorta
I've had issues with not making jumps and I've had times where occassionally my car decides to keep going straight while I'm turning
Yes I've fallen off the map multiple times, but it hasn't been that bad
Just something to get used to
I think the issue is more so that the jumps you have to do to get to other parts of the maps are very exact
There's not a lot of room to undershoot even with a perfect take off
Is AI bad? Not really
I feel like it's about the same as BL2, which wasn't perfect, but was pretty decent
If you see a guy and he doesn't see you he tends to walk around aimleslly
If you shoot they notice you 98% of the time, and when they don't, I just kill them and keep moving
No sense in standing around looking for reasons to not like the game
So now I'll move onto things that I've noticed:In BL2 you could find any weapon at any time
Not so here
Want a shotgun or a sniper rifle early?  Do some side quests then
You won't find them randomly
Want to play with the new ice weapons? Too bad, they don't start showing up for a long time
The loot system is definitely less randomized in this game
I got an Anshin Oz Kit from a side quest from Janie at level 3 and it's still the only one I've seen by Anshin and I've gotten two characters to level 12
I've seen Orange level rarity weapons and items a bunch from vendors but I've had white level equivelants that were better from a lower level
Also selling and buying prices are DRASTICALLY different in this game
Buying the Item of the Day costs me around $2000, If I were to sell pretty much the exact same item back I get like $60
This leads to me wanting to use the vendors less and less because money seems harder to come by and buying one or two things depletes my reserves for a pretty long time - and  I loot ALL the things
I wish higher rarity weapons truly showed that they were better in this game like they should be
The Oxygen thing is honestly neutral for me
It doesn't add to the game much, but it doesn't take from it either
I hardly notice it as almost every enemy drops oxygen tanks
If you're running low, kill something and there's an 80% chance it'll drop a tank
If one isn't enough that's what Kraggons are for
To sum everything up though, I have really enjoyed my experience so far
Things are a little less polished than I'd like, but I'm sure it'll be fixed in patches
There were no beta testers for this game and I'm sure most play testing was done on limited varieties of hardware
You cannot expect it all to run exactly the same on 20,000 different computer setups as well as the consoles it was released on
I'd recommend the game if you enjoyed the previous ones
If you are worried about these issues though, wait until it hits a sale
This is Steam, there's gonna be sales
EDIT: I've hit about 30 hours of gameplay now and I think I've grown to like the game more
I played through first as Athena and really didn't like her, then started as Wilhelm and enjoyed him but found he seemed to be underleveled and I got killed a lot
Now obviously the level is up to me to move, but I like to play through games without doing side quests first to experience the story, and then I play again and do achievements and sidequests
You can get through a really large chunk of the game this way, and then I got stuck around level 20 fighting level 25+ enemies
Restarted as Nisha because I figured if I had to grind I may as well try the last character! She's definitely my favorite, though her ability is a bit underwhelming on multiplayer haha
I find that once you get farther into the game and do side missions the issues I had with loot and money seem to go away for the most part, so I think I can mostly retract that
Still not a fan of vendor gouging though; I've seen orange level rarity weapons at vendors for well over 35,000 while everything else they're selling is around $1000
It feels like they're taunting you! I hadn't even FOUND that much money at that point in the game!I've also gotten more used to the different gravity and while I originally thought it made you a bit slower I find that I can get around really fast by using the oxygen boost (double jump)
There are oxygen geysers everywhere so it's not a big deal to burn that extra few O2
 I still stand by my recommendation for this game
If you like Borderlands, you're going to like this game
Also, thanks for the rates and comments

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is the follow up to Borderlands 2 and fallows on the rise of Handsome Jack
But will you want to play it ?Borderlands TPS takes place after the events of Borderlands and before the events of Borderlands 2 and follows on four new vault hunters
Athena, Wilhelm, Nisha and Claptrap get a message from a hyperion worker who happens to be Handsome Jack
After the Dahl soldiers take over the space station they try to destroy the moon of Elpis and it's up to you to stop them
Gameplay is identical to Borderlands 2
The only new thing is the new Oxygen system
You have a bar which starts to drain when you are outside the oxygen field for too long
Then you start to suffocate
You can also use the double jump to get on higher platforms
You can avoid the oxygen system by picking Claptrap as your character
The new abilities are awesome and all of them are very fun to use
Graphics are stunning as ever
They look awesome and all the colors are very nice to look at
The textures are kind of mediocre and some of the character models look very bad
Overall the game looks great apart from minor flaws
Audio is pretty bad
The game's audio for me stopped during firefights and I couldn't hear anything the characters would say to me and sometimes the Echo Com screen didn't transfer the dialogue and I couldn't hear anything which wasn't a problem in Borderlands 2
The soundtrack is alright, there are some great songs but a lot of them are kind of mediocre
The game is pretty easy for the most part until the final chapter where there is a massive difficulty spike and the final boss solo is incredibly hard
The boss fights are very team oriented meaning the game expected you to play with people from the start
Level Design in some parts is abysmal it took me massive amounts of understanding where my objective was and where the side quest start
This by far the worst level design in a borderlands game
The game took me 22 hours to complete every quest and to get to level 27
The game like other Borderlands games has tons of replay value with different vault hunter modes and trying out other characters and of course not to mention the DLC which I will have to check out one day
The game is pretty stable from the most part
There where some parts where the game wouldn't open a certain door to progress through a quest but a quick reload always fixed the problem
Overall this game is not as good as the other titles in the series and without a doubt not worth it at the full price
I am a massive Borderlands fan and Pre Ordered this game once I saw it and I can safely say it wasn't a bad game but it's not as good as the other Borderlands games
For other people only buy this on a sale
It has a lot of horrible side quests but this is an overall good game and I highly suggest you to check it out on a sale
I give Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel a 7/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												EDIT: Season Pass content has been completely revealed, updated review to reflect that
If you know me, you know I'm a Borderlands maniac
This game simply just did not deliver
Gearbox handed the reigns off to 2K Australia and it seriously suffered
Lemme give you the run down:POSITIVE+ Buttslams and low gravity are fun as hell, and make combat in this game incredibly satisfying and borderline addictive+ 4 new(ish) vault hunters with great skill trees and little to no skills that absolutely suck (lookin' at you More Pep & Flicker from BL2)+ Each vault hunter is more chatty and has unique dialogue to chime in with during story and side mission conversations+ The Grinder is a great tool for helping you get that specific gear you're looking for by putting in the correct ingredient weapons+ Laser weapons are friggin' sweet! Pewpewpew!+ New vehicle, the Stingray, is unique in being the first solo-rider-only+ Vending machines have significantly higher chances to have an orange item as the item of the day (like BL1 chances)NEGATIVE - 90% of orange items in this game are DIRECT PORTS or RESKINS of guns from BL2
Some are even clones with very small mechanical changes as if to pass it off as something brand new
There are a VERY SMALL handful of completely new orange weapons- As a cherry on top of that issue, a large group of bosses and mini-bosses that have specific orange weapons tied to their loot drops NEVER RESPAWN
You get one shot to get their loot
Good luck or have fun Alt+F4ing- Don't forget the chocolate sauce for this sundae of dissapointment! The Grinder WAS cool until you find yourself rely on it nearly completely as a source of oranges during end-game because you got no BOSSES TO FARM
- As if finding ported oranges wasn't bad enough, welcome back a few freakin' direct port quest uniques! REALLY 2kAUS?? They burn you on the oranges and then even get too lazy to make UNIQUE quest rewards for this game- Areas of the map include lots and lots of long uninteresting treks across the moon until you unlock the vehicles- The soundtrack in this game is not very interesting
It's all just kinda bland space trancey stuff
BL2 (especially the pirate dlc) had some absolutely sick music- enemies are very watered down in variance
Basically you have bandits in space suits (but much less variety of them), dahl soldiers, kraggons (they're cool), shugaraths (only on 1 map though) space spiderants and eridians
They cut out badass psychos, nomads, goliaths, varkids, bullymongs and crystalisks completely
The amount of new enemies is very much out-weighed by what you lost- enemies don't really say anything memorable
In  BL2 the bandits and hyperion personal said some hilarious things in the middle of battle
Scavs on the moon just say a lot of aussie mumbo jumbo
I mean it's lightly amusing, but the delight of the accent wears off soon and the dialogue itself is not that funny
- Once you hit 50 there isn't a lot to do
With all the recycled oranges from BL2 and the issues of their bosses never respawning why do you even bother farming? Oh that's right so you can take what you do from farming vending machines and put it in the grinder
gee thats fun, whoopee!- The season pass is very pail compared to BL2's pass
It includes 2 characters (Handsome Jack's doppleganger and Hamerlock's sister, Aurelia) 1 arena dlc called the Holodome (also comes with +10 levels) and 1 campaign dlc (+10 more levels included, so max level cap will be 70)
So in total that's 2 characters, 1 arena and 1 campaign
Let me remind you BL2 had FOUR campaigns in their season pass and still had 2 characters dlc you could get serperately from the pass (Gaige was even free with preorder of BL2)- The story isn't all that impressive, and leaves some pretty big questions unaswered for the viewer
But you form your own opinion on the story, if anything the unique dialogue from each vault hunter is very fun to listen to
In summary, this game is not woth the $60 price tag
I would reccommend waiting for a sale that drops it to $45 or lower
The pre-sequel is a fun game for the first play-through for fans of the franchise and newcomers
Play-through 2 and endgame will largely dissapoint the hardcore fans that enjoy the series so much, though

												I have over 1
2k hours in this game (only 905 on steam)
Been playing since beta
Spent a ton of rl money in game
In the top 2% of casual elo
Have never been banned and rarely got notifications of any one I ever reported for harrassment being banned
Not a problem normally I mean I played lol it comes par for the course with any online multiplayer/competitive game
I have heard about twitch streamers and Hirez people just randomly banning people for silly reasons but never saw it in that whole time
Last game I played I had someone from Hirez on team and he was playing poorly on all fronts
We got into it after I asked him to get a certain item to help him and after the game he continued in lobby where I ignored him
Entered a new game and got dcd
Never happens
Got a weeks ban hammer for having it out with someone from Hirez
I mean when their own employee can't handle the community they created and work for it says something
Very unprofessional
It would be different if I have a history of being banned
I don't
Needless to say I am done with Smite and Hirez
Not that Hirez had anything but Smite

Assault 5 v 5 Assault randomly picks gods for the teams, and throws you into a single lane where you cannot retreat to heal or purchase at the fountain

 Congratz Bandai Namco and CyberConnect2
You made it
Now can you do all of us a favor? Port the Rest of the Franchise to Steam
Oh by the way we also need more Tales of Games
Gameplay is 10/10
If you've played the Game on PS2 you can't go wrong
Oh and the Price is also a huge pro argument
For 50€ you'll get 4 Volumes and each of those are 20-30 Hours long
So feel free to put in atleast 100 Hours of Playtime to complete all 4 Volumes
Soundtrack wise this Game is pure

												I played the GU series back when in the PS2 version, and I am primarily getting this for the nostalgia
So far, I do not regret getting it
Two things I want to point out:1) I find the price pretty fair as it is 3 (or 4 if you count the newest one, not sure how long vol 4 is) games into one
2) People in the forum are saying this is a copy of SAO, I just want to refer those people to re-watch the intro
This game is being released as the 15th anniversary of 
hack, which means the original 
hack series goes all the way back 15 years ago
 On the otherhand, SAO is from 2009 (light novel)


so yea

 Welcome to The World
 Intro to 
hack//Franchise For those unfamiliar with the 
hack (or dot hack) franchise, I'll start with a basic, spoiler-free introduction
Dot Hack is a now 15 year old multimedia franchise with books, graphic novels, anime, and games, regarding a fictional MMO known simply as The World
This franchise started in the early 2000's, just following the early days of MMOs, inspired by titles such as Ultima Online and Everquest, successful MMOs before World of Warcraft popularized the genre in a more mainstream level
Each entry in dot hack tells a self-contained story about the fictional MMO and covers topics pertinent to online interactions, online indentities vs
real identities, identity politics, virtual reality, social media, urban legends, and so on
Very forward-thinking for a series conceptualized in the early 2000s
Each entry is also fairly self-contained, not necessarily requiring someone to pay attention to every book, game, anime, or movie to understand the one they are currently on, although consuming more of the franchise does paint a wider picture
It's kind of like Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear franchise in that way
On to 
hack//GU: Last Recode This game is a remastered package of 
hack//GU, a trilogy of action RPGs for the Playstation 2 console
It is the second series of games in the 
hack//Franchise but this is an ideal package to start with
The reason why is that it contains a series of 'Terminal' videos that explain the events of the first game series, so while it's not a replacement for sorely needed remasters or remakes of those games, it's a great alternative to ponying up $200-300 for that series, as it's been long out of print
The videos covering the first games are not necessary to watch for 
hack//GU but it provides some extra context and lore for those who care
As for the game itself, from my experience so far it is a competent port
Not a lot of options on this PC version, but it runs well at seemingly a locked resolution of 60 frames per second, ideal for any high-motion action game
The graphics are way better and less muddy than the PS2 originals, although obviously polygons are still obvious, especially on rounded objects
The style of the graphics are in a cel-shaded style, however, so that aspect has not aged as poorly
You can jump into any Volume you want, including a new 4th Volume created specifically for this remastered set
There is also a parody mode I have no experience with yet, but it allegedly contains spoilers and is not meant for anyone who hasn't completed the games
The gameplay of 
hack//GU: Last Recode is a story-driven action role-playing game, framed as an MMO
You have 'servers' which function as hub towns and another parameter to keep in mind for dungeons
Dungeons are accessed through key words acquired through your player character's emails, the message boards of the world, or story events, and the dungeons generated with the key words change from server to server, so trying the same word combination in different servers will give you different dungeons to complete
The Server hub worlds themselves are filled with shops, quests, events, and NPCs that roam around as if they were player characters in an MMO, and you can trade with them
A lot of effort was made to try and immerse you in the idea that you're in an MMO
The combat in dungeons is honestly very simple; one attack button, a block button, and skill triggers
It plays out like a basic brawler with repetitive combos
Do not expect depth of gameplay akin to Dark Souls
Dungeons are generated with differing objectives, but honestly from my memory it's just different floor layouts of maybe 3-5 specific types of dungeons with different aesthetic tile sets as you go along to at least change up the visuals from time to time
If there's two things that make this game (and usually, the entire franchise is strong in these regards), it's the story and the music
If you read my summary of the franchise, the story part wouldn't be too much of a surprise
It holds up pretty well with the topics and themes presented in the plot of these games becoming more and more relevant over the years
Again, I must compare the story to Metal Gear
Specifically, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, except with less pseudo-politics on a national scale
The music is very well-composed and catchy in GU, a large improvement over the soundtrack in the original dot hack games in my opinion
Not as stellar as the soundtrack for the first anime, 
hack//SIGN, though, but it fits the action of the game well
Conclusion If any of what I have said sounds appealing to you, I would say that this package is worth the price of admission as it is at $50
Previously, the games were only on PS2 with no ports to other systems, and physical copies long out of print and produced in limited numbers in the United States, where I live
Saying that, before this I was only ever able to get the first two volumes, and a complete set nowadays of the physical copies would set you back over $100, WITHOUT the extra volume, Terminal videos recapping the original (also rare) $300 
hack//Games, new stuff like the Parody mode, difficulty options, and upgraded visuals
All that said, you could argue this is a way to get roughly $400 value of previously hard to acquire content at the much cheaper price tag of $50
Although I would still very much like it if Bandai-Namco and CyberConnect2 would just invest in remaking the original dot hack game series already
If you're on the fence, I would say wait for the eventual steam sales to take their course until you feel ready to take the plunge
This series has a long history and can be overwhelming for newcomers, so buying it on a sale is much less of a risk if you are unsure
As a fan of this often-ignored franchise I would definitely reccommend everyone to give it a try eventually
This franchise is especially fun to people with experience or interest in games and their development, tech, and AI, even if the series often takes creative liberties with the subject matter

Hack series on steam
This includes LINK and the first 4

			
Posted: 7 November
												Having beaten 
hack//G
U
Vol
2//Reminisce, and eagerly awaited Vol
3
My PS2 broke, first it went black and white, then it failed to start and eventually never even turned back on
I still purchased 
hack//G
U
Vol
3//Redemption in hopes I would one day own a PS3, or buy another PS2


But that never happened
I lent a buddy my original series games, and after he finished he wanted more
After some reluctance I let him borrow the entire GU series
I never saw them again
I assume he found out how much they were worth, I haven't spoken to him in years either
Now its been 10 years since I purchased Vol
3 and I am finally able to finish the story, better yet they came out with an entirely new game
I am very grateful they came to steam as I don't own a PS4, I have been waiting for this for so long
Thanks!

												A solid port of a classic RPG series
As a veteran of the games, it took me 16 hours to beat Vol
1's main story, plus an additional 10 hours of (fairly repetitive) grinding for 100%
Volumes 2 and 3 are similar in length to the first, so expect 45-75 hours of playtime depending on how much you want to invest in completion
As for the fourth volume, I hear it's shorter than the first three, but haven't yet gotten to it myself, so I can't comment there
A few comments, take them as you will:-Except in certain instances, characters' mouths do not move when they talk
-There are a few very minor glitches and I have experienced the occasional crash while playing; not nearly enough to stop me from continuing
-The previously-limited-edition Terminal Disc is included, which will help bring you up to speed on the lore and the story of the original series for new players, and expand on the existing lore for veterans
-The trailers claim to have taken the various improvements made in Volumes 2 and 3 and applied them to the first game
This is only partially true; some features from the 2nd and 3rd Volumes are still not present in Vol
1, such as the improved combo mechanics of the twin blades or better charge attacks of the broadsword, or, perhaps most importantly, the quick-switch mechanic
-Some of the Bonus Content cutscenes are not updated to HD, and are displayed in a small window within the game
This does not apply to the cutscenes seen throughout the games themselves; only the extra ones you unlock at the end
-The game's EXP, Skill Points, and Attack Power have been rebalanced to provide a much smoother leveling curve
This version, therefore, is much easier than the originals
-Features a "Cheat Mode" that allows you to play through the story at max level
Considering the point above, this is mostly inconsequential, as you will rarely have to grind in a normal playthrough anyway
-Textures and models still look decidedly old, but passable
The lighting engine and cel-shading go a long way to help this
-The game was made for the PS2, as such it is meant to be played with a controller
It does support DirectInput, as well as all the modern controller APIs
-Keyboard controls can be re-mapped, but mouse and controller cannot
All-in-all, I think this collection has been well worth my $50 so far, and I haven't even beaten half of it yet

												"I told people online about my problems
In real life, no one would care about them, but online, everyone cares
My online friends are all so nice
They worry about me, they give me advice
I just wish real life was like my life online
" -Quote from an article in the game DAMN
This is perfect if you're a fan or a new player wanting to play this franchise (ps2 copies are rare and expensive)
I never had the chance to play vol 2 and 3 because of the price years after it went rare
I had beaten vol 1 a few times back on the ps2 years ago
When this release was first announced I was nothing but excited to get my money's worth
The quality of the game feels really good and smooth
The combat is pretty straightforward and simple with a one button attack but you get additional skills to execute
Additionally, you also have recovery attacks for more strategy if I may say so
It doesn't sound fun from words alone but it is when you have your hands in control of the game
Gameplay allows you to do general things you'd expect from an actual mmo like guild management, arena, improve gears questing etc

The game isn't complex by any means
It's straightforward fun as a game should be

Hack GU has a great narrative that give reason to invest time in the game
There is more than enough cutscenes to entertain the story and develop the characters
Furthermore, the fictional forums the game provides in its internet sphere offers branching narratives and lore to the world of 
Hack in game and the real world
The game was ahead of its time tackling issues relevant today about technology when it becomes too much a part of our lives not just for a solution but more so for convenience (which you would have to read in the in game forum)
It also makes you feel like you are in a forum with people discussing these topics like in real people
But even if you don't read them, the narrative will allude to these things or some characters will mention them
There are some minor pop in issues in open fields which can be annoying as well as the LOD for distance in the outside maps
The graphical quality is a decent improvement

												This is basically a 1:1 port of the PS4 game, with all patches, DLCs and add-ons (which all add their impressive share of post-main story content)
SAO:HR follows a different continuity from the anime's canon
See below
What I likeThe combat system is reactive, and actually gets better with time
There is a lot of content, even and especially once you clear the main story
It's in English AND it's voiced
I am a simple man
You can party with and customize pretty much everybody, and you can influence a character's AI and actions through the feelings system
The cast is great and well-rounded
What I don't likeThe PC port is passable
I hope you have a controller
See a port review below
The game might seem too easy until you finish the main story
It gets much harder when you hit Warriors of the Sky and Abyss of the Shrine Maiden
There's a lot of information, sometimes dumped all on you at once (especially post-main story)
Fortunately, the game provides a means to re-read the tutorials as much as you want
It's a MMO-like: there's only one save, and most events aren't replayable (some of them are)
It's not as bad on PC since you can copy-paste your save directory, but still
At some points, the translated text is completely replaced without keeping the original intent and meaning, failing at both translation and localization
It's still better than what we got in Hollow Fragment
The affinity/affection system is a chore, as in all Aquria games before
Exacerbated by the translation: the english text sometimes invites you to say Yes when you should have, in fact, said No
Regarding the portPC key bindings aren't ideal; this game was made and is still made for controllers
You're going to be very frustrated if you use a keyboard
Borderless window resolution is locked, and windowed mode manages not to work with Borderless Gaming
Full screen works as expected, however
Performance is okay
Loading times are abysmal (same as PS4, really), but I haven't tried on a SSD yet
Gameverse continuity detailsSAO: Hollow Realization is a sequel to Infinity Moment, Hollow Fragment and Lost Song, all of which follow a different continuity from the anime series, and aren't ported to PC at time of writing
There are a lot of new characters and differences, including:Kirito did not defeat Heathcliff on floor 75 and abort SAO early: Heathcliff was defeated on floor 100 as the final boss, like he initially planned
(Infinity Moment)Leafa, Sinon, Yuuki all join the SAO death game, for various reasons
(Infinity Moment, Hollow Fragment)Strea, a MHCP like Yui, joins the gang after having her own arc
(Infinity Moment)Philia, a self-proclaimed trasure hunter stuck in a closed-off dimension of SAO, met and was subsequently freed by Kirito
(Hollow Fragment)Rain and Seven, idols in real life and in-game respectively, join the team
In ALO, Rain saved Seven after Seven attempted to absorb everybody else, posing as the final boss
(Lost Song)Hollow Realization also includes other characters that are technically part of the SAO universe, but not portrayed in the anime:Kizmel, a NPC close to Asuna and Kirito, from SAO: Progressive (manga and LN)Argo, an intel expert
She's briefly seen in the anime, but has a somewhat larger role in the games
Alice and Eugeo, characters from Project Alicization, which follow the SAO light novel canon after Mother's Rosario
Anime adaptation (SAO S3) in 2018
The SAO arc was covered in Infinity Moment and Hollow Fragment, and the ALO arc in Lost Song
The GGO arc did not happen yet but will in SAO: Fatal Bullet (2018), which follows this continuity
Most of Sinon's backstory was already covered in Sinon's quests, howerer
Closing wordsConsole-exclusive ports are getting less and less bad, but there is still a ways to go
It's nice to see Japanese console developers trying to get on the PC scene, but when it comes to port quality, BNEI/NBGI and partners are still lagging behind other publishers like Square-Enix
SAO:HR is by no means a triple A, and does have a substantial amount of fanservice, but it has way too much work and content behind it for me to classify it as a bad or fanservice-only game
I recommend it to people who:like the SAO universedon't mind heavy-handed fanservicelike visual novels or VN-style events, because there are a lot of thoseThe game has a fully-featured multiplayer mode, with PVP duels and mission/combat cooperation, which I will not review since I have no friends the game can be played solo in its entirety
Review revisions and erratumI originally posted that controllers do not work outside Big Picture mode
That was false
It does however need to be properly configured within Steam

This is only true for the Warriors of the Sky part
Warriors of the Sky was a game update that leads to Abyss of the Shrine Maiden, and Abyss of the Shrine Maiden is a DLC that is properly voiced

												After already 30 hours of gameplay non stop + streaming it, this is what I'm about to say
First of all, I'm a huge fan of bandai namco jrpg games
Mostly been a huge fan of tales and god eater games and some other naruto game that are hack'n'slash one
I haven't bought any SAO games in my vita, so I only try AW vs SAO and SAO:HR on steam
Pros :- I love how every SAO game aren't 100% the same mechanism with the other SAO games
The game isn't like the previous one that is available on steam, is not like an hack'n'slash only, but they try to make like some kind of a MMO game
- The feel of being like playing with real players
Since they try to create something that ressemble like a real MMO, is pretty impressive that you feel like you're in one even thought you're just playing the singleplayer for the story
If you get into the game+story like I do, you can threat other npc players as if they were real players
You'll see many in town, and also in area, you'll see them fight in group
Of course is not perfect, you can't really choose a topic you want to talk to since they are just AI
But you can interact with them, and while interacting with them more and more, you can create some kind of bond like a real MMO, that's how you make friend
- Big and interesting story, like many of bandai namco games such as the tales series, god eater, and even other SAO, you can guarantee that you'll have tons of hours before completing the story (unless you skip the dialogue)- Good amount of customization for your character, some people will say there isn't enough, but I find it pretty cool
Plus, your clothes change depending on the armor you put
Sadly sometimes you will feel that the armor name just don't fit on how it look xD
- Japanese voice, I know there is a huge debate in the anime about dub vs sub, both have their advantage, and everyone can have their own preference
In my case, I love the japanese voicing more, which you have here
Is not like many JRPG that you just read


read



read



with some few sound like : "ah", "eh", "oh"
But you actually hear the character speak, which is something I really enjoy from the tales and god eater games
Since I'm not a big reader, just listening to the voice/reaction and reading the translate, it feel like watching an anime in subs, way more enjoyable then just reading
- Amazing map, as expected from bandai namco games
Map pretty detail for a JRPG
Of course is not comparable to many shooter game that require high graphic such as destiny 2 that just came out with amazing view/map, but for a JRPG, I'd say is pretty amazing
The details on a rock or jumping between branch, you don't feel like much invisible wall
Of course there will be some invisble wall, like an island surrounded by water, they won't let you start walking on water or swimming for 1 hours non stop
If you play AW vs SAO, you'll see that the map is gigantic, amazing flight range, you can fly anywhere in one area, the only invisible wall are like the edge of an area
While in many other game even in some online MMO, you'll feel invisible wall while trying to jump on a rock where your character jump higher then the height of the rock


but you'll slide straight down @
@


which doesn't happen in SAO:HR, where you can jump on every rock, even the one stick on wall as long as your jump is higher then the rock height
Cons :- Not for players that will just skip the story
If you don't care about the story happening in SAO:HR and just want to play the game and kill monster
I probably won't suggest this game for you
Unlike AW vs SAO where the flight system is something really impressive and smooth compare to many other games, in this game, it will be your average killing mobs and visiting place where you can do in many other MMO or other games
- Not being use to control (since I suppose most people will be using a controller to play this game), the control can be pretty weird at first due to it not being your average hack'n'slash jrpg, but they try to make some kind of MMO
I use a controller to play this game, and usually MMO are being play with a keyboard and mouse on keyboard
Some that play MMO with a controller might be more at ease when they first start this game
On keyboard you have a lots of button which you can set all kind of skills, while on a controller you have to hold button (which is not new) to do some kind of skill, but mostly the select button open you a bar of hotkey
Now this is where it get a bit rough
In some JRPG game, we use select a lots in the middle of a battle of course, like god eater where you need to use select to use healing or bullet change
But in this game, since an MMO usually have a lots of skill, mostly when you advance on class, in here you can have all kind of skill, and there isn't enough button on a controller, so you might be force to press select for other skill + buff + potion
- Create your kirito
The cool thing about most of bandai namco JRPG, is that there is voice with the character instead of just reading and hearing some few sound from your character
The problem here is that, unlike AW vs SAO where you actually see the story of Kirito and his friends, and you can control any premade character, in this game you will be able to custom your character (which should be a pro)
The thing is you will be kirito, that mean you will be the hero of the story of course
I'm a girl, so I created a girl character, but in the story, your character will be speaking as kirito, so you'll have a man voice which can be kinda weird xD
- Bad translate, if you understand at least a few decent word in japanese, you'll notice there is many mistake in the translate, including grammar or some few typo
Question I've receive that isn't part of my pros and con:Q : Is the game worth the price?A : I'd say yes, I heard the game deluxe edition was 80$ when it first came out, of course is cheaper now since this game been 1 year old
I always buy most of bandai game in full price, mostly because I'm a huge fan and I would love to see more of their game being imported in the western
It really depend on you if you want to buy it in full price or on sales, afterall steam sale happen pretty often
I buy it full price to support the compagny, and because how big the game is compare to many other games, you can see that they put tons of work into it
Q : Would you recommend this game for someone that never try a JRPG?A : Probably not SAO : HR to start with due to the fight mechanism being really different then many JRPG, I'll probably suggest to start with the tales one, or AW vs SAO, due to the flight system being really smooth and easy to control even while fighting
Q : If we don't like the anime, will we enjoy the game?A : To be fair, is kinda a hard question, I wouldn't say : because you don't like SAO you won't like any other thing related to SAO
Just like god eater, I started from the game, I was a huge huge huge, a REALLY big fan of god eater, I'm also greatfull I got the chance to meet the creator of god eater as well (THANK YOU BANDAI), but the anime


The anime wasn't as enjoyable as I expected
I loved the character in the game, and I loved the small anime special "God eater prologue" that came before God eater the anime
For SAO, it might be the same thing, just like people loving the VN but hating the anime (but that mostly due to poor adaptation)
If you love JRPG game, but dislike the anime, you can always try the SAO games, there no harm, except only harming your wallet depending when you buy it
But I find the game more enjoyable due to me liking the anime + movie + character
But SAO game are mostly story focus, unlike naruto fighting game, you don't need to watch naruto to enjoy playing a naruto fighting game
You'll probably put more time into the story in SAO games, so if you didn't enjoy the anime/LN, there is a huge chance you might not like the story in the game as well

												Have you ever wanted to swing your weapons around for countless hours, possibly the rest of your life?Do you enjoy seducing other women, including your cousin, while in a relationship?This is the game for you
			
Posted: 29 October
												After some hours of playing I am ready to write my review
Some may dislike the game mainly because it's SAO


I do agree that if you don't like SAO to some degree you might not enjoy it AS much
The game runs fairly well; I have terrible specs for now generation's games and I can play this game perfectly fine
My primary specs are: I3 Core, GTX 645, 6GB Ram
I am running the game at 40fps (I haven't touched the settings since installed)Assuming most people reading this have way better specs than me since I've had my pc for like 7 years, you should be able to run the game well if that is one of the reasons you are reading reviews
The story is quite fascinating and it's not a game you can complete within a couple of hours which makes it enjoyable to grind
There are apparently a lot of people having issues with using controllers so that there is a con
I am using keyboard
The character creation isn't really good since it's very limited but I managed to create a fairly easy char that resembles Kiyotaka from COTE
(I'm going to update my review after further progession and understanding)

												Guys, the "exit" button has disappeared, I don't know what to do =\\\			
Posted: 28 October
												Sword Art Online : Hollow Realization Deluxe editionComes with the season pass and all DLC
Character creation, create the avatar of kirito, even if its male or female
You can change the name, hair, eyes etc
Huge world to explore, fanservice, Lots of quests, Boss raid battles, All in a singleplayer experience
Enough skills to unlock to keep you bussy or  hours, enough armors to find, weapons to try etc
There is co-op and pvp
You can replay almost every quest
60+fps, looks good, plays like a Jrpg, VN style conversations
If you have controller problems -> go to steam Big picture mode and select controller configuration
Check all the boxes from ps4 to xbox input -> restart steam
and voila, controller will now work
Its a great game for Jrpg/MMO style gamepley/Sao fans
It has a little bit of everything, and i really like the world that is crafted so far
Enjoy the game, LINK START !Sorry for the bad english

												Pros:+Solid port runs 4k 60fps (even in town which was locked only to 30fps on console) +Great story and full of side events represented in visual novel style+Nice Soundtracks+Many things to do +Combat is greatCons:- Controller configuration problemOverall:9
5/10Update:After playing 60h+End game content is big and it has it's own storyi noticed some bugs in game like:-Your character get stuck sometimes and cannot move (Seriously? you'll be forced to exit)-The game does freeze during loading or when you switch back to the game after using another app			
Posted: 6 November
												First of all, I'm a fan of the SAO stories (Read the books and watched the anime), however, this is the first game I've played of the series (Mostly because I don't own any consoles atm)
The story is similar but it does goes on a tangent and follows it's own series of events
The story in the books/anime has many faults in terms of game mechanics, being a gamer myself it annoys me once I get out of the 'let's enjoy this story' and into 'game mode'
This game has some really good things, and some really bad ones
Just like the story in the books, it leads me to believe that whoever designed it is not a gamer themselves
Good Aspects1
The world
They made a very believable MMO setting with NPCs acting like players would in the field and in town
2
Unique NPCs
You'll see them in town and in the field
You can befriend them and eventually take them with you to the field or date them, etc
3
Quest Board
A good way of making Col (Currency) and getting some extra XP
Hunting quests, boss quests, mob drops quests (which come mostly from the Unique NPCs and help towards befriending them)
3
The Sword Art system
The active abilities are fun to combine in combat to use your combos and enhance your own playstyle
Use a weapon (sword, dagger, axe, etc
) to raise your skill level with it, which will give you access to new arts and buffs that you can learn by spending skill points
4
Multiplayer
Is very simplistic
Play with friends or strangers to grind for gear or levels
Grivances1
NPC quests
They are monotonous once you start getting a lot of them
You pick them and then have to confirm every single one of them, even if they are 150+
Is very annoying
QoL (Quality of Life) would be to have a way to pick them and turn them in in-bulk
2
Buffs/Debuff Skills
I rather have smaller buffs or debuffs turned into passive skills or reactive skills
Than having to buff myself every 30 seconds
And also they become completely useless towards end game
As passives/reactives they wouldn't become as useless
3
Controls
Gamepads don't work well at the moment
At least I couldn't get mine to work
It took me a few hours, but I got used to using mouse + keyboard
I don't think I'll use a gamepad even if they fix the issues at this point
Another thing, with so many keys, there is no need for toggle keys
It should be Optional, not enforced
4
Difficulty
It starts good and challenging, but it doesn't scale well
I got to a point around lvl 20+ when I could one shot trash that should be my level, world bosses (the lvl95 and above) were beaten with ease, and Zone Boses were done in under a minute
I went into the multiplayer at around lvl 30+ on Nightmare difficulty


they should rename it 'Stroll through the Park' difficulty
Bosses do decent damage, they just need to be more spongey
Overall is a fun game, even with the grivances I have with it
However, it also is a niche game
Is not for everyone
I'm not done with it, I'll continue until I finish it

												My bf and I purchased this game with the intention of playing it multiplayer, only to be extremely disappointed that the multiplayer is only for fighting boss battles, not actually playing the game
The story is also pretty uninspired and just feels like their only goal is to beat you over the head with nostalgia
They really just need to make SAO into a real MMO

												"The sin is not in being outmatched, but in failing to recognize it
""Do not ruminate on this fleeting failure - the campaign is long, and victory will come
"Game is fun for those who like numbers, strategy, and turn-based combat
It is being hotfixed and getting adjustments to certant things regularly by the developers to make it a better experience
Had I gone into it blind, I may have thought that the game was unfair too
However, after watching multiple other people play this game modless on all difficulties, it is clear that skill is involved and you can improve
So with that in mind, I will continue on to improve as well

												To anyone reading these reviews who is confused by the massive swings between positive and negative, you need to know one thing: Darkest Dungeon is an emotional game
To people just starting out, it can seem baffling, unfair, and deliberately obscure
To people who have been playing since Early Access, and who have seen favourite party compositions and strategies rendered obsolete, the Steam reviews page is more of an extension of Reddit than anything else - a place to air grievances (legitimate or otherwise) over a game that they have dedicated a lot of time to
What a lot of these reviews miss out is


y'know


the actual review part
On that front, I would say the following: the core gameplay is rock solid
At its heart, Darkest Dungeon has taken a minimalist, turn-based, four-man combat system and imbued it with massive potential for tactical thought and personal flair
Figuring out the best role for each of your heroes (chosen from a fairly generous pool of classes) and suddenly realising a unique way of getting them to synergise is immensely gratifying
Unlike a lot of games, it doesn't feel like there is a a ring-fenced area of "correct", vanilla play that only the very high-level players can get past; instead, you are encouraged and rewarded for coming up with your own strategies from the get go
The central combat system is smart, it pushes you to experiment, and there is a lot of room to come up with a playstyle that feels like your own, unique creation
HOWEVER! If that's all Darkest Dungeon was, it would be a neat tablet-based distraction, but ultimately sterile
It is the stuff that comes layered on top of it that is the source of its intrigue - and also the source of a lot of the frustration you'll see directed at it
As a typical RPG player, you naturally do everything you can to guarantee the safety and efficacy of your character(s), and it feels inherently uncomfortable to work in a game environment that leaves you perpetually on your toes and at risk of failure
DD refuses to let you settle into a comfortable routine, and a massive enemy critical attack, an ambush in pitch-dark while camping, or a series of misses on your part can topple you from a seemingly-unassailable position to a very desperate one
The potential for a fail-cascade is what turns off many new players, and even drives experienced ones to the occasional rage-review, but it is also vital to the fundamental risk-reward balance of the game, which is designed to punish complacency and encourage the utmost thought on your part
As you progress through a dungeon, you constantly need to balance a dwindling supply of light, food, sanity and health (although they can be restored in some ways), while also trying to complete objectives and collect much-needed loot with limited backpack space
Usually, this is the sort of gameplay I dislike; feeling that there is a time-limit, that I can't plough through something at my own speed in relative safety, is an uncomfortable experience after most games
However, the actual result is some very effective tension
In a normal RPG (say


Diablo), the steady drip of ever-increasing numbers is satisfying in a functional sort of way, but in DD the stakes are so high that getting a critical hit or dodging a huge attack always feels like a  moment  rather than just a nice bonus
It can initially feel punishing and unfair, since most gamers are hard-wired to see a hero death (which is permanent), a catastrophic turn-around, or a "tactical retreat" as a failure
Likewise, the element of randomness can make it feel like your hard work and smart play has not been rewarded, like you're just a random collection of atoms buzzing around in a meaningless void where there is no God or higher authority to dispense justice or distinguish right or wrong



It takes time to realise that you were never  meant  to have it easy, that it's  always  been a gamble, and you can't expect a perfect S ranking - all you can do is make the best play you can with the information you have
It takes time to realise that the game is pushing you to accept loss and difficulty as part of the game, rather than a failure
Even I rage quit every now and then - but I always come back, because, as I said, Darkest Dungeon is an emotional game
You invest (real) time and (fake) money in your group of heroes, the odds are massively stacked in the House's favour, none of your guys is going to come out unscarred, you are going to face some serious setbacks, but you return because actually making it, actually landing that last hit at the last possible moment, realising you've scraped through again, is always a surprise, and an amazing one at that

												Reviewers blaming this game's RNG for their failures is frankly embarrassing


especially when they say "the game is not hard, but the RNG is unfair
"  RNG management is the game
 It's like saying "golf isn't a hard game, but it's unfair that I'm expected to get the ball in the cup
" Darkest Dungeon is a great game; don't let people who are bad at adapting and/or assessing their skill level deter you from getting it
 I'm no slouch at these kinds of games, but I've had zero full party wipes in 150+ hours, and one-shotted the final two dungeons going in blind on my first playthrough
 In short:  "These nightmarish creatures can be felled! They can be beaten!"

Early Access Review
								This is a living review, I will continue to update it as my experience evolves; see comments for additional updates
TL; DR Overall, the game is fun and I can foresee getting many hours of solid gameplay out of it which is why I have recommended it
 Be prepared to experience the consensus "cons"; which can be blisteringly frustrating in the early game
 If you think those things will be enough to trump the enjoyment you would get from the things the game does well, do not purchase it
The most common criticisms of Darkest Dugeon are the inability to turn off combat animations, combat speed, dialogue animations causing you to be unable to interact with anything until completed, and RNG
 All of these things exist in varying degrees
Combat animations + dialogue have the potential to draw combat out for far too long
 The animations themselves, while cool, can start to feel really repetitive if you're having a bad stroke of RNG (missing a lot, despite a high chance to hit)
 They also are very herky-jerky (there's a zoom during an animation) that leaves me feeling like I'm rocking on a boat
 If I play on an empty stomach, sometimes I feel slightly nauseous
The chat bubbles also leave something to be desired
 They become repetitive very quickly and interupt the flow of exploration and combat
 I suspect they were included to create atmosphere, but I find they actually detract from it because of how herky-jerky they become - this causes your immersion to be regularly broken up/halted
 This is typically only an issue if your party is afflicted by negative quirks or your torchlight is dimming
 Characters become more talkative when things are going poorly
RNG
 I originally wrote that I didn't find this particularly irritating and chalked up the experience to most people just being unfamiliar with game mechanics (IE Chance to Hit, Resistances, etc)
 I've chosen to recant that
 RNG is crippling, but only in the early game
 Darkest Dungeon's biggest  problem, in my opinion, is the early vs late game balance
 Early on, resources are tight
 You don't have a ton of gold that can afford you to recoup your losses if you have to abandon a mission
 You don't have a town that has been upgraded to reduce the cost of removing negative quirks/high stress levels
 Due to this, you often feel overwhelmed - particularly if you have a bad stroke of RNG (IE
You get crit multiple times early in a dungeon, multiple characters have very high stress levels from it, etc)
 Later in the game, once you've upgraded your town some, prices aren't has crippling (maybe 750-1000 gold instead of 1500) AND you're getting more money from missions
 In addition, you might be able to remove quirks from 2 characters at a time, instead of just one
 As the game progresses, you almost start to feel overpowered - not in the traditional sense, as things can still go terribly wrong, but when compared to your early experience where EVERY thing feels stressful
Getting crit increases stress by 15-20
 Landing a crit reduces stress by 5-10
 Therein lies many of the inherent problems in every facet of this game
 When something goes wrong it is always nearly TWICE as punishing as the beneficial aspect of something going right
 My personal biggest qualm has to be the lack of an easy way to discern combat attack order
 There exists a "SPD" stat, which I assume is speed and I also assume determines attack order
 Rifling through each monsters' stat in an effort to figure out what will be attacking when is not an intuitive, efficient, or easy system
 It also feels like the order isn't static, as the encounter progresses the same monster isn't always attacking in the same spot (or so it seems - I could be incorrect in this claim)
 The reason this is problematic is because it forces you to pay astronomically close attention/have an excellent memory of when something attacked to determine whether you should disable (stun) or gamble for a kill (powerful regular attack)
 This becomes further complicated when trying to "combo" attacks
 IE
Stun with a character so another class that has an attack with a dmg increase against stunned targets can eliminate it
 Since combat positioning matters, if I stun, then my character gets pushed into a different position, and the new position renders me unable to use my bonus dmg against stunned targets attack, I have essentially wasted that initial action
Beyond some of these troubling mechanics, most of which I foresee being tweaked to be less punishing/better tuned, the game has some very neat features
 Stress, while annoying to some, was a big selling point for me
 I would like to see stress become more balanced around fight/flight
 What I mean by that is, currently, it feels like the vast majority of stress mechanics are negative
 Indeed, I would say upwards of 80% of the time my characters have become stressed they have suffered negative mechanics as opposed to positive
 I would like to see this number brought closer to 50/50
 Not to get too invested in "real life" comparisons, since this game is hardly reminscent of "real life", but stress serves a pretty strong evolutionary purpose and definitely is not something that is 80% negative (even if it has been shown to reduce your life span)
 The same could be said of what happens when you "gamble" on opening chests/sarcophagus
 It feels, more often than not, like this is a greater risk than potential reward
Combat positioning and class synergy are very cool
 Unfortunately, I don't think they are explained in a proficient way for new players which leaves one floundering in the dark for quite some time
 This type of trial and error experience feels a little bit exhausting
 Perhaps the addition of a tutorial or "practice" mode that has some examples of "combos" would be helpful
 IE
a guide that says, "Try using class X ability Y following using class Z ability T"
 The town is also neat
 The availability of upgrades makes it highly customizable and meaningful
 Much like the class system and synergy, though, it can feel quite confusing and overwhelming
 Resources are definitely finite early on and with so many different options and features to upgrade, I have often felt at a bit of a loss
 Discerning what is important in the early game versus what can be ignored until resources start to become plentiful in the late game is extremely difficult
I've heard some argue that upgrading character abilities and weapons/armor doesn't feel worth it for the cost
 I whole-heartedly disagree
 Upgrades are ABSOLUTELY worth it
 Sure, your damage doesn't go up astronomically, but your accuracy does
 Accuracy, to me, is probably the most important stat
 Also, they aren't that pricey as long as you invest in reducing cost - something that I think people aren't doing
Class balance could be improved
 There are a few classes that just feel worthless when compared to their counterparts
 I think both Plague Doctor and Leper are worthless
 Jester, other than people abusing their "stress heal" mechanic, leaves a lot to be desired as well
Ultimately, this game is really about two phases of gameplay
 Early game is soul-crushing and you feel like a victim to every mechanic
 When I read negative reviews, I can see why people are frustrated
 Early game can be THAT frustrating
 Frustrating to the point of wanting to smash your keyboard against the wall
 Most of these things are resolved by mid-late game, though
 If you survive early game, Darkest Dungeon opens up and becomes incredibly fun
 My hope is we will see some tuning regarding early versus late game
 I suspect we will
If you don't think early game will be too frustrating or are willing to soldier through that frustration, pick up Darkest Dungeon
 The game is done remarkably well and, despite being in an older genre, has a lot of innovation which makes it stand out from its peers

Early Access Review
								Imagine being stuck in a car for a fourteen hour drive
With three people you hate
While every other driver on the road is either drunk or deliberately trying to run you off the road
And you only have one sandwich left
And no head lights
Thats basically what the first few missions feel like
After that, it only gets harder because your driver has been blighted, your navigator was killed, and the other guy ate the sandwich because he had been driven insane
Eventually, after replacing a few people, you get to the point where, after a few pit stops, you manage to get rid of them and youre happily riding along with great people, and you think nothing bad is going to happen because youve got the perfect group of passengers
Then an eightteen-wheeler smashes your car killing all of you
Thats basically how this game plays
10/10 would make that drive again

Early Access Review
								Games like this are the reason why I really wish Steam's "do you recommend" question had more than just two options
Here's why: because I would very, very highly recommend this game


to a certain breed of gamer
Let me explain
First, the good
Darkest Dungeon is a masterfully crafted game
The artwork is beautifully grotesque and animation is smooth
The game is balanced fairly well, even if it is balanced towards the "hard" end of the spectrum
Even in early access there is nothing about this game that feels sloppy or poorly considered
The stress mechanic, in which your characters accumulate stress which can affect them in various negative (and sometimes even positive) ways, is a really interesting idea and something that you don't really see a whole lot in video games
The only place I've seen anything like this before would be the Cthulhu games, and I honestly feel like it's handled a lot better here
Oh, and the fact that it's constantly auto-saving, while intended to prevent save-scumming, also has the effect of allowing you to quit and pick back up whenever you want without losing progress, great for people who don't have a lot of time to sit down and play a game
The game wasn't my cup of tea (I'll get to why in a minute) but I can't honestly call it bad just because of that
It's not bad
In fact


KR Rating: [5] GREATBut wait, don't stop reading yet, because now it's time for the bad
As I said before, Darkest Dungeon is a hard game
Well, no, that's not really accurate
Etrian Odyssey is hard
That's why I like that series, and it's why I thought I would like this game too
Darkest Dungeon is not hard, it's unfair
See, you can be riding high one minute, dominating every encounter and getting a ton of good items from the various chests and cupboards (called "curios" in the game) that litter the dungeons
Then you get into that one battle
You know the one I mean
It's the one that doesn't even seem like it should be all that hard
It's the same enemies you've been wasting with ease this whole time
Except this time you do nothing but miss your attacks over and over, while they stack critical hit upon critical hit
Before you can even click the "retreat" button half your force is at Death's Door


or through it
It's a little like Dark Souls in a way
And the thing is, that's not an accident
I said this game was masterfully crafted and it honestly is
This isn't poor game balance, it's the entire point
It's the underlying design philosophy of the game
The developers never intended this to be a game where you train up max level badasses and retake the estate
 There are no badasses in the Darkest Dungeon
There are no heroes
No, this is a game where you recruit expendable idiots by the wagon-load (literally) and send them to die for the greater good
(This is also why there are so few levels of upgrades for your characters: so that restarting when your top character dies is easier
)That's why I say, I really wish that Steam allowed more options than just "recommend" or "not recommend
" Because, on the one hand, the game is very well made
It has become exactly what I feel the developers wanted it to be
It is a GREAT GAME
But "great" and "universally enjoyable" are not the same thing
A lot of people don't like hard games
I do like hard games and even I was turned off by the unfairness and the inability to properly take care of my people
If I really had to choose (and for the purposes of the Steam version of this review I kind of do) I would say that I don't recommend the game, if only because I think the number of people who would enjoy it are in the minority
That said, if you're the type who thinks you might enjoy that then by all means buy the game right now
It's only $19
99 USD on Steam right now, and for that you get one Hell of a solid classic-style RPG with an interesting twist
If you're more like me and you get attached to your characters and don't want to see them die (or if you just don't like hard games) then skip this one

Posted: 27 December, 2015
												I feel like I have to post a new review because all of the reviews that are pre-December, site problems that have been addressed
Red Hook released a huge bug fix and ease of use patch that was specifically designed so that players who dislike certain mechanics (like the stress for "delaying" a fight) can just turn them off
Red Hook is a company that does pay attention to the player base, the problem is that the player base is greatly divided
There is also an extremely vocal minority running a massive smear campaign on the internet, going so far as creating new steam accounts for the sole purpose of going through every positive comment and marking them unhelpful
While I don't want to get into that, if you want, you can absolutely find information about it
Now that the game is released, you may have seen a certain top review, I urge you to look at his time played in the last two weeks (which includes the time since the game was actually released), and notice that he has not played the game since the release, which means he cannot say whether or not the content has improved
He has been attacking the game for months, and was (as far as I can tell) initially enraged by the fact that the devs were not interested in incorporating his opinion into their artistic vision, please keep this in mind when considering your purchase
This game is amazing, and I've been playing since early summer
It has come incredibly far, and anyone who says otherwise is making snap judgements, or flat out lying
Darkest Dungeon has XCOM levels of difficulty
It has XCOM level "WTF" moments
Occasionally you will miss 99% chance to hit attacks, and occasionally enemies will get nigh impossible critical strings
But just like XCOM, through base building and experience, you can minimize risk and become a force to be reckoned with
This game is challenging, but not nearly as hard as most negative reviews would lead you to believe
Most of them say things like "The devs have been trying to remove every winning strategy" or "the game is anti-fun now", but in reality, I haven't met any players new to the game that have problems with it
This leads me to believe that throughout the development of the game, players found certain strategies that were drastically over-powered (which is why in the discussion boards, there are players that rant about the game being too easy), and the devs introduced changes which reduced the efficacy of these imbalanced strategies (which in any other game would be considered a "balance patch", but apparently in this game, people think it is intended to be "fun-killing")
One of these strategies (early on) was to get 4 of the same class, and use the exact same attack every turn until you won everything
This is no longer possible
This seems like a reasonable balance patch to me
I'm really disappointed that I have to write this review in this fashion
There is no reason I should be justifying the game against the recent torrent of bad reviews
This is an amazing game for anyone who likes strategy and/or Lovecraft
I have 300+ hours for a reason, you might not get that much time out of it, but for context, out of the current 3 difficulty tiers of dungeons, I didnt hit level 2 until 80ish hours
I really hope you give this game a chance
Edit: Due to some feedback, I would like to make something clear, this game is not XCOM
It does not have XCOM's production value or quality, and it is not worth 60 dollars
It is certainly worth it's current price tag, and buying it on sale is a no brainer
Release Edit: Now that the game is out, I can say that the devs really came through, they added a huge number of improvements and content with the final release
I recommend this game 100%, and it will only get better from here, as there are free content updates scheduled for the next few months

												You say you like hard games
 You've played Dark Souls, and that's your jam
 You're looking through steam titles for something new to try, and this game shows up
 Let me tell you:  THIS IS NOT DARK SOULS
I get it, you like hard games which rely on perfect timings and knowledge of the individual frames each move takes up
 This isn't that sort of game
 It's difficult, but it's strategically difficult
 You will always have time to think over your decisions before you make them
 This also means that in order to prevent there always being one perfect move, there is an element of RNG in this game
 Some people enjoy it, some people hate it, some people use it as an excuse for losing
 I hate to break it to you, but if you're losing you're probably making poor decisions
 Just because you lowrolled an occultist heal and that caused a character to die doesn't mean you lost to RNG
 Maybe you went for damage instead of throwing out a stun
 Maybe you didn't bring any stuns
 There are many decisions that go into every consequence in this game, and although you might think you are playing perfectly, you're probably not
 I know I make mistakes quite often
So take a moment on this game, give it a try
 Remember: an element of RNG does not mean your decisions don't matter
 If you're playing correctly, you'll pull through
 But you will lose characters
 You will be forced to explore in the dark, as your gold runs out and stresses run high
If you think you play this game well but you're losing to RNG, recall these wise words:  "Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer"			
Posted: 28 October
Tl'dr version: An amazing improvement upon the original, completely contaminated by some of the worst industry practices we have yet seen
Make no mistake, if the consumer base does not stop this now, we will be seeing not only microtransactions in $60 games but further degradation of the base game for them to wring every last ounce of money from us
DO NOT BUY THE LOOTBOXES
You can follow me, and see the rest of my work here:http://steamcommunity
com/id/StarSide/myworkshopfiles/?section=guidesElaborated version:Maybe from that you can already tell I will not just be talking about the base-game of Shadow of War for the whole review
Most reviewers policy is to separate industry practices from the game to judge the game "on its own merits"
Well, here's my issues with that
If you are compromising the product on purpose, in order to drag the game out, or purposely tear the game apart in order for you sell us content later down the line, that is most definitely an already compromised (ethically and mechanically) product
If WB had kept their grubby mitts of this game, I would most definitely have given this a positive review
However, since that is not what they have done, this review will remain negative
Microtransactions
Some in-depth analysis here
Firstly, the infamous loot box situation
You can buy orks from loots boxes, not just getting them out in the in-game world
This completely breaks in-game immersion and the economy of the game
You can either choose to ignore the loot boxes and go at it vanilla, where you're missing out on possible high-level minions, as the game was obviously intended, as the level of orks you find are introduced on a gradient; the higher level you are, the better orks you will find
Additionally, what are essentially ads for the lootboxes keep popping up in game, where you are prompted to go and buy them
Also, if you want any hope of being 'competitive' in the online game mode Shadow Wars, you'll need some super powerful orks, something the lootboxes have the slight possibility to help with
Consequently, you will notice every dynamic in the game becomes centered around these things in some form of another:You want an high level ork? Cough up! You want to upgrade your weapons and armor? You'll need additional gems to do that, cough up!You want to play multiplayer? Better have some good orks, so cough up!!Whether the game would have been constructed like this without the cancer that is WarnerBrothers getting their claws into the mechanics of the game is completely moot
Now, with that out of the way, let's talk about the game
Story
You a lord of the rings lore fan? This is going to be a rough ride
The game, for better or for worse, plays fast and lose with the canon to such an extent you wonder why not just set this in the time of the silmerilian and call it a day
However, if you can get past the desecration of established law (which I can), the story is actually quite compelling
Following on the last game, Ranger Talion and his ancient dead elf-friendo Calimbrimbor have made a new ring of power, just like Saurons
Great! What could go wrong
Turns out quite a lot actually
What follows is an epic, continent spanning war between the 'Bright Lord' and Sauron
All sorts of shenanigans ensue! Just don't get too disappointed if you were expecting high-brow Shakespeare
Movement and Combat
Like Shadows of Mordor but better
Everything is back from the last game, but with added upppf
Movement is buttery smooth, and really the game plays just like every other third-person openworld, Arkyum style game
Speaking of which, the combat system is straight outta Batman, which isn't a bad thing
Combat is fun and Talion's wraith powers are suitably beefed up from the last game
The Nemesis system
I was going to add this to the last section however, it more or less is one of the most original ideas in the last decade in gaming
Essentially, the Nemesis system allows every individual ork to remember you, and everything you've done to them
Burn that ork captain in a fire, he might come for you later on
This is extended to the 'meta game' aspect for creating armies
Your generals might betray you, or save your life
This creates some of the best dynamic stories in gaming really
However, sometimes the betrayals get a little too common, and you'll find yourself trying to game the system in order to keep your orks on your side
I won't say anything more, it really is something better to experience for yourself
Sound
Not the best, not the worse
Voice acting is passable, with a few exceptions
Talion seems mostly asleep during his cutscenes, the voice actor is clearly phoning it in for his paycheck at this point
On the other hand, Calimbrimbor is the star of the show
His gravely tones are both charismatic and slightly scary, especially when he gets all shouty
Combat noises are also quite good
Swords ring and the screams of orks will pervade your ears constantly
In this universe, all orks seem to have a slightly comical British cocny accent
You'll either love it or hate it
ConclusionNot concentrating on the poor industry behavior, this is a great game
However, I will not simply segregate them out of the review, because this stuff definitely effects the end product
Great game! But make a statement and wait for this to get to a low price
And DON'T, DON'T, DON'T buy those damn lootboxes!!

												DO NOT ACCEPT THE TOS! If you just click the accept button without clicking the check box it turns off the Microtransactions, marketplace, and people attacking your base while you are offline "multiplayer" there is NOTHING that tells you this is possible on the screen
 I detail about this further here at the very start! https://youtu
be/ur3-II1kvBEEdit: WB did change the game prerelease to no longer include losing your Uruks if you get raided while you are offline
The other points still apply
I wish there was a maybe option instead of recommend or not
In light of how this game is packaged I had to click no
Overall I am enjoying the game but it still needs optimization and all the loot box stuff removed

												So First off i played this game offline and online
atm 40+ hoursHowever there is a few things that is bad and a few things that is good
Update2!For once this will be a good point and update
With the first dlc released Slaughter Tribe they will be makeing Shadow wars Endless ( free update with or without additional dlc purchase )This is a good step in right direction hopefully they will solve aloot of the other problems as well later down the road
Lets take bad part first
Update3!Pitfight AI sometimes can be broken and the orcs just stand there for a minute and then suddenly go berzerk and kill some one
possible bugg ?Update!After about 40-50 hours into the game i started getting aloot of IronWilled Orcs wich makes them Impossible to dominate
This is no doubt a lockbox Mechanic wich is aimed at you haveing harder time to get a orc dominated
It was not in first game shadow of mordor for sure
IronWilled can be removed at a super low chance ( so far my chances have been 1 in 29 shames ) while you shame an orc but heres the kicker
If you shame an orc they have a chance to became deranged wich makes them lose their personality
Also ( if you have certain skill have  chance to make them a maniac wich can be quite insane strong but if ironwilled then they will proboly be hard time to deal with )Or in my case i ended up with aloot of very weak orcs and deranged and still ironwilled
Now this mechanic is aimed at you haveing a slower time to get orcs so you get bored and buy lootbox orcs i have no doubt in my mind about this
This only happened later down in the game and well it sucks to be frank
I found some very cool orcs i wanted but since they IronWilled i cannot get them without risking them to become insane and lose all their personality
VERY poor game mechanic
So Monolith lied about a few things in their interviews and such
First of all they said there would be no advertisements on lootboxes ingame in a published interview
But as soon as you open the game and anytime ingame you play and press escape advertisement for lootboxes shows up
Wich is bad
Next Monolith promised everything that was in lootboxes was in open world
This was also a lie
You see in the lootboxes you get scrolls that can customize your orcs
You do not get that in the open world only from lootboxes ( free or Pay boxes ) Below there is a few examples of what you get from lootboxes that is NOT in open world
Battle Training (raises a follower's level by 1)Archer Recruitment (grants a follower an Archer Gang)Hunter Recruitment (Grants a follower a Hunter Gang)Defender Recruitment (Grants a follower a Defender Gang)Mount Training (Grants a follower a caragor mount) Fire Training (Grants a follower a Fire Weapon)Epic Training: Mighty Savages (Grants a follower a boost to the effectiveness of nearby Savages)Poison Training (Grants a follower a Poison Weapon)Mount Training Legendary (Grants a follower a Defencive Graug)This list is INCOMPLETE we do not have all the traits scrolls here there is supposedly many many more locked inside the lootbox system and NOT avaible ingame
Below is a link to the official forum where people asked that this be put into the game and not into lootboxes Monolith preatty much ignored it
https://community
wbgames
com/t5/General/Please-make-training-orders-and-reassignment-orders-avaliable/td-p/1656682Next part that is bad about the game is Lootboxes in a single player game was kinda over the line and poorly done IF everything was inside the game offline as well as in lootboxes then ok np but it is not
Other than micro transaction things the game suffers from a little bit repetive gameing syndrome you do aloooot of the same things over and over with very little changes
Now that was the bad parts
Lets go to the good parts
Game features a very well made graphics engine and Npcs are well cordinated for the most part
Story is good as far as i gotten and sound actors are good but maybe little bit low on volume and subtitles can be a hit and miss
Optimisation is welldone i tested on my laptop and on my pc and both worked great
have not encountered any buggs so far wich is good
Nemesis version 2 engine is awesome! you will love it
Skill system is a little bit weaird at first glance but you get the hang of it later
You can respec free of charge at any given time great addition
Id say if it was not for the lootboxes this would be a perfect game
Now In conclusion If you do not mind microtransactions and some items being In Lootboxes only then you should buy this game
However if you do have something against microtransaction or you suffer from addiction disorders or similar problems DO NOT buy this game due to sublime advertisements in the menus
I do not know if they will ban people who have fun with the game with mods or cheats or such but i hope they do not since this is a single player game
There is a multiplayer section of the game but its like not worth mentioning couse its very very basic and limited
anyways there you have my review
PS the amount of bad decisions monolith and warner bros made when releaseing this game made the game dirt cheap before it was even released i got my copy 65% off from a retailer on gold edition
you can proboly snag this game with gold edition 50% of at any given time from retailers or digital merchants

												Shadow of War is one of 2017’s biggest disappointments for me
While its Nemesis system is better than ever, the rest of the game provides a flawed and repetitive experience with some unpleasant practices integrated into the menu
Imagine a single player game that advertises its microtransactions and season pass every time you pause
That may not sound too bad, but I easily spent at least forty percent of the game digging through the bloated and slow menu system
I must have seen them hundreds of times
In addition to that nonsense, you have the (microtransaction) Market section, filled with Gold and Mithril Chests that promise epic or legendary items and orcs
Other things you can spend your premium currency on include experience boosts and Featured Friday Chests™
Not everything requires real money in the Market
You can spend your Mirian (in-game currency) on somewhat useless Silver Chests and redeem rewards tied to the online component of the game (Online Vendettas and Sieges)
Those delicious rewards trigger a glowing circle right next to the Market in the menu, you know, to make you click on it
That way you can be exposed to more of their premium offerings since they’re all mixed in together
It’s just the other way the game is engineered to advertise its boxes to you
There is some serious free-to-play mobile game design philosophy wrapping its glistening, bulging arms around Shadow of War
Now that we’ve covered that nasty part of the game, let’s talk about the Nemesis system
It’s good and the orcs make it fun and interesting
You’ll run into and be killed by poet orcs, orcs that don’t know how to stay dead, and orcs that will save you time and time again (to my horror, which I’ll go over later)
Their responses to the numerous situations that can occur within the game impressed me
The voice actors put in some great performances as the orc and olog captains, especially when you earn the ability to shame them into insanity (highly recommended)
Unfortunately, the game overstays its welcome with its forgettable story and unlikable protagonists
The elf ghost seems unable to say anything that doesn’t involve the word Palintír™ and Talion doesn’t really develop or seem interesting
Shelob is apparently eye candy with her fine humanoid form and has a unexpectedly dumb storyline tied to her memories (one type of collectable in the game) that becomes apparent when you gather all of them
The other characters in the game are a slightly better while the orcs are #1
They have much more entertaining and interesting personalities than everyone else
The other big problem with Shadow of War comes in the form of highly repetitive and somewhat frustrating gameplay
If you’re the type that can’t help collecting collectibles, then you’re in for a boring and tedious ride
One of the worst parts about hunting them down is having to climb a tower that activates a mini-game that involves scoping out the territory until your crosshair shrinks enough to discover it when you’re close enough
Some of them have interesting lore pieces attached and others, not so much
The combat varies greatly in its quality depending on the encounter
You can easily find yourself spamming dodge or counter for extended periods of time if the captain has the right combination of immunities and traits
Some enraged captains will endlessly lunge at you if they’re Enraged leaving no room to do anything else until they chill out
Sometimes you’re stuck kiting the enemy or you’re facing a tank who keeps healing over and over again (don’t waste your time and run away until you’re at a higher level)
Other times, you’re being clever with all your tools and feeling pretty great about your conquest
Then again, you could end up becoming uncomfortably intimate with the game’s horrible targeting and wasting a powerful attack on an unintended victim
It’s a somewhat common occurrence with groups
Other issues involve traversal and glitches
Talion seems to have a fetish for climbing and will lovingly attach himself to any surface that’s nearby when running around
I’ve accidentally started climbing up a wall, pillar, or structure when just trying to travel from point A to point B
This problem happens frequently and with mounts too, especially graugs
However, the inclusion of the double jump was a very good choice and was fun to use
As for the glitches, I fell through the world once, witnessed silent speeches, and more
For the most part, my 33 hours didn’t have many technical problems and the loading times were fantastic on my HDD
The mission design could have used a better touch too
Too often would I be going out of bounds in an open-world game
And it’s not a matter of running 1000m in the wrong direction, the arbitrary boundaries are poorly placed to the point of causing mission failure and having to restart
It’s aggravating to see that message pop up and doubly so when it causes a restart
Let me use the environment to my advantage instead of forcing me in a weirdly confined space in a game where you’re normally able to move freely
Since orc speeches are unskippable, you can expect to hear plenty of repeated dialogue if you happen to run into a very difficult fight
The game has a weird grind going for it towards the end
Recruiting orcs means not collecting sweet loot off their dead bodies so each one has an opportunity cost between an item or convert, making the purchase of chests more attractive
I’m glad I got the Act 1 Starter Pack for 50% off with the 500 real currency Mirian which helped me stay geared up
Leveling up slows down too so again, I’m glad I ended up with a handful of 2-hour 100% experience boosts
Lastly, I don’t understand the balance in this game
The combat balance seems off when it comes to the difficulty level
Normal is too easy and Nemesis removes nearly all the hitstun that Normal difficulty has
I found Nemesis to be an exercise in frustration since some missions could end up turning into huge difficulty spikes while repeating the mission on Normal made it a cakewalk
You can tune the difficulty at any time, but nothing can fix that weird gap between the two
I lied, one more thing, before I forget
That heroic orc that kept saving me wasted my time
The upgrade system for items involving fulfilling some requirements that function like a mini-quest of sorts
The legendary ones tend to favor recruiting very specific orcs of a certain level, tribe, and class
This means staring at the Army section of the menu and going through the orcs until you find the right ones
You might even have to pass time if you don’t see any available
Now when I found the right kind of orc twice, they didn’t have the correct level
My plan was to let them kill me so that they could level up and allow me to upgrade my items when I recruited them
However, this one orc I recruited could not resist saving me and when he did, he delivered a one hit killing blow
In conclusion, the Nemesis system and great orc voice acting carry this game hard
2
5 out of 5 stars would be awarded based on that and the positive aspects of combat alone
Numerous things rubbed me the wrong way though and I cannot bring myself to recommend Shadow of War to anyone
Maybe at 40-50% off
It’s a horribly bloated experience with a sluggish menu
They needed to trim down a few things and go with refinement instead of having such a busy menu with too many functions
Oh, I do like the Photo Mode
Make sure to give that a “shot
” Hyuck

												Pros:- Better movement across the large maps- Similar gameplay to its predecessor -- doesn't completely change the formula- Grindy, if you're like me, you may enjoy spending more time killing captains and leveling up than actually playing main quests- Massive landscapes with lots of impressive views- Fleshed out army building: More interaction on recruiting and leveling up dominated enemies
- Some really fun main quest battles that slightly deviate from the repetitive side quests- Tons of lore that is delivered via main menu, in-game, and cinematic videos
- Despite reports, I was getting relatively smooth gameplay ~40-60FPS from my Titan X Maxwell (NOT the newer Titan X Pascal) running 4K: 3840x2160 on ultra
There was some choppiness when it came to assassin/ambush captain pop ins, otherwise been smooth
Also, no crashes in my ~20 hours of play
Neutral:- Microtransactions -- there's a lot of strife over this, so instead of writing about it ad-nausem, I'll say this: Aside from the trolly T
O
S
screen (desribed below), didn't affect my gameplay (I didn't purchase anything nor was I nagged in-game to purchase anything from it)
Cons:- The annoying T
O
S
-- I accepted the Terms of Service, but didn't accept the collecting of data (checkbox)
Now, everytime I start OR exit the game, the T
O
S
screen pops back up wanting me to accept the data collection
Instead, I have to accept and leave the checkmark box empty over and over and over and over and over
Never in my gaming history have I had a T
O
S
screen be that trolly
- Lack of customization -- the swords/shiv/cloaks/rings etc
are just stat upgrades
You can't customize the character's look nor can you differentiate between a level 1 sword from a level 25 sword
 - Predictable - captain assassin/ambush/betrayl pop-ins will mainly appear after sending death threats
Doesn't feel like RNG, but rather staged gameplay to distract the player
- Climbing walls -- when it comes to arch-ways, the climbing becomes super wonky, particularly if you're climbing on the front-face and are attempting to drop inside of/underneath it
Also, some of the wired "walkways" won't allow the player to move forward
He'll go into the crouched position and stick at the beginning of the wire
- The AI -- you can sneak in front a generic enemy's face and assassinate them
Or worse, they could be looking right at you and say, "Where did he go!?"
Some minor tweaks should fix this issue
- Repetitive -- the gameplay, so far, has become repetitive
Very similar to Shadow of Mordor, but with a touch of Just Cause 3 style of play, where areas need to be "liberated" (captured), before the story continues
Unfortunately, this becomes quite repetitive after about 15 hours
- The game size -- 100GB ladies and gentlemen
That includes the game, the 4k DLC cinemas and the DLC high-res texture packs
If you have a slower than 1 gigabit connection or have a data cap or have limited harddrive space


I'm sorry! https://imgur
com/m9gjJm0Glitches as of v1
01:- Captain loot -- Early on, I ended up getting a bow that I already had equipped at the time
However, since it's a level 1, I couldn't dismantle it
So I'm stuck with two level 1 bows with the same stats that I can't dismantle
- Broken Shelob memories - after solving ANY of the spider web puzzles, I get about 1-2 seconds of video before it rewinds, makes a loud pop and goes back to the gameplay: https://youtu
be/GbYwCjGYSUw ***This may only affect those who have the 4K DLC installed
***- Enemies respawn too quickly - After defeating a main quest/side quest/kill a captain, enemies will respawn in place within seconds
This mainly affects the side quests and mini-fortress battles, where another captain may respawn in an area you just killed the mini-fortress captain
Therefore, creating an endless captain respawn loop if you decide to kill the respawned captains
It does affect the main quests, but to a smaller degree
Regardless, enemies should respawn only after the area is left
- Loading - Occasionally, the loading screen would hang
When I alt+tab out and back into the game, it seamed to fix it
Other thoughts:Unfortunately, I feel that if you've played Shadow of Mordor, you've played Shadow of War
The game is just way too similar to its predecessor (same overall gameplay, similar storyline, same level-up grind fest, same animations, same in-game assets, same captain strengthes/weakness, same captain menu, same generic enemies, mostly the same dominated mounts


etc)
This game kind of feels like it should have been an expansion pack or DLC for Shadow of Mordor
It's not so much a new game with some fresh new features, but an old game that's been fleshed out
It feels like this: An author created a successful book
The fans wanted a sequel
The author takes his or her first book, adds in more detail, keeps everything else relatively the same, and releases it as a new sequel to the first
Would you pay for that? When it comes to Shadow of War, expect a different map with the same gameplay and a few minor game tweaks and army additions; otherwise, everything else just feels like icing on an already stale cake (I played Shadow of Mordor for 120+ hours, so I ate my fair share of this dessert already)
Recommendations:- If you've never played Shadow of Mordor: Buy it
- If you've played Shadow of Mordor and loved it: Wait to buy it on discount
- If you've played Shadow of Mordor and were expecting a revitalized game with some new enemies, new assets/animations, more purpose than building an army, or a new storyline: Don't buy it
Final thoughts:- Visuals - 9/10- Variety of Gameplay - 5/10- Fun Factor - 6
5/10 Overall: 6
5/10 -- slightly above average

												Great game that improves on everythign Shadow of Mordor had, but paying 60$ for a full game only to find i need to spend more money for buy my way thru the game to the "real" ending is what made this a negative review
:<			
Posted: 13 October
												Shadow of War is fun until reaching the 4th and final act, which locks the ending of the game behind a monotonous and mindless grind
A baffling decision that can only be explained by the developer/publisher trying to strongarm you into buying their expensive XP boosts and Orc followers in order to get closure for the story
SHAME

												I'll keep my review simple
Also watch out for the spoilers(I rate this games features with plus and minus, 3 being the best/worst rating
)Pros:	++ ACT I & ACT II
+ 1 versus 1 combat is a pleasure, shame, because it doesn't happen too often
+++ Improved Nemesis system
++ Fortresses
(unlocks at ACT II)+++ Pit Fights; There you order your followers to kill other orc captains in order to level up your fighter/follower
(you also receive gear by winning fights)Really positive thing for this game, hope they would've focus more on this
Like adding an online feature (like 1v1 other players)or customization for AI behaviour
 (as watching these fights gets quite irritating after dozen of pit fights -- because of the Artificial Intelligence; turns out its horrendous)
++ Atmosphere and collectibles
++ SoundtrackCons:-- Feels like they rushed ACT III & IV (no real story behind these acts) and left the game without proper ending or late game grind
 If the continuous sieges at ACT IV were intented as late game grind -- they have failed big time (besides min-maxing your fortresses)- Battling amidst multiple enemies can be/is frustrating when you try to focus your single target attacks to single enemy
(due to poor camera locking/focusing)- Climbing could be much more fluent, as it feels really clunky
- Spending long time listening to every new orc captain tell their mocks, threats and what-not -- as you can't skip it, well it starts to irritate slowly later on
-- Also turns out if you fight in Online Conquest your followers are gone for good if they die,don't do the same mistake as I did; if you can't afford to lose the followers, don't fight
*edit* Seems you lose them in *RANKED* Conquest, unranked doesn't count
--- Fortress sieges are real lackluster because the template is always the same: Capture few points (like Domination from CoD), kill few warchiefs and go slay the Overlord 1 v 1 -- then claim the fortress for yourself
Spoiler: it gets boring real quick
Not to talk about the defending of fortresses: enemy AI is really terrible, in the end you may end up hunting some enemy warchief who is idling next to a wall doing nothing
(happens quite often)Also you are unable to command your forces, they are at the mercy of a terrible AI -- too bad
-- Hoped it would have more regions than just these 5, also Minas Morgul isn't really active region in late game that is
Neutral:I wish the skill tree would've had more in-depth mechanics, but as it turned out it has very little to tell and feels hollow,however gearing in this game covers for this flaw by a little bit
Loot Boxes seems interesting but the variety of different loot boxes is just too slim to make me interested in
(no cosmetics, nothing, just few different follower boxes, hope they do something about this)Also, as an AAA game I would've expected far more content, it feels like a lot at start, but later on you suddenly realize how little this game has to offer



Overall for such game 60 dollars is too much I fear,there could've been so much more content and potential for this game,but they chose otherwise for some reason
I guess upcoming DLC's could cover for this flaw,until then I suggest waiting for sale
I'd give it a firm 7/10*edit*Some of you asked why I didn't give this game thumbs up;well I don't suggest you to buy this game for 60USD,as it doesn't offer enough content for the price;Story is short and leaves you graving for more,and the few side storylines it has to offer doesn't fill up the gap
Also I feel this game doesn't have real replayability -besides trying to beat it in Nemesis difficulty
If you feel you don't mind paying 60 USD for +40 hours of contentwith poor late game - go for it
My advice is to wait for GOTY or sale

 You feel an evil presence watching you


This is the sort of game that you boot up thinking you'll spend an hour or two on, only to one day wake up face down on your keyboard surrounded by bottles and plates wondering where the past 3 weeks went
100 hours in and I've still not defeated the current 'final' boss, something that's a mixture of the games' excellent difficulty curve, and a melancholy realisation that once I defeat him, my time with the game will naturally come to an end
Primarily, Terraria is a sandbox game
You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instruction, eventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the night, discover some form of corruption eating away at the world, encounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies
Despite all this, you are given little direction, these are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wish, encountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace
Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earlier, meaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle
Although traditional RPG elements are largely absent, a discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeated, meaning if you don't progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesn't become more difficult
In fact, the first boss doesn't spawn until you're suitably equipped with armour and health
My hours in the game are split roughly equally between single and multiplayer
Single player stands up on its own perfectly fine, but in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bosses, as the feeling of reaching new goals is shared, and the ammount of 'grinding' for materials is spread across multiple people
It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrack, as if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expected
Enemy design is exciting and unique, with floating eyes, possessed suits of armour, giant robotic worms, and a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances
That being said, whoever on the design team is responsible for 'hellbats' has earned a special sort of hatred from myself


All in all Terraria is an amazing experience from beginning to end, its tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its exploration, and fearful excitement at its combat
It's a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories I've made, and to forge new ones
It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubt, these hours I have spent were not wasted
I heartily recommend that you purchase this game
 Fortune and glory kid

												Honestly, I don't know why Terraria has so many haters
This game literally has everything
Fun to play, tons of things to do, bosses to kill, ofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friends, items to farm, a lot of stuff and decorations to build with, not to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the game, you can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new features, items, ect 


 When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it
That's just how the game works
Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting day, but it's also the perfect entertainment for your free time
10/10

												You can be a werewolf riding a unicorn while shooting rainbows from a gun
You can build teleporters, find a hair dresser in a spider cavern, and get a sword that shoots cats
You can take on the lord of the moon using a yoyo, summon a sharknado minion that shoots sharks at your enemies, and find sky temples where air wyverns spawn
You can buy a music box from a wizard and go record the music that you like the most so you can have it playing in your base whenever you want, and then you can go build a castle made entirely out of white marble
It would seem the only thing Minecraft has over this game is 1 dimension
Trust me, once you get used to it and start learning about the game, Terraria is simply one of the most satisfying sandbox experiences out there
It may sound rude, but compared to this, Minecraft just has no imagination

UPDATED EDIT 7/6/2015: With the release of Update 1
3, Terraria has become three hundred times better
Update 1
3 adds in loads of new items, monsters, bosses, events, and more
The new bosses are a really big challenge and very cleverly done
The addition of achievements is addicting to any player who loves to hunt achievements, like myself
Including the new gamemode known as "Expert Mode" which is basically like turning the difficulty up to 'brutal'
Lots of other changes as well, like new textures and sounds, and the new addition of world stats to keep track of how many of each type of monster you kill (Which now rewards you with banners)
How I Found Out About "Terraria"I found out about Terraria the same way I use to always find games, YouTube
I randomly came across a video called "Terraria"
I took a look, and instantly fell in love with what I saw, and knew I had to have the game for myself
It looked like a great combination of gerne' that I love to bits
Being a Minecraft fan since the beggining of Alpha, I knew I MUST have it
Unfair First ImpressionsWhen ever you ask someone about Terraria, read a review, or watch a video, 95% of the time you hear "Minecraft clone" or "2D Minecraft"
Which is incorrect on so many levels
If you have heard this many times, and are thinking twice about actually playing Terraria, please read on as it is nothing like Minecraft
Review Of Terraria Terraria is a very unique game for what it does
There have been games like it in the past, but the amount of content and play ability is beyond anything I've ever seen before
Terraria is a sandbox, RPG, action, etc
2D game
It does it's thing very well
I haven't noticed any UI bugs, or ones that I have, are fixed almost instantly after the patch is released
The gameplay it provides is not only smooth, it is addicting and fun
The combat system in the game is perfect for me, and a lot of others
There are so many enemy types in this game that are not copy paste, each one does their own thing and has their own weaknesses & strength's Example on the kind of enemies you could come across
Normal walking/running enemies, that have a soul objective to charge you until death
These may include enemies like the zombie or skeleton
As there are other enemies who will do the same thing, but in a different way (So not everything is copy/paste
)
Like the slime enemy type, which come in many varieties, which will bounce towards you
Or the spider enemy type, which will walk on the ground, but can also climb on the walls to get to you quicker
Just to name a few
"Well, how do I defend myself against these enemies?"Good question
Let's get that
Items & FurnitureThis is where Terraria gets big
Even though the world's are limited, they provide so much that you could spend 800 hours of game time on a single small world and still have many things to do
In the world of Terraria, there are alternate versions of almost everything
What I mean by this is, each world you have will not be the same
For example, there is a 50/50 chance when loading a world to have the default version of something, or the alternate
Such as the music that plays, there are different tracks for the same biomes, just depends on what random one you got
Or for textures on things like, grass, and trees
Also things like ore, in a default world you would have Copper as your basic ore, but in an alternate world, you'd have Tin as your basic ore
What this does is really expands the play time someone can spend in Terraria
Allowing a single person to play the game over and over, and never have the same experience
Below the surface are loads of blocks, dirts, ores, and more
Ore like Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, Silver, Platinum, Gold, Cobalt, etc
And blocks like normal dirt, clay, stone, mud, cobwebs, and so many more
You need these ores to make your weapons and armor
You can find treasure deep underground, that holds many valuable things
You can increase your maximum health by finding Life Crystals underground
The weapon range in this game is massive
You even have magic weapons, like spell books, and mana weapons
There are also bows, swords, pickaxes, axes, guns, lazers, cannons, familiars, and so much more
I won't get into to much detail here, but the amount of content in this game is massive, and it's still being updated
Sure, Terraria has been through some rough times with updates, but when it gets an update, the update is full of new things and changes
Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating)Overall, Terraria is a great game that you can spend hours of time in, and still be having fun in many years to come
It's a steal for the price of $9
99, and especially when there is a sale that lowers the game to $2
00 or less
This game is definitely a choice for sandbox gamers looking for an easy to slip into, addicting experience
Pro's:+Loads of content for hours of game time
+Great combat system
+Smooth gameplay, that's easy to slip into
+Provides a good challenge
+Fun and creative boss battles
+Amazing side events that you cannot resist
+Achievements are addicting to those achievement hunters
+Expert & Hardcore modes add hundreds more hours of gameplay and possibility
Con's:-No infinite world option
(Doesn't drop overall score - But can be annoying to some players)-No easy way to edit worlds before creation (Like choosing whether to have Crimson or Corruption)Overall Rating: Is about a 14

I have not been able to find the time or energy to want to update this whole thing
Anyways, carry on!So, let's do this review

I prefer Minecraft for the building and the survival
Terraria has a good array of things you can use to build but I like to use Minecraft because of the complexity of machinery you can make using all the complicated gizmos and gadgets in it
As for survival, it's exceptionally fun in Terraria but I like it in Minecraft as well due to the sheer size and randomness of a world
In Terraria everything is more or less always the same; corruption/crimson, hell, space, etc
but in Minecraft there are so many more places to choose from! But all the same, Terraria can be fun too
So, opinions aside, due to our comparisons


TERRARIA WINS!


 


right? You see, it isn't about who has more of what
It's about the way to play
The way to enjoy it
You enjoy building, being creative, making pixel art? Play Minecraft, it's the perfect game for you
Don't have much taste for being a super builder, but like adventuring, fighting, bosses, etcetera? Play Terraria

**NOTE: This review will constantly update to accomadate any new changes in my opinion, updates, etc
**INTRODUCTIONStardew Valley
I've heard a lot of things about this game
A lot of extremely positive things
And I was doubtful
Was Stardew Valley really that good? I was afraid that people were just giving it attention because they didn't actually know what a good game was
And as insulting as it may sound, in my defense, uhhm



Before buying the game I hadn't really seen what it looked like, or knew what it was about
I just knew that it was published by the same company, Chucklefish, that had developed Starbound
I had loved Starbound

So I was playing completely spoiler free
Haven't watched any videos, no tips & tricks, just the information of a billion recommended reviews stuffed into my head
So I bought Stardew Valley, and had pretty high expectations
If a game received THAT much popularity, it should be seriously good, right?WHAT STARDEW VALLEY ISPlop
Into the world of Stardew Valley
You completely start from the bottom, trailing after a tragedy and responsibility that's struck
A farm, barely any money, and the mystery of a town left in your hands
Whew
That's really a lot when you think about it
Boy, did I NOT know what I was getting myself into
At first,  it was kind of boring
And any new game you buy will always be like that
The beginning's all new and immersive, and the middle


kind of leaves you stuck
And that's one of the most challenging parts for a lot of people: getting through that middle
When you begin, you spot all the challenges you'll face, which is daunting, because you can instantly tell: you're going to have to freaking work hard to be a master at this game
The thing with Stardew Valley, It's all about exploration and management
Discovering and figuring out secrets and a beautiful story was amazing
Creative mechanics and powerful creativity had combined to produce a fabulous well-formed game that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth, and I'm going to tell you right now


it's totally addicting
I bought the game a few days ago, and literally have played it all day since
I've NEVER done that with a game before
I found myself as a kid in a candy shop, gaping at all the different flavors, and being able to savor them all
And now, in Year 3 of the game

I still have a lot more to discover
The creator, ConcernedApe, was brilliant when coding this game
He created all the aspects of Stardew Valley, and it took him ONLY four years
How? I've seen games that took ten years to develop


and they still had less than Stardew Valley
(Thank you, commenters!)PLAYINGCompared to others, I've only played around 80 hours of the game thus far
Buy Stardew Valley
You really won't regret it
This game is beautiful
The music is whimsically lifting, and the soundtrack is wonderful
It's a work of art
You will find yourself falling in love with the characters, and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people, and who changes everyone for the better
Let me tell you this right now: the game rewards for the hard-working
And you might be thinking: "what in the world do I mean by that?"I literally mean what I say
Stardew Valley is a game where you really have to manage things, yet, it allows you to explore the whole art of it
Work hard as you play the game, and there are sweet rewards
And I'm talking about rewards sweeter than all the candy in that candy shop
Here's the thing: you can take two routes with Stardew Valley
You can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game, or you can immerse yourself in exploring the town and what the game has to offer, but with also missing the point that Stardew is a management farming game
Or, you can successfully find the balance between both
But how?Stardew Valley allows you to store multiple accounts, which is fantastic
I recommend exploring with your first account, and learning the ropes
You seriously won't know anything yet, and will be like "OMFG" when you figure out there's a way that makes things one hundred times easier
After that, create a second account, and start figuring out farm management and what the game has to offer
I thought I was pretty boss with the second account, but I realized I could get a whole lot more with a third account since I now knew shortcuts and everything
So I created a third account, and successfully balanced management and exploration
Now I'm left in a spot where I can successfully thrive, and only continue to grow
THE PROS- Enchanting music that sings as you play- A simple yet fun art design that you can't help but fall in love with- Characters whom capture your heart- A shambled town that begins to thrive- Hidden secrets that you can't help but want to keep discovering- Amazing challenges that leave you wanting more- The awe of wandering through an amazingly formed game- Brilliant originality, which is incredibly difficult to find- A storyline that changes your perspective beautifully- Lots of fun, and I mean lots
- Mods created by the community to make your game more fun and immersive- however, I play without mods
THE CONS- As I said, the game rewards you for hard work
But only for hard work
It can be a grueling process, but it is extremely profitable
Those who don't like putting effort into a game won't enjoy Stardew Valley as much as other games
- Time
Stardew Valley takes a lot of time to play through
It's a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on
- Repetitive
The game can be grueling
To reach certain goals you have to go through processes that you will SERIOUSLY hate
But, in the end, it's definitely worth the labor
PLACES TO IMPROVE**NOTE: Some of these "improvements" may have spoilers, however, none of them reveal any actual information about the game and what happens, as it is common knowledge and will really not spoil anything
This category talks about bugs and things that need to be fixed
So if you haven't bought Stardew Valley, it's not too concerning, but you may read it if you wish
- According to MasterBlade's review, there was a crash that deleted all his/her's progress of 61 hours
I haven't come across this problem, yet
- In the Egg Festival during the Egg Hunt, there is an egg in the right corner of a bush next to Mayor Lewis' house
When you try to click on the egg, Jas' dialogue pops up, even though she has already walked off-screen
I find this annoying, as the triggered text prevents you from moving, and thus, lose the Egg Hunt
(I lost once because of that
Not a big deal, but it may be for new players
)- In the Egg Festival there is also an out-of-bounds glitch
If you go to the top area (where you would walk to the Community Center) and walk up to the very top barrier (to where you can't walk forward anymore)
Then, go left, and you're out-of-bounds!WHY IT'S JUST STELLAR Stardew Valley offers a lot of things, and has changed the lives of many people
Perhaps in peace, wonder, open-mindedness, the game gives a lot
But I have one thing that's been bothering me for a long time


How in the damn world did one single person spit out a freaking awesome game?Even though it's a farming game, which is commonly found everywhere, it's original with its own spins
It's extremely difficult to find a game that has such a captivating message that's been developed so well
Stardew Valley is a lot of fun and awe, and it really draws a blank in your mind
Buy Stardew Valley
At first, it might seem boring


but keep playing
Trust me, the candies are still sweet
And they really only get sweeter

												This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years
I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory
I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA
400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game
Farming
The farming is fantastic
It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy
Being able to design your farm any way you want it


yes please
Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold


it's so enjoyable and addictive
Fishing
The fishing is outstanding
From playing WoW and Runescape

or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun
At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time
Mining and combat
Mining and combat is incredible
Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard
(Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder
) Social
Social interactions are great
Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them

what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice
Main story
The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you "complete" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! Yes, I was a tester for the game
Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours
It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this
However you have to remember, I was a tester
I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes
I still love this game
I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them
And that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too
ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game
And that's true
The experience that you have with this game IS amazing
Minutes playing turn into hours
Hours turn into "oh no it's time to sleep"
You will forget about time
You will forget about sleep
You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back
So yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to "escape" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016

												I'm genuinely impressed an indie game of this scale made by one guy isn't stuck in an eternal early access, but is instead provided as the full package right off the bat
This is how it was done a decade ago, and this is how it should still be done
			
Posted: 29 September, 2016
												Can I just say thankyou to the developer of this game I suffer with depression and stardew valley gives me a reason to do somethng other than sleep it makes me feel like I have an impact of peoples lives (even if its only in game people)
I have played 200+ hours playing this game that's 200 hours distracted from my real life problems
I have oped(SP) in to be a beta tester, this is the first game I've ever done this with thanks to the developer for saying how to do that I really admire him for creating such a good game and hope he goes far in his career and he never loses the magic, Thankyou

												I spent three years building up hype, and I was still blown away
If you enjoyed Harvest Moon, Rune Factory or Animal Crossing - then get this
It captures all the same things that made those games great, and it's the perfect game to play either casually or seriously
There are so many different ways to earn money and they're all developed and fun, the hardest part is choosing which one to spend your time doing
The progression curve in the game is fantastic too
Every day you'll feel like you're making progress but there's still always something to work towards and you won't 'beat it' after a couple of hours earning as much money as possible, as there's always something to spend your money on
Even after 20 hours of playing, I feel like I'm nowhere near the endgame, and I could easily see myself playing through again and doing things differently
I'm even doing a playthrough on YouTube and the progress feels dramatically different even in its early stages
I'm easily disappointed by games, so you can imagine my surprise when I was so impressed by a game made by one person
Congratulations, ConcernedApe, you've made one of the best games I've ever played
			
Posted: 8 March, 2016
 Overview  Stardew Valley is a game that borrows heavily from similar titles in the Harvest Moon series
You start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables
The game is simple in its understanding: build a farm, make profits, live your life
What the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered
You're left with the freedom to explore the town, its residence, mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time
Sure, there are events to attend, festivals to see, men/women to romance and marry, kids to have, buildings to construct, fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay (Dragon Warrior, anyone?), but how and when you do those things is up to you
In essence, the game offers you very similar things to do as a Harvest Moon game does: Build and upgrade your farm, plant crops, upgrade tools, mine in the never-ending dungeon for precious ore, go fishing, romance and get married


etc
While some of your old favorites are back, new aspects have been introduced as well, but I won't spoil those in this review
Let's just say there's a nice story that evolves over time
The freedom to do as you please is what makes this game, and Harvest Moon in general, so enjoyable
It's a chance to mellow out, play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer
What Stardew Valley does, it does right
It's charming, cute and feels rewarding, even when all you're doing is cuttings weeds
It doesn't pull any punches or try to be something its not; the developer had a goal in mind and Stardew Valley is a reflection of just that
You can feel the effort, the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years
Stardew Valley is a gem and worth looking at
If you loved Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley
To date, Stardew Valley is a single player game, though the developer as mentioned some form of co-op or multiplayer availability in the future
Pros   Character Customization - Always good, always wanted
 Visuals - In the style of the SNES
They're colorful detailed and a delight
Game Pace - Fast, slow, or somewhere in the middle
It's your call to make
Content - There is a lot more to do than I first imagined
There are many hidden layers inside the game as you progress the storyline
 Cons    Combat - It's a tad basic since that isn't the core of the gameplay
A single hack/n slash mechanic Citizens - I'd love to see more citizens (even temporary ones during the year) come and go to make the town feel more "alive"Overall, Stardew Valley is a pleasure
I haven't put a ton of time into it (yet), but I easily see that happening
It's fun, lighthearted and addictive
As I said earlier in this review, if you've ever played Harvest Moon, you'll enjoy Stardew Valley
It's worth checking out and I highly recommend it
This will easily become one of my most played games on my list
You won't be disappointed, so check it out!

												Ok so far from my game this is what I got:> farming for first week> mayor tells me to socialize with the townfolk> decide to talk to random people> lots of talking> finally think i met everyone> try to interact with trashcan> find a salad in trash, untouched> girl sees me digging in trash> girl gets grossed out from me digging in the trash> get mad, decide to follow her> catch her walking towards lake> turns out shes pretty> want to know how to marry her> find out that i can gift people> dont know what to gift> remembered i had salad from the trash that she saw me grab> give salad to her> she loves it> advance a year or two later> me and girl are marriedI don't understand women, both in this game and in real life
10/10 would dig in trash again

												I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories
She would always buy me the new one for Christmas, and we would play it all day, filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry
Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum
Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed
It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work
Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created
I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game
I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten
			
Posted: 19 June
												There is a character in this game that is suffering from depression, it has helped me see my own illness and I have learned to deal with it in a much healthier way soley because of how my character interacts and helps them
The characters in this game are beautiful, and not just in their artwork
Their stories and the cutscenes have drawn me in more than just a regular farming game
I was truely excited to marry Leah and nervous that she would turn me down (Even though she was at 10 hearts and I knew she wouldn't)
 I have spent 80 hours in this game so far and I am in spring of year 3 waiting on my first child
This game has kept my attention and I am looking forward to many more hours
I give this game 10/10 rating
			
Posted: 28 May
												This game made me so miserable 
The writing can be as funny as heartbreaking The Voice acting is one of the greatest i've ever heard A lot of the time , the many side quest were as awesome or even better than the main story (That is already amazing )Pro : The whole game Con : Absolutely nothing It's one of the greatest gaming experience I've ever had in my 24 years on this earth

												I am 75 years old and really enjoyed this game
In this game I could do all the things I was once able to do but in my twilight years can no longer do
There should be more games like this for us seniors
The graphics were exellent
I very much dislike and dismiss the cartoon type graphics in most other games
The visual aspects of the game were superb, realistic and sometimes even breathtaking
The attention given to detail needs to be congratulated
The storyline was only just satisfactory but this was complemented by all the interesting charecters involved
Please continue to amaze us gamers with your excellent work

												The best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and second part of The Witcher
You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better
- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,- Story, which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something what makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which makes from every single battle - an unforgettable memory,- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally something dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his misery
The Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions)
Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them
All in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade)

Ignore me having 8 hours on this account, I finished the game twice and have 100+ hours on this game
QualityRatingReasonPerformance8
5/10You need a great PC to be able to run this game at maxed graphics, I got a steady 60 FPS on all ultra settings, with the occasional drop in the capital
Controls9/10Controls using a keyboard and mouse is weird, I had to get used to it
Once you've learned the controls it feels natural though, it's not like there's any inconvenient keymapping
I still recommend using a controller since it's a hell of a lot easier
(I didn't use a controller since I'm not comfortable with it, it was still fine for me)
Ultility7/10Playable only on Windows
GameplayRatingReasonChallenge9
5/10If you play this game on easy, it's a walk in the park, you destroy everything you see, and Geralt is some sort of God who almost can't be killed
On Death March however, everything else is a god and it's so hard to get further in the game
I found this the most fun experience, for a reference; On Death March enemies have 80% more health and do 230% more damage, also you only gain 80% experience from everything whilst on this difficulty
Content10/10A big open world, with a lot of things to do, hours upon hours of content after you've finished the main story
Side quests, collectibles, bounties, amazing DLC (some free some paid for)
One of the few developers that give free DLC that aren't just reskins or anything, but actual quests
Big + on CD PROJEKT RED for this Story10/10I compare stories like this with other amazing storylines like The Last Of Us, it doesn't even get close to how good the story of The Witcher is
Such an indept story, amazing eye for detail, and I really got involved in the characters
Diversity10/10The main story gives you a whole lot to do, exploring the entire world, even going back to Kaer Morhen
Whilst all the side activities give you even more to do (as I've said with content) all the bounties, collectibles, quests for armour, quests to help strangers, ''random'' events and DLC, you'll be busy for quite some time
DesignRatingReasonGraphics10/10The graphics are insane, I can't describe how good like they are, I suggest you search for some video's just reviewing the graphics if you really want to get an indept view of it, all I can say is that this game will be pleasant to watch / play
Sound10/10Amazing voice acting, amazing music, amazing ambient sounds
Everything is just amazing really
Great music whilst in combat as well, makes me want to keep dodging the enemy so the music doesn't stop, it really puts you in the right mood for this game
Mapping9
9/10I wish I could give this a 10, but it's really hard to call something perfect, but there's always little flaws with something like mapping, if I really wanted to start nit picking on them
But the world of Witcher is amazing, it feels alive and even though it's a really big world, there's little details everywhere
Interface10/10The interface is solid, it looks great, and does what it's suppose to
Not really anything else to add there
Final Score: 10/10Don't let the score fool you, it's not perfect, nothing is
Yet this game is at the same time
I love it, 99% of the people who played it love it
Do you like killing monsters, a medieval setting, a great story line, or just a good looking game? You'll definetly love it

												So we got a game in 2015, the complaint of which for many people was overwhelming contentWe got a DLC for the game in 2015 which was better than all the games in the yearWe got a DLC for the game in 2016 which was better and had more content than most games in the yearThe base game and DLC together costed less than most AAA games of the yearA game that had an artistic vision, a game that wanted to push boundaries in terms of narrative and choice/consequence based decision making in a living and breathing open world, with characters that are memorable and relatable
A game whose developers knew what gamers wanted
WItcher 3 has launched CDPR into the league of great developers like Looking Glass, Rockstar, Valve, old-Bioware etc




My only complain with this game is that it made other modern games feel obsolete
This is the game of the generation by such a huge margin, it's not even funny

'There's nothing behind me
I'm a Witcher, I'd have heard it
Just like I can hear your heart
Which is pounding


like a liar's
'Geralt of Rivia__________________________________________Introduction'The Witcher III: Wild Hunt‘ has won so many awards and has been praised by so many people that it’s kind of impossible to miss or ignore this game
It’s the third part in the videogame series based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski and represents the end of the famous videogame trilogy of Geralt of Rivia, a
k
a the White Wolf or the Butcher of Blaviken
To cut a long story short: The game lived up to every expectation I had and exceeded them with ease
Even the games‘ minigames are better than many full-price titles – yeah exactly, I’m talking about you Gwent, you awful little drug that I can’t get enough of…The main story connects to the events of the second Witcher game 'Assassins of Kings‘ and brings the overall story started in the first part to an end
Witchers are infamous monster hunters, magically improved mutants that are simultanesously feared and needed in a world threatened by dark creatures, evil spirits and living nightmares
Geralt of Rivia is a famous specimen of this kind and thought for a long time that his former friend and love, the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg, was already dead
However during the recent events in Loc Muinne he learned that this was not the entire truth and so he decides to start a new journey to finally find answers to his questions
A huge world with fascinating lore and characters awaits the White Wolf - the sheer quantity of places you can visit, persons you can talk to and monsters that have to be slain would be enough to  fit in several other games
This world is not only packed with interesting stories, dialogues, quests, fearsome monsters and an insane amount of details behind every corner, moreover it is convincing and far away from all the happy fantasy clichés you've already seen a hundred times
There is neither black nor white, just many shades of grey
Elves are neither the glorious archers nor the kind tree people, humans not the friendly guys that accept every race the same and dwarfes are no gentle stone-loving miners
In this world you have to make choices that you won’t like and to live with the consequences
Morally ambiguous is the description you’re looking for
__________________________________________Graphics and AudioRegarding the technical aspects this game conquers Mount Olympus easily (despite the much complained 'technical downgrade‘) as it is one of the most beautiful RPGs I’ve ever seen, with amazing sunsets/sunrises, spooky nights and gorgeous views over detailled landscapes full of nature and terror - this game is definitely gorgeous
You want to see some examples? Let me show you some screenshots taken from the game using only the additional E3FX and the free camera from the console:http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=639380403http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=657195325http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=626638385In addition to the stunning visuals there is also brilliant music and fantastic voice acting that will catch you during dialogues or pumps you up during the fights
Together with the exquisite characters, the superb dialogues and all the deep little stories the game suceeds even more in creating a credible fantasy world
__________________________________________ConsSo now there's the question: Are there negative points at all? Yeah some minor flaws: Talking to every person and looting every stash is kind of unsatisfying as there is no wide variety of things that you may accomplish or find this way, so after some time you will visit mostly the important places and persons while ignoring the rest
Furthermore if everything else may be a 10/10 for me, the fighting mechanic is not as fantastic as the rest
It has definitely improved since the second part but it’s still somewhat 'special' as it lacks unique aspects, a good feedback for the hits and suffers every now and then from targeting problems, camera angles, weird controls or some questionable hitboxes
That now may sound worse than it actually is - from my point of view it's 'still' an 8 out of 10
In addition I encountered some small visual glitches and sound errors during cutscenes but they were so small and disappeared after reloading, so I don’t even care about this at all
Compared to the games‘ size and content there are nearly no problems at all and everything runs more than just smoothly for me
To be honest there is only only real downside that I have with the game: My journey with Geralt will end some day and it set new standards regarding characters, lore and dialogues that future RPGs have to be compared with - and this will be a tough struggle for many of them
__________________________________________ConclusionSo in the end, would I recommend the game? Yes – and no
It’s a fantastic RPG with an amazing amount of content, exquisite characters, dialogues and interesting stories, so I’d recommend it for everyone who has even the slightest positive attitude towards RPGs or the fantasy genre in general
However at the same time I wouldn’t recommend the game for anyone who has only little time to spare, doesn’t want to be immersed in a massive world full of lore or just wants to rush the story - this game needs time
A lot of time
However it pays off by providing a brilliant experience that will take you on a journey that you’ll never regret or forget


…or to be more precise let's call it 'a journey you’d like to forget'
Just to experience this masterpiece again from the start and to get these great feelings again (damn I even ignored the fast-travel option and turned off the minimap and the quest hints willingly for many hours (I’ve been lost so many times) to enjoy the world and the quests even longer)
I rate it gladly 9
5 out of 10 points

												I love this game, it's the only one I have played this much
It has a touching story although it starts off really slowly in the beginning, being mostly fetch quests and bringing you around in all the areas to unlock dungeons for your MSQ
But later the Heavensward story and especially the Stormblood story are really goddamn touching
I started out with a friend of mine a year ago
He started playing in 2010 when it first released and was an utter disaster
but now, this game is indeed one of the best MMO's out there
I don't mind paying 35 euros to play for 3 months
And now after playing for a year myself i became a mentor
Helping people who are just starting out in the game
And don't hate on all mentors
Some do it for the crown, but most still do it to help other
Now for the gameplay, it starts off slow with maybe like 1 to 10 skills total before you unlock the job for your class
 But after a while hotbars tend to fill up
Graphics are good, even though I have to put them lower because of my older laptop (AMD Radeon HD 7600 graphics card)
But the game still looks surprisingly nice
And lastly apart from alot of fetch quests you just have to watch out for RMT (Real Money Trading) bots in the 3 main cities
Just report them and be on with your day
Since if you do buy gil, the ingame currency from those sites you can get banned

												The premier MMORPG on the market right now
Even though the quest design is a fairly rote affair, the level of polish is top-notch, and immediately evident in the graphics, gameplay, and music
The community is mostly friendly to new players, and the old content is completely doable even years later, ensuring you sink hours into this game before even thinking about the first expansion

												So I have bought this game on 05/25/17 and have been only playing this game till 06/04/2017 with an accumulate of 139 hours
Update: 06/22/2017 accumulated about 235 hours and I have payed a month of my Subscription :)
I am reupdating this for the Summer Sale for people who want to try this game and also for the StormBlood DLC update
Positive:-Noob Friendly-Tons of content (heavensword content might be needed if u want to max to 60)-Chocobo-The godlike music-Multiple classes to choose from
-The community seems better than most MMO'S that I have played
-New DLC for more new content
-Heavily Story relient
Most mmos have faied to make a decent story line but this game manged to pull it off
-Fun with friends
-Options to change your HUD settings
-Dungeons/Trials/Raids
Probably the best thing in this MMO with each bosses being unique and it does require everyone to cooperate
Update: Graphics: Even with a Low end PC you can still run this game smoothly
For Medium-High End PC the game looks gorgeous from Cutscenes to the most simplest flower it looks amazing
Free Companies: Aka guilds- If you can find a dedicated Company you can obtain tons of benefits and some can help you run dungeons
(Just joined one so not much info there)Enternal Bondings:  So there is something called the enternal bonding (sorry if I am saying it wrong)
Which are marriages
With an actual Wedding
Why not lol
Not fully detailed about this but I find it kinda suprising to have in an MMO bc this is the first I have heard about in an MMO
Fates: Open World Events that can award you EXP if you can find a good amount of people to run with
(Gotten popular since a StormBlood Update)]-Tons of Mini games that can let you obtain costumes/mounts and cards for tripletriad(Similar to Gwent)Gear: Pretty easy to obtain high end gear that can be obtained from Raids and other methods
Also Relic/Anima Weapons (aka legendary weapons) for a specified class that could take you probably days to weeks to obtain the highest stat
(Looks pretty cool)Classes: Not sure if I was specific with classes in this game, You will have a single character with multiple classes to change into
There are 9 DPS,,3 Tanks,3Healers, 7 Crafters, and a class to obtain ores/fishing
This helps prevent anylack of endgame content
And they can be all maxed out to lv 70
Negative:- Past 50+ the story just feels somewhat dreadfully long, It's mostly for you to unlock more dungeons and trials (bosses), But the story starts to take a much better turn after 
-Targeting system when your in a 24 vs 24 vs 24 PvP Match
(still figuring out how to fix/improve on that) update:  Targeting is difficult because being able to just find the target you want to click will end up clicking your own teamate
Even the random targeting system is random sometimes not sure how it works
(still figuring it out)
Update: Ok its pretty difficult for me to even find any negatives in this game
It doesn't mean its flawless
-lv 1-40: This could drop off alot of people playing this game from probably the story or the amount of content unavailable until you reach lv 50
Neutral:-Monthly Payment: Even I didn't know about this but, It is possible to pay your monthly subscription with Steam Credits
And yes you can pay through steam if you have purchased the game from steam and its connected to your final fantasy account
There is constant update and content just given through this game so I can see why its monthly and I can say its worth it
-Servers, I don't really have any problem with this but if your in an empty server and your asking for help, it might be difficult for you
So its better to do some research
You will que up with other people in different servers if your doing dungeons or any other instances
Also a paywall if your planning to transfer servers with your character
-Leveling: Took me about maybe 50-70 hour just to max out 1 of my classes to lv 50 then an additional 12-18 hours to max out to 60
I don't have any problems with this but sometimes I felt that the gap between 50-60 just makes you want to murder your own chocobo
But its generally worth it if you reach end game
-The story: This is probably the most important
The story took me about approximetly 2-4 days just from the standard edition
I haven't finished Heavensward and that took me about another 2-3 days just to finish 60%
The point being is that YOU will feel rushed and proably feel like skipping cutscenes,texts and other moments in the story
The cutscenes are amazing and the story is good but It felt like the mistake being is that I rushed it just to reach end game
The story could probably take you a month or 2 if your mostly on and half the time
Which is good
Update:-Queue times: This just happened at the Launch of stormblood probably because the amount of Players switching from Tank to DPS
Of crouse it isn't an issue if you are either a healer/tank or if your group at least one of the 2
The Queue times could sometimes average around 20-30 minutes
(Square Enix might plan to fix this issue so this might not be an issue later on
)-Pricing: Not going too complain but for most people they might be stingy about this, If your planning to buy this game I would extremely suggest you to get the complete edition for the standard and stormblood(comes with heavensward) that will be about 55-60$
Reason is because if you were to buy this game individually (like I did) your going to pay more
Free trial: I want to suggest you to play on the free trial before starting this off but it feels like its going to be difficult to get into until you reach the first dungeon trial at 20
I want people more people to play this game but some of my friends dropped from the free  trial probably because they didn't have any dedicated commitment from leveling 1-19
The Free Trial is capped at lv 30 but I get the feeling you still won't be able to experience all the features in this game
But you can max out to 30 before purchasing the game
Updated:I am probably missing out more information about this game than I am right now but majority of it is positive
This game is highly underated and I wish that people would at least try the game at see the amount of potential this game has
To be honest this game feels like what WoW became popularr when Wrath of the Litch King was released
(Not a hate rant)
This game feels like it has more content than GW2 endgame
Both are amazing MMO's but, Final Fantasy 14 feels like the MMO that I was missing in my life
If Square Enix keeps up the constant updates I am willing to keep playing

												I gave up WoW (or World of Warcraft) For this game
Why? You only need one character to play every class
The classes build off of eachother to add diversity to your play style as well as to upgade into more role focused jobs
You can craft your own gear, you can make your own food and you can play 90% of the game ALL BY YOURSELF! You don't have to be in a guild or part of a click
The people who play this game are shockingly friendly and supportive
Dungeons are part of a finder in game
The story line is epic and the cinematics are breathtakeing
The opening video almost had me in tears just because I knew what was happening without any words
Square has really outdone themselves with this title and I can't wait to see how they wow me with FFXV!Edit: As per a commented question, The sub options come in 30/90/180 day increments and can be set up as recurring (thanks Pasty858)
180 days is roughly $78
Also, anyone who would like to share in the recruit a friend benefits, message me
SO! Its been a while since I've played
after logging over 200 hours that weren't counted on here, and doing everything short of Savage content, I have to say that I never thought I would play a game that would tug my heart strings so much again
But this game
The most recent MSQ line just keeps the punches coming
It was amazing! If you love FF games, you must give this one at least a one month (or 14day) trial period!

9/10 - Would Manderville again
This review was written based on version 3
0Pros:Consistent, large patches about every 3 months
Gorgeous graphics engine
Deep crafting system
Probably the best storytelling in an MMO I've ever seen (but it does take 30+ hour to really get into the meat of it)One of the most friendly gaming communities around
Cross-platform play with the PS3 and PS4, excellent controller support for PC
Possible to play casually and still enjoy/experience the game with hardcore friends
Hildebrand - Game doesn't take itself too seriously and just has fun
Neutral:Game doesn't reinvent the MMO wheel
It is a pretty standard "theme park" MMO
That being said, it is extremely polished and everything in the game is executed very well
Subscription model, I was almost tempted to put this in the Pros column
One of the few games to do this model well in a sea of F2P MMOs
Cons:Tens of hours of monotonous fetch quests sprinkled throughout the game
Usual MMO fare
Long PvP queues, slightly unbalanced
(Not enough people play PvP)Endgame content can be very grindy at times
(Ex: Relic Weapons, and "Run the same 2 dungeons over and over to get currency to buy gear"
)Gil sellers - I realize this happens in pretty much every MMO
This didn't make the list because it happens, it is strictly on the list because of advertising chat spam
On an average day you will see a lot of messages (unless you're like me and are so fed up with it you go /away)
Expect the spam to be cranked up to 11 whenever a large piece of content is released
I really feel SE could implement better countermeasures with respect to advertising
It does seem worse than in many of it's other AAA MMO competitors
On a side note, I'm told the JP servers are practically gil seller free
I've never tested this myself however
Overall, not a huge con, but an annoyance none the less

Posted: 19 January, 2015
												I've never been an MMO player
Briefly played Tera - liked it but found progression slow - and briefly WoW - disliked the combat, just felt like button mashing
I also played Mabinogi for a short while and really disliked the game's mechanics
One day I felt the urge to play one and I knew a friend was planning to start this so I bought it but neither of us started
9 days ago a friend of mine was looking for people who wanted to start and I decided that if it was in my steam list I may as well try it out
I am now 95
9 hours in according to steam and I love it
I've just hit level 50 and got my Paladin armour and I'm still looking at all the content coming up
As I speak server is going down to patch even more content into the game
So here's the detailed review:StoryThe story is a good one as far as MMOs go (based on my limited experience)
I'd equate it to WoW in some ways as FFXIV builds off of an already established lore but is still extremely easy for new players to get into
I don't want to say much about it but Square Enix really put work into making a good story
It teeters a bit at times, especially around the middle (lv30-40 is a bit slow) but it's very enjoyable if you get into it
ClassesCombat classes are fairly traditional: tank, support, ranged DPS and melee DPS
Still within these wider definitions, each individual class is fairly unique
To add to this you are not restricted to the classes that you pick at the beginning of the game
You will unlock the ability to train any and all classses as you wish which allows for a lot of flexibility
But "Oh, the grind ¬¬" you say
Nope, all classes trained beyond the first receive exp gain bonuses which really speeds up the process
This is alongside the quick levelling options which I'll discuss in a later section
There's more though! All combat classses have a progression called a "Job" which is earned by reaching a certain point in the story, getting a class to lv30 and the corresponding second class to lv15, and then finishing the job quest
It's actually really easy to do and it encourages you to try a different role
All combat classes are unique and don't overlap much at all which is great
As for crafting classes, there's a fair few of them and I have limited experience of them right now but crafting itself isn't just sit there and wait for things to appear
There's an active process and is fairly enjoyable
Just like the combat classes, new skills are unlocked and it becomes a sort of strategic minigame
Quick synthesis for bulk items is available as well so you don't have to do it for each item
Still I can see crafting becoming tedious
repetitive and boring at some point but that's no different from any other mmo
Also, unlike the combat classes, the crafting classes aren't really unique
CombatThe combat system is targetted, which honestly I was sceptical about when first going in as I'm not a big fan of targetted combat but it grows on you
This is mostly to do with how the game feels since you really have to think about movement, positioning, skill orders, skill timing etc
from more or less the beginning of the game
This is a big deal and playing the first 20 or so levels in WoW feels boring and just mashing buttons in a certain order
The 2
5sec global cooldown adds to the strategic element of it too
You have more time to think and decide what move would be appropriate, but you also have a longer window to be punished for choosing the wrong skill
I honestly think this is way more fun and interesting compared to other games with a much smaller global cooldown
Another important point is that this game is very controller friendly
It's on the PS3/PS4 with cross platform support so that would be why
I personally play with a controller and it feels very smooth
I don't feel too overwhelmed with skills and I've unlocked all of them for my job with 3 cross skills in use as well (I have 2 full hotbars but it's very easy to switch between them)
It's down to preference in the end but the option is really nice to have
LevellingThere are so many different ways to level it's crazy
Though the main story quest is compulsory, there are loads of side quests available
If you think quests are repetitive you can switch over to doing FATES which are events that spawn that give gil (money) and experience to everyone that completes them based on the level of participation
If that's boring there are many different dungeons to do with solid exp gain on all of them
Duty roullete will give you bonus exp once a day so deffo worth doing that
No? Then you can do levequests which are contracts to do certain things in certain places which you can get by using one of your levequest allowances (which refill regularly)
Levequests are available to crafting classes too and are considered the fastest ways to level them
Still not enough? Then Guildhests might be for you
These are very similar to levequests but you're put into a duty (instance) with a party and asked to do it as a group
There's a daily bonus on guildhest roullete as well so that's good
Also, the first time you do a certain dungeon, levequest or guildhest you'll be granted bonus exp which is always a definite plus
Still too slow? Not enough content? Too repetitive? Well if you're that hard to please then I guess I should tell you that there are these things called logs which grant bonus exp for doing certain things
A hunting log will ask you to kill x number of y, while a crafting log will give you the list of everything you can craft
The king of all these is the challenge log which refreshes weekly and gives you a lot of exp for completing tasks like "complete 3 dungeons" or "complete 5 levequests"
Honestly there are so many different ways to level that players can pick something that suits them and though some can get repetitive they're fun for the most part
EndgameYou only need to google the game to see the amount of post lv50 content
The game's been out for about a year and there are things constantly being added
The first expansion is coming out soon so keep an eye out for that
Most people will tell you that lv50 is just the beginning, and they're probably right
I'm only just getting into the endgame and I look forward to everything coming up
PriceWell
This is the one major downside I see to the game
It's very expensive
Though nothing new for an mmo, it is a pretty heavy financial commitment compared to most other steam games out there
Especially considering you can get Tera, Mabinogi, and loads of other mmos for free now
You can buy gametime online from other sellers for a bit cheaper but it's still expensive
I suggest playing the trial to give you a better understanding of whether you'll enjoy it
I highly suggest it and will be playing it, but I can appreciate that a few years ago I could never afford to play a game like this
ConclusionI honestly think this is the first mmo to seriously impress me with its ability to keep you interested
It doesn't overwhelm you, nor does it leave you with nothing to do
Bosses are often really cool and have interesting mechanics, even from an early point in the game
I really do feel that besides the price this game is practically perfect
It's a great game - buy it if you can

												I was a WoW player
I played every expansion, I did HC/Mythic raiding, I spent thousands of hours playing it
If I could go back and get this on launch day instead, I would do it in a heart beat
If you are an MMO players, this  is hands down the best MMO on the market
 I've played every major MMO since Ultima Online back in the 90s
FFXIV has every element you could want in an MMO and executes them extremely well
The class system, all classes being available on a single character, is amazing
No alts, not that you can't have them, you just don't need them
The story is captivating, you actually want to read the quests and see what happens rather than just click through to get the objectives
Speak of quests, there are a ton, even without the myriad of side quests, and only completeing the main story, you can reach level cap on a class
Then roll in dungeons, raids, leves, hunting logs, challenge log, etc etc etc there is never a shortage of things to do, and they have made all of them entertaining
If you like MMOs even a little bit, stop reading and click the buy button
Really, stop
Why are you still reading
Stop it! Go play FFXIV, seriously

												Final Fantasy XIV, the original one, was a mess
The servers were terrible, payments were unfair and confusing, and the game just made it so difficult for you to enjoy
Square Enix realised, "holy hell, this is bad" and revamped the game, leading to the release of A Realm Reborn
And boy did they do good
A Realm Reborn is not only a more polished FF XIV, it is a new game
It offers so much more than the original
Better service, better gameplay, more engrossing quests, everything an MMO can offer is in this game
A Realm Reborn is by far the best Final Fantasy of the last console generation, and it is perhaps the best FF I have ever played
It stays true to it's roots, but still manages to not be a total copy cat of previous FF games
It borrows alot from the orginal series, when Final Fantasy was at it's best, but adds a sense of freshness so that FF new-comers could pick up the game and play it as their first FF and still have a wonderful experience
Detail is where this game excells
The amount of effort into making this as refined as possible is staggering
You could honestly sit at the character creation screen for an hour, picking the tiniest things about your hero
The environments are fantastic, and it's hard to believe that an MMO looks this good
As well as being the best Final Fantasy in years, it is also groundbreaking in the MMO genre
It offers so much to the genre as a whole, it has made a name for it's self as one of the greatest MMOs in recent years
It is addicting
It is enchanting
It is simply bliss
Square Enix have really made me regain my faith in them, and I hope that they let future Final Fantasies learn from A Realm Reborn
I cannot wait until more content is added into the game, and clock in a few more hours
Get yourself this game now, even just for the free trial, it's worth it
Even if you're a hardcore FF fan, or a newcomer looking for a game to start with
This is the one
+ Essentially has it all
Near enough limitless gameplay hours+ Environments look stunning, attention to detail is incredible+ Smooth gameplay, easy to learn mechanics+ Makes great homage to previous Final Fantasy games- A lot of fetch quests- Occasional bug here and there10/10
This is a fantastic game
Get it
Now

												I've been playing Path of Exile since 2011 closed beta and it's remarkable how far the game has come purely from crowd funding
 The passion of the userbase is equally matched by it's developers
 They've shown throughout the years to constantly improve and tweak the game with regularly scheduled content additions
 I still feel I don't know everything there is to know about this game, and that isn't changing any time soon
 Path of Exile is an incredibly complex and rewarding game that is definitely worth your time
Outside of having an absurdly intricate skill tree and a fantastic crafting/currency system,  the other large appeal of this game is the end-game
 Most ARPGs fail to offer incentive to continue to play your character after you've exhausted the content
 Usually this just comes in the form of a easily attainable level cap or grinding the same final zone of the game at length
 Instead, in POE you are given item drop instances, as described by the developers: "Maps can drop as normal, magic, rare or unique with higher rarity Maps yielding more items
Using a Map item opens six portals to the area, which can each only be used once
Like most other items in Path of Exile, Maps have mods that change their risks and rewards
Map mods can affect the size or complexity of the level, monster packs, monster properties or even alter characters while in the level
Players can modify Maps themselves using their currency items
For example, you can use an Orb of Transmutation to turn a normal Map into a magic Map, or use an Orb of Alteration to reroll its mods
"It goes to say that each and every map is a different experience, with room for countless variation in modifiers letting you push the limits of your character
 Not all characters are equal
 You will find that some characters that excell in early progression have difficulty in the end-game and visa versa
 Each character I've made has informed the next which is critical in a game that rewards experience and skill
And if that wasn't enough, POE offers alternative ARPG experiences in the form of daily race events which are time based leveling with unique modifiers that you won't see in the real game like 'Turbo Mode'
 Moreover some of these races have entirely unique content like Descent: Champions or Endless Ledge which offer players the ability to win special art reskins of legendary items for the leagues of their choice
All in all POE is a truly exciting game and a breath of fresh air for the genre

Warning: this game will consume big part of your life
If you start playing it, you will keep coming back for more all the time
Before I started playing Path of Exile, my attitude towards Hack'n'Slash genre was


let's say bad
This is my first game of such genre and I am completly satisfied
Now let's go straight to good and bad points of PoE
-PROS:+ truly Free To Play model, there is no such thing as Pay To Win, there are microtransactions that are all about purchasing visual effects for your character and his abilities (you can also purchase more tabs in stash, but that does not impact the game),+ developers actually care about the game, listen to their community and keep fixing bugs, creating new content or reworking old visual effects (I have been watching development of PoE since open beta and it constantly changes until this day, successfully becoming better),+ the desynchronisation issue has been fixed with the introduction of the update 2
0
0 - this was one of the biggest flaws of this game, it is gone now! Hurray!+ new leagues and events are started on a regular basis,+ huge amount of passive skill points which gives you enormous combinations for character developement, every build is unique (unless you begin copying others' builds which kills the fun)
There are so many possibilities that you are even able to turn an archer into a melee character!+ large variety of active skills - you want to sweep your axe? You want to cleave through enemies with your sword? Maybe you fancy raining arrows or using various kinds of magic? No problem, you can choose anything you want and upgrade your skills so they can consume less mana, become faster or fire more projectiles at once and that is not everything
+ many armors and weapons: one handed or two handed: axes, maces, swords also daggers, claws, bows, wands and staves, items also have different stats and 4 grades: normal, magic, rare and unique, same thing applies to monsters,+ crafting-currency trade system, it might come out to be hard to understand at first, but then you keep realising that everything has its value, there is no gold, just barter trade system
Crafting-currency items have one important function - they slow / prevent inflation which is a disadvantage of gold based systems,+ this game has challenging end-game consisting of large variety of special maps that can be modified to become more rewarding and demanding at once, if you reach high level [80+] with decent items and statistics you will simply feel satisfied + nice, vivid and helpful community,+ with the introduction of version 2
0
0 majority of in-game locations have been reworked, thanks to that some quests are now less time-consuming and do not get you bored!-CONS:** - with the introduction of version 2
0
0 this game has become flawless in my opinion
I hope that I managed to describe this game generally, but I have to say one more thing: you will not be able to experience the game by reading others' reviews, just give it a try and you might fall in eternal love

												If you like Action RPG but have not played this game yet, you must
Grinding Gear Games, an indie gaming company with their entirely free-to-play game, have created one of the most complex, in-depth and innovative ARPG in the gaming industry
Business ModelFirst of all, this game has one of the most fair and ethical business model you could ever see in the free-to-play market
Absolutely nothing you can get with real money gives you advantage over other players
This encourage players to support the game because they actually want to donate for the developing and its developers and not because they are forced to progress
Audiovisual artThe developers have stated that they "are sick of the recent trend towards bright, cartoony RPGs
The art style [they] chose for Path of Exile is dark, gritty and realistic"
The graphics are beautifully detailed, the music is iconig and the voice acting is outstanding
Gameplay & MechanicsThe customization and character progression in Path of Exile is complex and impressively in-depth, with a vast diversity in their mechanics
ClassesEach one of the 7 classes starts at different location of a passive skill tree, composed by 1325 nodes, with non-linear progression (the tree is actually a web)
Items & GearsSet items is a horrible decision for builds diversity, so this is not what you will find here
Of course there are Unique items, but having a full set of Uniques of the same theme/type does not grant you bonus mods
This is meant to be this way to avoid forcing players to play with sets, breaking their character building freedom
The item drops: maps, divination cards, jewels, gear items (their category, rarity, mods, gem sockets and links), are randomly generated
JewelsThere are socketable nodes in the Passive Skill Tree that makes possible to socket Jewels that grants bonus and special attributes to your skill tree
These jewels have rarity, mods and can be crafted too
SkillsThe skill system made by gems makes possible that the characters are not limitative to a few skills, so the game does not dictate how the player is going to play
These gems have level and attribute requirements according to their color (Strength, red; Dexterity, green; Intelligence, blue), they can be leveled up, have quality % and can be corrupted for bonus mods
Divination CardsThis kind of items are collectibles that gives you a specific item once you have gather enough cards of a set
Each card is dropped in a specific areas of the map
This system allow players to systematically work their way to the acquisition of the items they want, without having to rely on an eternal grinding
MapsTheir structures and pack of monsters are randomly generated, and is the main focus of the end-game, since they can be crafted
Currency & CraftingThere is no gold in Path of Exile, there are 25 currency items (orbs) that have crafting functionality
They can add/remove/re-roll the mods of the items, modify the sockets (number, colors and links) of the gear items, they can corrupt the items, change their rarity, etc
Basically people trade items for items they are going to use, and not for gold
This makes the trade highly in-depth and open
Forsaken MastersThere are 6 Masters (NPCs)
Each one of them can be leveled up to level 8 by doing daily missions, and they offer crafting bench and hideouts that can be decorated and customized as the player wish
The variety of builds and the hideout customization is so open that the developers runs two series called Build of the Week and Hideout of the Week
Developers & SupportThe developers work along side with the community to improve the game and add new content
They do a great job balancing the game and deploying constant patches and updates
The support is surprisingly responsive and open to any kind of feedback
ConclusionAll these elements makes the different ways a character may progress literally infinite, and the game always encourage to make new builds and try different mechanics
Some players likes to experiment with builds and other players likes to break the "rules" and metas to come with insane mechanics
The developers are, as explained, the most ethical and responsive gaming company you could find out there considering the success of their game
Reason to be disclosed: they are hardcore gamers creating a game after all, what would be better than that?			
Posted: 24 October, 2014
												Simply the most in-depth Hack'n'Slash out there and the best according to me
Character customization is top-notch and replayability is huge
I have a little bit over 1k hours played on it (did not link the game to my steam account immediately) and I still  have many things to discover
However, it is a "hardcore game" less accessible than Diablo 3 or others games
Pros:- Huge passive skill tree offering in-depth character customisation- Interesting spell customisation using gems (close to FFVII's materia system)- Interesting trading system relying on barter only (no gold or any other in-game currency)- Interesting crafting system allowing to modify dropped items- Game is very skill based (rare for a hack'n'slash!)- Very little Faceroll/OP builds, almost every build has drawbacks and strengthCons:- Can be hard to get into: trading system can seem overwhelming and in-game mechanics are quite complicated so use of the wiki and forum is much advised- Animation can seem clunky at the beginning and game seems to play slow at the beginning- Player can feel like reaching a gear-ceiling at the beginning of end-game if playign self-found (much better since Forsaken Master's 1
2 update though)- Will eat your life if you get into it

												If I'm being honest, I actually hate this game
I personally find it a boring, time consuming adventure
Why am I recommending it?Because I know quality when I play it
In addition to the great reviews this game has, I can personally attest to its uniqueness
Its skill system is complex and, like I said, can take years off your life if you let it
It seems as though the developers really put care into the game and I love seeing that in the gaming industry
If you want a game that improves on the Diablo formula, you should play this game
If you want a game that you can go into and get something done within an hour, this isn't it
I understand it's a more 'hardcore' game where time and effort is rewarded and 'laziness' isn't
It's just not for me, the once hardcore player-turned casual
9/10

												I came here to let everyone know that this game is indeed ok
			
Posted: 27 July
												Important disclosure : I started playing on Steam, but migrated my account to the standalone client
Hence, Steam thinks I havent played "recently"
TL;DR : I love this game
Since you came here to read a review for a F2P game, here goes :Good :1
diversity
7 classes, each with 3 sub-classes (except the 7th, she has only 1, but she can also pick points from any of the other 6 classes, fair, imho)2
playerbase
want to buy stuff? want to sell stuff? want to party up? want to chat up? u wont find an "empty" game, ever
people play at all times3
DIVERSITY
want to play a manly tattoo'd dude swinging a huge axe? done
want to play a quick, mobile huntress that shreds enemies with hundreds of arrows? can do
want to play a demented girl who lost her friends in a fire and has "replaced" them with raised zombies? OH BOY BET YOU CAN
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!! if YOU want, then that manly dude can swing his axe thrice as fast, for a small damage loss
or he can make his attacks BLEED his enemies
that huntress can electrify her arrows, or even make them chain off to nearby enemies
and if that sad girl ever gets bored of her new friends, she can always call up cute little flaming skulls of death that automatically seek out and destroy any that would harm her
ALL BY CHANGING A SINGLE GEM
seriously
i could go onnnn and onnnn
not enough space to write down everything
4
its free
all content updates are free as in free beer
no obligations to pay or tell others what you're playing
the bad :1
the cosmetics cost a bit too much
however, they look SWEET
other than on a templar
#spoilers i guess
2
some older content is not updated
mostly this is about old skills from 5 years back
yes, the game is that old
3
rich people like to ruin everything
there's some people whose only motive is to hoard everything and deny it to others
good thing that no matter how much they hoard, others just farm more of the item in question :)4
somewhat hard to play on older computers
yeah, if you're firing off a hundred spells per second, your PC WILL die of overheating lol
There are absolutely NO paywalls
There is nothing a F2P player cant do that a paying player can
Well the only exception to this rule would be stash tabs, but I played for almost a year with the basic 4 tabs
Be warned, this is not your traditional farmville style game
This game is BRUTAL if you arent paying attention
Playing casually is an option, however, you need to learn atleast SOME game mechanics to not get insta-gibbed by white mobs in the tougher zones
Once you understand how this game works, you will realize what a hidden gem it is
But, that requires sweat, blood and tears
You dont become an exile just by strutting around whacking at bosses with an unlinked Heavy Strike socketed in a white weapon, no
You become and exile by studying the masters!Welcome to Wraeclast, (hopefully) exile!! I wish you maxed resists and multiple mirror drops!!

Early Access Review
								Puzzle Pirates is a fantastic game I can't recommend highly enough
I've been playing since 2006, and have spent thousands of hours on the game
Puzzle Pirates is a puzzle-based MMORPG, where puzzles form the key part of the gameplay
The game revolves around these puzzles
Players team up to sail ships, which can then fight other players ships or AI ships
Some players perform one puzzle to make the ship move faster; other players perform a puzzle to reduce the damage taken on the ship; other players perform a puzzle to remove water from the ship, and so on
Overall, there's 20+ puzzles in the game, all of which have a different function in the game
Puzzle Pirates: Dark Seas is a new ocean (server), where more focus goes on PvP than in previous oceans
There are two factions: Light (Defiant Armada) vs
Dark (Shadow Fleet)
These two factions are perpetually at war; if ships from opposing factions meet in battle, the battle will be sinking, with the defeated losing their ship permanently
The developers are still fleshing out the PvP elements of the new ocean; there's still work to be done in this aspect, and it's one of their priorities for Early Access
Also, while the game is Early Access, you're definitely getting a full game here
The game has been around for around 15+ years
There are new aspects to the new ocean, and changes are coming, which is why it's EA, but this is not an unfinished game
This is a game players have been playing and enjoying for years
Some pros and cons for the game:+Puzzles: There are over 20 puzzles for this game
I've been playing for over 10 years, and haven't gotten bored of them yet
Some are better than others, and everyone has their personal opinions, but almost everyone has puzzles they enjoy playing over and over
There are 3 types of puzzles: Piracy (puzzles that help a ship function), Crafting (puzzles that produce labor for the economy, more detail in a minute), and Parlor (Poker, Hearts, Spades, and two custom games, Drinking and Treasure Drop)
The puzzles are still fun after years, and there's a real sense of progression as you get better at the puzzles
The better you perform at a puzzle, the more you contribute to the ship, or the higher quality labor you provide
The puzzles provide a very skill-intensive factor to the game
+Community: Puzzle Pirates has the best community of any game I've ever played
Pirates join a crew, and crews join a flag, which participate in end game content and larger events (blockades, the end game content of Puzzle Pirates)
I've met more friendly people here than in any other game
I have friends who no longer play who I still keep in touch with, and I keep meeting new people
I guarantee that if you play this game, you'll be able to meet a lot of cool people extremely easily
People love to help out new players and teach them the game
+Economy: The economy is entirely player-driven
Players buy basic goods, turn these goods into intermediate goods using player labor, turn these intermediate goods into final goods using player labor, and then sell these goods to other pirates
All labor to produce goods must be provided by players through crafting puzzles
Supply and demand has real affects on the market
It's also easy to own your own stall to create goods and to make money this way
There are players who focus on making money this way rather than sailing on ships, and it's a very feasible way to play the game
There are many more positive aspects to them the game that I enjoy, but the above three are what I believe what makes Puzzle Pirates special and unique
If someone were to ask why they should play this game, I'd give the above reasons
A couple of cons below:-Dubloons: There are two kinds of currency in Puzzle Pirates: Pieces of Eight (PoE) and Dubloons
PoE is the main currency, generated by pillages at sea, and used to buy goods from bots and from other players
Dubloons are the micro transaction currency
Most final products (ships, cosmetic items such as clothes and furniture) require a dubloon cost in addition to the PoE cost
Dubloons are only available through purchase with real money, and then can be sold in game for PoE
There's two ways to get Dubs: purchase them yourself, or buy them on the market for PoE
It adds to the cost of being a free-to-play player, but by no means is the game pay to play or pay to win; it's very possible to play and experience all of the content of the game without paying any money
But it's a definite downside new players should be aware of
-Graphics: I personally like the graphics, but that's maybe just because I'm used to them! However, the graphics definitely aren't top notch
It doesn't affect the game play, but it's definitely a problem for players expecting amazing graphics
-Playerbase: Back in its heyday, Puzzle Pirates had thousands and thousands of players each day (no clue on the exact number, but I'm sure it was over 5000 daily)
Now, there's maybe 1000 players, if that
It's still very possible to play the game and have a lot of fun, but the playerbase is definitely down
Part of the hopes for this new beta is that the playerbase will grow to previous heights
Overall, Puzzle Pirates is an absolutely amazing game that I think everyone should at least try out
It's an incredibly unique MMORPG that many people have fantastic experiences with, and I'm glad that I randomly stumbled upon this game over 10 years ago

								Puzzle Pirates is a great game that has lasted through the ages
With many mini-games to keep you busy, you'll find yourself asking where the hours went
Go on a ship and steal some treasure from some brigands and barbarians, or even other players! And if fighting on the open ocean doesn't appeal to you, then open your own shoppe! With Dark Seas and Early Release, we will see changes to the old Puzzle Pirates game that many enjoyed
So whether you are new or old, come give YPP:DS a chance! Can't wait to see you there

Early Access Review
								I loved the original puzzle pirates, and this was no different
It is the same game, just reskinned
Overall the game is great, but you must beware of spending real money on the game
I logged my 55 hours in a months time
I feel that any game that makes me spend so much time deserves my money, so I spent $20 (US) on a package ingame
Things were going great
Joined a great crew, bought a few ships
Then I started wagering, that is when things went bad
They have an automatic detection method for spending real money in game
Story: I wagered my 2 ships in a swordfight
Won the swordfight
Guy wanted a rematch, so i thought, if i lose then i will still break even
Won another swordfight against him
He was mad a left
Literally minutes later I was banned
The reason: RMT (Real money trading)
I have never spent real money to third parties, I litterally had just spent $20 on the games microcurrency
Why would I buy their currency then go out and risk it all for a few extra PoE (standard currency)
It litterally makes no sense
It gets a thumbs down from me due to the fact that support sends a bogus email telling you to tell them where you bought the currency from or you will be banned forever (again i never purchased anything, so what can i say back?)DO NOT SPEND MONEY IN THE GAME
Automatic rule enforcement with no way to dispute puts it at risk
Thanks for stealing $20 from me

There's PLENTY of different puzzles for everyone's taste
I've been playing this game since 2007, and it's absolutely amazing how it just won't die because of its lovely community and developers
What a splendid return we're about to witness here, I can only hope the population levels rise as much as this game deserves it to happen
ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED, give it a shot and you won't regret it!Timeless graphics, great gameplay, awesssomeee puzzles, awesome community, awesome concept and execution

								I've been a long time Puzzle Pirates player and had a blast playing on the older oceans years ago
Coming back to Dark Seas has been a welcoming experience
With a steadily increasing ocean population, wait times for pillages have been an all time low
This game is virtually timeless, as its easy-on-the-eyes graphics allow for hours and hours of puzzling and community fun
It really is, in my opinion, the ultimate cooperative mmo out there
 It's gameplay is truly unique
Every aspect of the game that you take part in truly matters, whether it is repairing battle damage on your ship, loading the cannons, navigating dangerous Kraken nests


it's all up to you, the players, to work together as a team
Highly recommended, however, I do feel that there is a slight learning curve for the newest players

								Love this game! I've been playing for over a decade and I keep coming back to it
It's great for anyone who enjoy games with an emphasis on community-involvement and/or lots of different, interesting puzzles
The game's system is set up in a way that's unlike any other games I've played, in terms of player flags owning and operating the islands that make up the world, the mechanics for pillages, and the numerous sea monster hunts
It's more fun that it appears at first glance!

Posted: 19 October
												South Park: The Fractured But Whole is not a terrible game by any stretch of the imagination
But for a full 60$ game I really expected more
I absolutely loved the previous game, The Stick of Truth, and naturally had high hopes for the sequel
However, TFBW just fails to deliver
It absolutely has the South Park feel to it, with tons of humor and references
The problem is that the game just can't coast by on that alone and the rest of the game is just


boring
The story isn't particularly interesting and you never felt there was anything at stake, something to drive you along
In the 20 or so hours it took me to play through the game I felt I spent most of my time fighting trash, searching for collectibles and doing fetch quests
Only at the very end do you see anything in the way of stakes and it all ends with one of the worst final battles I've ever seen and an incredibly anti-climactic ending
There are also other issues I have with this game, the price being one of them
At 60$ I expect more content than I received
The game is very short, even with all the side content included
And the inclusion of a very expensive season pass and day one DLC doesn't help either
And of course the cherry on top is the fact that you have to use UPlay whether you want to or not
Ubisoft


no one likes your stupid client
Stop pushing it
And there are some technical issues as well
I didn't have the black screen problem others have had, but I did have to play through the entire game with a very annoying grey bar at the top and bottom of the screen because my monitor uses a non-standard resolution
Oddly enough, The Stick of Truth did not have this problem so I don't see why this game should have it
The game is also very resource intensive, excessively so compared to the Stick of Truth
And finally the game feels very much like a console port, this is glaringly obvious with the in game phone menus and the control scheme, particulary when trying to do the toilet challenges
In the end I suppose the game is worth a play if you loved the previous game, just wait for a steam sale, it isn't worth the full asking price
But all things considered, if you haven't played the previous game I would suggest skipping this and picking up The Stick of Truth instead
It's just a better game in every way
Final rating: 6
5/10			
Posted: 21 October
												I am confused about this game
The critical reviews are overwhelmingly positive, stating that it's superior to The Stick of Truth in every way, but I couldn't disagree more and that is very disappointing
The story-line is largely dull and though there are a few laughs here and there, the writing is much weaker than the previous game
The cast of playable characters is much, much bigger, but the consequence of this is that each of them gets remarkably little time to say or do anything particularly memorable
This is clearly a poor console port
The controls are odd in places to say the least, particularly the toilet challenges, to the point where your inputs are simply not registered - which cuts you off from successfully completing part of the content you paid for
Crafting is good, but the downside of this is that it makes 70% of loot drops redundant and worthless as you will almost always have artifacts that are superior that you personally made than what you were rewarded with for defeating a boss or completing a challenge
This makes the achievement of success a bit lacklustre
The battle system is better than The Stick of Truth, but frustrating in a few ways
You are only able to attack in one parallel axis with the vast majority of attacks
I'm not sure why we're not able to attack from the vertical axis given the vast amount of freedom we now enjoy in combat
The music is weaker than the previous game and is not memorable
I would imagine that most people can recall without having to think terribly hard what the battle tunes were in The Stick of Truth - I can't do that with clarity for this game
The game has quite a few bugs that absolutely should not be present given how long the game was in production and for how long the delays were before release
The most common example of this is that the game has a tendency in places to soft-lock during combat or following a loading screen
I also experienced a black screen at one point, where the game continued to run in the background, but I could not see where by characters were navigating to - forcing me to hard reset the game without being able to save
I'm at the end of the game at the moment but cannot complete it due to a game breaking bug in a boss fight that has brought progress to a halt and until that bug is fixed I cannot finish the game
That is simply rediculous for a AAA £50 game from a major publisher
The length of the game and therefore the value for money is also questionable
To be clear, this is a very expensive game for what is a 20 hour RPG experience
There should either be higher quality and a greater depth of content available or a lower cost
The forced inclusion fo Uplay, whether you want it or not, in order to play the game is another irritationt that I did not expect, considering this was not present for The Stick of Truth with the publisher remaining the same
All in all, I am not sure why they did not just ask Obsidian to make the sequal
I'm fairly certain that they would have done a much superior job

												I wanted to recommend this game
I really did


but I can't
Let me stress South Park: The Fractured But Whole is a great game - even better than Stick of Truth
The combat was expanded upon exponentially - the tactical nature of the grid-based combat requires so much more strategy and planning than the rather basic "been there, done that" nature of the combat in Stick of Truth
The game world was expanded upon and is even more interesting, with plenty more secrets to find than before
Every great thing Stick of Truth did, Fractured But Whole does even better
However, Fractured But Whole is only a good game when you play the version on consoles
Sadly, it seems like Ubisoft gave this game the "Arkham Knight" treatment for this PC port
Any enjoyment you could be having is ruined by a plethora of bugs, framerate issues, and other various problems
Let's go over the first, most glaring, and most often brought up problems - the DRM and Uplay
Denuvo is infamous for causing players a various amount of problems during their experience
Enough said about that
As for Uplay, forcing people to download your own specific, barely funcioning service in order to play your game is a scumbag move, even more so when you use it as an exuse to lock much of the content of the game behind microtransactions
Not to mention, in order to make this game work for Uplay, you have to link your Steam and Uplay accounts -  a process that can be rather confusing and unintuitive
That, however, I might be able to look past in order to enjoy the game, but Ubisoft royally screwed up this port
If it's not the constant framerate issues or the abysmal loading times, it's the bugs
Dear God, the bugs
Often times, cutscenes will play without sound for no reason, characters will load incorrectly when entering a new area and you'll be unable to interact with them, and if you're really unlucky then the game will just crash on you without warning
In fact, there's a very infamous bug that appears right as you start the game - the game won't load and will just display a black screen, and the only way to make the game continue as intended it to make it go into windowed mode
For the love of God, do not buy this game off Steam
Literally any other version of this game is much better, and much more worth your time

												Multiple layers of DRM, need to make a uplay account
It launches on a black screen IF it launches, have to make it windowed mode to pass the black screen but then your UI is scattered around randomly and then there's a ladder in the first area with a bug that makes the game crash
This will be my first ever Steam refund, sad to say

												Great story
South Park never disappoints


However, Ubisoft does


I can't believe I paid 60 dollars for this buggy POS dumpster fire
Everything from frame rate drops, sound file malfunctions, black screens, freezing, uplay, dlc and dlc ads
Ubisoft must have cut South Park studios one hell of a deal
South Park sold out
IMO Ubisoft and South Park studios gave a big middle finger to the gaming community
I expected more, expected better


This is a $29
99 game at best
Kills me to say this


DO NOT BUY THIS GAME			
Posted: 17 October
												Game runs on Uplay (not steam), making the steam purchase obsolete (and overly complicated)
 Would love to review the game but Steam and Uplay don't want to play in tandem
 The Steam staff are not helpful, and refuse to refund a non working product all because i got a second copy of stick of truth during pre-purchase that i did not even want away
 Will never buy a pre order steam again if this is how they are going to treat loyal customers
 Steam and Ubistoft are thieves
Do not get this game for Steam
It is daylight robbery
Update:Problem was resolved no thanks to the Steam staff at all
 The game is great, but I'd suggest getting it on Ubisoft since Steam have no work ethic in their help department, and with needing Uplay to play this game does not need steam as a platform
In short cut out the middle crook (steam) and get the Ubisoft games on Uplay it will save you time and might just make Steam think their choices in the future
Still a thumbs down report due to the long winded and useless service from the platform I brought it on
But do buy the game through Uplay it is worth it, the achievement prize system rocks too

Early Access Review
								Another match-3 game from SakuraGame, mixed with short visual novel segments
I assume it's similar to Hell Girls, although I don't have much time playing that one so I can't make good comparisons
I'm writing this review after playing the first 2 1/2 chapters of Mirror (out of 8 total in the current build)
Bottom line: For a day-1 Early Access game, this is easily worth two bucks
Even if development stopped today, I would have expected to pay between $5 and $10 for what's there now
The artwork is very high quality, both for the characters and the backgrounds, and there's a lot of variety for both
The visuals overall are the best part of the game, on par with some of the more expensive VNs on Steam - Example (SFW)[steamuserimages-a
akamaihd
net]
The only fault I could see is that the style isn't always consistent - some backgrounds have a watercolor-style appearance while others are crisp and CG-like, but it didn't bother me at all
Music is okay - mostly unmemorable but it fits the game fine
The title track is a standout
The English translation is not great, but it's better than most other games published by SG on Steam
There seems to be at least some human involvement in it - not completely done by machine
I didn't have any trouble understanding what was being said 80% of the time
Hopefully they will make another pass or two and by the final release it could be relatively polished
Each chapter of the game appears to be a self-contained story, with unique characters and plot
Although the gameplay is primarily match-3 in the style of Puzzle Quest and the like, there are also short visual novel vignettes before each battle
They are a few minutes in length, and each one has a dialogue choice that results in gameplay modifier (e
g
-10% enemy health, +20% enemy attack, etc)
The modifiers don't seem to have much impact so I wouldn't worry about making a bad choice
This is because there isn't a lot of strategy involved in the battles
There are only 4 primary icons on each 8x7 board, so you'll be getting a lot 5x and higher combo chains without really trying
These battles are the weakest aspect of the game
I hope they take the time to add some more variety and make them less luck-based, but I don't think that's likely to happen by the time the game is finished
There is an in-game shop where you can upgrade stats and get new abilities, but I haven't spent much time experimenting with it because I've only lost a single battle so far
Again though I don't think it would make a difference
At the end of each chapter is a slightly longer VN section with a sex minigame with the opponent you defeated
The sexual content appears to be mostly bondage-related - nothing unusual for these sorts of games
The explicit portions are censored and there's no patch to undo it at the time I'm writing this, but pretty much every other SG release has one so I would expect it to appear before too long

								Interesting puzzle game
I thought the back story is rather interesting too
You have a little choices matter sort of dialogue
I have a few SakuraGame titles, lives up to their art style, to put it simply
A little on the lewd side
R rated but not completely full frontal, but then again its more echi than adult manga
Honestly I'm very surprised they charge so little for this title
And  with a promotion of 40% off at launch, its a no brainer

Early Access Review
 First ImpressionMy first impression is that this game is that the games will be full of nudes, just a linear elimination games
That's all
I bought it since the early purchase will entitle customers to 2 more free gift games
Maybe sooner or later will start having cards, so it is an investment
  Playing Experience	But, I was wrong, not about the nudes things, yes there a lots of them
Few of them are somehow a bit too much for me
(maybe i am a bit conservative)
I was wrong that this game is just a game that use sexy anime girl to attracts weebs
They offer more than that
The animation is nicely done, story lines created are interesting and different for each of chapters/levels/girls
The elimination gem games combined rpg character skills builds so that the gems eliminated will have difference effects
The music is pretty good
It is enjoyable to play this game while listening to them
Character voices are good and such and ear candy for me
Since it is just early access game, i hope they will add more contents, more characters, and more diversity in the game play
I personally would recommend the game
It is not a waste will worth every cents spent

												At one point this was my fav game ive ever played and then the devs got bought by kabam and kabam made this a pay to win like no other

its more of a pay to have fun, and make any real progress
pets to heal you, regen all your stuff, and attack for you, gotta pay to make them work
theres, backpacks,potions, item drop enhancers, very powerful items right off from the start
only way you can get any of these is with money

												Used to play this back on Kongregate (I believe it was on there) and a bit when it came on Steam
Was probably the best perma-death RPG game you could find
Didn't have demanding PC requirements, cool and clean pixelated visuals, easy-to-pick up hard-to-master bullet hell-style gameplay
Overall, it was great fun and I enjoyed my time with it
So I thought this game had died out a while ago (some time since I had played it regularly), but it turns out the game is still going strong


really strong actually
I was pretty excited and saw that this game has the VERY POSITIVE rating on Steam
As I was strolling down to read some of the top reviews, I noticed a new publisher called Kabam in the game's description area
Interesting
So I finally make it to the reviews and what I see is a bunch of negative reviews about how pay-2-win this game is after Kabam took over
I couldn't believe it was THAT bad so I tried it out myself a few weeks ago
Downloaded it through Steam, loaded it up




Wow
Another example of an amazing game ruined by greedy companies tainting the free-2-play model
No one wonder people are hating on free-2-play games when we got so much greedy companies these days
But Kabam really butchered this game
Everything good requires money
Skill is irrevelant
I can't believe they actually managed to take the skill factor out of a bullet-hell game

												Hoo, this game
 Was a lot of fun for the first 60 hours


before the company got bought out by a bigger company
 Apparently that company had big ideas in terms of monetizing the hell out of this fairly enjoyable free to play game
 I enjoyed it back when it was catching on, but I think the game has definitely taken a turn for the worse when it got bought out
 The design is more focused towards getting your money than making the game more enjoyable
 When a game does that, even if I already invested 60 hours, I walk away rather than get treated like a bag of money by the game's designers and publishers

												Before you say I have no experience with this game, I have played for a good few hundred hours on the browser version
This game USED to be good
It really was
Back then, a company called Wildshadow owned the game
It was truly f2p, with skill and no money required
Then, a company called Kabam took over
They changed the game into a cashgrab
Skins? Buy gold
Vaults and characters? Buy gold
1-life weapons or keys? Buy gold
Everything is gold gold gold
Updates are rare, and even when they come they just add more items to be purchased with gold
In fact, the way they 'celebrate' holidays is by creating cheap weapon reskins for more people to buy with

you guessed it, gold!!You might be thinking, at least there's player interaction! No, there isn't
The game is infested with hackers, scammers, enemy draggers, spambots, etc
Kabam doesn't care at all
After all, you don't make any money from clearing away hackers, so why bother?TL;DR: Stay away

												I've been playing this game obsessively for a couple months now, and still can't get enough of it
 Learning the patterns of all the enemies is one of the most satisfying things I've ever done in any game
 When you start out, you're just fumbling around, faceplanting into enemies and getting torn apart
 If you practice enough, though, you'll be able to take on any situation without suffering so much as a scratch
 Every part of the game is very doable with the default equipment, so you're never just screwed because the right items didn't drop for you
 The weapons and spells that you can find all work differently and cause you to change your method of attack, but they're all pretty balanced
 There are a ton of different weapons types with their own unique advantages and drawbacks, rather than traditional "tiers" of weapons (1 damage, 2 damage, 3 damage, etc
)  And there's an instant replay feature upon death, where you can look and see what you could have done differently to save yourself (there's always SOMETHING)
 This is quite possibly the most well-balanced game I've ever played, and I adore it
 Pick this game up right now if you can
Edit: If you have any doubts, just look at how many hours I've logged on it ;)Edited again, after launch day: Early access is over!  The game is complete and it's AMAZING
 I cannot believe how much better the game has gotten with time!  The final area and extra bosses have been added, and they really went all-out with the monster designs for the last zone
 And suddenly there are two entire new soundtracks to choose from?  Yes, please!  I cannot tell you how happy I am with how the final product came out
 I still play this all the time :)

Early Access Review
"Kick! Punch! It's all in the mind
"These words were spoken by the great Tamanegi Sensei (better known as Chop Chop Master Onion) over 15 years ago when music-based games were first making a name, and they ring even truer today as the rhythm genre takes an evolutionary step into the dungeon crawling arena
NecroDancer is the holy matrimony between addictive rhythm game grooviness and challenging roguelike complexity, and I'll be damned if it doesn't hit the spot
It's amazing that a concept this unique took as long as it did to come to fruition, but it's been more than worth the wait
Not only is the concept unique but it's done right, something we hardly ever see when a new mechanic or gimmick is introduced to the gaming world for the first time
We see so many "new" ideas that are merely just a melting pot of previously established genres
Lo and behold, these developers have obviously set out to refine and perfect their concoction of varied gameplay elements on their first attempt and that is highly admirable
Necrodancer stands not only as a magnificently well-realized combination of genres but as a completely new experience of it's own and the start of what is hopefully a new trend of taking fun and risky chances in game development
The in-game music is dark, fantastic and quite danceable itself lending to the blissful feeling of hitting each beat of the song with perfect timing
The precision of the music-based movement has lead lots of early adopters of the game to swear by playing with DDR dancepads which apparently add a lot to the fun and engaging nature of exploring the Crypt
This shows a serious level of dedication from the rhythm game community and has already garnered enough attention to spawn it's own design of custom NecroDancer dancepads[necrodancer
com]
And if you somehow are crazy enough to get tired of renowned composer Danny Baranowsky's heavy electronic horror jams, the game features an intuitive beat detection function for usage of songs from your own library
The detection of beats in your songs is generally spot on, and makes trying and discovering those perfect tunes for the game infinitely explorable and replayable for audiophiles in the same way games like Audiosurf and Beat Hazard Ultra provide endless entertainment
Even for those songs that might be a bit too fast or slow for manageable NecroDancing, there's a feature to alter the speed of in-game beats to give more accessibility for a wider range of genres
No form of music shall go undanced in the heart of these Crypts
There are four main floors to the game with three levels and a boss-type enemy each, but beating any single one of them won't be an easy task
You will retry many times being forced to scour every diamond, buy up all the upgrades, and loot your way through multiple plays before you succeed, but what makes this so much more of a pleasure to replay than any other games which borrow rogue elements is the musical nature of the game
NecroDancer replaces the repetitive and stale turn-based combat of traditional roguelikes with the fun and engaging audio interaction of the best rhythm games made to date
With a touch of the strategic approach of traditional tactics games, the enemies each have a very distinct pattern to their movements and attacks that the player must learn through multiple failures and awareness
Starting out you encounter the easier monsters such as slimes that move passively back and forth as well as skeletons that follow behind in a predictable way that is easy to counter
Protecting the exit of each floor are the harder and more complex mini-bosses, ranging from hulking Minotaurs that charge towards you in a straight path or determined Dragons that you must outsmart and keep just out of harm's way in order to retain your doomed life just a little longer
Throughout your journeys into the crypt you'll have two different forms of currency, first being gold coins that you can spend within the levels at merchants on equipment and items to help you on your current run
Second, and most importantly are the much harder to find Diamonds which are the only thing that carry over into the lobby after death, allowing you to purchase upgrades to the gear and loot you come across during your runs
This adds an insanely addictive level of persistence in the same way that the character growth in Rogue Legacy or shortcut system of Spelunky do
The shops you purchase these upgrades from won't be made available to you that easily, however, as each of the different merchants and trainers you need will be imprisoned and strewn about the various dungeons forcing you to dance deeper and deeper to rescue the people you will rely on in the future
The game is hard and you'll die many times, but the deeper you go the more you discover, and the more you discover the easier your respective trips will become
This adds a ridiculous amount of replayability and persistence to an already engaging and genre defying new formula
Here I am hopping and slashing away to the beat of Castlevania's 'Vampire Killer', and I come across a Blood Whip
Things could not be more perfect
Necrodancer isn't just a gimmick, it's the start of something beautiful, it's a new kind of entertainment that can be enjoyed from the hardecore-est of dungeon delving roguelite aficionados to the most casual of rhythm game fans, but there is one thing that all of these demographics must have in common; a dedication to the sound of music

Crypt of the NecroDancer is quietly genius
It's exactly what you would imagine a game to be like if you were told it's a roguelike, but in real time, with the turns lasting as long as the beat of a soundtrack — because they are, in fact, set to a soundtrack
This kind of "X meets Y" high concept game (roguelike meets rhythm game, in this case) is easy to think up, but not as easy to turn into a good game, if the failed examples littering Steam are any indication
NecroDancer not only works, but works well — it's an astounding feat of game design, and it's likely you won't even notice that while you're playing because it just feels natural
This is one of the few roguelikes that deserves the description "easy to pick up, hard to master", as most roguelikes are not even all that easy to pick up
NecroDancer has a tutorial that lasts all of 90 seconds, and contains everything you need to get started
Getting through the first set of levels will take a little more time, but can still be done in an hour or two
But make no mistake, the difficulty ramps up over a total of four zones (each with three levels and a boss level, for a total of 16 levels)
And if you think that's the end of it, you're wrong — there's a separate story mode to play through all the zones in sequence rather than separately, and to unlock all the characters (each with their own gimmicks that change the way you play) you have to complete the game multiple times
This is a true roguelike in that the peak difficulty is insane and completing the game with every character is a challenge restricted to only a handful of demigods, but it's also a true roguelike in that it's fair and rewards strategic play and perseverance
And all that to a great beat!I haven't even completed the third zone yet and I can already tell it will be many hours more before I chip my teeth on the really difficult parts, but I felt like I needed to get this review out before the current sale is over, even if my experience is incomplete
This game is almost certainly worth it at full price if you're into roguelikes, but at sale price it's a no-brainer
If it looks like anything you might like, buy it
Even if you can't make your way through it, you'll still get your money's worth for the time you're playing it

												There have been plenty of rogue-like games in the last few years, but this is definitely one of the most unique and original
The concept is strangely brilliant, the art is great, and the music is awesome, so the whole package seems pretty stunning at first glance
However, when you look under the hood, it's not flawless


the concept may be amazing, but the execution is a little bit janky at times
There are times when I know that I'm 100% on the beat, and yet the game simply isn't registering that I'm on target, leading to my untimely death
I'm a musician, so I have a good sense of rhythm and timing - something seemed off here
There's just not enough precision to the mechanics, which can really sink you when you're facing a boss or going up against a  big room filled with tough enemies
There are definitely a few frustrations that you'll have to deal with to get into a groove here
I would defintely still recommend this, despite  whatever shortcomings it may have, because the idea is great and the development team has gotten pretty dang close to nailing it
There's also the ability to add in your own music, which is a fantastic feature


I pumped in some Tribe Called Quest, Wu-Tang, Biggie, etc
, and then the game was really bumping and twice as fun
Get this on sale and it'll be money well-spent, as long as you recognize that there's gonna be a serious learning curve when it comes to getting into the game's idea of rhythm

												I've played this game for last 4 months of its Early Access
It already looked very promising and awesome
With the release it took me only a few hours of playtime to confirm everything I was ready to write about
This is a rogue-like rhythm dungeon crawler, as you've probably read on the store page
The genre is quite unique - its gameplay is a blend of turn-based combat but it's constrained by the boundaries of the "beats" of the music of the level (unlike a lot of rhythm games it's very forgiving on beat accuracy and there's a reason for that: it's quite action-packed, so when you have a few skeletons, fiery dogs and a dragon converging on you - you can't really follow the beats within 20% margin what is usual for rhythm games)
First things first: this is a rhythm game and its soundtrack wirtten by Danny Baranowsky is just pure essence of awesomeness
Randomly generated levels are extremely well done
When I say extremely I mean it
This game doesn't have unbeatable generations
It may be easier or harder, but it's a fair rogue-like, if you die - it's your fault
It's not like rogue's tale when you can be killed on first turn the moment you spawn
So you won't really be stomped by something you can't beat
With the release the game has been augmented with some kind of plot which makes it a bit more beautiful than a rogue-like w/o a plot
Also this game even during Early Access didn't have any gamebreaking bugs
In 80h I never had a single crash or anything else that'd ruin my gaming experience, since technically this is kind of a day1 for this game - it's exremely polished, which is a good example what Early Access system should be used for and how
With cutscenes you are being rewarded with when you complete "zones" with different characters, with easier and harder characters themselves, with a big variety of items, leaderboards, daily challenges - delivering beatdowns to the beat in this game is guaranteed to be one your best rogue-like experiences ever

												So, I often think of CRPGs as different GMs
Balder's Gate 1 is kind of a crappy GM - they don't know how to really roleplay and their plot is kind of rote
But they did a TON of homework, so you can go anywhere and find something there
It may be kinda stupid, but it is there! Balder's Gate 2 is that GM, but they got better at writing and roleplaying
Now, characters are better written and the plot is more interesting!Planescape Torment is the dude who may railroad you, but they've got such a great plot and setting that you don't really care
Tyranny? Tryanny is the GM who watches as you walk into their carefully pre-written campagin of evil and chaos, with deep lore and politics in mind, and blink as you say: "So, I stab my ally in the back
All of them
At the same time
" Tyranny blinks again
Then Tyranny smiles and says: "Okay, so, now, you find yourself working for


" Tyranny has some of the best choice based gameplay I've ever seen
Work for one side? Work for another? Work for a third? Work for yourself? Play people off one another? An amazing number of different choices lead to different outcomes
I've played the game three times and still haven't seen everything it has to offer
Add to that a fun, fast paced combat (which you can set to the easiest mode if you just want to enjoy the narrative) and my presonal favorite companion NPCs, and you've got one of the finest RPGs out there
Plus, you can do drugs with grandpa Lantry and have fun for the whole family!

Very unique setting for the genre - bronze age works for me, I felt immersed within the first minutes, and I can't say the same about Pillars
I'd say it's more streamlined, even more than Pillars, but I don't really mind
I feel like a kid running Arcanum or Baldur's Gate for the first time, immersed in a beautiful world full of interesting stories
Shame I have to sleep (and go to work tomorrow) because I can't wait to play some more!If You, like me, had trouble being immersed in Pillars, consider picking this game up
			
Posted: 11 March
												I rate 7/10
A solid isometric RPG with unusual story and engaging combat
Definitely worth a try for any fan of old-school western RPGs
Story+ Unique and refreshing: forget your usual boring saving the world from The Evil Overlord - you will conquer it in their name instead
+ Your choices actually matter
+ High replay value thanks to the amount of choices
+ Very detailed character creation system
~ Solid, but straightforward
Don't expect plot twists or deep philosophical themes
- The last act feels rushed, some plot lines remain unexplained and unfinished
Let's hope that's a set up for a sequel
Combat system+ Fun and complex, with a large and diverse set of abilities and status effects
+ Active pause and fast/slow modes allow you to tune the speed of combat to your liking
+ One of the most detailed magic spell customization systems I've ever seen
+ A neat combat log with all the rolls and effects explained in detail
~ Some spells/abilities combinations are really overpowered
I am looking at you, volcanic weapon accent
This + any weapon buff + Verse's Fury's Embrace = Fire Minigun of Instagib
- Balance is pretty skewed
The game feels challenging in the beginning, but gets too easy in the end (mostly due to the previous point)
Don't play on anything lower than "Hard" if you want at least some challenge
Companions+ Memorable and likeable
+ Detailed backstories and dialogues
+ A loyalty/fear system based on your actions
~ No waifus
This is no Bioware date-sim, if you were expecting one
Appearance+ Good graphics for an isometric RPG
+ Animations are smooth, magic/ability visuals are nice and not overly flashy
+ You can change the freaking font size!~ Music is whatever

One of the best games of 2016!Tyranny is definitely a very good RPG
Every choice affects the lives of the people and the overall story
The maps are small, side-quest scarce and the story is short
However it does have one of the best choice makings I've seen in RPGs and the story itself is very engaging
There isn't much to explore and the story might seem rather linear but what's in the game is done well
StoryYou are in middle of a civil war
The Overlord Kyros has won and rules over the realm
The last conquered land, the region of the Tiers, has a rebel uprising and two of Kyros' armies struggle to bring order as they are fighting each other almost as much as the rebels
Insert The Fatebinder
You bear a powerful Edict: If order is not re-established within a certain amount of time all life in the valley will perish
You have to bring justice, peace and order to a wartorn country full of madmen
GameplayTyranny is an isometric RPG
It's similar to Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale but the best comparison would be Pillars of Eternity
You can control a small squad of up to four people
Each party member can be customised to an extent
You can switch out their gear and colour their armor
Each party member also comes with a unique set of skills and spells
You can either turn on auto leveling or meddle with their skilltrees and attributes yourself
You spend half of the game reading through A LOT of text
As any other RPG Tyranny isn't just about combat
Half of the game is interacting with NPCs and making tough decisions
ConclusionI'd say that Tyranny is the most linear RPG I've ever played
The maps are few and seriously tiny
There is only a handful of sidequests and party members
The exploration is almost none existent and you're almost always on the main quest as there's nothing else to do
HOWEVER it does have quite a bit of replay value and it has one of the best choice making I've seen in RPGs and a very strong story making this one of the most memorable games of the year

												Tyranny is another masterwork created by Obsidian, but a real surprise seeing how little coverage and hype it got
Funny enough this game surpassed even Pillars of Eternity in many aspects
What you get is a real crpg in the veins of Baldurs Gate/ Ice Wind Dale or Pillars of Eternity, but by no means a simple Pillars of Eternity 2
Many mechanics have changed, grown and been improved upon by a mile and then some
The whole character-system is now even more refined and works alot better than it did in Pillars:Endurance is gone, the leveling and building of your char/party is alot more complex and interesting
You still gain levels, but this is by far not the only way to progress your character
Level-ups let you increase a singel attribute and allocate one talent point (which can be spend in various skill-trees, featuring active and passive talents); but now also many skills work similiar to the Eldar Scrolls games and level/increase by use
This goes for combat skills (like 1-handed weapons) to conversation/enviroment skills like athletics
Also the combat has a way more polished feel to it than in Pillars; micro-managing your party, all the options you got in combat feels now much more fluid and meaningfull while still beeing quite complex
Furthermore everything else flows into the character-system: standing with factions/npcs and all the choices you make in the story/sidequests grant you whole new abilities, talents, actives and passivs
Last but not least there's even spellcreation now included, which means you can sorta creat your own spells, modify em and adapt em to your liking
The even more impressive part is the game itself


sounds stupid, but the game is a piece of art
Music (one of the best soundtracks i've yet heard in a game), the amazing voice-work, the art-style/design of the U
I
and every little window (character-menu, inventory) or even more so the actual game-world is just incredible and polished to the rim
Many backdrops are jaw-droppers, many scenes play out as they would in a play
Ontop of all that the story and even more important the writing is topnotch
When Pillars was nod to Baldur's Gate, Tyranny is a wink to Planescape Torment
Leaving out spoilers (which you should avoid at all costs): the game-world is very unique (demons, greek/roman inspired art, etc
) and the story-line feels very fresh and not just like another iteration of "antihero becomes hero, saves world, end"
Every little sidequest i encountered was interesting, every conversation filled with lore and just the feeling of exploring this intruging new world
Tyranny does one thing no other crpg did for me this good: game-mechanics and story, combat and quests, standing with factions/npcs, everything works together


it's hard to describe, but very enjoyable if you are into the immersion crpgs can offer
On a last note: finaly a game doesn't just give you a forced good/evil deeds/reputation-system


no your actions here are never this clear defined, your actions may instill fear or favor and give benefits (combat/character-stat-wise) and story consequences which never feel like a choice between "right" or "wrong"
In my opinion the best way of implementing a standig/reputation-system i've ever seen in a game
All in this game came kinda out of nowhere and surprised me alot; one of the best games i've yet played
If you are into cprgs and still look rather for immersion and a complex game-system instead of the shooter/hack'n slay mechanics other proclaimed cprgs offer, go buy this game and take s a vacation, you won't regret it
what i would like to ad as final note is the impressive love for detail this game shows and thus the developer
the old static portaits for example are still here, but conversation show the actual characters talking and their physical reactions, missives between you and the different enteties who live in this world ad not just lore but life, backrounds are filled with enviromental effects, arcane spells are not just lore-wise cast by invocing sigils->the characters actualy draw them when casting, the same goes for all the animations


most of it is just stunning once you take a moment and look at it
All in all this is the next-gen-leap from old Infinity-Engine games to a newer age of indepth, immersion heavy crpgs, Pillars layed the groundwork, Tyranny is the next step

Product received for free
												It's too bad there's no neutral option for Steam reviews because I recommend it to cRPG fans, but don't recommend it to everyone else
Tyranny is Obsidian's latest cRPG with a twist
Instead of trying to save the world and beat the bad guys you're working for them
I received Tyranny for free for review purposes
My thoughts of Tyranny are not biased, or brought in any way
I always give my honest opinion on games and just because I didn't pay for this one doesn't change that fact
The Great:Graphics:Tyranny is a really good looking game
The environments, spells, particle effects, and even character models looked great
Usually cRPGs would do one thing really good while lack in other areas
Tyranny does everything good
I was really surprised by how good the character models looked and it made me want to spend some extra time creating my first protagonist
Character Creator:I didn't care much for the character creator until I got to the end of it
After I finished creating my first character I was able to choose my past exploits and how I helped Kyros take over the world
It was really awesome because my choices actually affected how certain factions acted towards me in game
If I decided to kill the queen the Vendrien Guard would call you, "Queenslayer" and want nothing to do with you, but if made peace with them they'll approach you with respect
There's a lot of replay value here because I want to know what the game would be like if I choose other options in the character creator
I've already started my second playthrough because I want to get a different ending in the game
Sounds:The soundtrack is awesome
As soon as the game started I heard this epic music in the background
It set the tone for the rest of game
It was imposing and sounded like a theme that a world conquering tyrant would have in my opinion
The other sounds in the game are good too
Casting spells sound like you would expect them to sound in a cRPG
There is voice acting in the game, but it's not fully voiced
I don't like this at all and I wish games like this would stop doing it
If you're going to add voice acting in your game that's fine, but make sure you do it for the whole game or don't bother doing it all
I could be talking a companion of mine and they'll speak a few sentences, but after that they won't talk anymore
I'll have to read walls of text until they decide to speak again
Thankfully the voice acting in this game is really good
It's Well Optimized:The only bug I ran into in my 25 hours of gameplay was a weird animation bug
Instead of my companion walking behind me like she should have been she was sliding all over the map
My FPS never dipped, and I never experienced any game breaking bugs
This is one of the better optimized games that has released this year
The Good:Story:It took me a while to care about what was happening in this game
I'm a fatebinder of Kyros and I help impose his will on the frontlines of battle
The lore in this game is really interesting, but the execution leaves much to be desired
I know Obsidian wanted to give the player as many options and branches as they could, but I would have preferred a set narrative over the many that we have here because none of them feel complete to me
I don't want to give out any spoilers because the game will be released in a few hours
Some of the storylines were really awesome and they way I could end a certain edict was fantastic
Getting to know my companions, the Archons, and plotting in the shadows was fun, but I never really got invested in any of it
The ending was really cool even though it ended abruptly and I do want to play through the game again to see what different choices I could make this time around
The Bad:Gameplay:I don't really enjoy playing cRPGs
I'm more of a aRPG guy, but the gameplay here is good if you don't play as a mage
There was a good variety of weapons for me to choose from, but I ended up going mage and regretting every second of it
Playing as a staff wielding mage was really boring to me
Staffs attacks are really slow and the magic system is slow too
It doesn't matter how many points I put into my quickness my spell cooldowns never changed
I don't know if this is a bug or intentional, but I stopped investing in the quickness stat just to be on the safe side
Another thing I don't like about magic in this game is the way I acquired new spells
In order to learn new spells I had to hunt them down and find them
This goes with the lore of the game because only Archons can create their own spells, but it's a bad game mechanic in my opinion
Leveling up my skills in the magic skill tree is pretty pointless if it doesn't teach me any new spells
In order to learn how to do AOE attacks I would need the right sigil and have a certain amount lore points
The problem with this that by the time I had enough lore to do AOE attacks I was at the end of the game
I never had a chance to enjoy my new abilities
Playing as  warrior or rogue is a lot better
Skill cooldowns are faster, I do more damage, and battles are over faster too, but when compared to Divinity Original Sin's gameplay this is just average at best
UI:I'm not a fan of the UI in this game
It's not modern enough for my tastes
Most cRPGs have a below average UI and this game is no different in my opinion
Loot:There's plenty of loot to find in Tyranny, but very little of it was worth my time
The legendary items that I found were great, but the majority of the items were worse than items I had found a few hours earlier
I never found any good staffs in the game
The most dps I got out of a staff was about 9dps while the rest of my party did a average of 25-35
A
I
The A
I
in this game is brain dead on every difficulty level
My party members did a decent job of engaging enemies without me having to issue them commands, but there were too many times when no one did anything even after I gave them a command
They would just stand there running back and forth doing nothing
This has got me killed a few times on higher difficulties and it's really annoying
The werewolf companion's A
I
is the most broken of all of the companions while the mages seem to have the best A
I
out of the bunch
Other npcs A
I
was just as bad as my companions
I can't tell you how many times I engaged in combat and murdered everyone because they wouldn't fight me back
The Verdict: I had a lot of fun with Tyranny, but I can only recommend this to hardcore cRPG fans
If you love games like Baldur's Gate, and Pillars of Eternity you'll love this game
You probably already preordered it and is just waiting to play it like everyone else, but if you're just a regular gamer trying to find a good game to play to hold you over until the next AAA title releases I would recommend waiting for this one to go on sale before buying it because it's not worth $45
The gameplay will satisfy the hardcore cRPG fans, but do little to impress someone new to the genre or anyone that's grown tired of it
75End NoteI purposely left out some features, and details in this review because I don't want to spoil the game for anyone on release day
I would rather you play and find out for yourself rather than having it spoiled by a game reviewer

												An odd game, very odd


The character creation part and Act I of Tyranny is some of the greatest work in the entire RPG history, I dare say
30 minutes into the game, you could easily see that whoever developed this game has got some brilliant, or even amazing ideas
Proceeding through the first act, you might feel the weight of history like Dragon Age, crafty political maneuver like Wheel of Time, and a shroud of darkness like Pillars of Eternity
If only the developer could stick to this level of quality, this game would have the potential to make history
The problem is that good things don't last for very long
Act II is somewhat exhausted in the creativity department
By the time you see Act III, it's already obvious that the developer has run out of either money or patience, and can't wait to get this game over with
Just when you are trying to cope with it and waiting for things to get better after hitting such a low point, the game's over, credit's rolling, leaving a ton of stuff either unexplained, or stupidly tied off
Would have recommended this game just for its breeze of fresh ideas
But the drop (or shall I say free falling) of quality between Act I and II (not to menion the joke pretending to be Act III) is TERRIBLE
Buy this game simply to experience the starting part if there's a damn nice discount, or else don't bother

												Have you ever noticed how, in a typical RPG (and, now that I think about it, most games in general) battles don’t really mean anything? How many times have you defeated a miniboss, only to have it stand back up and laugh at you, saying “I have underestimated you! You are a worthy opponent! This is not the end! We shall meet again!” and make a getaway? Think about it
How many times do you beat up Balrog in Cave Story only to have him fly away without a scratch? How is Black Knight able to keep running away after Shovel Knight stabs the hell out of him? How come you black out if you lose a Pokémon battle, but none of the other trainers do? And how does the big bad villain always seem to get away, even if their HP hits zero, so they can reappear in the sequel?Undertale asks the question, “What if defeating an enemy in battle always means that they die?”This might seem quite inconsequential in random encounters, but Undertale will also pit you against several main characters
If you defeat a main character in battle, they’re dead for good, and the whole story changes to reflect it
Heavy stuff
But thankfully, as the game advertises, you don’t actually have to kill anyone! The game offers a second option to get out of battles: talking the enemy out of fighting
This involves solving a simple puzzle, almost always involving the “Act” menu in battle
The puzzle changes depending on what kind of enemy you’re fighting; sometimes you’ll just need to give them a compliment, other times you’ll need to survive several of their attacks, and so on
Once they’re not emotionally invested in the battle anymore, you can “spare” them, and the battle ends
You won’t get any EXP for it, but you’ll still get gold
It’s a very unique fighting mechanic!I admit, after my first playthrough of the game, I was disappointed in the story’s presentation
I thought that both the very beginning and the final area of the game were fantastic, dripping with shocking emotional dilemmas, but the middle 80% of the game’s content seemed like it relied too much on oddball humor and not much else
The game hilariously plays with expectations and has no shortage of genuinely witty satire of its genre, and I found myself amused by nearly all of it, but after the first two hours as I was walking across long linear worlds and listening to dozens of characters try to tell me jokes, I started to wonder where the emotional gravity had gone
“Why is this game making me laugh, when I thought it was supposed to make me cry?” I asked myself
“Where are the feelings? After such an excellent and powerful prologue, why is the game taking so long to show me more?”Later that night, as I was lying awake in bed, the answer hit me: the game was quirky and lighthearted because I was sparing everyone’s life
I wasn’t playing as a murderer
If you want this game to have drama, you have to cause it
And I think that’s where all the hype is coming from, all the talk about player choice
This is a game about being a tree-hugging pacifist, or a murderous psychopath who kills anyone who gets in the way, or anything in between
You only need to live with whomever you decide to be, because the game won’t let you ignore what you have done
Though it isn’t the most visually impressive game, and the stage design isn’t always the best, Undertale has left me feeling that I have just witnessed a work of art
It tried some new and ambitious things and isn’t ashamed of what it wanted to be
It's about 6 hours long; I’d recommend anyone to play it at least twice, just to be able to say that they've made their own choices and seen what the game has to offer
It’s hard to imagine that anyone would regret the experience

												Ten dollars
Only a few hours of gameplay
16-bit graphics compared to the flashy 1080p stuff in standard games
But


wow
Undertale blew me away
It doesn't need flashy graphics or even fanservice to falsify its enjoyment
It just does things right, and boy that was one immensely enjoyable experience
I think most of the magic of this game comes from knowing absolutely nothing about it
I got this game from a friend and just decided to play it since it looked very interesting and it was getting good responses
So I went in completely blind, knowing nothing but the game's name
And I'm glad I did, because everything the game presented to me was unexpected, notably dark in places, and very emotional, which would have been lost entirely if i watched someone else play it
So, if you happened to have been flooded by everything Undertale on tumblr (god help us) and the entire story's already laid out for you, the magic has been lost and the game won't be as incredible of an experience
I'm sorry
Of course, I call Undertale an "experience", not a game, only because it does such a fantastic job at it
Following the motto on the store page, "the game where you don't have to destroy anyone", the game always tries to nudge you in that direction, taking a back seat in your mind and reminding you to "Spare them!"
And of course, you answer with "Why? Why should I do that when it offers me the option to kill anyone I want right in front of me? What's in it for me?" And that's where the game literally turns into a personal experience, as everyone has a different response for the game's selling point
And boy, does it turn to black or white pretty fast from here
Undertale's ability to completely turn the tables of its story depending on your actions is massive
Upon your game's startup, every little thing you do will be set in stone in the game's story pathing
If you're the type who immerses yourself into the game's charming music, laughs at the childish but hiliarious anctics, and is willing to hork down healing items just to prevent yourself from killing a monster just because a fight is difficult, the game rewards you
It opens up a very character-developing and world-unfolding story, along with some of the most emotionally invested boss battles I have ever experienced
You know a game is good when it breaks the fourth wall so well that you're shaking in your seat in true fear and can't stop the shivers, all while having to fight a hopelessly overpowered god of a boss
The amazing writing only starts once you beat the final few bosses, and the story doesn't stop being good from there onwards
On the other hand, what makes this game different is that it keeps its dark side from you, and its entirely your choice to experience it
If you scoff at the game's sparing choice since you're too cool or grown up to possibly be nice to people, you can go around and intentionally sink your weapon into a monster who just wants to be a friend
And unlike many other games, this isn't just a simple moment of "Oops, I killed another unnamed enemy, let's reset the game and nothing changes"


the weight of a dark choice is huge
Nothing can be taken back, and it forever changes your playthrough
Reset the game, and the characters know
Events change
And with each curious kill, you, in turn, turn from the only human in a land of monsters into the biggest monster in a land of innocents
In the end, ignoring what Undertale sets out to do, which is to let you experience childlike innocence and fun, only makes it delibrately change the game into a quieter, more grim story
Very little character development, and the world isn't explained to you, nothing
There's very little reward for going through this route
Yet it is a choice you can do
Granted, you get two of the hardest boss battles by becoming the murderer and will be forced into Game Overs repeatedly from them, but even that is a message from the game


It's trying to stop you from getting to the end of this route
Before its too late
It's as if you're doing deeds in an actual living, breathing world
And that's what makes it even more terrifying when you decide to become a murderer instead of a savior, because only you know that you're willingly going forward to obliterate every weakling in front of you
It's a test of your willpower, and it's your choice
The worst thing? The damage cannot be repaired
Go clean, or go home tainted
The game even gives you the choice to completely delete everyone's happiness after the most satisfying happy ending
The happiness you worked so hard to earn
And you can even become the murderer after saving the world, which will only permanently taint your game and never let you have a satisfying ending again
That's absolutely brutal, and yet that's still a choice
Amazing
Yes, this game might not be for everyone
The humour may become dry after a while for some people, and tons of gamers nowadays like to bash at popular games instead of trying it out, just because they feel accomplished by doing it
But, if like me, you are willing to experience why everyone's been talking about this game, give it a shot
Hell, even if you hate the game to bits and want to kill everyone, buy the game, do so, and at least have your own personal experience before refunding it
This game does the morality concept so well that other games can only dream of doing the same, and it is one not to be forgotten
It is a sin to call Undertale a game
Doing that would categorize Undertale into the bland and consequence-free "kill-em-all" genres that a lot of games are falling into now
Undertale is a story-driven, emotional experience
			
Posted: 22 October, 2015
												This is one of those few games that come along when times are bleak, and games have become regularly bland and heartless
Where you feel disenfranchised with the whole idea of video games
And you begin to start ask "Why?"


Like "Why should we play games?", "Why are games different from other media?", "Why should you use games as a form of expression?" and even "Why even play games at all?!" Undertale come along and says, "This is why
"

												(Mostly spoiler-free review)I hate turn-based RPGs
This is my Game of the Year
What
After becoming ULTRA-JADED about gaming with the cancellation of Silent Hills, this game re-established that games can be really, really frickin good
This thing was made with an incredible amount of love, and it shows in every nook and cranny, every joke, every secret conversation you never thought a game dev would have thought to include
Tobyfox is the most thorough dev ever
I'm continuously impressed with how many things he thought to include in this game, and how he managed to make it all extremely fun the entire way through
You'd think you've seen everything in this game, but you haven't
There's always another amazing thing, another way to turn the genre on its head, another great joke you didn't see coming
And it stays engaging the entire time, supported by a cast of fantastic, endearing, hilarious characters
Great puzzles too, imo! It avoids all the things about (turn-based and non) RPGs that I despise: -There's no grinding (unless you want to)-Battles are a great length and never overstayed their welcome for me-There's no boring menu-navigation-only-based combat (bullet dodging/timing-based stuff really spices it up, as well as bossfights always having a new, really fun gameplay twist on them!)-There's no unlikable/unrelatable characters that go on and on about you being the "Chosen One" or whatever-No plot where you gotta go to the 7 temples and find the 7 sacred whatevers and then oh wait now that you've gotten those 7 sacred whatevers, you gotta go to 4 extra places and get 4 SUPER sacred whatevers


-No backtracking (unless you want to! Backtracking is actually usually rewarded with more fun conversations and such
)-No constant equipping and unequipping items because, oh, this one is +2 Def but -3 Speed but THIS one is +3 Speed and -2 Def but THIS one is immune to fire and this one is


-It actually has a way more complex, useful moral than "Evil is Bad, Good is Good
" Everyone has relateable motivations
-The writing doesn't suck like 90% of RPGs
It has a wonderful sense of humor and a simple plot that is underlaid with complex emotions
-Has jokes about anime, doesn't take itself seriously
I could gush about it forever
Undertale's not only made me less jaded about gaming, but also less jaded about real life
It has a strong message about empathy that stays everpresent, while somehow not being cloying about it, or shoving the message down your throat
It's simply a wonderful experience, please play this thing!!

												Fantastic game
 The whole way through, the experience feels like watching a really good South Park episode or South Park movie, and the game is a *really* solid RPG, to boot
But the game isn't without its flaws
 I want to spend a few paragraphs on some criticisms of the game, and then we'll talk about what makes the game awesome
The game feels heavily "consolized
"  Loading screens are far more frequent than they should be and the controls often don't make much sense
 Throughout the game your character will be taught "magic spells" from various NPCs
 Each time you learn a spell, you are taught a series of controls to use that spell
 However, these spells can be used both in and out of combat, and in both situations the controls are different from one another—and in neither situation is the spell invoked the same way the game inititally taught you!Your out-of-combat utilities (like firing a ranged weapon at something in the environment or sending a buddy to perform a task) are equally awkward to select and use
Now, here I should note that I played with a controller attached to a PC
 I started the game with a keyboard/mouse but changed very, very early on to give my normal gaming posture a rest (I play games a lot with the keyboard/mouse), and also because South Park: The Stick of Truth seemed to be tailored more toward a controller
 Perhaps the controls are better with a keyboard/mouse, but using a controller felt awkward in many parts of the game
 But not in combat
 In combat the controls felt great
 More on that later, though
On top of that, the game's humor can be off-putting in some parts
 This isn't a real criticism so much as it is a warning—it IS South Park, after all!  The show has a reputation of making comedy material out of even the most sensitive of topics, and this game also doesn't hold back
 I like to think of myself as a fairly easy-going guy and I try not to take many things too seriously, but there were parts in this game that I felt myself somewhat rushing through or avoiding just to get away from an uncomfortable topic
There's a lot of back-and-forth running around the map in this game, and loading screens are absolutely everywhere
 The loading screens are a real slowdown
So let's see
 The loading screens, the really iffy controls in much of the game, and the warning about how the game remains very South Park in its humor are all the things I wanted to make sure to mention
 So, now we can talk about the stuff that makes this game a fantastic one!While moving on the map and navigating menus is often awkward with the game's controls, combat is something the game gets very, very right
 As I mentioned earlier, this game is a very solid RPG, and The Stick of Truth's turn-based combat is airtight
 This isn't your typical "select an ability and watch what happens" kind of turn-based combat
 Here, you'll select an ability, and then you'll influence the outcome of the ability with some simple, but fun controls
For example, Butters the Paladin has a "Hammer of Justice" ability
 To use it, you select it and then choose a target
 The game then has you rotate the left control stick in circles to make Butters spin (think Olympic discus tossing), and at just the right instant, press the A button
 Succeed, and you'll deal bonus damage to the enemy!  If you mess up, Butters will still deal damage, but not as much
 Again, this is coming from the perspective of using a gamepad to control the game; I'm sure this is different for a mouse/keyboard, but the principle is the same
Combat is filled with awesome stuff like this
 When you are attacked, most of the time you are given the chance to block some of the enemy's damage by pressing A at just the right time
 Some enemy attacks strike multiple times, requiring multiple well-timed blocks!  Different enemy attacks have different timings as well, so you'll always need to be on your guard
These combat mechanics make even turn-based combat a very active affair
 The action is fast and challenging, so you'll need to be spot on with your controls
 Thankfully, controls in combat are responsive and intuitive, and anytime there's some ambiguity about what to do in battle, there are useful tooltips and pop-ups to remind you of how to use an ability
While combat is great fun, the game also very often presents you with multiple ways of dealing with foes
 Sometimes you can distract them and sneak by
 Other times you can use the environment to defeat your foes without having to confront them
 Keen awareness of your surroundings and appropriate use of your abilities out of combat can speed up your progress and yield satisfying results
It should be noted that if you sneak by enemies, you probably won't get experience for dealing with them
 But in the cases where you can use the environment to defeat them, you'll be awarded experience as if you had battled them!There are many quests to accomplish throughout the game, and a few side quests can be completed as you progress
 As far as questing is concerned, it's your typical RPG fare—pick up a quest, complete the objectives, turn the quest in
 The game does nothing to revolutionize questing, but it handles questing very well
The story-based quests, however, are always greatly satisfying to accomplish because you are awarded not only with experience and often loot/money, but also with story exposition done in only the way South Park can
 It really does feel like you're earning a little piece of a South Park episode or South Park movie when you complete a story quest
The writing in the game is spot on
 You'll get to watch the South Park characters you're so familiar with do the things they do, in the way they do them, while interacting with one another and with your character
 I found the story largely fun and interesting
I was often quite pleased with the developers' efforts to include as many South Park characters as they could in the game
 This could not have been an easy task to accomplish, but the game is solid through-and-through with the show's characters, and because the show has been running so long, these characters bring with them their histories, backdrops, and references that the South Park fan should thoroughly enjoy
Character customization is very in-depth for a game with such a simplistic visual style
 You'll begin the game by choosing a class, and then customizing your looks
 As the game progresses, you will find, like, a bajillion different ways to customize your charcter's costume ("gear"), hair, facial features, makeup, and accessories
 You'll even find "strap-ons" (for weapons) and "patches" (for armor) that let you add significant bonuses to your gear, letting you really specialize or round out your character and playstyle
I did make a warning above about the game's humor, but for South Park fans, that (most of the time) means you're in for more of what you enjoy about the show
 There were plenty of times I found myself actually laughing out loud at the characters' antics; or at the writing; or at the timing of a joke; or just at South Park being South Park
 It's a funny game
There is also a difficulty slider bar
 Early in the game I cranked the difficulty to max and didn't look back, and for me, it was quite rewarding
 The window of opportunity to block enemy attacks seemed drastically smaller, necessitating more precise timing, and enemies often didn't go down without a fight
 I had to stay on top of my gear choices and customize appropriately
 Which buddy to bring into battle with me was also a serious consideration, and more than once I had to stock up on potions
Overall, it's just a really solid RPG, and I'd strongly recommend it to any South Park fan
 I could go on about it, but I feel I've covered most of the relevant aspects of the game, and apparently Steam has a character limit for reviews

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE:I have played this game extensively when my internet was down (which was 3 days long) so Steam did not record my game time
Steam does not record game time while offline and if I remember correctly I should have 10-11 hours clocked in
INTRODUCTION:South Park: The Stick of Truth is a 2014 role-playing game based on the popular TV show South Park
The game was developed by Obsidian Entertainment, and surprisingly enough, published by Ubisoft in one of those occasions where they release a game that is not broken or tied to Uplay
Good job Ubisoft!PLOT (No Spoilers):The story takes place in the town of South Park where you, the player, take on the role of the 'new kid' who holds a mysterious power of making friends really fast
Upon arriving, you quickly learn about an ongoing 'Battle' (game) between the Human forces of Cartman and the Drow Elves loyal to Kyle for the control of an artifact of limitless power called 'The Stick of Truth'
PROS:+ Great art style that mimics the TV Series with great accuracy making the game feel more like an episode of the TV show rather than a video game
+ High resolution art works and good animations+ Great sound design that remains true to the TV series' quality+ Wonderful voice acting featuring the original cast and Adolf Hitler[www
imdb
com]+ Good old fashion South Park humor (See NEUTRAL #2)+ Very fun and well integrated gameplay mechanics+ Good amount of Easter eggs from the TV Show+ Excellent overall presentation starting from the character creation screen until the end credits+ Excellent Story+ Fun Canada mini-game+ Good amount of character customization however


(See CON #2)+ No Uplay account neededCONS:- Gameplay becomes repetitive after a while- Very limited armor & weapon customization and selection- No crafting mechanic to fix the above CON- Useless DLC itemsNEUTRAL:+/- Excusable 30 fps lock because it works well with the graphics, gameplay and artstyle+/- The South Park toilet and black/dark humor may not appeal to everyone (so if you don't like South Park to begin with, you will probably not like this game as well
)+/- The story is fairly linear but the presentation makes it feel as if it was open worldCONCLUSION:EXCELLENT game for South Park fans all around
This game preserves the look and feel of the series while integrating very fun and entertaining gameplay mechanics that would rival even some of the much more established RPG games
WORTH IT?:I can RECOMMEND this game at its full price only if you're a South Park fan because chances are, any fan of the series would fully appreciate all the extra content and easter eggs from the show
 However, if you're not a fan of the series but don't particularly hate it, get the game during a sale
If you hate the series and/or you're easily offended / triggered by dark / toilet humor I would not recommend purchasing this game

												(TLDR? This review is also available in video format if you scroll down
)Since 1997, South Park has graced television with its profane, unabashed, and satiric humor
 With its success it has managed to become a part of American culture and spawn a full length movie and several video games along the way but none are quite up to level as South Park: The Stick of Truth
With the help of Obsidian Entertainment, Matt Stone and Trey Parker have created the most accurate transfer of an intellectual property to games ever made
 That being said, this is a game made with longtime fans of the series in mind
 If you're not a fan of the show, or don't appreciate its style of humor your experience may differ drastically from the intended audiences
The Stick of Truth picks up shortly after the trilogy events of Season 17
 After an initial character creation screen you wake up as “the new kid” in South Park
Upon leaving your house, you'll befriend your neighbor, Butters, and venture on over to Cartman's house where he and Kenny, along with an ensemble of South Park regulars, are role-playing as a warring fantasy faction of humans that guard a sacred relic known as the Stick of Truth
 After a brief introduction and Cartman honoring you with a chosen name his kingdom is assaulted by a band of elves who manage to steal the holy object
 As in typical South Park fashion, the small and insignificant somehow manages to eventually involve the whole town and powers beyond as the story snowballs you through the town's workings, aliens, government interference, and of course


Nazi zombies
One thing that's blatantly obvious from early on is that this isn't cable television's South Park
 This is a humor much more akin to the 1999 South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut, except on steroids and about 15 hours long, which is relatively short for a game of this genre
 Much of the humor is crude and meant to be insulting, but fans of the show will find it quite satisfying
The South Park writers were really on their A game and the show makes constant references to its own history, from every single piece of junk you pick up to who or what is in each of the boy's closets
 The amount of detail and respect this game has for the source material is really quite amazing
Its visual style makes you feel like you're actually playing the show and people walking by may not know the difference
 The game play involves you picking one of four classes, each with their own unique playing-styles
The combat plays out similarly to most JRPGs with a turn-based system that rewards timed button presses similar to Super Mario RPG
 You’re also able to choose one of six companions to follow you at different points of the game each with their own distinct abilities
 It's a streamlined but fun system that forces you to pay attention while you play, although its simplicity doesn't offer much in the way of a challenge
 Occasionally you'll also be presented opportunities in which combat can be avoided or reduced by taking advantage of the environment around the foe
 It's a great feature to have, as with most turn-based RPGs, combat isn't the high point and creates a nice rewarding dynamic when you see an opportunity to kill an enemy without direct confrontation
To offset the impressively accurate paper cut out visuals, Stick of Truth employs a very serious orchestral soundtrack
 You'll frequently be reminded of Game of Thrones and Skyrim while listening
Its contrast to the material creates a great comedic effect
The voice acting remains true to the show, with Matt and Trey supplying most of the voice work, often with the same voices for different characters, with the Nazi's having an effectively hilarious voice track
While the content provided is an impressive representation of South Park, its accuracy raises the expectations enough so that when something from the series doesn't show up, it can be a bit disappointing
Some characters and locations are missing and one can’t help but think they were deliberately left out to allow for DLC and/or a sequel
South Park: The Stick of Truth is a great game for people who appreciate the show or have a similar taste in humor
 It can be a bit polarizing but that's to be expected with a title such as this
 The writing is rich and full of references that fans will truly appreciate, but sometimes, as with the show some of the jokes can get old at times
Luckily however, there are enough jokes in this game to be thoroughly enjoyable throughout its somewhat brief duration
A relatively easy difficulty, and lack of post-game content and a somewhat questionable quest reward system, where you'll frequently get items well after they've had any use to you can cause a bit of tedium to set in
The gameplay holds its own, it doesn't do anything new or amazing but the charm that saturates every aspect of it makes it feel special
This is, hands down, the best South Park game ever made
 If you're looking for the definitive South Park experience, waiting for season 18 or just want to laugh, this is the game for you
TLDR? Here's a video my friend and I put together: https://www
youtube
com/watch?v=14c4uo2bQA8Pros:+ Honors the source material+ Great writing+ Looks exactly like the show+ Always present personality+ Best South Park Game Ever MadeCons:- Combat is a bit easy and simple- Short length when compared to most RPGs (Around 15 hours)- Need to be a fan of the show to fully appreciate itIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store

Early Access Review
								Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!I'm about one


maybe two good jump scares away from being institutionalized
Playing as an Indonesian schoolgirl with a magic phone, an archeologist with amnesia, and a toddler with diapers full to the brim has had an ill effect on me
My heart just can't take it – my mind just can't take it
The filaments that hold my fragile psyche aloft are pulled taut, straining as each frayed fiber falters and my sanity slips closer towards the cold, dark depths of derangement
Which isn't super great, really
But I'll gladly surrender my faculties for a game as fun as “Darkwood
”“Darkwood” isn't a “Slender” or “Amnesia” clone
This is a game in the vein of old school horror where atmosphere was king – you'll hear lots of comparisons to the “Silent Hill” series
The key to good horror is cultivating a crushing, foreboding world environment


one that fosters paranoia and unease the whole way through
Sure, jumpscares are necessary to finally break the tension, but the best horror games are dripping and oozing in atmosphere
The whole world should FEEL hostile, not just the denizens that inhabit it
This game doesn't want you playing it, no
It wants to play you
Here's what you can expect playing “Darkwood:” your hands should be clammy with an itch you can't scratch, not now
Your face should be inches from your monitor, blinking only when necessary, scanning wildly back and forth for something, ANYTHING, to betray the game's ill intent
As you talk with each bizarre NPC you should feel nervous, wondering when the conversation will go from benignly creepy to malignantly violent
And when you finally encounter an unspeakable horror, you'll have to make that gut decision whether to run or stand your ground
I recommend running
Like with all survivor horrors, you are at a notable disadvantage
You'll also be able to set up hasty barricades


rocking back and forth as claws scratch and jaws click outside, tearing your defenses down piece by piece
There are a lot of cool things happening with this game
Your vision is funneled, forcing the aforementioned wild scanning
You can see the world generally in your “peripheral vision,” but you have to be looking relatively dead-on to see any actual threats
They'll be effectively invisible otherwise
You'll inject yourself with concoctions extracted from fauna and flora that provide mutations
They will grant a boost in one way and a hindrance in another
There's a crafting aspect that's pretty basic right now but feels natural


rough and raw
Besides health you have a stamina meter, one you'll have to keep an eye on when deciding whether to fight or fly
Graphically speaking, “Darkwood” isn't exactly next gen, but it is highly stylized and creepy
It's a beautiful, dark, Gothic painting – like the ones where the eyes follow you wherever you go and it talks smack about your mother
And the music will chill you to the bone
If the environment and enemies start to give you a little break, don't worry
The music will swell and put you right back on edge, or the heavy creaks and sudden cracks of the sound design
Like any good horror this is a challenging game
I do recommend playing with permadeath on
Adds to the spook factor! Anticipate shedding lots of your own pixelated blood
My biggest gripes? It's hard to determine sometimes (between how dark the game is and how


generally dark the colors are) what  I can search and interact with and what's just a creepy thingy
The controls also take some getting used to, but that seems appropriate considering the genre
Now seeing that this is an Early Access title my recommendation is tentative and subject to change
But at the moment there is nothing out on Steam quite like this
Every day you hear people bemoan the death of “true survival horror,” myself being one of them
Well folks, it wasn't dead
Just waiting for the right moment to sing its siren song


and draw us in at least once more, into those dark and dreary woods where light dares not penetrate and your screams can't quite escape

Early Access Review
								<Subject to change>My first few hours in Darkwood were certainly very interesting, after the impressive prologue I decided to go speak to an NPC i was advised to find
After I did this I realised daylight was running out, and here's what happened next:-Returned to my safehouse and pushed a wardrobe up against a gaping hole in the wall
-Panicked because I didn't bother to collect the tools necessary to barricade the house
-Everything is now pitch black, my cone of vision is   tiny -I weep as I slowly walk myself to the 'front lobby' room because it has no windows to reduce the chance of being spotted
-I hear the moans of some unknown ethereal horror-Check both the exterior and interior door to ensure they are closed-The moaning gets louder-The action prompt for the front door now says 'close door', meaning it has been  opened -My cone of vision is still 2-3ft btw-I quickly close the door-The prompt changed to 'close door' again-I close the door again-Moaning is still extremely loud-Continue in this pattern for 60 seconds in sheer terror before the door finally stays closed for a while
-I sigh a breath of relief-Something swiftly moves past the far edge of my cone of vision-* very loud moaning continues  *-The monster was in the lobby with me for the whole night-I'm sure i'm going to die-Suddenly Daybreak-*Day 2*

												Wow, what a journey
A top down actual survival horror game that actually has an intriguing storyline
Categories typically get a base score, followed by pros and cons
Graphics: 9/10==========Many will question why I give this game a 9
I don't believe graphics have to have 1000000000 polygons to be good
This game chose a more pixel style of graphics with what I believe to be some hand drawn environments
Whatever it is, the composition comes together so damn well
The Depth of field on trees that are high up in the air way above your character, to the animations of enemies and your character, to the fire and flames and 3D buildings
It all looks great and has fantastic polish
Well done
+9Story: 8/10========This is a game where I can't really give a synopsis to what is going on
You will just have to play the game
+8Some major/minor character questlines have unexplained and unforetold consequences to the story and your surrounding environment
This isn't necessarily a bad thing but it has a chance of frustrating you since you probably won't be able to go back and change it (unless you reset very quickly)
As someone who always tries to achieve the best ending possible, this affected my "try not to die" playthrough
+/- 0Sound/Music: 10/10==============10 out of freaking 10
This is a game where you will constantly be saying to yourself "wtf was that noise
" From the subtle footsteps you'll occasionally hear of someone walking around in your hideout that isn't you, to the creepy eerie music that confronts you upon approaching a critical point in the storyline
It's all brilliant
+9No jumpscares
+1Gameplay: 9/10===========Gameplay revolves around scouraging for supplies and progressing the storyline in the daytime, to surviving the nighttime in your house against the perils of the forest
+2Crafting system is easy to understand, works great, and is implemented without frustration (besides missing a needed supply)
+1Fair difficulty settings ranging from Normal (infinite lives), to Hard (limited lives), to Nightmare (one life)
+1Enemies are varied in difficulty as the game progresses and all have unique abilities that might just end your 1 life playthrough
They are however readable, learnable, and aren't frustrating to deal with
You get the hard mode without the headache
+2Again, no jumpscares
+1Events that take place directly at the hideout at nighttime are brilliant and creepy
One night you may not encounter a single enemy, but instead will find someone knocking on your door to leave you supplies
Another night you'll face against 10 Huge Dogs
Good luck
+2Unique category, Lighting and Vision: 10/10================================Darkwood gets its own category of how it handles the lighting and the vision in this game
It takes into account not only the visual perspective of your character's eyes, but also of electricity, and fire, and whatever the hell those things are later in the game that emit light
Sometimes an enemy will temporarily destroy all electrical sources of light
Lets hope you have some torches or a flare! Even things such as getting poisoned, or drunk on alcohol will affect your given vision, typically narrowing it for a period
And there are abilities that give you greater vision
Some enemies simply require that you don't look directly at them, no matter how close you may be to them, and they can't do a damn thing to you
It's these things that I feel needed to be accounted for, for how brilliantly they're used
Well done
+10Overall: 9
2/10 (46/50 = 0
92)=====================It's not often I buy a game that I am just so utterly excited to play again the next day
I'm sure I'm not the only one
For what Darkwood is, it nails just about every aspect of its intended presentation
Well done developers!

Early Access Review
								Dear Journal: I keep coming back to life, despite my best efforts
I thought death would be a release, but it's only a continuation of the torment
In what I'm sure is a futile effort to keep my sanity, I will try to catalogue my various deaths
Death 1:No weapons in sight and night is falling rapidly
In a misguided attempt to make the animals friendlier towards me, I've brewed a strange concoction from the local mycological flora and injected myself with it
The only effect I've seen towards my original intention was that the rabbits have stopped gnashing their teeth when I approach and have opted for a more subtle, indignant sideways glance
Night fell and I drank the well water as I was told by the nonchalant wolfman (nonchalant in that he seemed to have no compunctions that he was a freak of nature) that woke me up
The generator has failed and my only light is the mocking phosphorescent glow of my last flare
I hear things approaching
Hungry things
I've pushed my wardrobe in front of the window in the hopes that it would stop them
It did not, and a howling naked man has bashed my skull in and, presumably, eaten me
Death 2:Woken up by the wolfman again
He doesn't seem to remember me
I show him the dogtag as before and, as before, he tells me to seek out the chicken lady
My travels this time have been more fruitful
I've discovered several nonfunctional vehicles nearby, each containing a substantial amount of fuel
Hopefully this will help me keep the generator running this time
I've also found enough material to fashion a crude weapon for my inevitable self-defense
On top of that, I've found a bear trap with which to lay a trap for any more au naturel forest men that want to avail themselves of my sweetmeats
Once again, night falls and I drink from the well
I'm somewhat prepared this time
Again they come
I catch one in the bear trap and proceed to beat him into submission
Shortly after, another bursts in behind me, catching me by surprise
A pitched battle erupts, with me barely surviving to fell my opponent
I'm bleeding badly, but have enough rags to fashion a welcome, if somewhat unsanitary, bandage
Eventually morning arives and I stride wrecklessly back out into the forest, perchance to happen upon more provisions and survive another night in this hellish place
I happen upon a corpse, seemingly hidden under a jagged thicket
Immediately upon poking it, it explodes and I'm slain by its cadaverous stench
Death 3:Again the wolfman comes
I think he's mocking me
Is it a he? It sounds male
I have little luck in finding anything useful in my wanderings
The woods are crawling with wolves (the normal kind


I didn't think to stop and check their gender), and I have to skirt around them constantly
I find some alcohol, rags, and a lighter, but little else
At least I can keep warm with this, one way or another
Night falls and I drink the water
I'm beginning to wonder if I should be following the wolfman's advice at this point
For all I know, it's the well water that's keeping me here
I can do nothing but sit in my dark house, hoping they don't find me and tear me limb from limb
My hopes are completely unfounded
Having no other weapons, I quickly fashion a crude Molotov cocktail and hold it at the ready for when something crashes through the window in front of me
Alas, one crashes in behind me
Panicking, I drop the freshly lit incendiary at my feet, immediately catching myself and the wildman ablaze
I'm not sure which of us died first
I can now officially say that immolation has been my least favorite way to go
Death 4:Banshee


or witch? I'm unsure at this point
Death 5:Pack of wolves
Gender unknown
Death 6:%$@&ing CORPSE BOMB!Death 7: Ok, this is getting a little ridiculous
I'm just going to sit in my house and pretend I'm dead
Maybe the universe, or whatever cruel deity placed me here, will forget that I exist and move on to torment some other poor soul


Nope
Ten out of ten
Would die again!

								This games makes a great impression in the prologue and in your first night out of the tutorial
Mine went like this
-I was able to gather a bit of resources and boarded up a door and a window-I turned on the generator since I moved a lamp into a room I thought would be perfect-I moved the lamp to the window which was boarded up so I could see outside as well as inside-As the night got darker I see creatures outside through the small cracks within the boarded up window-Moans closing in and sounds of furniture moving in the room next to mine-The generator dies and everything is now pitch black-I sit for a while in the darkness-When the door opens and this THING enters-I was luckily able to kill it with my plank with nails in it-Close the door and hold out-Day 2 starts and I leave the room I was in-I check the house to see how it got in-NOTHING was moved from its original spot and no windows or doors were brokenSo


how did it get in?			
Posted: 20 August
												I abstained from writing this review until Darkwood was publicly released
That being said, I've owned this game well over two years, so I've got quite a bit to say
To compare this game to others would be a crime, but if I had to, I'd say that Darkwood feels like playing Hotline Miami, if HM were inside of the Blair Witch Project
The top-down perspective may seem like an odd choice for a survival horror, but it ends up working very well in Darkwood, since your cone of vision is small, and the added challenge of having to mouse over areas to see underneath tree cover adds to a perfectly executed sense of claustrophobia
The primary gameplay loop of Darkwood is fairly simple: Explore, scavenge, and arm yourself during the day, then gas up your generator and wait out the night
If you fail to make it back to your safehouse and power on the lights before dark, Bad Things® will happen
What makes nighttime truly terrifying in Darkwood is the lack of a sleep mechanic: You are awake at all times and constantly afraid that your pitiful house defenses will be breached and you'll suffer Even More Bad Things®
The sound design also adds so much to that tension of waiting out the night
You'll hear footsteps outside your door
You'r door will be beaten upon
Things will go bump in the night, and you'll be cowering in the corner waiting, praying, for that music to start and your screen to go red, signifying the successful survival of another night
Setting and plot wise, Darkwood has the most compelling location and premise of any horror game I've ever played
I won't spoil much, just remember to respect the trees
Controls and game feel are 100% spot-on
Graphics look very good, especially if you like little details (Just look at how the grass moves!) Buy the game
Door code couldn't be simpler

Early Access Review
								So, I invested 31 days (in game time) to one world, thinking I could go through it and get some of the many endings this game provides
On the 30th day I go into a hellish pigshed and find a monstrosity that no words can describe, the only way of ending said creature (besides being insane and fighting it directly) was to electricute it
In order to do this I needed a particular cable that was sold by a good buddy of mine called Piotrek, whom I had just given all the items to for the rocket he was building
At the time he was really excited about this and told me that by tomorrow he was going to fly to the moon or something of that sort
What was unknown to him was that I had allowed the Wolfman to see one of the components to his rocket (I had no clue that this would cause the ship to explode, sadly
) So the very next day I walk to  Piotrek's house only to see him dead on the ground, skewered by the many pieces of shrapnel that came out of the exploding pile of junk
In a flood of sadness and fury, I head over back to the wolf camp and began talking to my partner in crime, whom was sh*tting himself in laughter after seeing the explosion
Once I realized that I wasn't able to finish off the monstrosity, I stride behind the Wolfman, brought out my pistol and put a bullet into the back of his head
I then promptly loot the dead man's body and walk out into the middle of the meadow as I waited for the time to tick away
As the sun set I felt my body begin to corrode away until my heart stopped, and I fell to the ground dead
I'm sorry, Piotrek

								After playing this game for 19 hours learning all about the game since this is the first spaz game i bought i came into a troublesome bug that the dev team replied quickly and did thier best to help fix this problem but sadly couldnt due to it getting corrupted and the bug not able to be replicated
So the devs sent me a fixed version of just past the mission where it bugged out and gave some recources for lost progress after they did that i had to write this review and just say thank you to the devs for thier support and keep building an amazing game have a nice day :D

Early Access Review
								I can't describe how much I love this game
There is an amazing amount of polish and balance, from the visuals and the strategic depth, all the way to the raw and dirty visceral depths that combat can descend to
Let me tell you about the combat; It is good
My most memerable battle so far was a 2v2 where I aided a weaker captain vs a bandit, only for a high level bandit to join in
Bandit capital ships are weaker but they have an insane number and reserve of strike craft, which increases by level (not fighters, those are different)
My ally engaged the motherships while I thinned the swarm but he was being overwhelmed, so I rammed the strongest enemy and kept thrusting to push him away (ramming is a big mechanic, more on it later)
Freed to 1v1, my ally succeeded in destroying the first pirate, but at high cost; his shields down, his nose and two wing modules torn off and floating free, a core destroyed and his health but a sliver
Sensing blood, the swarm of strike craft pounced
There was nothing I could do to save him
He exploded magnificently, destroying many of his attackers who were too slow to flee
The remaining pirate and I circled while exchanging broadsides, each deadly piroette bringing us closer to a field of asteroids
His strongest weapons were on his nose and he fought to bring them to bear
I, meanwhile, was slightly more manoeuverable and clung on the the relative safety of his rear, while picking of the remaining swarm
Our shields failed at the same time
Shields, armour and hull are not just 3 interchangeable stats in SPAZ2
Shields are the most familiar, a flat, regenerating, protective field
Armour is different
Every single non core piece of the motherships have their own armour, some of which is shared to the core
If a part loses all its armour, it is torn off, and sometimes destroyed
Hull, or health is only relevent to the cores of the ship and when that is gone; boom
So unlike other games, it isn't destroy shields>armour>hull with various piercing weapons, it is shields>tear them to pieces or shoot straight for the core
We tore each other to pieces
I took his right wings out but clipped an asteroid at speed, destroying my left
Caught against it, he was able to bring his nose to bear, shreading off my remaining wings and one of my engines
Now he was more manoeuverable
In despairation, I boosted, smaller asteroids tearing into my hull until I placed a large one between us
Frustrated momentarily, he stopped and reloaded
Seizing this last opportunity, I came out of hiding behind him, my last weapons pounding his engine, trying to even the score
But it wasn't enough
He began to turn and rained fire on my last engine
Before I could be left helpless, I once more boosted, this time straight at his exposed engine, knocking it into the void while my nose crumpled and exploded
Both helpless now, no engines, but still he had weapons and he slowly, ever so slowly, turned to bring that hateful nose to bear
With nothing left, I had a moment of inspiration and grabbed the astreroid chunks with my tractor beam
In space, surrounded by the refuse of awesome technology, I beat him to death with a rock
A narrow victory, I collected the refuse of our 4 ships to just bearly rebuild 1, and then jumped to the void
All actions described above REALLY ARE IN THE GAME
If two things collide, they do armour type damage (very weak vs shields, weak vs hull) to eachother based on their mass and speed
If you can get an enemies shields down while yours are still up, boost at him/her, smash their bits off! Beware of ramming with your shields down, as you can wreck yourself
Finally, you can rebuild your mothership WHILE IN COMBAT
A wing came off? Try and grab it before it goes to far, and reattach it! Enemies powerful weapon came off? Remove your own and replace it!Did I mention I love this game?Also, there are so many viable ways of building your mothership, and none are perfect for all situations
I keep parts in storage to swap forms when dealing with different kinds of threats (General flying, starbases, pirates, mining) but my general form is the ION shield ram: Huge shields/thrust and some ION weapons or lasers to take down shields so I can ram them
It is weak to strike craft and starbases however, and is hard to mine with

 “Do you realize crew members suffocated on the lower decks because you routed power from life support to play stupid video games?” Space Pirates and Zombies 2 (SPAZ 2) is a hybrid 3-D space simulation crossed with a real-time strategy game developed by the company MinMax Games with emphasis on combat mechanics and customization
 Pro & contra: ++ Customization
Fully customizable ship systems with modular elements facilitates the creation of unique configurations
Broad spectrum of weapons allow for various tactics
The mass added to a ship influences its inertia und mobility; bigger is not always better, especially when several photon torpedoes are headed your way
   + Gameplay
Fluent and satisfying combat
Each part on an enemy ship can be destroyed, weakening the combat effectiveness of the opponent
  + Atmosphere
The developers managed to deliver a believable space world around the resource REZ
Exploration and interactions with the different factions were actually enjoyable
The power balance between them can be influenced and shifted by your actions
      o Music
Average space soundtracks
- Story
The campaign is rather short with a simple and predictable plot
If you played the first part, you will know what is coming for you
It also lacks the humouring side quests, which the predecessor offered
However, I have enjoyed most of the characters presented
Furthermore, solid voice acting
 Summary: With the innovative modular ship building system, mixed with the tactical combat, SPAZ 2 is worthwhile investment for fans of space simulations
Especially the faction system provides enough long-term motivation, in order to subdue the galaxy under a unified command
    Recommended for space enthusiasts with masochistic tendencies for zombie outbreaks and interstellar power play

Early Access Review
								All in all I have to give the game a recommendation
It was fun, and I played through it to the end, which is "good enough" for me
But much of what else I have to say about the game is going to be a critique
People aren't kidding when they say the game isn't really SPAZ
The top-down arcade action, the desperate resource harvesting, and the panicked tactical withdrawals are all missing
The combat system is totally re-worked, and all the nifty ship designs from the last game come into play as highly disposable fighter craft
Which is all fair enough, but the elements that replaced the old SPAZ could use a LOT of work
Nearly everything falls short of its potential
The meat and bones of the game, its combat, is very straightforward when applied to bulky motherships
The player who warps in with the best mix of weapons, stats, and/or backup wins
There's very little room for tactical nuance, although a clumsy player can easily ruin their battle by failing to get close enough for some of the shorter-ranged weapons
There are obstacles scattered around the battle void, including the inexplicable exploding canisters from SPAZ 1, but they're very easy to avoid even in the heat of battle and didn't once contribute to a win or loss during my run
Fighting ships is fun, but fails to stay fresh and exciting the way it did in SPAZ by slowly introducing new models of bigger ships
The second most important component is building and maintaining the mothership, and this is where I think the developers really dropped the ball
Assembling a ship out of boring same-y blocks is dull, and combing the galaxy for pieces that have the right weapon, look, or quality is tedious
Rather than giving the mothership turret or weapon slots, like the strike craft, weapons are built into the wings, nose, and engine pieces
There are no utility or equipment slots
The game incentivizes you heavily to maintain a big, blocky craft, and cores are all one size with no weapons, They could have done some very impressive things with the mothership construction, and instead it's mostly a matter of sifting through starbases to find the wing turret you want (ideally in the right faction too, because otherwise it just looks ugly)
One aspect I did like was the presence of numerous other starship captains, all with their own allegiances and numerous options
Character portraits were colorful, and their AI behavior generally made sense
The only complaint I have about this system is that a battlefield with four players is quickly exploited by the player to fight frequent 3-on-1 battles, especially when the zombies show up
Ganging up on extremely powerful captains is a fine way to take them down, but since tactical combat is stunted (as noted previously) ganging up on enemies soon becomes the "main" tactic
You search out a zombie ship and try to catch them alone or while their friends are occupied
Friendly ships jump in and fill up the battlefield in your favor, and the enemy's fate is sealed
I would prefer to outfight opponents like I did in the original SPAZ, but alas, that's not feasible
Finally, the writing is good
I found it bizarre at first that the characters had synthesized voices, but the charming bickering and the random tidbits of humor did a lot to keep my interest going until the end

Early Access Review
								I felt the need to expand the review, since there was a lot of complaining going on all over the place, from people that have barely played through a tutorial but presenting themselves as able to properly judge the game
There is also a lot of complaining that it's not SPAZ 1
5
If you've played SPAZ 1, this part is for you, otherwise you can skip it entirely:1
All resource collecting is done on strategic map now, without pointless grind and a waste of time
There is also no limit on resources you can carry, which is great news
Having to watch how ships mine for ten minutes straight was a chore of SPAZ 1 and I never liked it even 1 bit
All that resource micromanagement never added to the game, since after you've lost a battle or it was hard and led to loss of resources, game STOPPED and you would spend next half an hour collecting resources
2
Skill trees are gone and replaced with three random skills per level
Some will say, that skill trees in SPAZ1 were great, when they were actually not
You had to upgrade a skill to be able to use better tech, and once you knew a cookie cutter build you could easily blast through the game, or got gimped for a looong time if you didn't
Because of this you could never upgrade everything or try everything in one play (and that is an extremely long time)
Game could actually punish you for trying wrong and it did
Skills in SPAZ 2 are extremely helpful and relevant to the player actually making you stronger, and unpredictable pattern doesn't allow a winning level up in each gameplay
With new content, there can be more skills added leading to more variety, without the need to lock them to a path
3
Blueprints are gone
Finally, for the best
That was another grinding aspect in SPAZ 1
There were barely two viable strategies: blow up the station (if you can, huh) to get all blueprints inside, or spend goons to impove relationship and then REZ to buy it (and then get back grinding goons/REZ back)
With ship blueprints, you had to destroy a ship a number of times to get all parts of blueprint to unlock that ship
Incredible chore, cause you either had to be lucky, or repeat a mission to get those blueprints
In SPAZ 2 an ingame economy and leveling up gets you better and bigger parts
You protect transporters in order to get better tech, and upgrade bases
And of course you loot enemies for it as well, even on the battlefield, which is great
4
Combat is deeper however you disagree with it
Instead of basically an energy regeneration for everything in the game, you now have separate sources to manage
Energy battery can protect your shields from getting down with a boost under heavy fire until enemy need to reload
Boost engines allow you to ram through the enemy or get further away
Energy battery allows you to keep firing and once depleted you have to reload, which also makes it impossible to boost up shields or regenerate them if they are gone
Asteroids protects you from heavy bombs and enemy fire, while can also be used with a tractor beam to damage the enemy
There are powerups on the field, REZ "balls" that might spawn some zombies and barrels to blow up
Battle wagon mode allows to pass weapon controls to AI, which is incredibly useful against small strike crafts, but it uses battery ineffectively which leads to more reloads and decreases survival chances
5
Mothership is not smaller ships from previous game, those are still here and they're recognizable
How can one describe SPAZ 2?Have you played Mount and Blade? Good, cause the idea behind strategical map, factions, captains and other stuff is basically the same
Economy is real, bases produce stuff, ships transfer stuff, captains trade and fight, zombies infect, bandits mess up
Diplomacy allows for alliances, friendship, bounties and so on
You can even share parts and resources if you need to
You can start a proper faction and take over eventually, but it's NOT easy even one bit since there are lots of threats that needs your attention
In combat you manage a number of ship resources to increase performance, and survive as long as possible until you catch an enemy on reload phase when they are most vulnerable, strip off their shields and ram them to death
:) You won't see it in low level fights, but then it gets important
Ship building is difficult, since parts are hard to find and there's always more you want to install than you can with different strategy involved
In 7 hours I have barely seen any tech at all with 16 level
You can't slap random crap on a ship and win, nope, only in the tutorial
There is nothing in the game that MAKES you waste time on routine stuff anymore and it's awesome!You can attach to you ship a torn apart enemy part on the battlefield any time, or reattach something you've lost yourself
You can even throw it in the enemy with a tractor beam
The game is incredible already, since it has solid well planned foundation and it can only get even better in time with the help of developers and mods
I mentioned it before, that there is only one feature needed - LARGER battles with more ships involved
That is one thing I want to see, something like 10-15 motherships in one intense battle
For the 18$ it's one of the best purchases I've made, besides the

M&B
*Some small fixes

Early Access Review
								I want to preface this review by saying that not only am I a big fan of the original SPAZ, I also respect and admire MINMAX for experimenting with their original model and stepping outside the box for their sequel
That being said, I think they stepped out of one box and into another
SPAZ 2 retains the charmingly witty-yet-stupid writing and dialogue of the original game that reminds of a Saturday-morning cartoon
The aesthetics have also remained the same; blurry textures composed of screamingly high contrast colors that bore into your retinas
On top of that, the from-scratch gameplay is also retained from the original game, where you start with practically nothing and build your empire on top of that
Aside from the actual space combat, these things define SPAZ pretty well, and if that's all you're looking for, you won't be disappointed
This is all SPAZ 2 has in common with the original, however
In the transition to 3d, much has changed
You now get to fly and build the mothership, you are now the biggest fish in the sea
Right Hooks and Tugs are tiny compared to the hulking, glorious piece of junk that is your ship
You start off with a scaffold looking like it was built entirely out of old bicycles by an inpatient from a mental hospital
Over the course of the entire game, from start to finish, you will upgrade from bicycles to smashed car-shaped objects
This modular mothership, along with the ability to establish and govern starbases, seems to be giving us what we didn't have, and wanted in the original SPAZ
An interstellar empire
Flying the Clockwork
AI that don't run face-first into the enemy's largest ship and die instantly, wasting thousands of Rez
Actually, that's still a thing, but they only waste small amounts of scrap instead because they're only piloting small fighter ships
This lends a much more strategic feel to the game
And I'd call that an advantage
However, much was lost in the transition:First of all, everything feels like it's about the same size
Gone are the days of warping into a battlefield and attempting to take down a ship 20 times your size with bombing runs
The smallest mothership is maybe 1/4 the size of the largest
Heck, even space stations just look like circular, spinning motherships that can't move
Next, ship design doesn't matter as much
In the original, when you were restricted to chassis with a set number of module slots and module types, you knew exactly how your own ships worked, and their strengths and weaknesses
When you looked at an enemy ship, you could distinctly see what modules were attached to it (unless it was cloaked), and you knew how those weapons would affect your fleet
What weapons a ship had often determined whether you'd try to take it down for its blueprints, or flee with your tail between your legs
Now, you pretty much slap whatever module will fit on your mothership and has the most stars
Because of the randomness of parts, both in terms of their perks (the bonuses they confer to your ship, like shield strength, speed, health, etc
), and in terms of the weaponry on them (cannons, beams, the works), both when you're scavenging, and when you're shopping at space stations, it's very unlikely that you're going to find exactly the part you're looking for
I get what they were going for here; you're a scavenger among scavengers
It's not about what you want, it's about what works
But, that being said, it isn't very compelling
The chances of me finding a part that: a) looks the way I want it to look, b) has a weapon that I want on it, and c) has the bonuses that I want (which I don't even keep track of anyways), is almost null
The chances of me finding *multiple parts* that I actually want are nonexistant
This results in your mothership EITHER looking like a piece of trash, that has EITHER nice weapons OR nice stats, OR a mothership that looks nice and is completely worthless in terms of battlefield effectiveness
Yes, that was a nested either-or statement
And, usually, what ends up happening is you get a muddy mix of all of these things
The end result is that you don't feel like the ship you're flying is *your* mothership, even though you built it piece-by-piece
It feels like you just cobbled together what the game gave you and now you're flying it around
And, all of these things would be fine if they took advantage of the things they gained; We're in 3d now
There's a lot to explore, right?Not


Really
You still fly your ship in 2d, while asteroids hover tantalizingly over and under you
You still effectively fight in 2d; you can't go over or under an enemy ship
The battles are more bland than the original game
Explosive barrels don't matter as much, and neither do asteroids
They feel much more staged, 2-4 ships warp in, 1-3 ships warp out
The outcome is largely determined by your stats, and who warps in with you
Positioning can matter, but ships are so random and cobbled together that it's hard to tell when you're facing directly into an enemy's broadside, or if the other side is even worse
You can't "get used to" an enemy faction
You can't take advantage of a ship's slow turning speed and its blind spots
You really can't dodge missiles anymore
There is no longer a cloaking system (except for in the star map, where it doesn't really matter), and "big" weapons like Mass Bombs don't feel as significant
That's what it is
A lot of elements have lost their character
Rez is no longer the rainbow-colored candy it was, now it's just a generic purple blob that you pick up
Finding a new color of Rez stone felt like moving to a different level
Things are worth more now
Ships are bigger
Now it's just numbers on a screen
Goons have gotten even less important
You no longer scavenge for rescue pods, or steal from hotels; just numbers on a screen
You need to maintain a minimum number of goons, and you shouldn't have too manygoons
Finding the last blueprint to a weapon you really want is no longer a thing
Sometimes you stumble across a part that has a unique weapon on it, and you get to use that one part, and you will never find that same weapon ever again
And if you do, it's going to be on a worthless part
The game feels smaller
You can cross the whole starmap in a matter of minutes, faster towards the start of the game and slower towards the end (the opposite of the original game), and you probably won't be attacked
It's not a bad game
I just don't see why I would play it over the original SPAZ, which has much more crisp, interesting RPG gameplay and gunplay
Or Istrolid, which offers the modularity and customizability of SPAZ 2 with much faster, more satisfying top-down gameplay
Or why I would play it over Dreadnought, or Fractured Space, which are full-blown third person space shooters with interesting tactical gameplay and the advantage of other players
SPAZ 2 seems to be a mashup of various genres, and sadly, it doesn't work, at least not for me

Early Access Review
								After 45 hours I won the game, such a blast to play
Different than SPAZ1 but funny like SPAZ1, a good mix of arcade space battles along with a great story
I finished the story and I have not even played the Sandbox yet
I could say alot about the game but I do not want to give alot away, just that it is deeper than one would think
Story has some fun twists and turns
It was fantastic to build my ship up, earning experience points to make it strong
I am so glad I played it, great hours spent for me

Early Access Review
Quick noteThe mixed rating is because the devs could not add multiplayer into the game due to major issues
The devs made a fairly long detailled post about this, but it was removed
So here's the short version for wy it was cancelled :After updating the game engine (Unity),the devs realised that unity completely changed how multiplayer works, thus all work done on multiplayer before that was lost
They wanted to upgrade to the newer engine to improve performance and the long term compatibility with the new systems coming in the next few years
(Performance was indeed much better after the upgrade
)They then tried to start over the multiplayer work but had several issues doing so
After trying to work around the problems for over a month, they made no progress at all with multiplayer
Eventually, the devs took feedback form the players about that issue
Most agreed to scrap multiplayer in favor of adding more content to the single player experience istend
At that point multiplayer was scrapped
That's about it
Some details are missing here but this is what hapened in a nut shell
Anyway, on to the actual review
IntroThis is one of a kind game that should NOT be left under the radar
Space Pirates and Zombies 2 (Or spaz 2),Is a game with many different gameplay elements in one game
If you played the original spaz, this game is quite different form that game
In this game, you control a fully customizable mothership with Elsa has her captain trying to earn a place of power in the galaxy
Homever you are not the only one


There are other 199 captains roaming around
They follow the same rules that the player does, with few exceptions
The game is also very well polished, more so that you expect
Go to the ---TLDR--- if you just want to see pro/cons of the game
The meatThe major gameplay element is the starmap screen, where you can plan your destination and interact with several things like other captains, resources zones, starbases and other events
All traveling/resource gathering is also done on the star map, greatly reducing the grind you usually find in X4 games
Starbases is where you can use scrap (in game currency) to buy much needed resources like Rez (Think of rez like Gas) or buy parts for your mothership
You can also battle in the arena with preset ships for rewards and improve relations with other captains
(More onthat later)Ship customizationYou can fully customize your own mothership using the loot you find or buy them at shops
You want have lot of projectiles weapons? You can
You want be a carrier type mothership with lots of drones? You can
You want go nuts with a lot of missiles? You can
You prefer using beam weapons? You can
The way your ship handle in combat depends entirely on how you build it
Want to go fast?                     Use more engines
Want a better turn rate?          Use more wings
Want to have more shields?    Use more noses
Finding the parts you want may be hard, but there is a VERY helpful catalog system where you can order parts form and getting them delivered to you directly
The Captains and FactionsYour actions can cause a captain to like or hate your guts
If a captain likes you, he/she is more likely to help you in battles and gives you better prizes when shopping at his/her station
This also work in reverse, of course
If a rich captain really hates you, you can expect a bounty on your head
While captains that are friends with you will not try to collect the bounty, the others will
You can also put a bounty on someone else if you want
There is 5 main factions in the game that you can join after building relations with other captains of that faction
At that point you can have your own starbase in the faction you joined if you spend time gathering resources and build a station for your faction
Stations is like a bank where you can drop resources and parts for later use, also a good source of passive income
Each factions specialize in something, giving a specific bonus for parts they sell
(like Speed/armor/shields and power
) Some weapons type can only be found in a specific faction
You unlock the ability to form your own faction and build your own empire of imbeciles and simpletons with you has the leader later on
Space Pirates and Zombies?Now you may wonder, what the heck the *zombies* in thetitle mean?At some point in the game, the zombies will make a appearance
How they show up depend if you play the campaign or the sandbox mode
They do what you expect them to do, no much else to say


Oh and try not to get infected, wash your hands often
CombatsFights will usually happen vs
bandits, captains, starbases


and Zombies of course
The combat is done in a 3D Arcade shooter style with the option of a top view or behind your mothership with the ability to switch at anytime
Up to 4 captains/zombies/bandits can participate in a battle, ending in 1 vs
1, 2 vs
2 and 1 vs
3
Combats are fairly fast,with lots of effects form fired weaponand usually quite hectic
You and other captains can also have smaller ships (Called Strikecrafts) to aid in battle
And yes, those are also customizable
You can unlock more type of strikecrafts by collecting blueprints in battle
Collecting more for a already unlocked ship will eventually make it more powerful
If a mothership gets damaged eneuf, the ship may lose parts of itself
Attacking a specific part of a ship for a while will eventually break it, this is userfull for 2 reasons : weakening the enemy ship and extra loot after a battle
Some weapons are better that other to break parts
TLDR (Pros and Cons)Again, most downvotes for the game is because multiplayer got scraped
Even so it still got it's perks, the game do not deserve to be brushed aside just for that reason alone
Ok, starting with cons because i prefer a good end
Cons :1
Lack of diplomacy options for factions
The core is here and it works, but is missing things like trading/no-agression and a few others
2
The story leaves something to be desired
3
Modding is not possible
Offset by using the various sliders in sandbox mode that changes how the game plays
4
Too easy/quick to become the *Biggest fish* in the galaxy
5
I wish you could build more that starbases in the galaxy map
(Like building on resources zones to speed up the gathering rate for example
)6
Can be confusing to play for the first time
(Don't Skip the tutorials the first time you play
)Pros :1
Good customizations option for your mothership and your fleet
2
Devs being very informative,you always knows what's hapening and are constant to fix minor/major bugs really quickly
3
Great replay value, thanks to many sliders(Or mutators) in sandbox mode
Over 50 new options was added in 0
9
1, for a total of 73 different tweak possible so even more changes is possible now
)4
The grind is minimal, making the game fun form the very start to the end
5
A Fairly deep Captain relation system
6
Be free to play YOUR way, even in story mode
7
There's no games comparable to this
Closest being the mount and blade games
But it's still a completely different game
8
The galaxy feels alive, thanks to the many other captains roaming around
(200 including you)9
Early access done right
No really, it's one of the best early access progress i seen, check the *Major Update Stockpile
* in the forums to have an idea on how much it progressed
If you like space battles with tons of customizations options with great replay value, you will love this game

Early Access Review
								SPAZ was a good game but we wanted more


more of

EVERYTHING
SPAZ 2 delivers
- more customization- more explosions- more D's (3D instead of 2D)- more voice - more sounds- more quests- more space- and much more more

Rewards slow and methodical gameplay
And the boss battles are fantastic

												I summoned a mad phantom with the intention of dueling him, but instead he sat down and offered to toast with me
We continued on throughout Undead Settlement together despite my wariness of him and he helped me take out all the mobs in the surrounding area
After a while, I became accustomed to fighting alongside my newfound friend and started turning my back to him knowing full well that he would protect me to his last, dying breath
We were a team
The best of friends, and nothing could stand in our way
He may not have been a Warrior of Sunlight, but Solaire's legacy thrived on within him
Jolly co-operation resumed until we neared the Curse-Rotted Greatwood


 And it was then that I decided to take yet another chance and summon a second Mound-Maker to see if we could rally him to our side
The plan seemed successful at first
But it wasn't long before I noticed some suspicious patterns in the phantom's movement, and his interest in my backside became a significant concern
My anxiety was proven justified when the phantom took a swing at me with his greatsword and missed
My loyal protector raised both his hand and his middle finger at the attacker, before charging forward with fury the likes of which none in Lothric had seen
He made it his personal duty to end the traitorous life of the one who would dare attempt to strike at me, and before long the violent fool was fleeing from our jolly wrath
He rushed up a ladder and leaped across rooftops before finally dropping a harmful distance to the ground, giving us an opening to attack
My companion launched himself from the rafters and his flowing cape waved majestically in the air as he readied his sword and plunged towards the infidel who would dare spit on the tenets of co-operation and sunlight
The valiant protector lunged his sword deep through the attacker's back before he could escape, the weapon grinding through bone and flesh and rendering him a lifeless husk
I dropped down following this, and we waved and spun our capes at one another in excitement and victorious glee
But this was the end of our time together
We gave each other one final wave before my friend's body started to fade away as he was whisked back to his own dimension
It hit me I'd never see him again

												After putting these many hours, I must say that this is one of the best, if not THE best RPG
Period
It's hard, yes
It has a steep learning curve, also yes
But this game is a rare gem among the simplified, straight-forward, linear games that are currently in trend
Rare indeed for a game that actually rewards you for patience and restraint and encourages players to slow down and observe the surroundings and the enemies
Of course, the same can be said about Dark Souls 1 and 2
But Dark Souls 3 is really much more refined than those in a good way
Relatively faster paced combat not only feels more fresh but I think is a necessary step forward in making the gameplay more interesting
Also, the enemies are much more aggressive to compensate for this faster paced combat
Though the lore does not appear to be on par with the one in Dark Souls 1, which I personally believe to be the best in the Souls series
But it is still well above Dark Souls 2, which I personally didn't like all that well
I could go on and on about this game, but for brevity I must say: Everyone must try this at least once

												Tip from someone who recently beat the game
You can use the cord for your controller to hang yourself
Due to many responses as to having wireless controllers bash your head with it until you forget about the game or you die doing it
			
Posted: 15 September
												You'll try
You won't know what's going on
You'll think dying is bad
Your friends will explain things to you, using words like, "Estus shard" and "Praise the sun" and it won't make sense
You'll give up after dying repeatedly on the tutorial boss only to finally kill it and then die to a dog that scares you into falling off of a cliff
Three months later, your friends will convince you to play again
You try it out, only to fail yet again
This time though, you understand that's part of the process, just as your friends had reassured you
You'll roll
You'll roll again, then again
You've done it! The dog that once scared you into jumping off a cliff is dead and you've miraculously taken no damage
Renewed vigor fills you and you continue on
This time you ignore your friends, resorting to the wiki to answer your questions and your own curiosity to guide you to treasure
Suddenly things begin to make sense
You go to bed
You wake up with this incessent urge to play again, oddly intrigued by the story even though you're "not that type of gamer"
"Why do I enjoy this?" You'll ask yourself
Soon, you're rolling in real life, to dodge your responsibilities solely to play this game
Didn't think it'd happen to me
It did
Buy it while it's on sale so the first three months of you not really playing it don't feel like, "Such a waste of money
" It's not a waste, even at full price
Amazing game and story
So damned confusing at first but it's worth it
I promise you

 Positives: + Gorgeous looking
+ Level design is great
+ Massive areas
+ Game rewards you when you progress
+ Difficulty
+ Well designed enemies and bosses
+ Best PVP in souls games
+ Amazing soundtrack
+ NPCs are interesting and well done also their quest lines are pretty fun
+ If you want to CO-OP with a friend it has never been this easy
+ Good and smooth controls
Negatives: - Sometimes framerate drops but not too often
- Areas aren't connected like in Dark Souls I
But it's not a big deal
- IMO some of the bosses need a little buff
Summary As a Souls "veteran" this is the best Souls game in my books this is just amazing piece of work to be honest i didn't even expect this much
FromSoftware did amazing job and hopefully it doesn't end here
This is how you make a game

Spoiler free reviewIf you didn't enjoy the quality of Dark Souls II and are wondering about the enjoyment of Dark Souls III and the fact that it may be overhyped, worry no longer
Dark Souls III is the true successor to Dark Souls
The third entry in a game series renowned for its outstanding unique storytelling and its sinister difficulty, FromSoftware has brought us again another game worthy of praise
Taking place in the land of Lothric, you will encounter grotesque beasts of the unknown, epic bosses, the most beautiful environments and a lore deeper than any ocean
If you are tired of hand-holding games where the game seems to shove tutorials in your face even to end-game than this is the game for you
Dark Souls is NOT a HARD game
One of the reason that I hold Dark Souls in such high regard is not because of the difficulty but rather the fact that it doesn't treat the player as if they're a child
The game will punish you but know that it doesn't mean the end, rather every death you face is nothing more than a stepping stone to a greater success, a hard earned success is honestly the greatest feeling ever
You will learn new skills and eventually adapt, the game knows you aren't stupid and will treat you like you are; a human, something a lot of games these days are sorely missing
DifferencesAgain, Dark Souls III feels more like a sequel to Dark Souls I than II ever did
Borrowing things from all their previous games you will see happy changes to the overall game
Fans of Demon Souls will be happy to know that the hub world shares an uncanny resemblance to the Nexus as well as the Maiden
Extremely well designed bosses inspired from the creatures of Bloodborne and its engine as well as Dark Souls II's accessibility to the series
Positives: CAMEOS! Returning characters will make appearances
Extremely well optimized
Keyboard and Mouse controls aren't that bad
There is now no permanent health loss when dying
Amazing soundtrack that will soothe your ears
Extremely well designed boss fights
Full of amazing locations to explore
 Great level design
Rewarding difficulty
Playing CO-OP with a specific player is very easy now
Stances
Combat has been reworked for the better
No more Soul Memory
Interesting NPCs, to encounter and converse with
PVP is better than it ever was
Classes don't lock you into anything, you can make your build into anything you want, e
g
magic user
World fits together nicely in a way that makes sense
Open world, areas are massive
Approachable systems, deep and very easy to learn and master
Mage builds are rethinked, they aren't as broken and overpowered like in Dark Souls II
Matchmaking is a breeze
This is NOT the final Souls game
BACKSTABS ARE BACK! At the very least better executed than in Dark Souls II
You can easily switch between OFFLINE mode & ONLINE mode now
Negatives: Though rarely, at the moment there is a few framerate hiccups but other than that PC version is very well done
Somewhat noticeable pop-ins
The world isn't inter-connected like in Dark Souls I which may upset some
CAMEOS! Though I've written it as a plus, some may dislike it as some may think of it as lazy where From could've very well created new and interesting characters
Not necessarily a negative but having an unstable connection while online will bring you back to the main menu
 Is this game worth it?Yes, very much so! Though I am biased, this is truly an amazing game
It doesn't matter if you are a veteran, new or old, Dark Souls III takes the best part of all of From's previous games and makes it even better
It surpassed my expectations, even more it completely destroyed what I should expect from a game
All upcoming games, Triple A especially take note, this is how you make a game
This is a true game
Thank you kindly, Alex for giving me the chance to play this wonderful game

 Do you like?  Brutally slaughtering your friends to get a kiss? Making people explode? Poop jokes? General hilarity? Sandwiches that not only taste great, but also are packed with steriods?If you answered yes to any of these questions then this game is for you In short  castle crashers is a medieval hack and slash adventure which you can play by yourself or with up to 3 friends (Four player Co-op)
It possesses an amazing cast of unlockable characters, enough stupid moments to last a decade, and cartoony graphics which will never get old
Have Fun!9/10

												There is a deer propelled by its own feces in this game
Strongly recommended
			
Posted: 26 November, 2013
												Introduction:Castle Crashers was my personal favorite Xbox Live Arcade game when it was first released back in 2008
The Behemoth continued to give this game more life with it's DLC of character's that had unique abilities, animal orbs that would accompany you throughout the game, and weapons that would improve your character's growth (or vice versa if you are looking for a challenge)
The game was later ported to the Playstation Network with exclusive mini-games in 2010
Castle Crashers eventually was ported onto Steam, but was ported badly onto PC on launch; however, the game was redeemed to be fun and playable again after The Behemoth made necessary updates
Verdict:This title is a hack and slash RPG, and has been widely recieved by many gamers who appreciate the genre (even those who don't)
The game can feel a bit tedious at times, but as you level your character(s) the gameplay will feel slightly different before it tends to get repetitive once again
However, the game keeps the game fresh upon every level with unique scenary, opponents, and even jokes
If you plan on purchasing this title it's obviously more fun to play it with friends then it is with complete strangers, so try to convince your friends (and if they've convinced you to buy it listen to them)
Completing the title will be a mission, but personally I think that's half the fun of trying to unlock every single character, find every animal orb and weapons
Give this game a try by downloading the demo
If you find the game a bit pricey than wait for a discount (or a Humble Indie Bundle that has this game packaged with it)
			
Posted: 17 August, 2015
Summary (TL;DR)This is by far one of the best purchases I've ever made on Steam
I'm very pleased with this game, the gameplay is fun, and this game makes you want to play with others
It's about 6-8 hours of gameplay per character, and there are plenty of characters to choose from
If this game is on sale, be sure to grab it
You will not be dissapointed
Pros DLC goes to charity Fun co-operative play Decent sized storyline Original graphic style Many unlockable characters Large selection of weapons Many pets which give different advantages Controller Support Steam Trading Cards Fun soundtrack Pays homage to The Behemoth's "Alien Hominid" and "Battle Block Theater" Very well pricedCons Very difficult solo No drop in/out system for online games Online games occasionally have connection issues
Rating10/10

												A great game to play with a room full of friends, a pizza, and some drinks
The game is decent by itself, but with friends in a local coop setting, it's wonderful
The game is mostly you verses monsters, but occasionally you have to duke it out amongst yourselves for the hand of a lovely maiden
It has wonderful items, and challenging gameplay
I'd highly recommend picking up a 4-pack on sale to play with your buddies some time

												// Castle Crashers a 2D Platform Indie Beat 'em Up : //// Schuitje82 - Extended Review //About this game:=============I really enjoy this game from the beginning when it came out on another platform
It has a super great and funny story line that makes this one great adventure
Graphics looks amazing and the themes are well through of
You play through the levels to save the 4 princesses from the evil kings
This may sound a bit boring ? but on the contrary, the game has a very nice story
You bash and shoot your way through levels and woop everything in your way
Discover new land, animals, weapons and much much more
Core Gameplay:============You can choose in the beginning the 4 basic characters from the game
These are Fire, Toxic, Ice and Electric Castle Crashers
All of these have there own special powers you can throw at your enemies
You have a level up system so that makes it extra addicting to play this game
And you can choice how you like to upgrade you character as you wish
You give more points to magic you will unlock new skills
Or try to be strong as the hulk and  place the points on strength
You can discover new animals they will give you more power health, XP or just  find things for you
After all these finding animals and leveling your character
You can also find new weapons and give this a extra twist to your character
What is cool about every weapon is that it haves his own stats that will give you sometime extra like, speed, strength or magic powers so an extra advantage to you character so it’s not about the weapons looks it’s what stats you will need because of the play style you choose
Overall:======This games has some amazing soundtracks and levels

												Castle Crashers is a 2D beat 'em up with some RPG elements
I'd heard a lot of people talk it up and even tried the demo before deciding to get this bad boy when it was on sale for Halloween
You get four characters to choose from, so you can potentially play a 1-4 player game right out of the gate
Each character has their own starting weapon, magical element, and appearance
You go through levels beating up bad guys and trying to save princesses
Along the way, you'll find some cool weapons and animal orbs that give you special perks, You can switch between them between levels by visiting the blacksmith
I don't typically enjoy beat 'em ups
They tend to get stale and boring, despite how many combos or different weapons the game wants to throw my way
But Castle Crashers adds in some RPG elements to keep it interesting
Sure, the different weapons, different characters with their magic, and different animal buddies all add some customization, but the leveling system is what truly gives this game replayability and a sense of progression
Upon leveling up, you'll gain points that can be put into any of the four stats you have, strength, defense, magic, and agility
Depending on what kind of playstyle you want to use or what role you have on the team, you can build accordingly
Do you want to focus on one or two stats? Or would you rather be more well rounded? How will you compliment your teammates? Or what is best for solo play? It gives some complexity to the otherwise simple concept, which is great
The ability to play locally, cooperatively, or solo is nice for varied options and experiences
Essentially, each character you use equals one campaign
And there are a lot of unlockable characters, so this game does have a lot of replayability and lifespan
I also like the simple cartoony art style and some of the music is pretty cool
The main game with single and multiplayer, insane mode, two mini games, achievements, there's a lot of hours to be had with this title
However, I DO need to point out a few flaws in the game
Castle Crashers is a game of diminishing returns
When you start, there's lots of new and exciting things to keep you hooked
New characters, new weapons, new animal buddies, new secondary items, new levels, and a blank slate to upgrage how you see fit
But after a while


it loses its luster
There are only so many characters, items, animal buddies, weapons, and levels in the game
Your upgrades get harder and harder to improve as the game goes on and you will start to gain less points per level
You max out at 78 and from then on it's very little change between levels
Insane mode, aside from a few exceptions, is basically the same as the normal game


excpet enemies take longer to kill and can kill you faster
More frustrating and time consuming than an increase in challenge
Also, the online isn't always the best
It depends on game settings, connection speeds, and the locations of the players for sure, but laggy games can be tough to get through, especially in crucial moments the requre precision
Not to mention that when the game literally has to stop and wait for the other players, it can get very annoying and tiresome
So I'd recommend finding people close enough for online, or simply doing local play if you're going to do multiplayer
I like Castle Crashers
Sure, it has diminishing returns, and if you want to complete it with everyone at maximum everything


you'll be playing longer than you enjoy
But playing in moderation, trying to win rather than max everything, playing with other people


all of this can easily extend the playtime of the game while keeping it fun
Is it worth $15? Well


it really depends
If you like beat 'em ups a lot, then probably
Try out the demo and gauge your excitement
I'd say this game is probably worth about $10 generally, and when it goes on sale it tends to be cheaper anyway, so definitely go for it
I'd give Castle Crashers a solid 7/10
A good game, great for fans of beat 'em ups, but still alright for people who don't much care for them as well
I'm sure I'll get lots of hours in this game over the years, and you might too

												So Meta, Even This Acronym
OneShot is cute, imaginative and, at times, simply mind-blowing—and blowing the jaded mind of a modern gamer is not an easy task
The meta nature of the game is highlighted by its name: you only have one shot at it, and then the save file becomes corrupted
There won't be a second journey
Only


how is it fair? Whatever you do, you will have to face a dilemma in the end, and choosing either of the cruel options is reductive and simply wrong
Can you


rebel against the whole thing, perhaps?These, however, are the thoughts you'll deal with by the end, but even before it the game is littered with charming meta-humor
The main character needs to sleep, for example, and when she does, the game closes
Some puzzles require thinking very much out of the box and using unexpected approaches
All the while the touching and lovely story of a hero stranded in a strange land and carrying a lightbulb to light up the local sun continues to unfold
The game is at its most poignant during the moments when the hero interacts with you, the player, whom she considers to be a god
You get to chat, encourage her, and fight your own enemy—often outside the game
The execution of OneShot leaves something to be desired: while very sweet in terms of visuals, it's often clunky and makes you do a lot of unnecessary walking back and forth solving various puzzles; coupled with imperfect location layouts, it gets frustrating sometimes
However, I'd say the game itself is charming and unique enough for it to be easily forgivable
			
Posted: 11 June
												I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam
I've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot
I don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context
(I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party
Be warned!)Transistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life
They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you
They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously
However, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason
In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters
When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the "eyes" of the protagonist
OneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story
Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all
It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close
It was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game
It's really hard to put into words


but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees
:DAnyways, random game comparison tangent over
It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended
Extremely solid 10/10
If you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc
, this is basically a must-buy

Posted: 31 March
NOTE: This spoiler-free review is accurate as of the newest update (Solstice)
Due to the content and ending added through this update, I highly recommend this game, and if you have finished the game before this, I implore you to replay it to experience the true ending
I was introduced to this game by Markiplier's playthrough
I only heard 10 seconds of what he said before I closed his playthrough and decided to get this game myself, feeling that this game is worth going in blind, and would be one with a lasting impression
It's True
This is the most emotionally-invested game I've had the pleasure to experience
Even after the end, it haunts me till today


and my emotions are so messed up just thinking about my experience that it's difficult to even review it
Even so


I'll try
Oneshot is A story-driven puzzle-adventure game
You play as a cat-like persona named Niko in a Mission to restore a world's lost sun, a large lightbulb
You only have one chance to save the world
It seems very straightforward



Except you're not playing as Niko
You are considered a separate entity



yourself
By opening the game, you unwillingly become "god", in charge of a world that operates, exists and disappears at the click of your mouse
Niko, meanwhile, is just dragged in as the "protagonist", waking up in a different, crumbling world


a child trying to get back home, to the waiting arms of mommy
You are essentially Niko's guiding voice, in a world both of you have no understanding of, and are in charge of leading Niko to bring light back to the lands


and at the same time, bringing Niko back home
Of course, its not that simple
The game is sentient, aware of how it's a program running on your computer, and will attempt throughout your journey to keep you from returning the sun
But in the end, it is unable to control your final decision


and yet, it still gives a last stand by denying you a perfect ending
It's in control of the story and is hiding things, and without you thinking outside of the box to beat the game's coded "story"


Niko, the world, and the game itself


will never find peace
The writing and story in and of itself is one of this game's strong points, as the amount of fourth-wall breaking and events that reveal the true nature of the world is extremely compelling, especially since its all addressed to who the ingame people think is "god"


you
The biggest draw to this game, however, is simply How personal it makes the relationship between you and Niko
Leading Niko feels like leading a younger sibling, in which Niko doesn't really understand what's going on, but will deal with events in their own childlike, innocent way
During your advanture, Niko also comments on Every action you take and even questions you about our world all in your own name


which further got me attached to Niko
Standard game mechanics are also used to strengthen this bond, as when Niko is tired, you have to find a bed to let Niko rest in; this is the only way to save and close the game "naturally", and also initiates dream sequences along with more dialogue between you and Niko
If you decide to close the window instead, Niko will be afraid and in a state of shock when you open the game again, as you brought darkness to the World Niko is in
This happens often, to the point where you'll likely be afraid to hurt Niko by closing the game
Yet, despite your cluelessness and inability to explain how you can access things out-of-game


Niko trusts you
It's a sort of child-like trust towards an adult that's so innocent that you can't help but love Niko back
When the game denied me the Opportunity to respond to Niko, who was frantically calling my name


I Realised that I could do nothing but stare at the screen
That feeling is horrid, accompanying a person almost all the time


and then being denied the chance to say "I am here for you"
Eventually, I wasn't playing for the sake of the world


I was playing for Niko
For Niko's happiness, and to hear Niko speak to me again
Niko felt real
I wasn't ready to let my little cat-like child go, even though that's what I was fighting for this entire time
And that made the full game's ending all the more painful
You wouldn't expect a person's happiness


to hurt you so much
OneShot is initially a story of trust and moral decisions, but its true lesson is of attachment


before Letting go
The initial ending will make you think of your consequences
The true ending will make you cry, reluctant to pass the credits
You only have one shot, as once you complete the story


you'll want it to stay completed
And yet


I Don't want it to end
I'll never forget you, Niko

 All I can say is that OneShot is an experience that you won't forget anytime soon
Just a small note though, "Prepare yourself for a great OST, along with some pancakes
We love pancakes!!!!"

"The world knows you exists"I cannot describe just how amazing this game is


OneShot is a game where this game breaks the 4th wall and knows about your existance
You are guiding a character named Niko
Niko wakes up in another world that is "decaying"
This world is dying because its sun went out and your mission is to save the world


However


your choices will affect the gameplay
This game breaks the 4th wall by knowing that YOU exist
It has puzzles that you have to find out using your computer, and not the game itself
This game, is by far, the most amazing game I have played


I never know that I can grow attacthed to a cute character as Niko
The soundtrack is really good, the storyline is amazing, and the characters are well placed
This



is the first game that legit


made me cry


I would totally recommend this game to people, because its simply really good
Edit: I just completed




the "original" ending





I'm


crying

												Like Undertale, this game is about a young child trying to get home after falling into a land of strange creatures while being blessed with a "videogame" power
However while Undertale is bright and cheery, OneShot is quiet and somber
If you liked Undertale, give it a shot!

												DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS GAME
Seriously, look how many hours I've played: Over a thousand
People make fun of MMO players because they spend so much time working for imaginary goals, but at least they're hanging out with friends and collaborating
I've just been sitting here alone in my underwear in the dark
FOR 1000 HOURS
I used to be like you
I had friends and family, hobbies and interests
I used to cook for myself and clean my apartment once in a while
I used to have house plants for god's sake! I thought becoming king would take a week or two of gaming sessions at most
I WAS WRONG
Please, if there's anything you value in life, don't buy this game

												Mount & Blade: Warband is a game that defines the whole concept of what a perfectly shaped sandbox/RPG medieval game should be like, mixed with loads of action and epic adventures
Start either as a peasant or a noble man with a fully selective character customization and background history at your own choice, participate in tournaments, travel and discover the vast variety of what Caldaria has to offer you
Warband will be an unforgettable realistic experience that will mark in you the true hardships and living ways of the medieval age
What makes this game so great after all??It isn't just a 1st person game where you can travel around doing quests, Mount and Blade: Warband goes way beyond that by offering players a battle system where you can command your army while simultaneously giving your men orders during the heat of battles
In this game, both your character individual life and his relationships among all other NPC's are equally important to how well you can manage your army expenses and food variety in order to achieve success either alone, or within a faction
A never ending adventure! If you are not looking for trouble, trouble will come to you as time passes by and factions envolve with each other by declaring full-scaled wars against each other conquering castles and other key locations that will drastically change the game economically and militarily
Be either a good samaritan with your army of justice and fight off bandits and free entire villages from rebel control, a evil masterless soldier with a thirst for blood and wealth in the middle of the Caldarian disgrace, or simply a trader travelling around buying cheap and selling expensive, Warband will give you a fair challenge with very balanced rewards and consequences in whatever way of life you decided to take
The game difficulty is well balanced, and instead of making things harder just by simply increasing the units stats that you are facing against, the AI gets a lot more rational and fast even during the campaign map as well with the in-game combat, they will almost act as real human players!Remember that I have mentioning about your character individual role in the game? Get a good relationship with lords by doing quests or freeing close family members from enemy heavily guarded dungeons, and who knows if you can freely marry their daughters unless you convince them with your persuasion skills to run away with you!The medieval atmosphere and music has never been so good as it is now; If you enjoyed the previous Mount & Blade game, you will fall in love with this one
Mount & Blade: Warband will be the game that you will be happy to be hooked into to, a fair balanced game between adventure and RPG with a vast variety of content and diversity in all of its aspects
Some negative aspects
Bugs, Glitches and some graphic reading failuresDespite being unusual, you will encounter some glitches that will make some of the game items to disappear, or to find everything in a black screen when you return to the world map
There are also some in-game bugs that makes everything blur and unable to see around, although, I found out this can be fixed if you simple minimize the game and open it again!Some crashes might happen too, but those are rare to encounter
ConclusionI would rate this game with a 79 out of 100, or 4,0 out of 5,0, a never ending sandbox game that will make players fall in love as they experience the life and atmosphere of what a true medieval age game has to give!

												Yngol/JacobZupers guide/review of Mount and Blade: WarbandThe game Mount and Blade: Warband is the purest sandbox game that i have ever played, you can litterally do anything you feel like doing in the small land of Calradia
You can be a pirate raiding caravans from the six big factions (Sarranid Sultanate, Kingdom of Vaegir, Kingdom of Swadia, Kingdom of Rhodoks, Kingdom of Nords and Khergit Khanate
) or you can join up with one of the factions or make your own one or just play as a mercenary! Many people that look into the game for the first 5+ hours think that this is a simple game, but it is indeed pretty complicated which i will come to later in these 5 facts about why and how i have played 1400+ hours of this game, enjoy :)1) *SINGLEPLAYER* The singleplayer is awesome, you will spend a minimum of 100+ hours on it, and once you get the hang of it you just wan't to play it 2-3 times again because you haven't even tried a bit of the possibilities, but once you have tried the most it will get kinda booring but the next facts will fix that problem
2) *MODIFICATIONS* There are a BUNCH of modifications for the game and they are so simple to enjoy
So when you are tired of the vanilla game go to this website -->      http://store
steampowered
com and download some of the many multiplayer and singleplayers mods for the game
3) *MULTIPLAYER* If you aren't happy with the singleplayer game, you can always move to the multiplayer
Note that M&B has a very intense fighting system that requires you to play a bunch before you can actually feel like a good player
But once you get the hang of it, it is so much fun just to hack and slash through your enemies
4) *INDEPTH MULTIPLAYER FIGHTING SYSTEM* The fighting system of M&B is very complicated, for some players it is just a slash/block game, but it's really much more than that, there are loads of tricks to defeat the more experienced players
5) *EVENTS* The Mount and Blade community is still really active and therefore there are events for most of the of the mods
If you wan't an mod simply full of events i would reccomend you buy the "Napoleonic Wars" DLC and join up with a regiment and play a couple of linebattles with your regiment on TeamSpeak, there are loads of regiments and some in different languages
There are pure Spanish, German, Danish etc
speaking regiments
This is simply some of the biggest reasons to as why i still play Mount and Blade: Warband this day
I hope you enjoyed my review, and i really hope that this makes you buy this wonderful game and play the living soul out of it

												It's a well polished game where the loot is actually viable to use
You are not just selling everything to the vendor but you find stuff that you can use and come up with different combinations for your characters like maybe an embermage that carries a gun and a shield or a traditional weapon like a staff or even two wands
Simple put: the itemization in the game is enormous! There are skill trees available that offer numerous different builds
For example, I started with an embermage and went all +Ice damage
But then I added some fire gear and spells and now I have a completely unique spell build that just makes me want to create another embermage to try out different combinations
The only thing that I am not a big fan of is the art work and bright color scheme of the game
At first it wasn't my cup of tea per say but it actually does work well for the style of story they are presenting the customers/gamers
It's extremely well done
There is no Auction House or Real Money Auction House
It is the standard for an ARPG and what a game should be

TL;DR? See ConclusionNOTE: Related ContentAlso see my:Torchlight (1) ReviewINTRODUCTION:Torchlight II is an isometric action Role-Playing Game developed and published by Runic Games who's composed of developers from popular titles such as Fate and the Diablo (1 and 2)
This game was designed to resurrect the old school dungeon crawler genre adding to it a fresh coat of paint and an attempt to quench the thirst for the classical isometric experience
True to the formula on what made the first Torchlight great, Torchlight 2 is one of the better Dungeon Crawler / Top-Down Action RPG available in the market
PLOT (No Spoilers):The game takes place several years after the first game
The Alchemist, one of the three original heroes, gets corrupted by the Heart of Odrak, the monster that was the source of evil that plagued the small town of Torchlight
The Alchemist, wearing new power armor and wielding the Heart of Odrak, destroys the town and sets out on a mysterious quest that would, if not stopped, eventually disrupt the flow of nature and interrupt the delicate balance of power in the world
PROS:+ Classic gameplay with nice little tweaks to fit the modern age of gaming+ Colorful Graphics+ Good level variation and environment design+ New classes and a much more varied choices for pets+ Much more complex skill tree: This is a good new addition from the first game
More complex and more specialized player builds are sure to come up
+ Good re-playability: Lots of characters, lots of builds and lots of loot
+ Multiplayer option that was absent in the first game+ Better end game content+ PC hardware friendly+ Steam Workshop Support+ Does not require 24 hour internet connection to play
CONS:- Inferior voice acting: -Unlike Diablo II who had very good dialogue and memorable quotes
- Inconsistent volume levels on dialogue: -background music can sometimes drown NPC voices
- Confusing Story: -The story isn't immersive enough to keep you interested
Story is also very difficult to comprehend without paying close attention and references
- Inconsistent Difficulty: -Normal is extremely easy that you will probably get bored the moment you get some of your more powerful skills/spells
Hard and Elite however are extremely difficult that it would make a frustrating experience to the casual gamer
I would recommend playing at Hard since I believe that getting a better challenge is much more acceptable than getting bored
- Connecting to multiplayer can sometimes be difficultCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME, GREAT BUY and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
WORTH IT?:Whether this game is at full price or on a sale, this game is worth your money
FINAL NOTES:Torchlight 2 is a great spiritual successor to the classic Diablo games that provides a good alternative to the Always-Online Diablo 3 experience (specially if you're only looking for a Singleplayer or Local play
) WORTH IT?:This is a MUST BUY and MUST TRY title for both fans of the classic isometric RPG games and new players alike

												I didn't buy this for a long time, despite wanting to try it, because in my opinion, once you'd played one Diablo clone, you'd played them all
And I still hold this opinion to be very true in a lot of ways - for example, Titan Quest, while initally intriguing, became a hellish repetitive single-player slog through to the end that, after 20-something hours of playtime, left me exhasted and scarred
Torchlight, however, surpised me
Perhaps it has something to do with the well-designed classes that aren't quite as derivative as many Diablo-clones, or the deep levelling system that allows so much variation within the same class, or the well-honed difficulty scaling that makes you feel like you're always growing, or perhaps it's all these features combined that make this game stand out
The controls are intuitive and the mechanics of the game are well-implimented
The enemies are numerous and varied, and there's always surprises to be found in every corner of the randomly-generated maps
The champions and bosses are similarly frequent in appearance, a factor which helps to eliminate that feeling that you're just grinding a way, wasting time until you fight a boss battle
In saying that, playing this game on single player, I did feel like I was taking part in the occasional grind through enemies and loot and levels, which bordered on tedious at time, but playing with a friend and sharing that burden eliminated that feeling entirely
On the topic of multiplayer, I felt that it could have been slightly better implimented, in that, for one, it took forever for my friend and I to find each other in the server screen, and there was a bug that occasionally stopped us from adding one another without a full game restart
Also, unlike the Borderlands games (the pinnacle of intuitive multiplayer connectivity in my opinion), you cannot see what missions your partner has to do, so you're contantly relying on them telling you what they're up to (via text chat, if you don't have steam chat), and if you're more advanced than your partner, then any enemies that you've killed won't reappear for your partner, regardless of who is hosting the server
Although I'm sure there's a reason for these issues, they seem like really bizarre features to omit from the game
I mean, sure, you may get a tad overpowered if you're allowed to kill creatures a second time round, but is that really worse than your partner being forced to wade through a sea of emptiness, constantly underpowered due to lack of combat? In any case, all I can recommend is that you start multiplayer games at exactly the same time
Torchlight 2 is a well-made, deep and enjoyable experience, especially with friends, that separates itself enough from other Diablo clones to really stand at the top of the pile

												08/02/2015 UpdatedYeah, this is a fanboy's short review
Regardless of the fact that i am big RPG lover, i have to admit that this is one of the best games i ever played! Did you like Diablo? Sacred? Gothic? Titan Quest? Yes? Then what are you waiting for?This game has absolutely everything which Action-RPG needs to have:+There is nothing to not like in its graphics
+A lot of things to do+A lot of ways of character customization+SKILL TREES!+Finishing the game is just a one small step for a man (NG+ is waiting), but you just need to keep getting better equipment & try other classess (ALL are fun to play)aaaand

												Torchlight II does some things very well
It does other things very poorly
Whether you like the game will come down directly to what type of RPG you like
Comparable game: Titan Quest
You will like Torchlight if:1) You enjoy character building
Torchlight II has 4 distinct character types that each have at least 2 clear build paths
The replayability is there- From a run-an-gun shotgunner to a life sucking mage
2) You enjoy the intracacies of finding and equipping the best armor/weapons and grinding/searching for more
3) You enjoy doing multiple playthroughs
You will not like Torchlight II if:1) You want a story driven RPG
2) You want an RPG with battle mechanics that are more then button smashing
3) You cant stand 'guns' in a classic RPG
4) You want a 'deep' RPG
Beyond character building TLII is pretty shallow

												This is IT
Finally a  game that not only repilcated Diungeon keeper but improved on it
The overworld angle gives the game a touch of RTS
Like a moba or warcraft 3
In this game, not only do you play defensive, but you  venture out, and go on offense
Characters level up RPG style
 If you have fond memories of Dungeon keeper this is your game

period
They got it right this time
This is it
This is it
Now only  if someone can make a JA2 remake as good is this
:( Keep hope alive

												Dungeons 3 eh ? 



where shall we start
8/10WHAT IS DUNGEONS 3Dungeons 3 is a strategy game inspired by the cult classic dungeon keeper franchise by bullfrog (RIP Bullfrog)
The game takes some classic gameplay from dungeon keeper such as digging out your dungeon, building rooms, gathering \ training your minions and finally laying traps for those pesky hero's
It also becomes its own game adding the overworld combat that was teased for Dungeon keeper 3
When in the overworld your armies take on a totaly new role where the games goes from a dungeon keeper style game too a sort of warcraft 3 style game where you can micro your minions activate there abilities and so on
If you want a more true to the original game I could not recomend a game called "war for the overworld" any more both are wonderfull games
You can find "War for the Overworld* here : http://store
steampowered
com/app/230190/War_for_the_Overworld/Now back to Dungeons 3 



THE PRO'SThe game feels true enough to the dungeon keeper series too scratch that itch for keeper fans but also its different enough to be its own game and a new experience
The game has a great sense of humor and lots of refrences that makes me cackle
The variety from the underworld to the overworld helps keep the gameplay fresh
You can spend a long time building up your lair, go for a walk for a change of pace then spend the next half hour useing traps to kill of those invading hero's Graphics are quite nice + go well with the not taking its self serious feel of the game
Gameplay is basic enough to pick up fast but complicated enough to give depth
For example you can just yolo charge your army or you can move your minions around to avoid damage, toggle and activate abilities focus healers and the list goes on and on and those where for just a small combat in the overworld
The research tree is easy to understand and quite fun with enough areas to spec into to give you quite a bit of variety and playstyles
The resources needed to advance your research also forced you to advance in the overworld not just the underworld so you cant just build up then steamrole
as someone who often does build up and steam role i am glad its not the best option as it breaks up the gameplay and helps everything feel fresh
The User interface ( for most of the game ) is very well done and easy to understand
THE CON'SThe in-level user interface menu on the left side of the screen is a wee bit annoying and takes some time getting used too
It took me a long time too stop summoning new minions when i was trying to select ones I already had
The tab for your army is also not bad when you do not have too many minions but as soon as you have more than 5 it becomes hard too organise clustered and a pain in the backside to find the minion you want and impossible to do so with any speed
I miss portals spawning minions
THE ENDThanks for your time reading this and i hope it helped you make up your mind if you wanted to purchase the game :)If you want to see some gameplay you can find my video here :https://www

												Okay, I've put a decent amount of time into the game already with intents on pouring countless more hours into it as it grows and gets tweaked
Thus far however, as with any game I've noticed some good things and some bad
 It is possible I missed the ability to do certain things, feel free to correct me
For one, the game is streamlined more with the monsters and whatnot and so it makes the evolving of creatures such as Orcs into Ironhides and Goblins in Gob-Bots pretty simplistic and rewarding for your army and it helps out a lot
 The fact you can host a smaller army cap just because it is so much easier to make stronger and more buff units is nice and the tweaking of the beasties to give them more defined roles and capabilities is quite nice even if it a bit simple
(Which I like
)The UI is

nice, it has some small issues that I personally do not enjoy and yet it is a very nice and clean UI that has little to no issues except for one thing that I have noticed
 Sometimes you can get locked in place while doing something like refilling or digging and can't click anything until you hit esc a thousand times (Small Correction, this locking which is still on-going is more easily fixed by right clicking once or twice
 I recommend trying that if it happens to you
)  The other UI thing I do not like is the Menu on the left
 I'd personally love an option to make it there permanently just for my own screen
 Waiting for it to pop up is obnoxious, fortunately we can avoid Some of the hassle by Hotkeying the options in this menu
 Which I use ` through 5 and it makes it very simplistic and yet I still want the ability to pull and keep it up
The difficulty isn't too over the top and you can increase it higher if you are inclined with the added bonus objectives for achievements being present, the humor from Thalya and the narrator in place make it enjoyable and a proper laugh even as you get into some intense fights and traps
The traps by the way might be the biggest improvement, as someone whom admittedly plays far too defensively
 I play aggressive defense, and as such properly take too long to complete maps and yet I love a solid defense
 This defensive play was crippled in the second one by three or four Bards at once coming in and crapping all over my defenses and now if you aren't paying attention they can sorta stroll through and yet with one or two clicks you can obliterate the enemy and it is rewarding
It feels like a new Dungeon Keeper (without being it

cause

y'know

don't sue me
)  So overall, I find it pretty damn impressive and if you enjoyed the old Dungeon Keeper, or Dungeons 2 you should get this game and no-life it 100%
 PS:  Who the hell doesn't open with buying a Naga first?  Seems a given

												This is a fun little game, although depending on taste might be light on content
To put my opinion into context I enjoy the ant-farm sim aspects and while the RTS part is fun, it is less my thing
 So, there is a bit of me wanting the game to be something other than it is
  I went in expecting more dungeon management and sim, but it is more akin to starcraft gameplay - tech up, fight, game over
 I felt rushed through the bits I enjoy
However even accounting for this, I still think the game is a little shallow
The story is fun, and if you are a fan of the humour will find it quite funny
 I have only progressed half way (I am guessing) through the story - having spent most of my time in the endless game mode for the ant farm gameplay
Now that I have played through the full tech tree a couple of times on the endless map with different layouts and build orders I feel like the game has much less to offer me at present
Playing with friends would extend longevity and could be a lot of fun
 Definately grabbing on a sale - and if your a fan of RTS and have some friends keen to play coop or head-to-head I suspect you will consider it worth the $40
For my tastes - I wish I waited for a 25-50% off sale

												First review I have ever written, but I will keep it short
 This is a great game; I never played Dungeons 1 or 2, but was a Dungeon Keeper fan
 While Horney is no longer around, this game has its own sense of humor and it is an enjoyable game
 If you liked DK, try this or if you enjoy the genre, try this
 I dont think youwill be disappointed

												A+ game
 Well designed, nice art work story like, humor and game mechanics
No bugs or issues
Well-polished and damn entertaining
 Enjoyed the commentary and game play immensely
 Expect to laugh a good bit
Some pretty funny content
If you’re looking for an old school RTS game, much like wow, age of empires and things of that nature
This game is a modern version with its own flavor too it
Quite addicting and fun
My only complaint is the undead mobs you get in the grave yard, feels like its missing something
They are push overs, be nice to off load those or buff them to make them more rewarding to use, or some sort of undead healer and tank would be nice
 The undead you really can’t heal them unless you send them back to base and wait a long time for the heal so I rarely use them because of that
Outside of that, made a little too many references to world of Warcraft on the story
Took a bit away from the experience but all these are pretty minor things compared to the value you get
It’s been quite a while since I’ve purchased a game this well made and completed before release
I will most certainly look for sequels and a job well done to the Devs making this game

												Fun, but as others have said, ultimately shallow
I have strictly played single player so far, but after ten hours, playing skirmish maps is losing its luster, with each game being very similar to the previous one
The random map generator really doesn't change much, and the progression through room building and tech tree doesn't allow much variety in focus
Maybe there is more fun to be had playing co-op or multiplayer, but as it is, the game would get a partial thumbs up, except for the $40 price point
At $20 I would recommend the game, but there just isn't enough content to justify the high price at the moment

												So far a lovely game, better than it's prequel
It's not a copy of Dungeon Keeper of course, it's an incredible game of it's own
I would say very good mix of Warcraft 3 and Dungeon Keeper, with some Trine too
+Graphic is great+the Narrator is great (at least in my language)!+Dungeon managment and units looks and play very good+turn heroes in undead to increase your ranks or convert them to evil heroes+Alehouse for your orcs and goblins!+your minions eats turkey, so you can make rooms for them in your dungeonsTake it if you like the idea of manage dungeons and defeat the "light" in a humoristic way, marching in the overworld to destroy towns and castles!

												I need Cold Steel II right now!			
Posted: 5 August
 In the early hours of Cold Steel, I was worried


worried that it couldn't live up to the lovely standards set by Trails in the Sky
However, after my first year spent as a student of Class VII, I can confidently say that it has, and knowing that this is just the beginning of a new series fills me with great anticipation
If you've played Trails in the Sky FC, SC and TC you'll know what to expect
A great story, compared with wonderful Soundtrack, depth when it comes to characters and a wonderful Gameplay mechanic
Cold Steel is a game in its own, you dont have to play FC, SC and TC to understand the story
However if you HAVE played those Games, you'll get a better view at some point in the Story
My Specs:i7 7700k @ 4
2ghzGTX 1070 EVGA SC @ 8GB VRAM16GB DDR4 RAMI play on highest available Settings possible and on 1920x1080p and FPS unlocked to "Limitless"
I get 144 FPS constantly without any drops so far and it feels really good on my 144 Hertz Monitor
Performance-wise this is a Gamers Dream
I'm crying just because I'm able to play this on my PC without having to buy a "Console" for it
The Game has so much to offer and if you really wanna play this Game - take some time
You have to invest around 60 Hours (Depends on your playstyle) to finish the Game
*RECOMMENDED*

												I've never posted a game review in my entire life, however, this game made me feel things I haven't felt from a RPG in a very long time
Not since FF7 have I felt a twist in a story this hard
 I'd like to think that I am pretty savy when it comes to RPGs especially JRPGs, but, I geniunely felt surprised if not totally shcoked by what this game has presented me with
 I talked to every character I could (after I got the hang of the social aspect of the game) and not only did the dialogue keep me interested, it made the game so much richer because of it
 *Gives developers and designers a standing ovation with tears in his eyes* BRAVO I SAY, BRAVO!

Posted: 7 September
												This game singlehandedly sets the standard for all future Japanese PC ports
By recruiting optimization modder Durante to actually provide optimizations and post launch support, Xseed has proven that PC porting isn't as expensive or difficult as major publishers like Square Enix pretends it is
On top of optimizations are PC exclusive features like Turbo Mode, an FOV slider, and autosaves
Xseed and Falcom are proving to be the CD Projekt RED of JRPGs, and their games happen to be of that quality as well
As with every Trails game, this game is just as phenominal as the Trails in the Sky trilogy was
It's one of the only JRPGs I could ever immediately start a NG+ on minutes after the credits roll
The characters are well written and fleshed out, the world is meticulously handcrafted to be unique and interesting, and the major story beats sets up the incredible sequel very well
This is an excellent game to get into the Trails franchise
It was designed with newcomers in mind, yet still retains everything veterans love about the franchise
The amount of quality hours you can put into this game makes the full asking price worth it, and all purchases of this game is directly making a statement about what PC JRPG players want out of their ports

												I put many many hours into the PS VITA version of Trails of Cold Steel by XSeed when it originally came out in the UK last year
As a fellow player of the previous two Trails in the Sky games, prior knowledge is not nessicary in order to start this game
Those who have played the previous iterations will find a deeper meaning and some fun references through characters and mentions however, but nothing that will take awaty the experience for a newcomer
This game, while an engine at fault, suffered frame issues on the VITA so being able to play this in a better quality, not only 60 FPS appeased me to get it once again
Falcom themselves, the original developers of the game have something unique in the craft of their games in this series, as once finished, you'll be yearning for more
That being said, first installments to a new adventure are usually slower than most
However, unlike sky, Cold Steel has an argueably more hooking beginning
The battle system is one of the most refined in the Trails series yet
We lose some features like Rush, but we also gain a different way to do battle in the way of Master Quartz, to furter augment the skillsets and stats of your characters and the ability to swap them lets you build your characters in interesting ways
Overall, a highly recommended title
Please tell your friends so we might get Cold Steel 2 next
10/10

												Trails of Cold Steel is part of the Trails/Kiseki series, of which there is also Trails in the Sky on Steam
Cold Steel is set on the same continent and 1½ years after the events of Trails in the Sky, but in a different country and with a new main cast
Having played Trails in the Sky is not necessary (but highly recommended, they are awesome games after all!), it's fine starting with this one
Port: Ported by Durante (you might know him as the one responsible for DSFix if you played Dark Souls) the game runs on a toaster and offers a wealth of graphical options
There is also a Turbo Mode, which allows you to speed up the game with the press of a button
So, what about the game itself?- GREAT story and writing
It starts slow and steady as you get to know the world and its inhabitants and events slowly and slowly escalate and escalate until it culminates into an explosion of awesomeness that blasts your jaw to the ground while you scream internally (and externally) like a little child and then it's over and GIVE ME THAT SECOND GAME NOW
- Characters are pretty good
Not as good as the Trails in the Sky cast, but still pretty good
Some of them make a terrible first impression (looking at you Machias) but all of them get a ton of growth and character development over the course of the game
- NPCs: If you take the time and talk with them (all of them offer new unique dialog after every little story progression), you learn a lot about the world, their lives, relationships, problems,


Many of them even have  their own little story arcs going on over the course of the game and at the end I knew the students of Thors Military Academy as good as the main cast
- Combat is turn-based with a maximum of 4 active party members
It has elements of positioning and turn-order manipluation and the challenge level is pretty good
- Music: It's a Falcom game, of course it has an awesome soundtrack :P- Length: around 60-80 hours depending on how deliberate you are- Voice Acting: No Japanese voices included, but there is a mod for that if you want
The english dub however is very good and has around 5000 more voiced lines than the japanese one

												Don't be fooled by my play time as I played this game and its sequel on ps3 and bought it again here to support this series on pc
The port is very good in terms of performance and graphical settings and launcher thanks to Durante
I have a GTX 760 and I am playing the game at maximum settings @1080p
I am getting between 50 and 60 fps unlike the 30 fps on consoles
It has a turbo mode to boot to save plenty of your valuable time in battles, saving your game and traversing the fields
The following is my review of the game proper:This game is one of the best jrpg'sI played in recent memory; it's very long though and has huge replayability factor due to its game plus mode and the need to play it more than once to get all achievements for their hunters out there
Despite the above praise, this game presents no real innovations in the jrpg genre, but it excels at what it does
It spends so much time in world building and making you so much attached to and invested in getting to know the characters
The characters are, for the most part, unique, complex and have interesting back stories
Even the countless NPC's are unique and have their own personalities and problems
I was reminded of persona sometimes when I played it, which is a good thing, due to its social-link like mechanic with your fellow classmates and exams
The graphics are a slight letdown but this is more than compensated by its great gameplay, beautiful music, nice English dub, which isn't full but much more is English dubbed than many other Japanese games
The battle system is turn based in the tradition of classic Japanese rpgs like persona and the earlier final fantasies and utilising enemies weaknesses, delaying enemies' (particularly bosses' turns) and performing links with your party members play a crucial role in securing your victory in battles
Also, despite spending a long time grinding for levels and items in this game, I never really got bored or annoyed by the battle system, which is a huge plus in a long game in my book
Despite being long and very detailed that it makes you feel part in its universe, the game ends on a cliffhanger, which prepares you for its sequel as it is part of a trilogy
This is the definitive edition of this game due to the excellent port and its various enhancements, which made me want to replay it despite my huge backlog

												Welcome to "The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel" (ToCS)My review is based on my PS3 experiences (Cleared ToCS I and II twice), early PC insights and my personal opinion about this game
Trails of Cold Steels:-J-RPG -Turn-Based -Flexible skillsystem with a lot of strategy-Not the hardest but really pleasant difficulty [Normal]   (Go hard if you would like more of a challenge) -Story rich (Can drag on a bit at the beginning but it's getting really epic and interesting once you are hooked)-It's quite linear but you have time to discover various places and towns (You have your freedoms) -No prior knowledge needed (Trails in the Sky or the other titles - Just light references) -Great and illustre characters and character development-Motivating to deepen the bonds (Similar to Persona) -Almost every character (NPCs included) has his/her own story -A lot to do (amsuing sidequests, minigames, discovering and collecting various stuff)-Average graphics in general-A lot of love put into details, characters and environment -Graphics are still way better compared to PS3!-A lot of improvements over the PS3 version like higher resolutions, higher frame rates (60 FPS), depth of field, shadows and so forth-Really great OST which is underlining situations and the mood greatly (Still listening to them from time to time)Playtime: Between at least 80 hours and 120+ (Average for my first time was around 110 - PS3)-It's the first game of a trilogy -ToCS II will come later to PCs and ToCS III will release in Japan this year +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ It's pretty difficult to recommend this to everyone depending on what you like


and if you have some experience from games like Trails in the Sky FC/SC/TC and Persona At best I would say it's a mix of the previous Trails in the Sky and "Persona" in general -It's a mix because like in Persona you have your everyday school life and mysterious battles/characters-You are deepening your bonds with the "main characters" and getting to know their personality
This depends on the time you are giving each of them individually (Pretty similar to Persona)The rest of the game is how you know it from Trails in the Sky -A lot of text-based conversations with spoken dialogues (way above average RPGs)-A lot of details put into the story, the chraracters, background information and collectibles-A lot of different things to do (next to the main story) like fishing, playing cards, quests and so forth  The basic story (without spoilers) is best explained in the short wikipedia description I'm quoting here: "The game's plot is centered around the newly formed special class "Class VII" in Thors Military Academy, composed of both aristocrats and normal Erebonian citizens
Class VII is the only class in the entire academy that does not segregate the two different social classes
The game follows Class VII throughout their school year, mainly around the times when Class VII receive special field training that takes them all over Erebonia
Throughout their training across Erebonia, Class VII matures and casts aside their preconceptions of the two social classes and witness first hand the reality of the empire; The power struggle between the aristocracy led by the four noble houses, and the working class reformists led by Iron Blood Chancellor Osborne which threatens to lead to a civil war
" +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So who would I recommend it to?=> People who like Persona and are into spending time to develop bonds with various characters=> People who like to play turn-based games with deep strategy (You can abuse every system


)=> People who are into longer games (Average time = 90-100+ hours)=> People who are seaching for a great story where everything feels connected (Characters, Story, Backgrounds)=> People who don't dislike certain clichés +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++POSSIBLE LIGHT SPOILERS! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Some random notes at the end (Just for me or maybe you even like it => (My Personal opinion)-Rean is a great chracter for me [Realistic - Intersting - Mysterious] -Rean is human/kind and may come across as your "typical" hero [He is not - but he tries]-His schoolmates come from various societies and families-They have all their traits and quirks -They don't get along too well at the beginning and even later-Problems will arise among themselves-They are at odds with themselves-The different reasons for their behaviour/quirks are explained well and make them loveable -The battles are fun and interesting-The characters for battle are changing depending on the school trips and where you are in the story-Even if you are not leveling you don't have to fear to be underleveled and to grind endlessly because you are getting more EXP the lower your average level is compared to the current monsters you are fighting-You are even getting less EXP when you are higher compared to the average level of the monsters you are fighting -It was a pleasure catching all kinds of fish (Fishing), to play Blade (Card Game), to collect certain books and read a novel from time to time and to get to know more about the society and the world around ToCS-A lot of German words mixed into the game (I'm from Germany so it's quite funny how they use different terms)-Fun scenes: School trips, schwimming, awkward/funny situations the characters are getting into, school festival

												I wanted to wait until I beat it to write a review but at 60 hours in, the game is already so good I feel compelled to
This is probably one of the best action JRPGs you will find on PC, and certainly the height of the Tales series (disclaimer: I've played a handful, but not nearly all of them)
Let's dive right into what makes Berseria great, and where it's a bit lacking:- The story is engrossing
Yes, it's JRPG, and it's Tales, so there's bound to be clichés and tropes, but Berseria strikes the perfect balance of not taking itself too seriously while presenting you with relatable characters in genuinely compelling scenarios
You can have fun, but still feel invested, and there's enough sub-plots to keep you interested in ALL of the main cast
- The combat is bleeding edge, joyous, chaotic mayhem
It's super fast paced, and between juggling enemy types to trigger status effects to fill your Soul Gauge to use Break Souls to feed your Mystic Artes (which you'll want to properly time to get grade bonuses, among other things), there is always a strategy to be refined on the battlefield if you are a grinder, min-maxer, or whatever
That isn't to say mastering the mechanics is a necessity
There are plenty of tools and difficulty settings to tweak the combat difficulty to your liking
Me? I crank that **** up to Intense ASAP and get to work melting wave after wave of demons in Dangerous Encounters (and all the better if you get a Dire Foe afterwards - seriously, these are some of the best, most heated moments of the game!)
- The cast is fantastic and the writing is strong
This is hands down the biggest strength for me
Despite being yet another title in a genre as saturated as JRPG (in a series as dense as Tales, no less), the main characters manage to have very distinct personalities and motivations, and are just the right amount of "morally grey" to be likable without being obnoxious
They start off as somewhat standoffish misfits, cooperating only to pursue their personal opportunistic goals, but over time you will see them grow together in a way that is believable
There's also something deeply satisfying about being able to play as a team of blatant criminals, as opposed to the white knights, royalty, and chosen ones we've grown so tired of
And beyond that, even the side cast of characters does a great job of complementing and bouncing off of the main cast
The villains do seem a bit one dimensional, and I fear the "big bad" twist is going to end up being predictable, but it's a small bump on an otherwise fantastic journey
Final note on this - the themes and the tones are appropriately adult
The language feels natural and there is swearing and innuendo in all the right places, never beating you over the head with it
- The pacing is good
The intro/tutorial segment is the perfect length (some Tales games have ones that drag on ENTIRELY too long, not the case here), and you will periodically unlock new mechanics to keep the gameplay fresh
You will actually acquire all the party members pretty early on in the game, although this is preferable due to how the equipment mastery system works
- Great customization options
The arte pools are huge, and the trees are fully customizable
I've used Velvet almost exclusively for the first 60 hours, but I can tell there is still plenty to unlock for her and the rest of the cast seems to have their own fun, unique playstyles as well
Because of how fast paced the combat is, I don't find myself switching primary fighters as much as previous Tales games, but Berseria actually makes it even easier by allowing you to swap mid-battle, mid-combo
Lots of fashion options, lots of equipment flavors, and a mastery system that makes it fairly compelling to keep different sets of equipment around (and tweak until your playstyle is content)
- The world map is expansive, but the areas can be a bit samey, and the puzzles are definitely nothing groundbreaking
Pretty middle of the road for JRPG, so just don't expect anything impressive there
I find myself constantly looking back to Symphonia as the holy grail of Tales world maps, as I've yet to see that one be outdone
- The voice acting is good
I've only listened to the dub, as the English VAs are more than serviceable
The main cast are all great
The NPCs are not as varied as I'd like or as I have seen in previous Tales games, but again a pretty small nitpick
Nearly all cutscenes and skits are fully voiced, though, so there is a truly dense amount of lore and worldbuilding going on, if you are into it (I am)
- The visuals are aesthetically pleasing
Watch some videos
It should be clear that Berseria is not pushing next gen graphic fidelity
Instead it goes for a colorful, eye-popping art style that does the game justice
- The music is good
The tracks set the appropriate moods, and have enough depth to be enjoyable from moment to moment, but I honestly didn't find much in the way of "holy **** I need to go download this right NOW" kind of songs
Still, I would say a bit above average in terms of video game music
In summary, this is a must-buy for Tales fans, but still a heavily encouraged purchase for JRPG fans, action RPG fans, or someone looking to try out the genre
If you haven't tried the series before, don't worry about needing to start at the beginning
You can jump right into this without any issues and you'll find yourself getting giddy with glee as you literally hack through swaths of demons like they were hot butter in no time: I guarantee it

												I think the only bad thing I can say about this game is that a lot of the environments just seem pretty bland and the dungeon layouts can be irritating at times
I also wish that it looked nicer overall
Velvet could also use some better costume options :sThat aside, the game has a wonderful story and the entire group of characters are all lovable
The combat is somewhat deep and also quite fun
You can definitely tell that a lot of care and love was put into this game
This was my first Tales of game and now I'm definitely going to be looking to play more! Easily my favorite game of all time

												Once every few years, a JRPG arrives that blends together good world-building, a story that is both fascinating and thought-provoking, challenging your own worldview, philosophy and beliefs and a combat system that, while simple at first, makes you feel like a glorious badass having fun killing hordes after hordes of enemies
This is Tales of Berseria
Review is spoiler-free, minus the intro stuff
The game puts you in the boots of Velvet - an average village girl that one day gets to see her little brother being murdered right in front of her by her own brother-in-law, she turns into a daemon and then she gets thrown in prison to feast on other daemons for 3 years
As she manages to escape with someone's help, she learns that her brother-in-law now is mankind's greatest hope against daemons, and the whole world praises him as a saviour
Filled with rage for the injustice she and her brother tasted, she embarks on a journey to kill him
Let me start off with the world-building
I was having a discussion with a few friends over how games stopped bothering with giving attention to details due to how gamers nowadays tend not to care much about information that gives you a clue on how X village works, how they survive in Y conditions etc
For that I'm glad that Berseria doesn't do that
Here, in the form of completely optional NPC's, you'll find stuff like a father looking for his lost son, a group of teenagers who become interested in music and decide to start their own band and dogs that are criticizing humanity
For that I praise the creators of the game who decided to not restrict themselves to "what information is useful" but also to "what information makes you immerse"
I found myself returning to a city wondering whether a couple of NPC's got married
I can't criticize the English voice acting because I play the game in Japanese voice acting, and there's some great quality to be found there
One of the characters in the group, for example, is the same voice actor behind Jojo's bizarre adventure part 4 antagonist, Yoshikage Kira, and he's doing a glorious job here, too
Combat system time! People will bash the game for having "button-mashing combat"
And they are right, combat is button mashy, BUT


It would be wrong to stop here
See, this is first and foremost a JRPG that has an "exploit weakness system"
Your typical dungeon/area visit will be  to first identify the enemy population's weaknesses, compile combos that hit every weakness they have then mash that button against them
For example (oversimplified), if an area has worms, knights and bats I end up identifying and crafting 3 different combos so I'll mash Y for bats, X for knights and B for worms (Xbox controller)
This is the equivalent of scrolling through menus in a turn-based JRPG to find the ice spell versus enemies that are weak to ice, the armor penetration move for armored enemies etc
Later in the game the enemy variety becomes large enough that not only you craft combos for each but you make sure you can weave them
So you'll start with X for the first move of the X-combo then Y because the second move of the Y-combo works not only for bats but for armored, etc
Then you get moves called mystic artes that make your characters go full blown crazy killing machines
All in silky smooth 60 frames per second, even for my poverty rig (there's a demo on Steam that you can check out if you're not sure about your PC's performance)
Add to that the amazing A
I
behind your teammates, which is also one of the best, if not the best in a Tales game ever and can easily play better than 70% of the players! I can even put everyone on "auto" and go to the bathroom knowing that we will almost certainly win a fight
Now for the downsides: So far, I find the game quite linear - on rails, so to speak, and the optional areas that I have unlocked so far (I haven't finished the game yet, have mercy) are simple arenas that lack in the difficulty and satisfaction department, compared to the rest of the content
I found myself visiting them once, go "is that it?" then leave in disappointment
Maybe this will change as the game goes on
I heard very good things about the post-game content
There are also the occasional sidequests and mini games that (thankfully) are so many and diverse that you can "play favorites" without losing the rewards (you win coins that let you buy stuff, but its shared across mini-games, thanks Namco)
The difficulty settings are Simple - Normal - Moderate - Hard, with Intense and Chaos being unlocked after you do something in the game
On the other hand, there's a way to make fights so hard you'll almost always get a couple of party members or everyone dead
To give you a clue, my winrate in normal fights is around 90% but for dangerous fights it's at 10%, but that's just me not accepting winning a fight with people being knocked out left and right (the game rewards you with in-game score, called Grade, if you win fights without deaths and without using items, who would say no to that?!?)
Maybe it's also me being used to JRPG's throughout the years
Someone can also play the game with the combat system in full automatic mode - AI doing everything - in case you just want to experience the story without bothering with learning how the combat works (I wouldn't do that but some people could)
NINJA EDIT: Something else that I noticed and I gotta say: Contrary to most JRPG's, on higher difficulties the enemies not only get the usual stat increases but also different attack frequency and in bosses it can be a change of movesets and spells!Overall, this isn't simply one of the top Tales games ever (and easily the best modern Tales game - RIP Zestiria) but a great JRPG
I said it on my Zestiria review and I'll say it again: "Tales of" games are the only JRPG series on Steam that combines fast-paced flashy combat system with immersive storytelling
Does it worth paying full price? For me that's a resounding yes
But I hope that my review was informative enough to draw your own decision
Meanwhile, I'll be finishing my playthrough and prepare for my next one
And if you choose to get into it, I would advise you to take it slow and savor every minute, instead of speed through it
JRPG's like this one deserve to be enjoyed like good wine or chocolate

												A JRPG in which your starting party is an angry vengeful demon, a psychopath with a sword, a merciless pirate and a brainwashed child you literally kidnap and take on dangerous adventures with for endgoal to kill King Arthur because he made the world a better place and you just can't accept saving the world was worth one life
Also the battle system is majorly improved over Zestiria and Xillia/Xillia2

												So after about 70 hours i finished the story of Tales of Berseria
I did not download any item packs and played on normal difficulty
I´ll just jump right into the review
GraphicsIt fullfills its purpose
It is not espeacially good or bad
The characters are well designed and the animated scenes are beautiful
But tbh, i don´t really care about the graphic quality in this game
SoundFirst of all the soundtrack is amazing
No other than Motoi Sakuraba composed the soundtrack
It really has a big role in the atmosphere of the game
This is what i call art
Every scene is accompanied by a track, that fits perfectly
Joy, happiness or sadness, even the funny parts feel authentic
Now the dub
Everything in this game is dubbed
The dubbing actors did an amazingly good job
I have no reason to play the Newgame+ with japanese dub
The english dub is by far better than expected and i´ll stick to that
BUT this game has a bug
Many people cannot hear certain sounds when using 5
1 surround sound
In this case you also cannot hear the dub
Using the stereo mode fixes this problem, but can cause other sound issues
I recommend using a fix for that (just google it and you will find it)
GameplayThe battle system is in realtime and pretty good, but not well explained
You have to figure out some stuff on your own
Tbh, i liked figuring stuff out, but i can see people being annoyed, because certain actions/skills don´t work they way they expected it
The items and ability system is easy to understand and the game is beatable without focussing too much on optimization
If you want to master every equipment or make very effective combos in battles it becomes a little bit more complex
Outside from fights in dungeons you have to walk a bit until you unlock certain teleportation points
Outside from dungeons there is a quick travel system that is bound to a consumeable item
Since you should have absolutely no money problems, it is no problem to buy nearly endless of this stuff
At a certain point ingame i nearly stopped caring about anything that has to do with gameplay, because the story gets such a strong peak, you could have given me 2d jump´n´run gameplay and i would have enjoyed this game
AtmosphereNow some of the more important parts
The atmosphere in this game is convincing
I felt like i was part of the world ingame
This is achieved by the amazing soundtrack and also by many other little things
For example small conversations between characters (which are also dubbed) or even some background noises
The characters all have their motivations to do whatever they do and no one feels out of place
There are many scenes where i thought: "Oh god no, why did you say that?" The first time was the point where my mindset changed
These characters HAVE a personality
Each of them
And the game is not afraid of showing this
The characters develop while progressing in game
Everything happens for a reason
To fully understand what happened with some characters i had to rewatch scenes or let whatever happened rewind in my head
I paused the game many times, just being stunned, waiting for my brain to comprehend the situation
StoryWow, what can i say about the story
I don´t know, i am speechless
The story in itself is kind of sinister and gets darker, especially when you understand why certain things happend
While the game starts a bit slow it quickly gets to a point where i stopped thinking this is a game
I stopped "playing" it and started "experiencing" it
My emotional state was decided by the happenings in game
I felt joy, i laughed, i was angry, i even cried a few times
This story hits you hard with emotions
And this is coming from a guy who stopped playing story focused game long ago and thought he was more of a cold, emotionless guy
tl;dr: All i can say is i am absolutely overwhelmed by this masterpiece
Don´t get scared away if you think the beginning is slow or boring
If you are only interested a little bit in JRPGs or just want want to experience a great stroy, because most of the animes released nowadays are boring, i definetly recommend this game
I also recommend watching the trailer "The Calamity and The Blade", which is english dubbed, since steam only has the "The Flame" trailer
This is the best game i have ever played

												Pros-Fast paced intuitive combat
-Solid visuals and animations
Cutscenes are nice
Character models and expressions are great
-Interesting story theme
-A lot of content, very long game even when you're moving through it at a fast pace
-Great HUD for finding points of interest and next plot point
-Tag switch mechanic is fun
Soul Break mechanic is fun
-A good amount of side content with interesting rewards
Unlocking some costumes felt rewarding
Cons-Bloated and repetitive dungeon design as you progress in the game-Arena is beyond average-Weakness/Resistance/Stagger system is really wacky
Combos feel super RNG unless you heavily spec yourself with stats and hitstun modifiers-Lack of good ways to enjoy the combat system post game-Combat is fun, but becomes very mashy at times-decent songs in the soundtrackNeutral-Minigames range from simple and fun to grindy-Game is long and packed
-A lot of the recycling, but that's a tales standard at this point
-Difficulty is average overallNote:this may seem like a backstory for Tales Of Zesteria if you ever finish the game till the end and do every side quest to know the full content of the story
Should You get this game, only if you are Tales Fans and i certainly this game will be worth your time and money and pack full of content than the previous Tales installment beside my Favorite Tales Of Symphonia

												A game I wish I could forget entirely so I can go back and play again for the first time
The world is large, the quests are plentiful, and the story reads like a top teir play
The usual archetypes are introduced but as the game marches on they're abandoned and the depth of each character shines through
Pros:-Story-Combat (Insanity is level to shoot for, if it's too easy, you're on the wrong difficulty)-Playtime-MusicCons:-JRPG Dialogue, prepare for the grunts and cheesy emotions-Weapon system feels abritrary at times, no reason to give up certain gear for a long time

												Story: 9
5/10Characters: 8/10Combat: 9
5/10FPS : 60/60---------------------Overall: 9
5/10Pros:+ The story is not your average save-the-world heroic stuff, instead it's dark and twisted
+ The combat system is the best among all Tales' games and is easy to understand
+ There are strong enemies if you like a good challenge (such as "Dire" foes)
+ New Game+ is filled with interesting options, so starting another run is worth it
+ 60 FPS
+ New battle camera
+ Quick save option
Cons:- Some characters may be annoying
- Music is not as good as other Tales' games
- Dungeons look better than in Zestiria, but some require a lot of time and running around to finish
Note:You don't need to play Zestiria before this one to understand the story, but doing so will make Berseria much more enjoyable since it will show how Zestiria came to be
Alternatively, you can play Zestiria after Berseria
Whichever you choose will make you experience the story in a slightly different way

												You know this game did something right when characters that have no backstories and barely even talk die and your first reaction is to feel deep pain
Not because of the gruesome death that a wild Chryssalid can make, not because of the large grenade explosions or the laser beams of a Sectopod, but because an XCom Operative, a squadmate, a friend, will not see the end of the war that got us all together

												I managed to make it to 2/3 of the way through this war without losing a single soldier
I was riding high, getting win after win and promoting my soldiers by the Skyranger load
We were cleaning the streets, cleaning house, cleaning Earth
And then it happened


It was supposed to be a standard op, man
It was supposed to be easy
That's what Xcom command said
"Just a downed UFO" they said, "standard sweep and clear
"We were deployed in Western Canada
The target was a UFO a little larger than what we'd encountered before, but we were big boys and girls
We were ready


We engaged a couple of X-Rays outside the front of the downed ship
Nothing we couldn't handle, a couple of Mutons that Sophie 'Baroness' Mercier put down
We were all ready to send the MEC in when it happened
Kate


she was taking cover to the front, but her right side was exposed
A God damn Sectopod came out of nowhere, man
It just walked right in, man


Tore her apart


We beat the thing, we "won" the mission
We even saved mankind a few months later
But nothing was ever really the same after that day
God bless you, Kate 'Doc' O'Connell

												You can make your very own story with your soldiers


Some may have a legacy


Some may die horribly


Some may sacrifice themselves for others


Some may even be a retard and miss a 90% flank shot


Either way, its a great game
10/10

												You've used up every soldier's turn except for one
You need to take the shot otherwise a gigantic UFO will steamroll several of your hardened veterans
You move him right into the open to take the shot
This is it, this 40 minute brawl will come to an end one way or the other after this turn
65% hit accuracy, in the end it has to be this way
Do you feel lucky, Commander?

												I have always been a big fan of the XCOM franchise since the very first game all those years ago and I have to say that XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a worthy 'reboot' of the series
The game is an odd mix of strategic base building/management and turn based tactical combat
You will research new weapons, armor and even technologies such as genetic engineering and mech warrior (half man, half machine 


although more like 5% man 95% machine)
You will have to capture and interogate the aliens, perform autopsies, and try to understand why the Aliens are here, and how you can stop them
The visuals are great, although they are a little over the top
You can field warriors clad in pink with bright blue big hair, or you can choose dark comoflaged spec ops type soldiers
It is up to you and has no effect on the game other than to meet your own preferences
You can name you soldiers to make it more personal, and more dramatic when they die
All round this is a fun game, and with DLC such as the Enemy Within and mods such as Long War this game has a lot of replay value, and potentially could be something you sink hundreds of hours into

												This review is totally superfluous
Don't bother reading it
Anything I can say has been said by others before me
Well, if you must read on:XCOM Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within is one of the very best games I have played
And replayed
And replayed
At the time of writing, I am replaying it now on Impossible difficulty, in fact
You will lose countries to panic
Your best friends will die horrible deaths over and over again (so don't name your soldiers after your friends, eh)
Your interceptors will be shot down
Your base will be destroyed shortly after your last soldier falls
Dozens and dozens of civilians will be slaughtered by aliens or turned into zombies
Whales will hold nasty surprises



Yes, XCOM hits all the right buttons for an amazingly tension filled turn based adventure into the terror of an alien invasion
In the beginning you will be playing catch up, very badly and will wonder why cover is so useless
Just useless
And then, you figure it out
And the game becomes so addictive that you will be grumpy at work the next day
Your grades will suffer
Your spouse will commit adultery
The world will end due to alien attack
But you won't realise it because you just know there is some way to get to that next MELD cannister before it expires next turn
If you just move your assault trooper after your sniper has taken out that floater, and you have supressed the overwatch from that muton by blowing it up with a rocket from your heavy trooper, and the MEC has blown a hole in the wall with an alien grenade, but oh, hell, "run and gun" is on cool down, so your support soldier is gonna have to make the run instead of reloading
But can she cover the distance and activate the cannister? Who knows? The world ends
Stop reading
Just play

												I could tell you about the many times I played through this game's campaign
About Enemy Within, and the chances it brought
About the mod Long War and how it turns this great game into an epic marathon
But you don't want to hear that
You want to know if this particular game is worth your money and your time
In short: It is
This is game about adaptation
About turning the weapons and technologies of the invaders against them, about choosing where to pool your limited resources, or where to send your troopers to fight, knowing some may not return
And boy, does it hurt when your beloved sniper, the one you've been watching over from the start, that guy that could always be counted to nail a crit at extreme distances
He has just died because you send your fire team ahead and he was left behind to offer support


until a flanking alien killed him in cold blood
That's X-COM
Those memorable moments that happen amidst the familiar landscapes
You'll also offer silent prayer to that unfortunate civilian that had to die so that you could hit that alien cluster arround him with a rocket
In terms of crunch, the tactical aspect is very solid
A large part of the battlefield can be brought down, and so can your cover, making each battle less about hunkering down and dealing and taken fire and more about manuevering
A flanking, agile soldier can become just as deadly as the one hunkered down behind a wall with the giant machine gun
A very enjoyable game, with engaging mechanics and a smart AI that makes for very emotional, un-scripted moments

												Five good reasons to buy West of Loathing: 1) Sophisticated, earnest writing
The game knows when to be funny and when not to be
And while toilet-humor abounds (both literally and figuratively), the jokes are never truly idiotic, nor meanspirited
2) Freedom of choice
Do you want to solve the puzzle or bypass it entirely? Do you want to engage in every subquest or barrel through to the ending? Do you want to kill every enemy you see or attempt a pacifist run? Anything is possible, although certain choices do have meaningful consequences
Different kinds of people will enjoy the game in many different ways and on many different levels
3) Charming music, art and animation
And there's a continual stream of new stuff to see from beginning to end
4) Cheap price
There's at least $20 worth of content in here
5) Trustworthy developers
This is a small indie company with ~15 years of experience that actively engages with their playerbase
They want to generate DLC and make new games
Good sales will directly effect their ability to do so
If you, the consumer, don't actively support them, then no one else will
			
Posted: 12 August
												There is an amount of fun and depth that the price doesn't represent
This is easily worth $20 USD or more (though $11 is so appropriate, it's not funny) I never write reviews, yet here I am
Please grab this game

ProsIt's like a Loathing game, but as a proper game executableThe amazing stick figure art aesthetic remainsA brilliant and appropriately-themed soundtrackJam-packed with a ton of well-written humour (and a ton of puns)Lots of quests to exploreStrongly-designed RPG elementsSupport for multiple save filesConsUnless you're on Hard, combat doesn't feel difficult most of the timeFetch quests necessitate a lot of backtracking, and random encounters prolong said backtrackingThis game is a prime contender for my GOTY of 2017
Like N before it, I originally started playing The Kingdom of Loathing[www
kingdomofloathing
com], waaay back in 2006
As such, the humour and puns of KoL were an integral part of my life growing up (and also explains in part why I'm such a stickler for bad puns)
I eventually quit KoL after losing millions of meat while gambling
Kids, gambling is bad, m'kay?The announcement of West of Loathing really excited me, for multiple reasons - firstly, because it was set in the same universe as KoL; secondly, because it was a proper Steam game; thirdly, because it just looked freaking amazing
It's basically Skyrim but with a lot less real-time travelling, tons to explore, and the return of Meat as currency
There are a lot of locations, and exploring every nook and cranny of them will reveal even more secrets elsewhere
That was part of the magic of KoL, exploring and figuring out secrets and puzzles on your own
Grab a notebook - there's a ton to remember at any one time, you'll likely forget a few things here and there, such is the magnitude of the number of things you can really do
Some achievements are rewarded for finishing some of these secrets, which span basically most of the game, giving incentive to actually chase them
You likely won't get everything on your first playthrough, but the game adequately counters that with the option for multiple save files - plus you can still continue a save file even after you've hit the end on that file
And then, the writing
You're going to lose your sides over and over again
There is a ton of hilarious puns and well-written humour everywhere
One of the best bits about this game are the spittoon exploration moments where the disgusting details of your dank diving into the dark depths of the salty spittoons just for egregious equipment is deftly described in putrid prose
There's a lot of depth in combat, with a choice between 3 classes, and of 1 pardner from a total of 4 (3 have to be unlocked), each with their different traits and abilities, and a lot of skills to discover and learn, giving you freedom to spec your character
You can either casually let the game build up your character by leveling skills in a specific manner, or you can build it up yourself
You'll want this degree of freedom later on when attempting the challenge of Hard Mode in a single in-game day
Last but not least, stupid walking
Need I say more?When to buyIf I'm being honest, $11 (that's ridiculous
It's not even funny
) is a freaking huge steal for what you get
I highly recommend exploring every single nook and cranny
There's so much amazing writing everywhere, and I'm pretty sure there are some bits I've missed, despite 100%ing the game

												Hey
 Yeah, I KoL'd for a long time
 Like, a really long time
 But if you're here reading reviews then you don't give a tinker's damn about that, now, do you!?First thing to look at here is, lemme tell you what kind of people are gonna enjoy this game
 Just do some mental tick-marks in your head, then you can make the call for yourself
 That's why you read reviews, right?  This is what you want, right?  I'm not like, going insane and getting high off the smell of my own farts when I say this?  'Cause the whole point is, you don't care if *I* like the game
 You care if *you* *can* like it
So here we go
- Are you the kind of person who enjoys reading things?  I don't mean learning from reading--I mean the actual engagement with the rhetoric of the thing
 Like, you read it and you think half-seriously about why someone wrote it and what makes it all work, and you get this solid impression of who the writer is, almost like they're your imaginary friend
 In this game, the writer is sort of like your imaginary drinking buddy instead
 Good comic books and their narration boxes would be the best comparison, honestly, since most games are focused on accuracy with their text rather than entertainment
 Which is a bit silly when you think about it, because of this next point:- Would you appreciate the subtle difference between a game that doesn't take itself seriously, and a game that takes itself only as seriously as it needs to?  Now, you can enjoy being the harsh critic and tearing into all the plot holes, pointing out the weaknesses and the shortcomings and where the payoff wasn't worth the investment
 Fine
 That's just being an aware, functional human being who's not liable to getting screwed at every corner
 That's not what I'm talking about
 Can you


I dunno


just let go a little bit without feeling like you're betraying that awareness?  Can you be cool about it in *both* non-temperature senses of the word?- Do you appreciate the kind of language I'm using so far?  I'm not writing this for dummies
 You do have to have some appreciation of the English language
 Sure, I'm a bit drunk right now, but I am perfectly comfortable with talking about, for example, how this game isn't succinct and ventures into full-on loquaciousness at times, but that that serves a purpose beyond either the mechanics or the strict storyline of the game (which are both independently relevant)
 It's because the meta-story matters, too
 Well, it does if you like having fun, at least
- Did you figure out by now that maybe I drink to forget all the invasive thoughts that terrorize a fertile mind embedded in a chaotic world?  No, actually, I hope you didn't, because that would seriously justify this sort of weird and unhealthy half-acknowledged egocentrism I have going on
 That doesn't even belong in this review
 Well, maybe it does, because if you actually read further into this bullet-point anyway then it indicates an ongoing curiosity about things that don't actually matter or apply to you
 You thirst for higher knowledge
 You can't help but ponder the ineffable in search for the transcendental
 There's something out there, and you're gonna find it
 Perfect
 I like that
 That definitely applies, then, and hopefully negates my worthless moping
 Because, well, it's not just engagement with the writing but the passion for discovering GOOD writing that matters here
 And you will discover it in this game, but only if you are looking for it
- Um


do you have a weird thing about clowns?That should be good
 Go play this game, like comment subscribe hit the bell, then go get a life, you poor sumbich
 Your breath is getting in the way of my alcohol
 Get out of here

												So


I've just over 350 titles purchased through Steam over my years of gaming
This isn't a humble brag, rather a picture of perspective
I have never written a "review" for any of those games, but I want to write a bit about this one
Look


the game starts off sucking
I don't know how many times I said to myself "This game is SO bad" but, I don't like losing to challenges
That's what this game is
A challenge
A challenge of fidgety controls, a challenge of stiff combat, a challenge of convoluted  quests, and I should preface this by saying I have never played any of the Gothic games to completion, but I have played the Risen series, and came to very much enjoy those
The game starts off with these milestones that seem unreachable at first, requiring seemingly way too many stat points to learn any skills, get any upgrades, or progress your character at all
Right around the 6 or 7 hour mark it was like


all these milestones came at once, and then all of a sudden, the game was playable and started making sense
I hate saying this about games, but you have to put a little time into the game before it gets good, and I guess you could argue that this is the "Piranha Bytes" way, but I felt it more in this game than in the Risen titles
So give the game a try for a while and power through the garbage first 5 or so hours, get your first companion, and THEN you will have much better grounds to make a decision
I am SUPER glad I didn't push this one to the side
UPDATE: So a little over 20 hours in, and I have to say, the game has done nothing but get better and better
I am at the point now where the world building is incredibly well done, and I have had so many awesome experiences with the quests moslty due to the lack of "Here's the morally good choice, and here's the morally bad choice"
There are SO many more grey areas than that, and choices that you made at the beginning of the game come full circle 20 hours later, and I am hoping the game continues that trend
I also want to note the companion system
I LOVE these guys
They have their own motives and views on the world, and will change their disposition towards you if your choices conflict with their goals
The companion quests, so far, have been really interesting as well
I havent cared for a companion in a game this much since KotOR, I just wish that there were more banter between your companions themselves
I feel like that was a missed opportunity that could have been interesting, and added even more to the world building
So far if I could sum this up with some cheesy quote, it would be "Shoot for the moon, because if you miss, you could still land on a star" and then I would add "


And eh



if you don't land on a star, theres all kinds of other cool stuff hanging around in space"
			
Posted: 18 October
												Pros:--------One of the most immersive and interesting open-world RPGs I've played recently
-Runs smooth as BUTTER on my computer, and my hardware isn't even that new or great
-No borders or invisible walls

you can go anywhere
-The world is fairly large, and also not empty
 A good balance of vastness, and denseness of stuff to do
-Various combat systems come together in harmony for a smooth experience
 Melee combat may feel a little stiff to some, but I got used to it
-Rich world full of character and an interesting story and lore
 Great blend of fantasy, modern, and high-tech
-Controls for Keyboard/Mouse and Xinput-compatible controlers is both very good

though I wish you could disable double-tap to dodge on keyboard
-Tons of room for changing your style of play

weapons ranging from sharpened sticks, to laser rifles all availible here
 Assign your own attribute points when you level up

learn a ton of skills, and find yourself some armor and accessories that suit your needs
 You can even learn magic, and psychic abilities
Meh:--------It takes a pretty long time to get anywhere in this game
 Be prepared to sink a dozen hours or so, before you really start to feel like you're getting significant things done/ are strong enough to do more interesting quests and go to more interesting places safely
 This may be a turn-off for some
-This game world does not give a crap about you
 It's tough
 You're meant to run away from some encounters, especially early on
 It will test your patience and skill
 Sometimes you have to dig around to figure out what to do
 This may be a turn-off for some
Cons:--------Some clumsy little things in the controls, like interacting with the wrong person/item occasionally happens
-Sometimes enemies and followers kinda slip inside objects
It doesn't happen too often, and they usually pop back out just fine, but it's a bit weird
-If a follower doesn't want to be involved in a fight because it is against his/her morals or whatever, they will just blankly follow you around while you fight, making it appear that they are simply not reacting to the combat taking place
 It'd be better if they'd go retreat off to the sidelines or something maybe, instead of getting in the way, but it's usually just a minor annoyance
-Might be too difficult/slow/frustrating for some
 Already kinda covered this in the 'meh' area
 I personally like the pacing of the game, but I know that some people will not be into it
Bottom line, I love this game, and I recommend it, but not necessarily to everyone
 It's a pretty hardcore experience
 Difficult, and time-consuming
 Immersive and wonderful
 Free and sandboxy
 Easily worth the money, if it looks like the kind of game you'd be into

												Long story short: yes, this is Gothic 2, with all of its pluses and minuses
And I mean ALL of them
If you haven't played Gothic before and are trying to decide whether to grab this game or not, you should understand what Piranha Bytes games are and, more importantly, what they are not
Speaking generally, despite having dialogue choices, character progression and inventory management, I wouldn't call ELEX an RPG in the same sense as, for instance, Pillars of Eternity or Divinity: Original Sin
Mechanics of ELEX are much more straightforward, the stamina-based action combat is simpler and easier to understand, the conversation options are mostly limited to either accepting quests or rejecting them, leaving no room for a philosophical debate akin to Planescape: Torment
No, the real backbone of ELEX is its sense of adventure and real, hand-crafted world to explore
The game doesn't feature randomly generated items or level scaling for enemies, meaning that everything and everyone you meet out there is hand-placed by the developers
This, in turn, means that no matter at which point of the game you currently are, you're free to use your skills and speed to discover and loot whatever you fancy
Fall down a pit and emerge with a hefty pouch of coins, explore the dried well and find a forgotten sword stuck in a stone, fly to the top of a cliff and be rewarded with a valuable amulet that'll increase your abilities - all of this feels extremely satisfying, because it gives you a real advantage in both conversations and combat
Since the content always remains set, every small item you get, every little thing you find brings you one step closer to achieving the heights of your power
Speaking of heights, I can't help but ask myself whether it's ever a bad idea to include a jetpack in your game, because you'd better bloody believe it makes the world of ELEX so much more enjoyable to traverse
Can't win a fight? Fly to the top of the nearest cliff and flip your opponent a bird
Want to check an interesting spot far away on the map? There will definitely be a way to get there without putting yourself in mortal danger
Love to chill and enjoy the scenery? ELEX has plenty of vantage points for you somewhere up top
It feels good
It feels right
Anyway, the worst thing I can think of about this game is getting used to it
Even in the days of Gothic, the control scheme and clunkiness of movement took me several hours to get accustomed to
I suppose that's just the way Piranha Bytes operates - the movement feels a bit heavy and carries a certain amount of momentum, and that is true for both exploring and fighting
However, once you put an hour or two into ELEX, this won't be a problem anymore, and you'll be able to enjoy the game to its fullest
And there's plenty to enjoy even without venturing to the farthest points of the vast world, because every NPC you meet will most likely greet you with not just one, but two or more tasks to handle
Earning their trust to eventually join a faction is also a trademark of Gothic, and this just makes the characters you meet more believable and likeable
In the end, I think ELEX is not a game for everybody, because some of its aspects could definitely use improvements, and it's not even that polished yet - I had the game crash on me twice during the first two hours of playtime
However, for those of you who are sick of the silly open worlds a-la Ubisoft that somehow found its way into so many modern games (sorry, Geralt, but I don't feel that destroying my 837-th drowners' nest only to find a chest with useless loot counts as a good exploration experience), ELEX will be a welcome relief

This is true game in PB spirit - anyone who liked Gothic (Risen to a lesser extent) will love this
Granted is not for everyone, this is true not hand holding old school RPG when you start weak as f*** and gradually work your way towards becoming a demigod




I mean work hard
Alternatively - go play Shadow of War for your sense of accomplishment
They give it there to you on a plate
Oh and cons:- Clunky UI


and

- INVENTORY MANAGEMENT - I mean who designed this s**** inventory, it's a 10 steps back from whatever gothic had, and that was clumsy and unwieldy

												My first "review" Currently like 40 hours in i believe and the game is amazing
The start of the game is really punishing but that's a classic PB game for you :) (Which is great btw)I love how PB lets you learn about the world in the beginning and introduce to so many characters to tell you about the history of the world and their view on it
It's nicely explained by the characters
The world is amazing and there's literally 0 loading screens, only when using fast travel (Which takes literally 2 seconds to do as well) Graphics overall are very well made and im really amazed how PB managed to pull this off with only 25 people! game is voiced acted very nicely
Many people complain about the combat, at first i did too
But in like 5 hours it's something you learn and get used to, how to parry enemies and juke them as well
Most PB games require skill when fighting enemies, not just brainless clicking
If you already played gothic or risen then you should really buy this title
many "Youtubers" make videos about this game being trashy when they only shown like 2 hours of gameplay


You really need some patience when playing this game and it will be rewarding
Exploration of the world is amazing as well
I was so side tracked i didint do any main story missions
started around 27 hours in
The game does have some issues but hey, which games doesn't have them on release


The AI of companies is a bit glitchy but it's not really a major issue
Some AI do glitch and dont move from time to time but it should get patched soon
If you never played a PB title  i would wait until the game gets patched or goes on sale
For most PB fans we know that glitches often happen in Gothic etc :P but some of them are super funny so its not even that bad
I'll rate the game a solid 8
5/10
not 10 because of the glitches mostly
 I haven't been so hooked on a game for ages and Elex finally brought me back nostalagia from Gothic !  Thank you PB for this game <3 looking forward for a next game!

10/10Pros  You really fall in love with the art style and dark, industrial setting
Also the lighting is absolutely gorgeous
(seriously, look at those sunsets at The Hound Pits pub)  The map design is brilliant with dozens of optional routes to take and ways to complete objectives
(After playing some missions for the 4th time I was still finding pathways I hadn't taken before)  You're completely free to play how you would like to - never be detected, set off every alarm there is, kill everyone with crazy rat swarms and traumatise a child or keep your hands super clean
Or just completely wing it
 As there are not endless cutscenes and the game is split into missions, it's really replayable
It's fun to try a new playthrough of the game completely different to your last one and I do feel this game should be replayed to fully appreciate the different mechanics and everything the game has to offer
Cons  "SHOULD WE GATHER FOR WHISKEY AND CIGARS TONIGHT?" will drive you insane after the 20th time
 If you don't save often and are going for a stealth, no-kills run, YOU'RE SCREWED
The game can be buggy and the controls can mess up especially when going for non-lethal takedowns
So just save a LOT if you care about the acheivements
 Yeah, the storyline is pretty short but is thankfully made up for in gameplay
Also do me a favour; read notes, listen to audiologs, use the heart on everyone, look through keyholes to overhear conversations
It adds a lot more to the game!

												The bold artistic design, the memorable steampunk world, the awesome open-ended gameplay, the compelling abilities, the colorful characters, and above all, the freedom of choice -- these are the things that mark Dishonored as one of the best remarkable games of recent years

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Dishonored Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Stealth; Atmospheric; First-Person; Dark; RPG; Action My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-40 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates REVIEWDishonored is a riveting, immersive, and downright pleasurable experience
 Decent graphics with superb artistic direction and a fitting soundtrack set the ambiance
 There is a captivating world to explore, rife with a subtle-but-present wealth of lore and history
 The gameplay can range from stealthy-pacifist style to murderous-warrior style, or somewhere in between; it is easy to find a playstyle that suits your preferences
 There is much to like
The atmosphere of the game is really its heart and soul
 The gameworld is masterfully crafted to be immersive and intriguing as you explore your way through the campaign
 Wandering through side passages and windows, you not only find collectibles and items but also notes and books which provide lore and background information
 This supplements the primary storyline and few sidequests that compose the main narrative
 That narrative being enticing and well-told, although not without a few clichés
The gameplay is structured to offer varying, branching options to choose from as you progress toward your goal
 In each level, there are various paths to take and various ways to take them
You could blow open the front door and slaughter everyone or you can slip through an attic window and never allow your presence to be known
 A lot of games try to offer this, but Dishonored is exceptional in how balanced the gameplay is to truly allow for both stealth and loud options
 It does lean slightly toward stealth, undoubtedly, but you really have a lot of freedom to get creative in how you want to go about each mission
Another premiere aspect of the game, tying together the atmosphere and gameplay, is the evolving gameworld
 Depending on your methods of completing earlier missions, as you get deeper into the campaign the gameworld changes to reflect how your actions have impacted society
 The effects are ultimately rather subtle, but contribute to further highlight the outstanding atmosphere of the game
The various styles of play and mission paths combined with achievements and collectibles make for some good replay value and decent playtime
 If you explore and immerse yourself in the lore, the game can be quite substantial; if you bulldoze through the main campaign, the game can be quite short
 Also the DLC can add a decent amount of content, so the GOTY edition is probably a good bet if you are looking to maximize gameplay hours

												Dishonored is a true memorable game
It does everything right
You have a diverse arsenal of weapons and powers at your disposal in your story of revenge
As Corvo Attano, you put the mask of an assassin in a city tormented by chaos
Your way of dealing with problems will influence the city, since killing will take chaos to new levels or being a pacifist will get you a happy ending
Level design is well thought, so being the good guy is not impossible but rewarding, while being the bad guy is really fun
The chaotic play style is the one where you'll fully enjoy your ablities and their upgrades, but as you progress that way, things get harder, as the game adapts to you to be challenging
Assassinating your targets is fun, but handlling things peacefully is actually more attractive, as you'll deal with fascinating NPC's 
If you'll take your time to explore, you'll get to know an engorssing world
Overall, this game is a gem that deserves everyones attention and while it is kind of short(I didn't wanted it to end) the score of 9
4 does it justice

												The world of Dishonored is fantastic; it is so rich and well-established by way of in-game books, notes, overheard dialogue and even just little scenes upon which you can stumble
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=303411450 Some people call Corvo, the protagonist, boring and characterless, but what's facinating is the effect that your actions - and by extension, Corvo - has on those around him
People treat you differently by way of subtle changes in speech or tone and the lasting effect on one particular character is nothing short of brilliant
As far as gameplay goes, Dishonored isn't perfect
The stealth mechanics are pretty close to perfect, with leaning around corners, clearly visible alert warnings and a multitude of clever ways to get around without being seen, http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=304088002but it falls apart a bit in the combat
Corvo is heralded as a master of arms, able to 'beat three men at once', as a guard can be heard saying
Ironically, fighting more than one person at a time can be infuriatingly difficult
And that's on moderate settings
Because almost all NPCs use a combination of sword and pistol, you can cross swords only to be shot at point blank range by someone you can't stop, they can kick you; an unblockable attack that deals as much damage as a bullet, or they can just swing their sword as you jump backwards out of range and hit you anyway
Their sword range is about three times the length of their sword and you must block every single hit
The killy death tools are nicely varied, allowing for very stylish kills with grenades, crossbow bolts and shrapnel mines, and that's not even touching on the supernatural powers
Adding them, the game becomes a flowing action of combat adding a clever third dimension to swordplay (at least the way I fight)
Aside from just jumping and teleporting high, time manipulation, rat control and blasts of wind are just some of the tricks you can use
Admittedly, you'll probably find one or two powers that you use more than the others, but the options are there to experiment
While the story can be a bit predictable, it serves as a good framing device to take you across the breadth of Dunwall, killing and stalking people of all kinds
Also all of the cutscenes are skippable for those who want to try speedruns
The DLC is an interesting topic, allowing a new perspective on the story as well as some different powers and amazing sprawling levels
The downside of these slow, stealth-based games is they can be lacking in F**k Yeah moments, but Dishonored makes up for that in lasting enjoyment, http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=304087909replayability and a world that you can be lost in for days

												Dishonored is a first person stealth action game were you play as Corvo Attano
He is the bodyguard of the Empress of the Isles but you are framed for her murder and now have to become an assassin to seek revenge and save her daughter who was kidnapped in the process
You are freed from prison by the Loyalists who are a resistance group that seek to take the city of Dunwall back
Your first night out you are visited by a mysterious character called The Outsider while you sleep
He burns his mark on your hand and imbues you with special powers to help you through your missions
These missions can be completed in a variety of ways
You can sneak through all the levels without killing anyone or go ahead and kill them all
Why not try a little of both if you feel like it
The only thing is the more you kill the more chaos will ensue
With more chaos you’ll see more rats and more plagued citizens
There are also small side missions you can complete to earn other goodies to help you out
Your weapons consist of a small sword, a crossbow, or your bare hands which can silently take out your enemies or help you in moments of confrontation
Another thing you can do is peek through keyholes to see what may be on the other side which can help you choose how you will accomplish things
You are also given a choice of ten supernatural powers which five are active and five are passive
You will need to find runes to unlock more powers or upgrade them
There are also 40 different bone charms to help enhance your powers or abilities
The supporting cast were well voiced and had many likable and unlikable characters
Everyone was well voiced which always helps add to the immersion
The story was pretty good but I just never really understood what the whole purpose of the Outsider was
I’m not sure if I missed something in the end but I felt all he really did was give you some powers and then never explain why
I also felt a there really wasn’t much to see since most of the game was basically in one area
Overall Dishonored was a great game to play and would love to see a sequel perhaps that may explain more about the Outsider
Maybe even add more missions to flesh the game out some more just not ones that make it feel like it’s just filler
If you haven’t played Dishonored yet then now is the time since the game can be picked up for cheap and it’s worth the money
Bear Rating: 9/10

												Not the most difficult stealth game but perhaps one of coolest


Dishonored is set in a world that resembles Victorian London, but with an odd asortment of technology that looks like it came straight out of a HG Well sci-fi novel: It is somehow familiar and alien at the same time
The visuals are pretty good as is the story, and the game mechanics are easy to pick up
The AI is generally quite good, except for a minor issue with leaning 



basically the AI will not spot you unless you could be seen when not leaning
This means occassionally you can lean around a corner and look someone right in the eyes and they wont see you
Not that this is a big issue because you soon unlock special powers that make 'leaning' seem prosaic
With the addition of magical talismans and very cool gadgets the game does become somewhat easy even on the hardest difficulty, but it somehow manages to remain a lot of fun
The missions are very well done, often allowing many different ways to succeed
You can be the cat burglar or the ghost killer, or maybe you want to possess the minds of men and beast to help gain access to somewhere new? It is up to you
Add to this many different routes in and out of every place and you have the feeling of really being free to do things your way rather than being herded by the gameIn the end, whilst I would not classify it as the greatest stealth game ever made, it is certainly one I recommend to stealth game lovers without any hesitation

												Death Road to Canada is a unique experience in which I can sacrifice a teammate into a geometrically impossible vortex turning them into a dog, then allowing that dog through the bitter experience of sacrifice to experience thousands of years of evolution to become a super dog capable of wielding a chainsaw and a minigun
No matter how impossible it is, my team of dumbasses who want to hook up their game consoles to the increasingly vital car battery to play Dr
Drobnus Deluxe will see their way through to Canada
No matter how many people are lost to looting that very last toilet in the rest stop, no matter how many people die striking propane tanks in an attempt to rescue a dog from a gas station, we will make it to Canada
I might be a dink
I might be told on a regular basis to cool it
But all I really know, is that all of my dogs tell me I can make it

Probably one of the weirdest and funniest game I've ever played
Some people, in their reviews, like to list out their first playthrough
I would instead like to list out the best (and worst) moments of my experience in this game
-I created all my friends and myself in custom character mode!-On two separate occasions, I accidently threw a grenade and killed my entire team
-I met up with a man dressed as Garfield who screamed, "I FREAKING HATE MONDAYS!" The game referred to him as "an abomination
"-I shook hands with The Grim Reaper and later died


-An anime girl joined my team and exploded after becoming too happy
-I got a notification telling me that a mutant was destroying a town! I chose the option to help out the city that was being attacked and it turned out that some girl just got stuck inside of a rubber dinosaur costume
-The daughter of Thor came down from the heavens and proclaimed, "I am here to help you on your quest to Canada! It's not a big deal
"-My team found a hotdog car
That was pretty cool
-I almost died in a graveyard because of my "obsession with goblins
"-I gave Elvis Presley an Uzi and he was surprisingly good at using it!-One of my friends joined my team and at one point he asked, "How about a sing-along?" My character responded, "How about a shut up-along?"-I found Cloud Strife and discovered his name was "Nimbus Ordeal
" I would be lying if I said I didn't laugh
-I played with one of my friends and I told him that we would definitely lose



We ended up winning
-When I reached Canada, a giant Canadian robot appeared singing "O' Canada!"-Best of all, I was made an honorary citizen of Canada! It was probably the greatest moment of my life
Overall, this game is sincerely funny and well-made
If you're looking for an "Oregon Trail" style game with crazy characters and bizarre situations, this game is for you!10/10(Also, you will almost definitely lose at first
This game can be rather difficult

												You huddle in your boarded up apartment, surrounded by zombies
 You ran out of food a week ago
 Your last friend died three days ago
 You ran out of bullets yesterday, but you saved one for yourself
 As the zombies tear down the door to your room, you put your pistol to your head and close your eyes
You hear a familiar jingle in the distance, getting closer
 You open your eyes
 Suddenly one of the walls explodes inwards and a huge vehicle plows through, sending severed limbs and zombie entrails everywhere
 It’s an ice cream truck!  The driver has a green mohawk, and a rusty machete across her lap
 In the back you hear two people arguing about which one of them farted
 The driver throws the door open
“Get in loser
 We’re going to Canada!”

This game is one of the most fantastic games I have ever had the honour of playing
            I first heard of this game via YouTube, on a channel called "PBGGameplays"
I have wanted ever since, I believe it was ~3-ish months ago, and I had been meaning to get it for a while
And then I did get it
And it was even better than I had expected it to be
            It is very replayable, due to the randomized everthing, and the sheer difficulty of it all
I have tried many times, (to seemingly no avail), to reach Caanada, but it is very difficult
Oh, that doesn't make it bad
It's not impossible; I know that, and I have gotten so close to victory once or twice before
            The controls are great too
From someone who has no usb-connected controllers, even the keyboard is great to use
The local multiplayer is fun, and it's quite easy to play using only one keyboard
I can see it working with three, maybe four players
             This game is chalk-full of quirky jokes and clever references
It jokes around quite a bit, but knows when it's time to kick some serious zomble @ss
From the awesome car prompts, (such as "Let's boogie!" or "Hit it!") which, honestly aren't necessarily even jokes, just completely awesome, to the Buttsville police departments, this game is made of the essence of fun
              I love the style of it all, and the (I think) 32-bit graphics
And the music
Ooooh the music
I love it
I love all of the music
All of it
It's the kind of music that makes you want to get up and dance the zomble-filled night away
Well done
              Anyways, this game is just awesome, great job to the dev(s) who made it
If I were to rate this game with a number, it would have to be an absolute ten


out of five
I absolutely love this game,
                                                                              That is all

												THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1
3 Starbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy
From playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy
Pros + Unique art style + Infinite procedurally generated universe + Creative alien races that are completely customizable + Pets unique to each race + A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero + Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials + Mining and harvesting isn't a grind + Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator + Devs constantly working to update and add new features + Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization + Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race + An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable
Exploration is necessary to advance upon it, is unique to each race, and customizable to each player + Crew members can be added to your ship, but I'll say more later + Your own space station can be created for players and NPCs to visit + You can create and fully cutomize a mech to fly through space and stomp along the ground + You can visit and trade inside of other space stations full of NPCs / other players + You can create colonies for NPCs to live in + Treasures can be discovered pretty much anywhere + Tech can give you powers like dashing, jumping, and morphing into a ball + The bosses get harder and are all quite cleverly created + The quests link into the web of connections that advance your tech, systems, and story + Moddable in any way you like, from the intro scene to Robbie Rotten's clothes + Vehicles such as hover bikes and boats are available
+ Port forwarding isn't required to host games, your friends can join you through Steam at any time + Tiny easter eggs and hints from the devs can be found throughout the game + It's fairly cheap price-wise, I mean it's a fourth of No Man's Sky and four hundred times better + The soundtrack is beautiful and has brought tears to my eyes more times than I'd like to admit + So many possibilities that can lead to my 700 plus hours on this game Neutralities ~ The universe doesn't feel losslessly empty and gigantic, it's fairly easy to get from star to star ~ Life is extremely abundant ~ 2D and pixelated; the graphics aren't 'next gen' Cons - You can't customize the exterior of your ship - Crew members are a little dumb AI-wise and not extremely useful - It's a bit slow paced, which a lot people don't like  because they all are stupid and get bored way too fast and don't have the drive to actually work for anything  but I love it
TL;DR * It's a great space exporation game with a web of slow-ish paced advancement that's extremeley wide in possibilites and customization
* Much of the game is unique, including the races, planets, stars, and generated structures
* If you don't like it, you probably don't like space games :p

												For people who like story, or fast, reaction-based gameplay, this game isnt for you
With over 200 hours on this game, i have come to a conclusion
You don't play this game for the end goal of saving the universe
you play this game for the journey it takes you on
I realised this when I was playing with friends, and we where doing nothing but sitting around a campfire on logs playing music on our instruments that this was my favroite game
If a game can make sitting around a campfire an experience that is memorable, it has to be doing something right
10/10, hands down
			
Posted: 24 May
More Than Just Terraria In SpaceI was initially attracted to Starbound because it looked like Terraria in space
This was appealing to me because I love Terraria – I presently have over 290 hours in that game – and I love science fiction
After 100 hours of playing Starbound, I came to the realization that despite their surface similarities, Starbound and Terraria have subtle and not-so-subtle differences which distinguish between the two games
Starbound focuses more on completing quests and uses procedural generation more extensively
It also is more of a survival game than Terraria is – on survival and hardcore difficulties, your character must eat to survive
While both games have exploration and combat mechanics, Starbound tends to be more focused on exploration and less on combat, as most weapons are found in chests distributed across the surfaces and caverns of planets rather than dropped by enemies
PositiveThe boss fights are enjoyable
Furthermore, after you complete the campaign, you gain access to a repeatable dungeon with a procedurally-generated boss, Building is easier in Starbound than Terraria due to the ability to place back walls without having to craft them from blocks – instead, you simply right click while holding a block to place a background wall
There are also a wide variety of block types and objects to build with, allowing the construction of interesting towns and villages
Multiplayer games are exceptionally easy to set up
Starbound supports Steam’s “join game” feature
Furthermore, the multiplayer games are very stable – I have accumulated most of my 100 hours in multiplayer, and only noticed one significant bug, namely a villager side quest which could only be accepted by one player (With the introduction of 1
3, I have noticed an uptick in the number of bugs in my multiplayer game
The bugs don't seem to be multiplayer specific and appear to be limited to a handful of players, but I thought them worthy of mention)
Starbound features Steam Workshop support and a massive array of mods - over 2,600 workshop items are available for the game at present
The pixel art is good
While aesthetic is highly subjective, I find Starbound to be a better-looking game than Terraria
Starbound’s soundtrack is, to my untrained ear, quite good
It is also fairly extensive – there are several hours of music to enjoy
In the endgame, it is possible to upgrade lower tier legendary weapons (a group of weapons which were designed by hand rather than randomly generated) to tier 6, the highest tier of weapons available
If you particularly enjoy using one of the lower-tier legendary weapons, you don’t have to permanently relegate it to the shelf when more powerful equipment comes along
NegativeMovement in Starbound is less satisfying than in Terraria due to the lack of an equivalent to the later game's wings
This is an issue given that a large portion of the game consists of travesing alien landscapes in search of a village or dungeon
I often wished that I could simply fly over a pool of lava rather than building a bridge over it
While this is the only major omission in the movement catagory, it is a rather glaring one
Starbound has some of the worst side quests I’ve ever seen, and I played the original Mass Effect
While the handful of handcrafted side quests in the game are fine, the quests given by villagers and colonists are awful
The quests are randomly generated and fall into only a handful of preset mission types
The messenger quests are especially annoying, requiring the player to carry notes between two NPCs standing 5 feet apart
The other quests aren’t quite as bad, but the lack of quest variety quickly leads to them becoming repetitive
Crewmembers seem like an afterthought
In my experience, medics and chemists give their respective bonuses so rarely when outside the ship that they are mostly only useful as combat support
Furthermore, engineers and mechanics are hilariously broken
Mechanics can increase fuel capacity infinitely, while engineers can increase fuel efficiency to the point that you can fly across the galaxy on zero fuel, behavior that was presumably unintended (fixed in update 1
3)
Some of the achievements require an insane amount of grinding
The worst offender is the Destroyer of Worlds achievement, which would take tens of hours of nonstop mining to achieve legitimately
Neutral“Serviceable” is the best way to describe Starbound’s story
The game has a hackneyed “collect ancient artifacts to save the world” plot, the characters are memorable, but don’t get much character development, and the campaign consists of only 8 missions including the tutorial
This is forgivable given that the story isn’t Starbound’s focus
Ultimately, Starbound is a sandbox game, not a JRPG
The cost of randomly generating ordinary weapons is that they are far less interesting than some of the insane weapons found in Terraria
The inclusion of secondary attacks helps somewhat in differentiating between weapons, but I still found myself deciding which weapon to use by calculating DPS
Fortunately, there are a fairly large number of handcrafted legendary weapons
If you somehow didn’t like Terraria, you probably won’t enjoy Starbound
While Starbound tries to differentiate itself with its focus on questing and sci fi setting, its gameplay is like that of the game that inspired it
However, if you enjoyed Terraria and are looking for a similar game with just enough alterations to the formula to justify its existence, Starbound is the game for you

 Starbound, short and sweet it's a great game
But here are the very long reasons why: (  Paragraphs in order: Storyline, Gameplay, Graphics, Setting and mods  ) STORYLINE In starbound, you play as a character of any of the six races about to graduate to a protector
This is stopped by a violent and mysterious force, which coerces you to escape in the first ship you find
As you look to repair your ship you are pulled into a rope of interesting and exciting quests to see what parts of the universe you can salvage before the same violent force rips it apart, just like it did to your home planet
PROS:  Allows you to get a sandbox experience without feeling forced to do the story (there are ways to skip it) Feels complete when you're done, main story line may end, but there are always tonnes of sidequests
Easy to follow along if you don't take long breaks
CONS:  Low curve, would appreciate more action spread through the scavenging of artifacts
My ideal would be adding more minibosses
 GAMEPLAY Although it may seem daunting with all the crafting and vague mission information at first, it is not
A general idea is to get your ship furnished before doing the missions
Get some understanding of the crafting and the traveling
Generally, looking at the  starbound
wikia
com  helps you with missions and obtaining items
The gameplay can shift between serene and action filled based completely on what the player wants
The serenity and action are respectively accompanied by multiple factors such as the music or dialogue
For the calmer experience, there is farming, cooking, building spectacular monuments, fishing and looking for easter eggs and pop culture references (which are spread out very frequently)
As soon as you want action, you could do some hunting, exploring or doing missions in both the main storyline and ones you find in the settlements on the planets
The quests are also rewarding, with some giving gift bags and others offering to join your crew on your ship
The boss battles in this game are exciting and suits both casual and hardcore players, depending on how fast you decide to go through the story
The combat is smooth and is changeable depending on the players choice of weapons and armour
 the most important part, however  is the free and easy multiplayer
You can play with friends through dedicated servers or through the steam overlay  join game feature PROS:  Everything is fun, there is really not a whole lot of grinding for items or currency
during mining, for instance, the game throws dungeons and new underground biomes at you to keep it interesting
Everything is a way to progress
After some calm farming you could sell the crops to progress, if you want, you can make food with the ingredients that can help you with different effects
 Combat is very good and easily fits any player
CONS:  Some derpy issues such as settlement guards attacking you because their houses get striked by meteors
GRAPHICS  "pixely" graphics remind many of terraria, but the graphics designers have really done well, seeing as there are so many branches of weapons and clothes from all races and all different weapons, magical, firearms, spears, chakrams, you name it
Everything is very varied and all the mobs are very visually adapted to their biomes and planets
The bosses do a good job of showing their origins and the attacks fit their visuals
PROS:   Modern but nostalgic Well varied Items and furniture convey their origins and use
CONS:  Not a whole lot of underwhelming weapons that allow the legendaries to stand out
They took away the feature of mobs having different colors depending on their planets to give slight notability to a seemingly average poptop or gleap
 SETTING  The setting can change depending on choice
Staying on a planet is accompanied by one of twelve songs by day and sixteen by night
Many who play this game, including me, love the music and it fits to different parts of everyday life
My personal favorite way to listen is through the title screen, but I know I should already have bought the OST on steam
In the game, during bossfights, there are nostalgic feeling battle-music that really sets you into the idea that your character is in danger
PROS:  Amazing music that fits a serene or action-filled gameplay
The immersion is helped so much by music
CONS:  It's hard to get around to buying a five euro soundtrack
 MODS When you feel like you have completed everything you wish to have completed in starbound but crave more, fear not
There are hundreds of free mods to enrich your experience, post main-missions and during them
A noteable one is called  "  frackin universe  " The megamod is generally the biggest mod in all of starbound and adds dozens of new biomes and monsters along with hundreds of weapons, armors, tools, items and microdungeons
It also adds a whole new quest hub and a massive eldritch dungeon to explore
There are also things to help you collect things  you would normally have to work a bit harder for and very much more content
It feels like an entirely new game
Oh and did I mention? the mods are free
 SUMMARY  Addictive game with smooth combat, interchangeable setting, easy multiplayer, cute graphics and free mods, some of which completely renew the game, to multiply the replay value tenfold
I have over two hundred (I know, casual hours) in this game and I don't plan on stopping, seeing as I have only slightly dipped my toes into the "frackin' universe" mod
9
5/10  Would definately recommend if you are willing to get past a slightly slow early game

												Although it gets boring fast if you're alone,add in a few mods like Frackin' Universe,get a friend or two to play with you and you're really going to enjoy the game,I'd give it a 9/10			
Posted: 23 January
												EDIT: damn, top of the list


i hope this changes something
EDIT2: got sick of people misinterpreting the reference to No Man's Sky, so i removed it
sorry!1
3 edit: basically only modified the lategame, base gameplay is still mechanically brokenDon't let the negative rating fool you - I don't hate this game, I just don't like what it's become
TL;DR Loved Koala, don't like Giraffe
Generic environments with generic dungeons and towns, repetitive and boring combat, shoehorned and unengaging story gates your progress constantly
Let me start this review off with a little nostalgia from my first experiences with the game
I played - and loved - the Koala builds
Every planet was different, with different creatures and different landscapes and colours
It was nice
I didn't know what I was going into, and that was great because each experience was a new one!However, I feel the direction the game's taken is downwards
Planets are now segregated into different types, and each one has essentially the same thing to expect
A lush planet has a mine and some ruins
A forest planet has a swamp and some frogs, maybe a few Avians
A snow planet has llamas and some monkeys
This happens again and again and again, and while the terrain is varied and gives a hint of adventure to the "exploration", seeing the same rebel camp or monster-filled mine or generic temple over and over again gets boring, fast
Seriously, on every planet, you'll be sure to find the same thing in a different shape
This is a weakness that demonstrates itself in spades when you begin to actually explore the universe
Additionally, there's the problem of the combat system
Throughout the course of your exploration, you're constantly thrown the same preset enemy with the same preset fly-towards-you-and-do-damage-on-contact tactic
(I'm exaggerating here, but still, there is a shameless amount of monsters which simply run, hop or fly at you and deal damage as soon as they touch you
)More creatures with mechanics like the Poptop, who come at you slow but do a lot of damage when they charge, would be a lot more fun, and would make the fighting more engaging than "this creature runs at you and mobs you until you die, kill it"
There is so much more that could be done with the system, and it shows with the complexity and variety of weaponry in the game, but the way that every monster attacks you is insultingly and unfittingly simplistic! It's also annoying to get cheap-killed on a regular basis, and degrades the gameplay significantly when it literally starts punishing you for daring to venture from your house on your starting planet
Finally, there's the problem of the story being shoehorned into everything you do
I don't know about you, but I play Starbound to build pretty things and venture out into the unknown
Unfortunately, the game forces you into the shoes of a superhero, and it constantly rubs me the wrong way
I couldn't give half a damn about the fate of the universe
I play this game to build and chill out
Maybe that's an incredibly shallow way to play a game, but it's just the way I play
Unfortunately, the way the devs have implemented the story is annoying and broken, disallowing you to actually explore, instead holding your hand like a gameplay-long tutorial level
I don't care for the story because it's inconvenient and slow to work through, gating your progress while never bothering to actually engage you outside of "save the universe from Cthulu"
I don't think there's any more that I can say other than please, for the love of God, Chucklefish
Make the worlds more wild and varied
Add more building configurations
Make some biomes NOT spawn buildings as often - people don't need to live everywhere
Reduce the spawn rates of your preset creatures and work on the combat - it's boring and it starts to grate after a while
And, please, make the story optional
It's so painfully linear and shallow that it feels like I'm trying to read a children's book than play a game
Please make this game fun again
I'm starting to get sick of installing mods and turning off monster spawning just to have a nice time
ADDENDUM:About two weeks of experience with the game later, and my opinion hasn't changed - though I can certainly list out some good aspects of the game:BASE BUILDINGThe wide range of blocks and items, and the option to have NPCs inhabit things you create, makes for a fun and relaxing to play
My only gripe is that the interactions are far too shallow, and the radiant quests have a very, very limited range
MODDINGModding is absolutely amazing in this game, and is exactly as advertised
While confusing and frustrating occasionally, modding is incredibly flexible and often instantaneously satisfying
Also, the ability to add mods to the game to flesh out your experience is rather pleasant
Unfortunately, it's the most fun I've had with the game thus far
If something passes my mind, I'll add it to this addendum
I would have written something on the community but I currently don't know what I'd say on it

Early Access Review
								This is a great rogue-like, couch co-op (sometimes without the co-op bit) variable speed action RPG/sim
When something goes awry, it's hillarious, but the control is very much dependent on your strategy (or lack there of)
Pros:The graphics are nicely stylised, and run smoothly
The funniest tutorial I've played in a game so far
Great for having some friends around, as the learning curve isn't that steep
It's a bit like a multiplayer hotline miami, with more to do than just killing (although that always an option)
It's still in early access, the dev is very active and is constantly fixing bugs and adding new features
There is already plenty of content and unlockable characters - each with their own traits/buffs/neuroticisms
The sim aspect is coming along nicely, interactables work well, NPC's reactions are amusing and well thought out
Online multiplayer (haven't tried this yet)Can press enter to chat, would press enter to chat to my friend sat next to me again
Generative levels are done well
Cons:Split screen functionality, can sometimes be confusing, especially when bringing up the map, which covers the whole screen, gets cluttered with 4 people + inventory (quick use commands were not working in multiplayer in alpha 25)
Narrative between levels would be a great addition, especially since it has a classic arcade machine intro
Plenty of bugs, needs more content, but EA so to be expected
No FBI loading screen, telling people that "Winners don't use drugs"11/10Would use drugs again

								To be frank, I kind of underestimated this game at first and I hate that I did so
This indie game is extremely fun and enjoyable and every time I play it with my friends we always have a blast
As well, it's development is only in ALPHA right now, and it doesn't even feel like it's in alpha, rather; it feels like a game that's been worked on for a lot longer
I definitely recommend this game, playing this with friends is so fun, and there's lots of funny and memorable moments you can get from playing this with your buddies
Even without friends, this game is still extremely fun, as well!Keep it up Matt, you're doing a great job! I cannot wait to see how amazing this game will be when it's finished!

								You're hungry, and you have a target to eliminate, who is being held captive in a couple of buildings ahead
You spot a fridge in a locked house
You hack the fridge
The fridge charges forward
It passes through an entire building before hitting a generator
The generator is outside the holding cell containing your target
The generator explodes
The target is free, and very grateful to you
The owner of the fridge spots you outside his place, and attacks
You run away, past the target to find where the fridge broke
The target gratefully sacrifices his life for you, while you eat a ham sandwich
A passing policeman witnesses the brawl and brutally murders the furious fridge owner
Target eliminated, you have been fed, and nobody who knows of your terrible deeds is left alive

								I've played the alpha a lot and I want to tell you some things about this game:1
There is a lot of content, even in Early Access
2
You can play this game exactly like you want to
If you want to kill everyone, kill everyone
If you want to kill nobody, kill nobody at all
If you want to just mess around with gadgets, you can totally do this and succeed
3
There will be a lot of funny and useful combinations for you to explore
I also want to give you some pros and cons:Pros:- Awesome Pixel art- Fun and fluid gameplay- A lot of replayability- Each of the many classes feel different and are fun to play- A nice developer and a good influence of the community (in my opinion at least)- You can be a giant gorilla, do I really need to say more?Cons: - Sometimes the game can be a bit confusing if too much happens at all- Early Access
Not a con for me but it might be one for some peopleI wasn't able to try the multiplayer aspect of the game but I'll try to catch it up sometime soon
So far the game is really polished and feels way better than most of the Early Access Games out there

								You're probably curious already, but I know you've been hurt before
  "Early Access?" you ask, the words laden with memory and loss
"I don't--"   SoR places a finger across your lips
Its dark eyes fix on your own with a gaze so sure and warm that your reservations begin to fall away
At first speechless at the game's audacity, you find yourself strangely comfortable within the silence
You've never seen this game before, but at the same time


it feels like it could be an old friend
  The game steps back and reaches into unseen pockets
  "For me?" you ask, anticipation creeping back into your voice as SoR places its gifts into your open hands: a baggy of cocaine, a baseball bat, and a breaching charge
"But


I really don't understand
"   "It's okay," it says, chiptune artifacts whispering through pixelated orthodontia
"You will

								After completing a mission I got the "Killed No One" bonus
Did I physically stab or shoot anyone? No, I did not
Did I buy a slave, order him to stand guard in front of the only door out of a building, then fill the air ducts with shrinking potion causing a bunch of tiny people to run outside and get squashed by my slave? Yes, I did
Am I legally or morally responsible for their deaths? Apparently I am not
Game is good

								You ever play Hitman: Blood Money? Remember how much freedom you had in completing your missions in that game and how goddamn cool it was?How about Deus Ex? The cyberpunk RPG that slowly built you into an unstoppable force of nature in several different ways, all of it up to your own playstyle?Well, take those concepts, add tons of ridiculous and flexible items, throw in a few *dozen* different characters with vastly different skills and inventories to match, procedurally generated city blocks and solid NPCs to populate them, and you've got this fantastic little number
Highly recommend it

								This game is ridiculous
I mean that in the absolute best way possible
While there's no overarching story to be found and  the upgrades are random in the very best of the Rogue traditions, I keep on coming back
Characters to unlock, challenges, mutators, and perks to explore
I'm hooked

												Video games often deal with larger than life situations, and yet it tends to be the simpler things that hit home the most
Borrowing elements from films such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and Pixar's Up, this is the story of a man on his deathbed attempting to fulfil his lifelong dream to visit the moon
To go into anymore detail and risk spoilers would be a crime, but know that To The Moon stands as one of the most heartfelt stories of any game I have ever played, and when paired with the immaculate score composed by my much beloved Laura Shigihara, I can hardly imagine how someone could play through it without feeling something
It's worth noting that what is here consists almost entirely of exposition
This is in by no means a slight against the game, just a fact that needs to be mentioned so you know what you are getting into
I realize that many have a disdain for games that barely warrant being described as such, but in this case I beg that they put aside those prejudices, as I feel if anything could change their minds To The Moon is it
To say that Freebird Games creation was emotionally affecting to me would be an understatement
Despite coming close on many occasions, I can scarcely recall any game that managed to make me tear up the way To The Moon did
It's a remarkable achievement in not only videogame storytelling, but as a narrative in any medium, and you would be an absolute fool if you passed it up!You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal

												Wow
To be brutally honest, I loaded this game up today thinking that I would just play around for a few minutes and then put it away, unlikely to ever play it again
In reality, from the point the story began to unfold I decided that I wouldn't 


or couldn't stop until it was completed
It's amazing what Freebird Games managed to do with the RPG Maker tool
With some subtle animations, lighting, and movement, it didn't take long for me to forget the 'low budget' visuals and imagine as the game and story elements unfolded in whatever resolution my mind can create
I will admit that this isn't what a person could call a gameplay heavy experience
However, the way that the elements are woven into the story are creative and even add to the story
I think as a medium we hurt ourselves by calling our games 'games' at all


however, I was able to complete the journey through my own interaction with enough perceived freedom that I didn't feel corralled into a corner
Mostly the story itself made me want to push to the next story element or conclusion


it was simply that good
It's sad, really, that a small time developer like Freebird can craft something with such a small budget that is so moving, yet all the big AAA developers can hardly bring me to laugh let alone shed a tear
Speaking of laughter, the pacing of the story is impressive with some comic relief to mix up the joy and sadness
Although I will admit, a few times I thought one of the main characters was a little over-the-top silly


but that may just well be who he is
When I was in college I took a movie class where the instructor said it was a travesty to ever watch a movie in pieces


and in this case, if you can free up a few hours, I think that this dish is best served in one sitting
Just keep a box of tissue next to your monitor

												I'm not crying, there's something in my eye			
Posted: 3 December, 2016
												I like to think of myself as a human being in touch with my emotions
I feel, love to feel and don't stray away from bad or good
I admit, sometimes I tend to overreact, but my opinion is that things like that can't happen if you don't care
However, I am not easily touched by art
The last time I've cried is also the first time, as far as I can remember
Back in the nineties, when I was five or six, I've watched this movie


I can't remember its title, but I remember the dread and tears rolling down my cheeks during the final movie scene where character visits his buddy's grave
His deceased friend is his circus monkey and instead of flowers, he's bringing him bananas
Something about it disturbed me deeply
Since then, I had a few emotional rollercoasters where consuming art made it harder to swallow or breathe, but I was never moved completely
Steam Awards this autumn had To The Moon nominated by a buddy of mine
I was suspicious about it; hey, it's Enterbrain's engine RPG, which means Game Maker, which means, dude, stuff like that can't move you
I didn't really point it out to my friend, but could he feel I was skeptical? Could be, because I've received it as a gift
So, at least I could give it a try, right?At first sight, To The Moon looks childlishly naive
It's a simple 'walk-in-four-directions' RPG game with limited interactivity and no combat system
It gives an impression it wants you to explore its world, however, soon enough you will discover the game is rather linear
Dr
Rosaline and Dr
Watts of Sigmund Corp
have a rather peculiar job - they rearrange memories of dying people so they remember their life differently seconds before dying
The new technology allows them to fulfill dying person's wishes
They didn't expect visiting Johnathan Wyles would be anything more than a regular night on the job
However, things turn out to be rather complicated when they find out they need to fulfill Johnathan's dying wish - make him travel to the Moon
It doesn't take very long to get tangled into a four hour story choke full with symbolism and emotions, aiming and succeeding in shattering you to the core
This is a game that thrives on its lack of stereotypical heroes, big quests and otherworldly ideas
Meeting Johnny (Johnathan's nickname) proves to be a gutwrenching, slowbuilding experience
Nothing in To The Moon happens too fast or too slow; the story is perfectly timed and it's progressing toward the epic finale one step at a time
Both humans and certain objects are pieces of grandiose puzzle
However, motif is not onedimensional - it consists of several layers and, as you piece it together, it takes away your breath, masterfully emphasizing tearjerking moments by utilizing comic relief in form of Dr
Watts dialogue lines which are often used to break the fourth wall and make the world even more beliveable
And while moving and interacting mechanics are not something that game should be proud of, they're basically non-important
On the other hand, music composed by Kan R
Gao, game's writer and director, proves to be a moving force behind the title and catalyst for game's story
It works wonders in creating atmosphere, be it moments of light comedy or heavyweight anxiety
As the game progressed, I felt it coming: I knew To The Moon is actually influencing my mental state and changing my perspective with each passing minute
I knew I was getting attached to the characters, their ideas, fears, thoughts, doubts and hopes
By the end of Act 2, it was getting harder to breathe and my emotions evidently grew stronger
As I was approaching the game's climax, I felt my eyes were burning and body's temperature rising
And then it hit me so hard, the way I wasn't struck by anything in art since that monkey scene from a movie I no longer remember - To The Moon made me cry and it didn't stop there
As I was gasping for air and being thankful I was home alone, I couldn't stop myself
Emotions were too strong, no matter how hard I fought against them
I even tried concentrating, meditating on my breath, thinking crying over game is probably silly because I'm causing pain to myself


But I was wrong
I was so wrong
To The Moon made me cry during playing, step away from a keyboard and cry for another half an hour after finishing it because it was so liberating
It was an unscrewed valve releasing tons of pent-up emotions from who knows where
A silly little game I knew nothing about proved to be one of my favorite games ever, one I will ALWAYS recommend and the one I will measure interactive art from now on
Few months ago, I was at home, nervous about some basically unimportant reason (could it be money, or recent  unemployment or what?)
My daughter was sitting by the window, her elbows on the window sill
So I was nervously pacing through the room when she turned to me and said: "Dad, come here with me, let's look at the stars
"And I've really turned around, somehow, the fate didn't allow me to miss out on that opportunity
So we sat by the window and we've looked at the starry sky and then she said to me "Look at the stars, Dad
Stay here with me
We'll look at the stars
Aren't they beautiful?"So I sat there and gazed upon the shiny dots thinking that, as we grow up, society murders something good in all of us and that our kids are the only way we can, at least partially, get it back
So, just as my daughter on that very night, this game did the same thing for me - with its story of hopes, dreams, fears, love, life and death, it made me feel a little bit more human
And I'm forever thankful for that

Exquisite, emotional storytellingTo the Moon was released late 2011 to immense critical acclaim - it received several awards as one of the best Indie-games of 2011
Steam user reviews are also "overwhelmingly positive" (97% positive out of nearly 12
000 reviews is really impressive)
That's already quite an achievement by itself, as it was the first game made by the then new and really small development studio "Freebird Games"
So I went into this game with quite some expectations, and I am very happy they were all fulfilled, and more
To put it frankly: as a game that wants to tell an original, emotionally involving story, To the Moon is simply among the very, very best
Its story is so original, so gripping and so sad at some points, that I found myself completely absorbed by it, and I played through the entire game in one day and almost in a single go
That's no exceptional feat: it's not very long, I needed just under six hours to reach the end
But what wonderful six hours these were! Since To the Moon relies for more than 90% on its story and its twists and turns, I won't spoil anything here
Suffice it to say that I felt involved in a way that a good book or a good movie can achieve -and maybe even more
It's not only the story that is gripping, there is more to it
To the Moon dwells extensively on very important social and philosophical questions, such as the desire to develop one's individuality amid a rather bland society, or man's right to decide (or not) on his own life's ending
Heavy and even depressing as this may sound, in reality the game succeeds wonderfully in touching these delicate issues in a subtle way, made all the more digestible by its great use of humour
I found myself quite often laughing aloud, only to feel tears coming up the next minute or so
It's this so difficult to achieve balance between humour and depth, that makes this game outstanding and a true piece of art
Dialogues, of which there are plenty, are simply masterful: all credits to the story- and copy-writers for this one
Not everything is perfect, though: the actual gameplay is rather bland and even repetitive, since it mostly involves moving the two playable characters around on a small map and interacting with objcets and other persons in a rather straightforward point-and-click adventure-syle
Happily, the inventory is kept very simple, but there are is a whole series of mini- (even micro-) games that is simply boring
But even this rather disappointing gameplay vanishes into nothing thanks to the story and the emotions it evokes
The subtle 16-bit graphics are quite interesting: even though heavily pixelated, they manage to bring across quite some detail, even on an emotional level
All in all, this is a gem of a game; a testimony to the fact that Indie-games have evolved into gamings most innovative department, where content is so much more important than package
It's a must-have for anyone who takes his gaming even a tiny bit serious
Overall score: 9
5/10

Early Access Review
								Another favorite made by Behemoth
In its current state (Early Access update 3), it stands strong on an excellent foundation for what can be a masterpiece once finished
I'll list some pros and cons below for its current state
PROS:Artwork
Voice acting
Funny
Turn-based made fun
World exploration
Co-op, both local and online!Daily leader board with rewards (replay value)
World seems to have 'pick up or ignore' side quests
Capturing new recruits to join your team is currently my favorite part
The weapon and shield choices are great, and hilarious! Spatula for a sword, large piece of bacon for a shield, lol!CONS:Main storyline is limited to only one, really awesome btw, quest once the tutorial missions have been completed
Sound track is VERY limited at this point, and music can get repetitive
There needs to be about 20 more monster types added for capturing and battle variety
CONCLUSIONGreat game that's worth a buy already
Made by a team you can trust to see the project through to the end and finish with a great product
Highly recommended, worth it for the laughs alone

								I grew up at the tail end of what I'll call "the Newgrounds generation"-- that is, the adolescent boys (and, to a lesser degree, girls) who spent their youth on the website of Tom Fulp, engaging in the flash animations and games and becoming part of that underground internet subculture
I was always captivated by that which made Newgrounds, Newgrounds-- the fact that anyone could make anything and upload it, and anyone else could comment on it or rate it
And nothing stood out to my juvenille mind more than the works that made the website famous; the ultra-violent Madness Combat series; the absurdist humor of Eddsworld; the insane difficulty of early iterations of Super Meat Boy


The list of media that changed my budding self can go on and on
I retained all of it; I'll blame my entire personality and sense of humor on what I grew up watching and playing on my dad's old laptop
But the one export of Newgrounds that I always loved the absolute most was The Behemoth
I fell in love with their beat-em-up classic Castle Crashers at a Kid's Night Out party, as I played it on an Xbox 360 there
I was obsessed
Every waking moment I would think about, draw about, talk about the game
When I finally got my own Xbox 360, Castle Crashers was one of the first games I bought for it, back when you paid in Xbox points (where one dollar was equal to 80 or 160 points)
I was a junkie for that game; I even brought my own Xbox to my friend's houses so we could play together locally
Years later, when I heard they made Battleblock Theatre, I bought it on the spot
It was everything I wished for-- The Behemoth's signature art style, sense of humor, and pefectly challenging gameplay, but on a platformer
I had a new drug, and I was hooked
I played that game whenever I could
Sadly, eventually, the burning passion I held in my youth died out
I would still play both games (Alien Homonid too, but to a lesser extent) from time to time, reminiscing on the bygone era of the post-Golden age of Newgrounds
Time passed, and I caught wind of a new Behemoth game from either Game Informer or PC Gamer in the magazine rack of a local supermarket
And this time, it was a turn-based RPG! I was amazed
I was excited
I spent as much time as I could researching it, trying to find out where, when, and how I could play it
That was years ago
Pit People was a cloudy fuzz of nostalgia and excitement in my mind until the day I opened up steam and what did I see on the front page-- Out now, Pit People
I was ecstatic
I couldn't wait to get it
What stopped me? My own wallet
In my youth my pocket changed flowed freely, and I splurged on whatever I felt like-- games, DLC, food, movies-- but in my teenage years I was not the same
I decided to myself, "ah, early access
I'll wait until it comes out for real"
4 updates passed, and I couldn't hold back
I whipped out my debit card on the first day of the Summer Sale and proceeded to buy it
And I must say, it's everything I hoped for and so, so much more
Where do I begin? Everything is exactly as I remember The Behemoth
The gameplay is challenging, in just the right level of fun
There's tons of options for how you want to play the game
There are cosmetics galore
The story is humorous but engaging, light but oh so rich
The announcer is the same from Battleblock Theatre and I love it as I did back then
This is the kind of game I would have made for the young version of myself growing up at my dad's overheating computer playing on Internet Explorer until I accidentally discovered Firefox
I give this game a perfect 10
If anyone at The Behemoth is reading this post, I want to tell you: Keep up the great work
The Behemoth quite literally shaped my mind as a child and it's just as good as I remember it

Early Access Review
								Pit People is XCOM, Fire Emblem, and Pokemon thrown into the minds of Behemoth and what they made is a funny and good looking game
The meat of the game is doing battle with teams of bad guys with your very own squad that you find through the story mode until you find Sophia the Recruitador (a lot of characters in this game have funny names)
Then, the game branches into another way of playing it
You can capture any unit you fight on the battlefield when you leave it as the last one alive
There are several character classes from the human fighters to the penguins to the beefy giants to the cupcake healer class
Every character has their own name from Gluten to Pipistrella
This is an early access title as of January, and it shows only in the story mode
The rest of the game is polished and balanced with each weapon type and class, but the story mode is farly short
What it lacks in length it makes up in character and gameplay
The narrator Stamper was present in their previous game Battleblock Theater as well but he takes the role of a godlike bear that overlooks the story as a sort of meta-narrator, talking to the characters and talking to the player
Apart from the short story quests, there are a few side quests that are all five parts incrasing in difficulty
These serve the same purpose as side quests in different games, to give you some more gold and flesh out the characters
These side quests take a bit longer than the story
Apart from the insanely fun singleplayer, there exists an in-universe multiplayer PvP called the Pit, which is pretty much the only reference to the title of the game
You and a partner control your squads to defeat two other people's squads
It's a very satisfying game mode as you can learn from the other people's squad composition to increase chances of success
Think XCOM PvP
You get story rewards as well depending on how many games you win per day
As it is now, Pit People is very fun and well balanced even though the story mode was short and as sweet as the cupcake healer class

								It's a game made by The Behemoth you already know it's good

Early Access Review
								I haven’t seen very many qualitative reviews yet, so I’m attempting my own
This is based on what I’ve experienced in the game so far playing three hours on my Xbox One and on Steam altogether
A turn-based strategy game, you can build a team of up to six characters with their own customized equipment
Everyone can have different weapons, some with effects and some that are strong against enemies wearing particular equipment
An example of this is that swords will be weak against people with helmets but maces will be strong against them
While customizing you character, you will see a bar graph which tells you their equip load, damage, range, defense, and dodge
Going above 100% equip load will reduce the character’s move points by one, and staying below 50% grants an additional move point
You can designate one person on your team as the hero
Doing so gives them more health, damage, and greater equip load
The combat is fairly simple
Move your melee team members adjacent to enemies, and they will attack them
Ranged team members supposedly need at least one empty space between the enemy and themselves
If there are multiple enemies that can be targeted within the vicinity, that unit will seemingly choose a random enemy to strike
Some of the fights can take a few minutes depending on how fast your thinking is when it comes to moving your team
Early in the game, you will find a city where you will be buying some of your items, fighting in the pit against A
I
or other people online for gold, and customizing your characters or changing your team members as you obtain equipment and people throughout the game
Gold and items can be obtained outside of this place, but you are limited to how many items you can carry
Two important items I’ve come across are campfires, which allow you to heal your team outside of combat, and recruit cages, which allows you to recruit enemies to join your team
Mind that you will need to unlock the recruit cages through meeting a certain character first
I would recommend not fighting in the pit early in the game against A
I
's beyond story mode
Three consecutive rounds can be difficult to finish
Story mode is not finished yet, but there are many battles across the map you travel through outside of combat
Alongside the story mode quests, there are other quests you can choose from
You can also encounter optional quests while exploring the map
The game will point you to the objective once you’ve accepted a quest
The art and music are reminiscent of previous titles, but they feel updated as well
The narration is just as funny as it was in Battleblock Theater
Castle crasher players will recognize the combat style immediately
Battleblock Theater players will know how this game is loosely connected to it
I've recently tried co-op
Pretty much the second person you play with will have the same stuff as you from the very beginning
When you unlock a character, they get a variation of them as well
They will also have the main characters in character selection when they have the chance to change team members
I have not tried PvP yet, so I can’t say anything about them
Hopefully someone else can tell you guys about them
Other than that, that’s all I can tell you about the game
Hopefully you will find other qualitative reviews better than mines
If you buy the game, I hope you enjoy playing it as I did

Early Access Review
 Pit People is a fairly interesting Turn Based Strategy game
Which makes me excited for release
 Hoooweeeever  Pit People is still in development
Though you can have some fun now, It gets a bit eh
Tiring
Boring? Don't get me wrong, the game is good there's funny side quests per "world" there's Story
Etc, all the good stuff
However, It's just not getting constant updates the moment
Meaning if you're invested in the game and want to support its development while it comes out, sure go ahead pay now
However, if you want to enjoy the game in its full state and not just be stuck wanting to know what happens next
Well
Wait until the game is released
The game has catchy (copyrighted) music
And its policy on uploading to youtube is fairly easy to abide to
If you want to avoid copyright mute the music, leave the narration on, and play and upload
EzPzNow As for the game there's tons of weapons in variation and quality
IE There's Bows, Guns (guns aren't as good or OP as you may think) Light Swords, Heavy Swords, Maces, All that good stuff
And they all have their pros and cons
For example the Mace is a good weapon however its heavy
Meaning if you have the mace you cant wear armor
And if you wear armor, you're weakness is a mace
(Or club) and even then there's multiple and tons of races not limited to the Electrobots, Giants, and Spidaurs
Oh and a Troll mother
You know that giant bushmonster thing from Castle Crashers
And again, each race has its own pros and cons
Electrobots cant heal through cupcake races, only through gnomes and do massive AOE and possible stun damage if aligned correctly (they can also float) Wraiths can do debuff damage an an AP (armor piercing) attack that ignores armor
However its melee only
However the Wraith has a Weakness to Rainbows, (and possibly pixies?)But I'm not going to guide you through everything the game is lively but incomplete
You will yes have fun, some units have funny names
Game makes me want to play it but
Well
Doesn't have much for it right now
I'd recommend waiting until release to buy it, as at release you can at least get a taste for the game before refunding (if you choose to do so) But I certainly recommend it even so, It's worth the money (especially at release whenever that happens) and is done by the Behemoth, who can do no wrong in my eyes yet
That and the artwork is by Dan Paladin so
It's all just great
But again, I suggest waiting until release before you fully judge the game
Also this quote from the "Why Early access" question
Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?"Yep
When the game is completed, it will cost more than it does now
ORDER TODAY!"Also, Also
The developers listen to community feedback and bug reports so once again
It's worth the pricepoint at the moment
There's just not much to do in the game currently
There is some
Just not a lot

Posted: 19 March, 2014
												After playing Super meat boy, I started looking out for new games by the same developer
Edmund Mcmillen’s wonderfully strange imagination is an interesting thing to explore through his games, that’s for sure
This game was not a disappointment
At first, I had no idea what to expect, the trailer was very strange but a tad intriguing
When I came across it there was next to no information about the game and the mechanics of it on the store page and back then there was no costumer reviews to go off of
Admittedly I never actually brought it to give it a go off of the information I was given, I ended up with it from a bundle and it’s the only reason I really played it
Although I wish I had taken the leap to try it because it is well worth it
Binding of Isaac is a randomly generated dungeon crawler, one I have heard to be described as “Zelda-like” (I would have no idea about that, never played a Zelda game) you’re a young boy running from his demented mother
Who has been blinded by her hard-core Christianity and believes that the voice of god has spoken to her and told her to murder her son to prove her loyalty
So a very interesting concept, indeed
A short cut scene plays on start-up, which expands on what I just described, you find yourself wandering through randomly generated dungeon floors, fighting monsters, picking up loot and items as you go along that changes how you fight, gives you different abilities and drastically changes Isaac’s image
At the end of each floor, you fight a boss, and move on down to the next floor
It being harder than before, with a bigger space to explore and more enemies to defeat
There’s a large range of items to collect that when found for the first time is added to the “things I found” section in the main menu, so a lovely bit of collecting there to entice those OCD minded like myself, There’s new characters to unlock which vary in stats, challenges to complete and even some DLC that can extend your gameplay
You are given one life and one life only
You can find hearts to heal, but once you are dead, that’s it, you start all over again
So throughout the whole game and especially when nearing the end, it starts to put a little pressure on and gets that heart rate going
I’m not one to be good under pressure so it gets me every time
I FINALLY managed to complete the game a few times over, again, admittedly, only after I gained some “top tips” from my way-to-good-at-games brother
There have been people that have completed the game 10 times over and still not gotten bored
I think that the randomly generated dungeon element to it keeps its replay ability intact
If it were to replay the same levels over and over when you died, the game would be a lot different and no doubt a lot less popular
I have heard from friends that it is quite hard to complete without “doing your research” on the wiki or seeking tips from those nerdy minded like my brother who managed to figure all of it out themselves
I on the other hand find that kind of thing enjoyable, because it beats you every time and you work and research and try to understand the game more to finally get to that ending
I can quite honestly say that the first time I reached the end, my heart has never beaten that loud or that fast in a long time
And that sense of accomplishment you get from finishing a game, is a on a much higher scale when you work to complete this one
The music is great, it fits the setting perfectly and is great to listen to
Rarely have I actually wanted to download a game’s soundtrack, I can give most soundtracks a thumbs up but not often do I actually want to listen to game music outside of gaming
The art, as per usual in Edmunds games, is amazing
And I hear they are also looking to remake the game to have a more “retro” look, with possible multiplayer features
Which should be very interesting
For those interested you can look up “Binding of Isaac: Rebirth”
All in all, it is a great indie game, which is both fun and challenging
Definitely worth trying, I am not usually the dungeon crawler type, but this game is a lot of fun
The only fault that I had with this game, which has bothered me quite a few times now, is that I have lost my save for no reason
The game is listed as having ‘Steam Cloud’ features, but it definitely doesn't work
I haven't uninstalled the game, I haven't touched it
But recently I hopped on and seen all the progress that I had made was gone
And for a game that has no real save points or ongoing plot to keep up with, your stats, unlocked characters and collection of things you have found is pretty much all you have
I was pretty upset to see it had vanished and it’s something I felt I needed to warn people about
TL;DR : Awesome music, fun and engaging game with a slightly 'twisted' side to it
It's a challenge to reach the end and you can definitely end up putting a lot of hours into this
Addictive and awesome all around

												+ Endless replayability, every game is different in every way+ Endless array of items to pick up+ The controversial religious theme is a breath of fresh air+ Freakishly awesome enemies and art design+ Absolutely addicting, worse than dope- After a while playing, it gets terribly slow on later levels (blame Flash)- Can be frustratingly, controller-smashing-onto-a-wall difficult			
Posted: 29 December, 2013
												As of writing this I am 500+ hours in and I have to say its one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long time, It's really easy to just pick up, yet it also has the ability to make you stay playing for hours on end
Due to all the secrets, items, enemies and most importantly the difficulty it has a ton of replay value
When I say difficult I really do mean it but the more you play the more you learn how to overcome many of the challenges that the game has to offer
Another reason I enjoyed it was the randomly generated levels, this also comes with random enemies, items and secrets, so no two runs end up being the same
The game also borrows a lot from Zelda, so if you are a fan of the level design and many of the mechanics of the early Zelda dungeons and items you will probably be a fan of this
Other than the solid game play it is aesthetically pleasing because of Edmund McMillen's really fun and quirky art style
I really recommend you pick up this title and the expansion pack as soon as possible

												The Binding of Isaac is a small game with very simple mechanics, but it will catch you with its huge amount of contents, great soundtrack and polished graphics
Sprinkled with humor and nods to gaming's past, The Binding of Isaac is a ballsy game that revels in its absurd moments
Shock value aside, you'll want to play this indie gem over and over again
It's imaginative and  utterly absorbing
I'll put it simply: If you can roll with the macabre toilet humor and if religion jokes don't put you off, AND if you enjoy games with non-optional permadeath, randomized content, tons of secrets and considerable replay value… it's hard to go wrong with The Binding of Isaac
Especially at its low price
			
Posted: 18 May, 2015
												This is pretty much a roguelike dungeon crawler with quite a bit of influences taken from Zelda, and a ton of religious/Satanic overtones and pretty taboo themes, which was probably designed for masochists



And I mean this in the best way possible
Pros+ Fun and rewarding combat+ The game is difficult, but also fair towards the player+ Nice cutesy but brutal art style+ Gameplay is random with its roguelike elements, making it very addictive+ A lot of different items and powerups to mess around with+ Multiple unlockable characters to suit multiple playstyles+ Plot has a ton of social commentary that will hopefully leave you thinking even after you stop playingCons- Can be glitchy at times- Difficulty curve can be very brutal for newcomersQuestionable? If you're a pretty religious person, you may be pretty offended by the game's style, plot, messages and humor, but you may be able to overlook these things
Overall, I would totally recommend this game to other people
			
Posted: 15 October, 2014
												A stream-lined rouge-like, filled with morbid imagery and religious overtones
Gratifying combat and a punishing yet fair system of bosses and enemies
The few glitches that it holds are more than made up or with a mind bending story, compelling social commentary and a wonderful community
Pros- Consistent, skill based combat       - A multitude of bosses and enemies       - Hundreds of items (Each with their own individual effects)       - Different characters supporting multiple playstyles       - Complex metagame to masterCons- Glitchy        - Learning curve like a brick wall        - Extremely punishing of mistakes and deaths        - Thick subtext (Overkill at time  [Having to literally kill yourself as a boss])A rewarding experience which captures the journey so perfectly, the destination is rendered irrelevent

												The game is brilliant (and sooo addictive)! One of the best indie games ever
It is interesting, hard, it has exellent dark humor and atmosphere is epic
It is the game you should take with you to a Desert Island
First you will die a lot, but then (if you are curious enough and tenacious) you'll know tricks and secrets, learn every combination and manage to do crazy amazing stuff
 Music is great, very catchy and suitable, the graphics - cute and old-school
PS Mom! I love you mom, I still do :( I will go to the basement, I will meet my inner demons, fight them and win! And you will be proud, right? Or maybe I'll just play with some dead things (that you threw there), get parasites, decide that I am a cat and can fly and kill you, being one happy and absolutely crazy boy! XoXo Isaac

												Why is a Company doing things like this, i really enjoyed playing SAS 4, even played SAS 3 for a long time
So to get to the point, i played around 15 Hours to get my Charakter to level 30 what i figured out than was just disgusting to be honest
You increased the price for game perks from around 11
000 to 215
000, it's an increase in price by almost 20 times, are u serious? I really get that a F2p game is living by it's microtransactions but you got botherd by buying Crates and stuff almost every click
Is the idea behind that you might think "yeah he reached after such a long time just lvl 30, he must be addictet so we make him pay"? Was giving so much money into SAS 3 but this is not worth it, even that i like the game but i feel fraud, 20 times price increase is just a bad joke

												if you're keen on playing SAS 4 on PC, play it on browser
this steam version is an inferior mobile port
			
Posted: 18 October
												Now, I know what you're thinking
If you played SAS4 on PC, you're absolutely thrilled it finally got steam support


but that's not the case
This is a port of the Mobile version of SAS4, with no Crafting system, no Upgrade Rewards, and absolutely no free-range chat
Player beware, this game's netcode is a scare

												Game is OK,but it is a port of the mobile
A lot of players want the features from the browser version on steam
			
Posted: 22 October
												We want the browser port on steam please
			
Posted: 20 October
												If you want to play this game I strongly suggest playing the browser version: https://ninjakiwi
com/Games/Action/SAS-Zombie-Assault-4
htmlReviewing this as someone who has played the browser version of the game
Everything feels very sluggish
Player and zombie movement speeds need to be increased and either a significant increase to mouse sensitivity or a mouse sensitivity slider is sorely needed
Overlaying the minimap with NPC avatars who are contacting you is a terrible idea
Having them pop up at the top of the screen, like in the browser version, was fine given their brief length
There should be arrow indicators at the edge of the minimap pointing to items on the ground, like money and strongboxes, just like there is in the browser version
The graphics feel too bright and clean compared to the browser version
Grenades only throw forward so throwing them at hordes of zombies in pursuit of you, which is basically the only time you need grenades, is suicide
The grenade should go where your cursor is like in the browser version not only thrown at an arbitrary distance in front of you
Mouse cursor grenade precision is crucial to surviving heavy encounters
The turret support UI element at the top of the screen is annoying, its blocking very valuable aiming space and I constantly click on it instead of shooting the zombies I'm trying to aim at, and should be moved to the lower right corner as it is in the browser version
What happened to the alloy+money crafting system? Where are the XP/Alloy bonus rounds?The only thing I like about this version is the added red dot sight and that is literally it
			
Posted: 2 November
												Sorry to say that - but that's not even the browser port, it's port of the mobile game, which offers less than the browser version
This doesn't even have a chat, and is in my opinion lacking
Game aged fairly well, graphics are still pretty cool, since you don't see many top down shooters no more
But still leaves me pretty sad to actually give a negative comment on this, devs didn't really bother, wasted opportunity, they really should work on it instead of giving us this crap
Say whatever you want, try the browser version then try coming back to this
			
Posted: 21 October
												Very, VERY, lazy mobile port
I mean, for f***s sake, could you at least have the effort to remove settings that bare no use on pc?

I've been playing this game for about five years
Well before it was on Steam
It was a complete and rich experience then and it is even better fleshed out now
Don't listen to negative reviews calling this game "unpredictable" or "incomplete"
I never did the main quest until years of playing this game
It is not the focus of the game
The game is highly unpredictable but that is a feature not a bug
In the vein of Nethack or Rogue, unpredictability is one of the main gameplay elements
Expect to die immediately
Almost every death, however, can be avoided if you play correctly and pay close attention to your surroundings
This game is not for most people
But for the rare and imaginative few who appreciate turn based classic roguelikes with a heavy emphasis on gameplay and variety and not on graphics or balance, then this game will enrich your existence permanently

Early Access Review
								I like Caves of Qud quite a lot, and it deserves the positive ratings it has gotten
 However, it is not quite ready for a consumer audience and is quirky enough that it would turn a lot of people off
 I'm writing this "negative" review so that you can understand its shortcomings before buying it
Caves of Qud is actively in development, with all that entails
 By "development" I do not mean "polish"
 There are almost daily updates which sometimes break old savegames
 Mob combat AI is still getting major improvements, items are still being added, large balance changes are made regularly
 The main quest is not finished, some major locations (the kind you can see from the world map) are not finished, and some of the few named unique NPCs have no dialogue
This is a true early access game, not a beta
 If you are passionate about roguelikes and/or science fiction to the extent that you'd like to help develop the game by finding bugs through hilarious death, you might want in on this
Beyond its incomplete status, this game is a roguelike
 By genre convention it lacks a great many of the conveniences most gamers are accustomed to
 Input is keyboard-only
 The default keybinds for laptop are both horrible and incomprehensible
 Permadeath is on by default and the disable-permadeath option is somewhat cryptically hidden
 Many enemies can and will destroy you even in starter zones and a "fair fight" is a myth
 You will not always get warnings when steering your character towards certain death
 You will have absurd runs of bad luck that are not your fault and you will die of them
 CoQ makes excellent use of its tile art system, but it's not what most modern gamers will expect
If you are not comfortable reading books at least a chapter at a time, you will probably not be comfortable playing
 If you cannot occasionally relinquish control and adapt to chance circumstances, you will find this game infuriating
 If you cannot sometimes let go of a good thing, this game might break your heart when your character dies
This game, overall, has a high barrier to entry
 If you overcome it, though, the world beyond is rich and lovely, as a hundred other reviews will attest
Caves of Qud is a lovely roguelike with beautiful tile art, a piece of far-future fiction that sci fi fans will immensely enjoy

Early Access Review
								I'm not the biggest roguelike player I know
Sure, I enjoy randomization, I enjoy permadeath (a lot!), and overall, I appreciate the types of games they are
Before I played Caves of Qud, my favourite roguelike was probably Dungeons of Dredmor
I still love it, but that's mostly for the writing, as I loved how goofy it all was
At first, Caves of Qud didn't really grab me
I didn't play many ASCII games growing up, aside from a really great one called 'Sleuth'
I was among the many that looked at a game's graphics and judged it solely on that
My my, how times have changed
If you can look past the simple-yet-complex visuals that you're faced with in Qud, and if you get a hang of the fairly easy controls, there is a very, VERY deep game here
One that allows you to opt-in for a character defect that will cause to you spontaneously combust, all so that you can balance that out with something better
What kind of better? Well, how about having hands so cold that you literally freeze your enemies from touching them? Or a way to see 5 moves into the future?How about the ability to clone yourself to make your own follower? Or give yourself better night vision and hearing abilities, so enemies are easier to detect? Or what if you just wanted the mental ability to 'hate' something to death? All of these options are fairly viable in your character creation process
That's why I love this game, and I've barely scratched the surface
Play a gunslinger with extra limbs who survives by photosynthesis
Play a water farmer who is constantly hunted by your evil twin
Play a character who has a beak
The possibilities are endless, and endlessly weird
This game is so much damn fun

Early Access Review
								If I could take one game with me to a desert island, it'd be Caves of Qud
**DIFFICULTY**Is it hard? Yes
Is it too hard? No
Even for somebody who's never played a roguelike before? Totally do-able
You will die
A lot
The game is designed to be hard, but not tear-your-hair-out frustrating
The way that it manages to be very difficult and yet wholly enjoyable despite death after death is a masterpiece of gaming
**INTRIGUE**There is deep political simulation, effecting every last mob in the game
Gain enough reputation with certain types of creatures or people (arachnids, farmers, tortoises) and they will rush to your aid in battle
Lose enough, and they'll attack you on sight
The landmarks in the game--like the starting village, Joppa--are always the same, but the wilderness and caves are procedurally-generated
That means that as you try to reach the deepest depths of, say, Red Rock, you could find the next staircase down mere feet away or on the other side of the map
What's more, there are very in-depth and extremely interesting crafting and trade systems that you can master in time
**COMBAT**Deceptively simple
Like any proper roguelike, you have to come up with creative ways to deal with certain situations
Choosing whether to shoot your rifle or swing your sword could be a life or death decision
It's easy to learn, hard to master
**CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION**Oh, boy
Wanna be a beguilin', time-dilatin', flame-throwin', photosynthesizin', gunslingin' cowboy-snake called Grassy Jones? You got it
Want to be one of just a few remaining true men, an aristocrat as well versed in ways of the trigger as he is in the way of the blade? You got it
 Wanna get a few more points to put into useful mutations by taking a debuff that puts an evil twin somewhere in the world, an exact clone of your character who may one day find you and kill you? Yep
You can do that too
**LORE**Just play it, man
It's awesome
**CONS**Sometimes, you get attached to your beguilin', time-dilatin', flame-throwin', photosynthesizin', gunslingin' cowboy-snake called Grassy Jones
While after he dies you can click 'replay most recent character' on the new game screen and get Grassy Jones back, you won't get his successes back
Half the time, that's fine and it's just as fun to do it all over again
There's actually a disable permadeath button, but for now it doesn't work
There are other little cons, but they're too small to mention
**THE BEST PART**It ain't even finished yet, cowboy

Early Access Review
								I had never actually seen a madpole before
Even the best hunters in Kyakukya would talk about them as merciless killing machines
The thing looked as mean as they said
Rows of jagged teeth flashed between frantic snapping as it splashed about
I watched from the banks of the river a few feet away, peering down my carbine's scope to get a closer look
It was ugly
I pulled the trigger; the madpole tried to flee, but another pull and the water turned red around its corpse
Three more madpoles swam over
I shot another and they scattered
I emptied my carbine, reloaded, and saw that only one was still moving
Feeling sporting, I shouldered my rifle and drew my daggers
I waded into the river and charged the last madpole, landing both blades in either side
You can imagine my surprise when this madpole ignored the blades I planted, latched onto my shell, and I could feel its teeth through my carapace
The very same carapace had, just last moon, merely sizzled as laser fire hit me
Even more surprising was watching my right arm come off in the madpole's mouth, then fall into the water as the madpole took another attempt at ripping my shell from my body
I stabbed as hard as I could with my remaining arm to try to dislodge the madpole
This worked, in a way; the madpole released in order to gnaw at my feet, shearing them off with such speed that my terror obscured my pain
My remaining forearm was taken off at the elbow
Rolling myself onto the bank of the river, the madpole released me to fall back into the water lest he suffocate on land
I rummaged through my now thoroughly-bloody pack with a stump and my face; I found it: My last shot of Ubernostrum
Held in my teeth, I shot my bicep-stump full of superdrugs and watched as my arm sprouted back, as painfully as it did quickly
I dug out my revolver, shot the remaining madpole to death, and collapsed
I decided to wait and wash my bag as I waited for my natural mutant regeneration to generate bones and sinew to regrow my limbs, and to reseal my carapace where the madpole had bitten through
I dined on my severed feet while I waited

												I'm a sad man
I'm late-40s and I still like cute things
I also love RPGs, so you can see why I looked at Recettear and liked the look of it
The game wasn't quite what I thought it was though



but in a good way
I was pleasantly surprised
You'd probably be forgiven for thinking as I did - this is a typical JRPG with the theme being centred somehow around a shop
Well, yes it is


and it isn't
The game essentially has two parts to it
The RPG part takes the form of a fairly typical top-down dungeon crawler a la Chocobo's Dungeon, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and a host of other similar ones
That's about as standard as it gets though
Recettear does things rather differently - you are a young girl who has inherited her father's item shop which serves the local townsfolk with equipment for their day-to-day use and more importantly, stuff to go a-dungeon-crawling with
You also have a guardian of sorts (who also turns out to be a debt collector too) who's a fairy
Well, this is a Japanese game - 'nuff said
The relevance of this is that Recette (you) have also inherted some burden of debt too, who naturally you owe to your ward
So, the crux of the game is to run the shop, and earn enough each day to enable you to pay off your monthly debt payment
I know, that might sound a little boring, but it isn't
It's actually where the game really shines
Your day is divided up into a maximum of 4 sections, which you can "spend" by either visiting town for certain things, visit the adventurer's guild (more on that later), or open the shop
Your shop has certain shelf spaces laid out, and arranging the stock so your best stuff is visible from the window is an essential trick
Put the boring, common and cheap items in the window and you'll attract less passers-by
Put the really expensive stuff in the window and you'll also attract less passers-by
It's a balancing act
Once customers come in, they'll flit around looking, and approach you with items they want to buy from the shelves
As with any real-world store, the trick is to maximize profit, while retaining custom
So, sell higher than you bought it, but low enough so they don't get annoyed and never return - another balancing act
Some customers will ask for certain special orders in advance, which you almost always never have the stock at the time to fulfil, so you make a gamble on whether you can acquire the stock they're asking for - accept and fail, and they'll get annoyed, but refuse and they'll get annoyed too
You can't please everyone


So where does the stock come from? This is where the adventurer's guild and the dungeon crawling comes in
Instead of opening the store, you can toddle off to the adventurer's guild where all the adventurers hang out
You can recruit them, for a fee to go and dungeon crawl with you
 There's a great element of risk/reward here, as at the end of each level, you can choose to duck out with the loot, or proceed onwards with the chance of more and better loot, but with the added risk of costly failure
As Recette, doesn't fight (well, she's only a girl), you take the role of the adventurer here
Her role is to tag along and store your part of the loot
So, you fight, you level up your adventurers, you gain better loot to sell for better prices, you get money to pay off your increasing debt, and so on
There's also some added little nuances such as it being wise to look after the adventurers you are hiring by selling them stuff cheap when they visit your store, as they'll use that stuff when crawling the not-so-murky depths
As the game progresses, you'll need to get a bit inventive in how you manage your stock and customers, but I won't elaborate on that as that would be spoiling things!It's not an easy game to describe, and it probably sounds a bit dry on the face of it, but if you like the straight up old-school action-RPG dungeon crawler, I wouldn't hesitate to grab this - it does that part of it very well, but the light startegy side of shop management and how it dovetails so very, very nicely is what makes this game utterly unique
I can't recommend it highly enough
So I have no hesitation in saying this is easily worth £15 on my value-for-money scale
			
Posted: 25 November, 2013
												You think this is a cute little game about running an item shop and having fun, but it's not
It's a game about crippling debt and trying your hardest to claw your way out of it
The bank comes to your house and tells you that your dumb deadbeat dad is probably dead, and that they're going to repo your house
Instead of making you homeless, the bank fairy just turns you into a slave and turns your house into an item shop (because zoning regulations and child labor laws don't exist here) and you spend the rest of the game trying to make payments to buy your freedom
Fun game, but god help you if your hustle isn't strong enough
Would not recommend to the capitalistically weak
			
Posted: 20 October, 2014
												Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is, without exaggeration, my favorite game of all time
The art and characters are absolutely adorable, the protagonist is even more so, and the gameplay is incredibly addictive
You not only get to spend plenty of time squeezing every last possible cent out of your customers, you get enormous dungeons to go adventuring through and plenty of amazing spoils to bring back to the surface, craft into amazing items, and sell right back to the adventurer who helped you acquire them
And once you pay off your loan, you unlock Endless Mode and get to finish exploring those dungeons and becoming a billionaire
I have 225 hours of this game under my belt, and I STILL haven't finished finding every item in the game
The plot(that is, the plot that isn't related to your loan - yes, there's more!) is definitely fun, although you won't be able to see the whole thing during your first story mode, but since Endless Mode allows you to pick up right where you left off, it's not a problem
Basically, what I'm getting at is that Recettear is an amazing game, I love it, and you probably will too
Base price for hours of entertainment? It's a bargain
Capitalism, ho!

Early Access Review
								Do you know crunch? I mean, do you truly know the incredibly visceral, powerful and satisfying feedback that is crunch? Now go into Nuclear Throne and smack a maggots nest with a sledgehammer
Go on, I don't mind
Being inanimate text that a person typed and then abandoned, I have no sense of time
It'll be like kicking good vibes across a punch bowl (I'm also hit-and-miss with simile)
Okay, you're back! How was it-- Ohhh, I know that look! Your eyes have the enlightened glint of one who has tried the good stuff, the real deal, the prime reserve
You can't go back, now
Now, you know crunch
The real crunch
This is Nuclear Throne, and it's appeal cannot be simply summed up in a few words
It's referred to as an "action roguelike-like(-like)" because it is difficult to put into a genre
Because it is its own genre
If I were to call it anything, it would probably be "Randomly-Generated Action Crunch with Permadeath", which I am predicting will be a cereal by 2019 (sans permadeath, unless we don't have randomly-generated cereals by then, in which case I WANT to die)
Everything about this game is crunchy
There's a power-up based leveling system (further referred to as they are in game, "mutations"), a charming and variant cast of playable characters, tons of weapons (about 73 as of this writing, but I was just in on a stream where they rather liked my suggestion of adding nunchuks), crazy enemies, b-skins, rule-altering pickups and even local 2-player! And the art and music-- Ohhh, the art and music! The beautiful and detailed pixel art, the energizing (sometimes haunting) tracks and impeccable sound design frankly shocked me
Such character and atmosphere I found myself immersed in!The game is so easy to pick up, and yet the way you develop your character is incredibly deep
The developers waste none of their time (and consequently, your time) on anything that doesn't feel just awesome
Sure, "Mutation A" doesn't seem very good, at first
But once you learn more about "Characters D and E" and how they synergize splendidly with "Mutation A" when paired with "Mutation G", you get an "Aha" moment! Like a challenging, yet ultimately rewarding puzzle, Nuclear Throne holds a plethora of "Aha" moments for those willing to scratch past the surface and experiment with the MASSIVE number of possible character builds
And you need no mutation to love a samurai chicken! C'mon
The developers are two guys, who comprise Vlambeer, and four others who handle the art, music and sound
They're the most down-to-earth, approachable and generally cool guys to ever make a game, probably (permission to put that on the back cover = granted)
They generally update the game every Saturday with new characters, baddies, weapons, difficulty balancing and bug fixes
They even stream themselves developing said changes every Tuesday and Thursday on their Twitch channel (http://www
twitch
tv/vlambeer)! And they take feedback like pros! None of this "bleuuu, you don't like my game, banned and deleted" business
They're good people
Oh, and you'll be dying a lot
I didn't "beat" the game until I had already logged around 100 hours (there's an end-boss, but you loop back to the beginning with higher difficulty upon defeating it), but that didn't stop me from thoroughly enjoying every minute up until that point and after! This is a fantasticly addictive game, with a fantastic community and fantastic developers that is already easy to recommend
The fact that it promises to only get better is just gravy!And yes, I did a "let's play":http://youtu

												Nuclear ThroneRating: 8/10Overview: Bullet-Hell Rogue/ Isometric viewThe Good: +  Multiple characters each with their own unique skill and passive abilities
Each character plays very differently from each other
+ Lots of weapons + Randomized levels and upgrades + Very addicting gameplay, it really has the “just one more time” element to it
Highly replay-able game
+ Daily and weekly challenges + Good Soundtrack The Average:+/-  For a rogue game there isn’t a whole lot to unlock, other than the characters (you start with 2) everything is already unlocked right from the start+/- This is a very challenging game, a typical run to the last boss is around 20-30 minutes, it took me 12 hours before I finally beat the game
Bad level layouts, and getting bad weapons usually result in a quick death
If you hate dying over and over again, this game may not be for you
  Conclusion:This game is a lot of fun and very addicting
Despite my frustrating with the game I keep coming back to it from time to time just to see how far I can make it
Finding an awesome gun and getting good upgrades feels satisfying

												I bought this game when it was in its early access period(For 13 dollars multiplied by 4
Yes, my currency sucks) and I recently exprienced most of the content, meaning I can finally review it
Nuclear Throne is a hard(and I mean HARD
at about 9 hours you'll be just getting used to the third area) roguelite top down shooter with a huge variety of weapons(above 140 I believe), a roster of 12(and a few secret) characters, 7 main areas(split into levels) with secret equivelants of most of them, and full of content
Every session is quite short, and there is no end unless you choose to end the run
Every enemy drops EXP upon death(rads), and when you level up you can choose 1 mutation(modifiers) out of a selection of 4 every time for 9 levels, and get a special choice on level 10
Mutations vary from trivial things such as faster move speed to kills reducing reload time
The devs are extremley helpful and active on the forums(at least during the early acces period and until they finish updating the released product) and the community is the last one to be called a toxic community
The game's lore was told partly through little references in-game, lore bits and pieces from twitch streams of the dev and more, and is worth a read on the wiki(Also run by a great guy)
Nobody knows all of it(except for the developers), but what we do know is pretty damn good
After defeating the first final boss, if you do a thing the community will eventually notify you about(or wiki), you will loop
Looping is going through the entire game all over again and will never end until you die/get either of the 2 endings
It includes new exclusive content and so much more
The loops are late game, and since they can last forever, the game has to become even more brutal with each loop, and on loop 1 already, without spoiling, you will notice a difficulty spike
Pros -Full of areas to explore, enemies to shoot and die to, weapons, synergies and more
-Will keep you playing for a good amount of time, but still is fit for short sessions if you're just passing time-Amazing and helpful community-Fantastic soundtrack(Personal favorites are Frozen City's B-Track(Ode on the official soundtrack) , and The Nuclear Throne)-Great pixel art that is just beautiful to look at
Cons -It takes a while for RNGesus to make some good weapons become common in the pool after the first time they drop-Sometimes the game would do flat out unfair actions, such a certain telefragging enemy-Inconsistent difficulty curve
Its smooth until the third boss, spikes, stays that way, lowers down a bit in the 7th area's boss and on loops spikes up again and goes through the same curve-Sometimes you just get screwed(even on spawn)
RNGesus may not have mercy
-Some secrets that without a wiki/datamining no one would have found
TLDR: NT is a great game to sink hours into, as well as to play in short sessions, is hard, but rewarding and fun, as well as full of content to exprience

												Nuclear Throne is a rogue-like fast paced game created by Vlambeer
The game is currently available on Steam for GBP £8
99
At the current time, there are two game modes available to play: a single player mode and a Local Co-Op mode
The games menu screen and settings are all easy and swift to go through
The game runs very well and feels smooth even when there are multiple enemies and projectiles on the screen
The game feels very well designed and there is enough variety in all the different map layouts, upgrades and weapons that the game never feels dull
Nuclear Throne, like most rogue-like games has various different ways to enjoy playing
The game has twelve different characters which all have unique and special traits
You can play the game as a tanky character with a shield as an ability, or you can dual wield weapons and play as crazy and fast paced as you want
Nuclear Throne is hard, it really is
It takes getting used to and learning enemy shooting patterns is extremely important if you wish to progress to some of the later levels
The game constantly pulls you back in with how different every single run can be
Sometimes you can wind up dead on the first screen and sometimes you can get to the end with barely a mark upon you
If you are the sort of person who enjoys a challenge and gets a thrill out of fast paced rogue-like games, this is the game for you
My only negative feedback for this game would be that at the current time there is no official online multiplayer for the game which can make the game grow a bit stale over time unless you are lucky enough to play on Local Co-Op
Overall, Nuclear Throne has been a fantastic purchase for me and has been worth every penny spent
I feel the price is great for how many hours of joy (or rage) you will get out of this well presented, well-made game

								I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype "Wasteland Kings" was released
It's an insanely fun, fastpaced "roguelike-like" or "roguelite" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find
On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week
To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die

												I am a pretty, pretty princess!  When trying to become Queen I got stabbed, shot, poisoned, burned to a crisp, and rule 34ed Japan style
10 out of 10, would die again
Long Live the Queen is a Visual Novel game that, instead of trying to simply win the hearts of others and fall in love, you try to survive the horrors of royal life with your head intact
 Of course, it doesn't help when everyone is a bloodthirsty murderer who's only desire is to bring forth the death of a fourteen year-old girl
 Seriously, what the hell is wrong with them?You take the role of Princess Elodie, who needs to be trained to be a proper queen because Disney dictates that no princess is allowed to have a living mother
 You end up making all the decisions because your father is a lazy bum who's shirked off all of his responsibilities, but for some reason won't let you have your mother's keepsake
 The kingdom is a mess, everyone is evil, and no matter what you do you just can't seem to save this poor little traumatized girl
The mechanics of the game play on themselves in a bit of a cycle
 You can upgrade Elodie's stats; which can increase slowly or rapidly based on her mood; which is based on events that have happened; which are based on your choices as well as her stats; which are upgraded accordingly based on her mood; which is ba-- ah you get the idea
 This means that every decision, even the first one, can drastically affect how the story unfolds
 No two games are alike, unless you purposefully do everything in the exact same way every time
 But that's boring
Because of the above mentioned do-it-all-the-same concept, you can technically beat the game as many times as you like after you find out how to do it once
 But beating the game is not where this game shines
 Sure, acquiring the crown and becoming Queen Elodie is a grand event in itself; only if you get there (because you will die, and die a lot)
 But one of the greatest things about this game is the ability to make different choices every time and see where it leads you
 Find out what is down each path and discover what you can and can't get away with
 And more importantly, unlock all the outfits because they're cute
 Proper wardrobe is the pinnacle detail between ratty princesses and pristine queens
All in all, it is a great game and I'd recommend it to anyone
Wait

 It only got better from there
 I tried a perfect princess, died
 I tried a warrior queen, died
 I tried a mix, a little Sansa a little Aria, I died
 By the time I finally won the game I had sunk invading fleets, executed half my family and awoken something evil in the dark and deep, and I was beloved by all those still alive
Simply put the game is amazing and you should get it

												Despite its girly appearances, the game involves a lot of strategy, and thinking to help the princess live, gain reputation, and overall being a great queen
You make choices that effect the story and various paths to discover and explore (Its possible to complete the game with nothing in combat)
However, one event at the end can not be changed no matter what choices you choose which causes the game to be somewhat linear
The music was diverse and amazing in my opinion and helped set the tone of the game depending on the situation
Gameplay could have been better for example more scenes, and backgrounds
If you enjoy visual novels, this is a great game for you
However, I feel the price of the game is a bit too much for the amount of gameplay and would recommend waiting till it goes on sale if you plan on purchasing the game

												This is a game of trial and error, educated guesses, and mood management
If any of those three things sound unappealing to you, you may want to stay away from this game
Have you ever played a visual novel? This game resembles one
Half of the game is background images with text boxes on top of them, and the other half is menus
However, this is not a visual novel
The story is very light in this game, and forgettable
This leaves the gameplay to keep you interested:Your princess has a large number of stats, ranging from singing, decoration and dancing, to swords, polearms and archery
You increase these stats by assigning two classes each day
At the end of a day, you choose from several different activities, which alter your mood
Her mood is important because it directly affects how quickly you increase skills during the daily classes
The "depression" mood happens to increase the "decoration" skill faster
Increasing skills is everything in this game, because it runs on a set schedule of story events
These happen at the same time and start off exactly the same, but the way your princess reacts to them depends entirely on how you've chosen to raise her skills
This is the mood management I mentioned
You are often asked to choose an action during story segments, and these can alter the story greatly - or instantly kill you
The educated guesses and trial and error come from that, and of the fact that you cannot possibly predict when you will need a particular skill
Your princess will randomly be stabbed, poisoned, etc
and if you don't have the right skill high enough, that's all folks! The fun of this game is from starting a fresh game after each death, and planning how you will raise your princesses' skills this time to accomodate the story event you just died on
If this doesn't sound like something you would enjoy, I would have to advise you to avoid this game, as it is ALL it has to offer
I personally got about ten hours out of it, and I'll probably go back for more someday, but this kind of experience may just not appeal to you

												Do you have a kid that you think would be into Diablo but you're not down with the whole "Satan" thing?  Are you a crazy cat lady that likes RPGs?  Do you like action games with tight controls, simple but clever mechanics and a good power ramp?  Well then, you've found your game

												Pros:- cute graphics- quite positive atmosphere- tutorial is super short and clear- loot system (finding the same item multiple times upgrades it)Cons:- Several minutes into the game and everything will be clear about the AI- Gets repetitive fast- Not immersive- Lack of settings (audio, difficulty, controls, etc
)- If you do side quests then the main quest might appear way too easyThis game is like a popcorn movie, can be 100% finished in a single evening
 
Posted: 8 August
												From playing it for about 4-5 hours, I've found it to be fun
The combat is smooth and easy to learn and get used to; while allowing skill in movement, timing, and attacks to actually play a large role in single-target fights, large-group fights, and even bosses
The story, of which I've gotten a little under halfway done, is great (though I get heavily distracted with side quests, which are pawsome!)
And you're actually encouraged to complete side quests in order to level-up for the main storyline
The dungeons are relatively short between the level 1-35 range that I've entered and conquered
The dungeons do respawn with enemies and coins/xp pickups, though the chests do not; helps with the level grinding!All-in-all, from a first look the game is great

												You can just chill playing this game, so relaxing but at the same time has a bit tension (3
5 out of 10 difficulty)
Full of cats, funny conversation, classic artstyle, smooth controller, fine music, your typical indie game
So far didn't find any glitches in the gameplay, achievements bug has been fixed
Cat Quest is a really really enjoyable game both for kids and adults
I suggest to buy this game when on sale because the story is very short and not worth full price at all
Anyway cat lovers, let's do some Catventure!!

												Review subject to change


So far Cat Quest is a very cute (oops! don't call them cute! lol), fun and relaxing game with excellent realtime combat and controller support!  I am not that far into the game, but I wanted to write something so people know that this is a fun and well thought out game
 I am playing with keyboard and mouse and will try my PS4 wireless controller as soon as it charges
The gameplay is really fun!  If using keyboard and mouse, you melee attack with the left mouse button and can use number keys or the right mouse button to cast spells
You use WASD to move and you can roll using the spacebar
 Combat is really fun and I have no complaints in this department!  It feels like playing Diablo 3 using the keyboard & mouse
Great writing with a purrrfectly catastic story and great one-liner's!  It has made me laugh out load a few times!  PROS+Great melee combat with dodge & spell casting+Can completely heal and save your game is towns+There are different schools of magic to learn+Huge game world with lots of dungeons to explore+Very cute (oops) graphics and good animations+Wonderful sound track and great sounds (meow!)+Polished game with fun references to kittens & cats+Well written dialog and fun storyline+Character sprite reflects weapons, armor & items equipped+Enemies respawn so you can grind if you want or not+Dungeons can be replayed again for more loot & experience+Ability to bypass or run away from battles (so far, lol)+Kittens, Cats & Dragons!!! Oh My!!! lolCONS-Cannot name your character-Only one save slot that I can see-Cannot rebind keys on keyboard-Characters HATE to be called cute! LOLNone of these cons matter at all in this game
 Everything has been thought out very well and the game seems very polished!  Try the demo if you want before purchasing!  For a three person development team, I think they did a superb job!

												At its core, Cat Quest is a game that ditches unnecessay frills and features and instead has a polished core gameplay that works exactly the way you want it to
Though combat is simplistic (with a button for attacking, one for spells, and another for rolling), there is a great amount of enjoyment to be had with this title
It's back to basics, the fundamentals that make other action RPGs so much fun: fighting, looting, and fashion
GameplayCombat is boiled down to the bare essentials
You have one button for swinging your melee weapon, a selection of up to four spells to cast, and a dodge button
All of these are used with equal frequency
It's not enough to just whack an enemy, more often you will need to slow them with ice or weaken their defenses with fire
You can't just stand there and wail on the baddies, you will need to watch for their attack warning and roll out of danger
You're given a lot of warning when danger approaches, and in exchange you are punished greatly if you do get hit
Cat-like agility will be needed
Loot is comprised of armor, helmets, and weapons
Every chainmail helm has the same stat distribution as the next
However, every time you get a new chainmail helm, the one you already have goes up in level, and thus in stats
This means you might be mixing and matching sets rather than sticking to one for the entirety of your playthrough
Side quests are sadly tedious, all falling under the umbrella of Kill X or Fetch Y
There is some variety thrown in, in the form of tracking and chasing, but those moments are just a game of follow the dotted line
Avoiding side quests isn't really an option, either, as they're the best way to level up
Simply killing monsters won't be enough, unless you go after those of a much higher level than you
Balancing is an issue, in terms of leveling
Starting off, you'll see a lot of quests above your paygrade, though you're free to attempt them
After awhile, you'll find yourself rocketing past the level recommendations for the main quest and going back to find side quests you're now 20 levels too big for
Eventually you'll want to tackle quests that are deemed too high a level for you, but with the right gear and magic, you will do just fine
Final ThoughtsHeading straight for the end of the game, ignoring any side content you don't have to touch, you'll likely finish the game in 3~ hours
Factoring in all the side quests and dungeons, expect to get about ~6 hours out of this game
There's promise for future content, though it's hard to tell if it's hinting at a sequel or DLC
If you're looking for a fun and simple (but not too simple) game to relax with, this would be a great fit for any veteran or newcomer to the gaming scene
It's accessible and charming, and while the content isn't as substantial as some may like, what is there is better polished than in most other games for its cost
Quality over quantity is the name of the game
PROS+ Charming art style and orchestral soundtrack blend for a simplistic but enjoyable gameworld
+ Decently sized selection of gear, some original and some referential
+ Simple combat, but more depth there to be found if you look
CONS- Very boring side quests that lead to mashing through dialogue just to get it over with

												This is the first steam game I've purchased for myself
I played the demo today after seeing the reviews and figured that if it was easy enough for me to play, I'd get it
And it was - and still is! This game is EVERYTHING for me after my surgery
It's not that complicated with the controls and actions, and it's really cute and fun
The creators did such a good job with the can puns
Honestly


this game is purrfect if you're looking for simple, fun, and adventure - and if you just so happen to have a love for cat things!

												It's fun at first, probably the first half, it doesn't really fall off much, it's an overall neat game, However, the dialog and the overload of puns all over the place and the childish dialog

can get quite cringy
Buy at your own risk!was plenty of fun to play, sadly was pretty short </3

												The meowment Cat Quest loaded, I was pawsitive I was in for a grrreat time
Okay, got that out of my system we can move along now
If there is anything that the internet doesn’t get bored of it’s cats
I can’t exactly explain it, but an obsession that goes back to Egyptian times can’t necessarily be overrated
Cats invading video games isn’t exactly new either, with games such as Cat Goes Fishing, Catlateral Damage, Fort Meow and many more
Maybe I have been fortunate, but I have enjoyed them all and never been left with a fishy taste in my mouth
When I heard about Cat Quest, an open world RPG, I knew I had to check it out
Needless to say guys, its pretty pawsome
(I swear that’s the last one
)Right off the bat, I do recommend Cat Quest
Not just because its adorable and over the top, akin to something like Slime Rancher
I recommend it because I genuinely had a blast and couldn’t stop playing the game until it was all over
If Cat Quest accomplishes anything, it is that it is super simple and fun to play
This game is going to attract a wide age group and its got something for all of them
As soon as you start the game and get past some story tidbits, the first thing I noticed was this huge vivid over-world map
Felingard is the name of this huge continent and you will explore all of it
This map isn’t just a means of getting from place to place
This map is the game
Monsters, towns, and events play out on this screen or one of the fifty two dungeons
You begin your epic quest to defeat a mysterious figure named Drakosh and his dragons
The combat itself is all real time from an isometric view
The beautiful part is that the combat is super simple but manages to stay complex enough to keep you on your toes
You can slash with your equipped weapon, dodge roll, or cast one of the many spells in the game
This is one game I highly recommend you play with a controller
The enemies telegraph their attacks with either a red circle or symbol to represent a spell they are about to cast
Some enemies are faster than others and using different spells/tactics to overcome them is required
The problem I found with Cat Quest’s combat is that it tends to have extremes
The combat is either far too easy or you’re going to die very fast
It never quite hits that sweet spot in the middle
Cat Quest does however have a good pace as the dungeons themselves range from level 1 to 99
If you find it to be too easy then just hop into a dungeon five or six levels higher than you and feel the pain
The dungeons themselves are rather simplistic in design and more about combat and loot
Loot in this game I felt a bit divided on
Cat Quest has a stat system with the usual suspects, e
g
health, magic, damage, armor
You can mix and match armor pieces to create your own play style
If you don’t like physical attacks, then wear magic armor
Some armors even go to extremes giving huge benefits to one stat and taking away from others
Also some armors just suck in general, guess they are there to keep the game challenging maybe? The problem lies in Golden Chests
Sometime in the middle of the game you will get access to these beauties
Golden chests contain rare loot
These rare items can break the game quite easily
I stumbled upon an item called Courage that gave me vast amounts of health
This item made bosses seem like they were tickling me and I just stood there whacking away at them
Now I could’ve not used that item, true, but I didn’t know any better
Plus if it’s in the game, why not use it? Cat Quest respects your time as a player and for that I appreciate it
However, the game’s combat just loses some of its enjoyment once you gain access to these golden chests
It’s like the game gave up and handed me the win
That isn’t to say I didn’t love the combat in Cat Quest, I just wanted the last boss to actually be a challenge instead of dead in five seconds
I think the combat system had great potential to keep things fresh and fun all the way until the end
Cat Quest didn’t need to hand me the keys to the kingdom, proverbially
Side quests and story galore
One of the main highlights of Cat Quest is by far is its dialogue/story
Side quests are filled to the brim with cat puns, and hilarity
There are times where I found myself genuinely laughing and that isn’t an easy task for a game when it comes to me
On top of that, there is actually a pretty intense lore here that I found myself being wrapped up in as the game progressed
Drakoth’s story and the birth of the Dragonbloods is very interesting and far from what I expected
The story isn’t one dimensional, despite appearing that way
The reason behind dragons tearing up the place is rather sad
When I finally reached the end of my “Cat Quest” I was left with far more questions than answers
Which also left me with a bit of a gripe
The end feels like it’s baiting for a sequel or DLC
While I don’t want to give any spoilers, Cat Quest comes to a climax with a threat looming, but the game just ends abruptly
It felt odd
Queen’s Bay an area that has one quest and no follow ups, more or less confirms this suspicion
Then again, more Cat Quest is hardly a bad thing
In all, the side-quests were fun and enjoyable
They brought a life and personality to the world that left me wanting more
I can’t wait to see the Mice Pirates and the Lupus Empire
There was one side quest though that annoyed me to no end
One which had you traveling back and forth from opposite ends of the continent
Silly Chef cats
Another obvious statement is that Cat Quest is very family friendly and pleasing to the eyes
This game is candy wrapped up in kittens
One fear I had was that the huge over world map would be one tone but Cat Quest does manage to keep things varied
You will venture on islands, snow caps, plagued lands and more
The art is very well done and mixes seamlessly with the combat and magic effects
The monsters, and sprites themselves are cute and I couldn’t help but chuckle when I put a big metal helmet on my cat
Item design is one area that I was also impressed with
It added plenty of personality on its own
An area that didn’t hit the mark for me was the menus
They were very bare-bones
Cat Quest is also available on mobile devices, and it shows in the menus especially
The music and sound effects are as equally pleasing to the ears as the graphics are to the eyes
Every time I heard a meow when I got hit, it made me smile
There were times people nearby thought an actual cat was meowing, if that tells you anything
The music is as fun and adventurous as is required for this type of game
You can expect an orchestral soundtrack and if you keep moving in the game, no one track over stays its welcome
I guess you could say I had a purrfect time
Sorry I lied, I couldn’t help meowself
I finished the game out at about nine hours and that was getting all the current Steam Achievements
Including all the outfits, and clearing all the dungeons
You’re looking at anywhere between six to ten hours total playtime
The game doesn’t have much in the way of replay
There is no new game+ and it’s basically a get done and go type of deal
Keep an eye out though for future DLC or an update
Aside from the achievements across all platforms, there are also Steam Cards
Obviously that’s computer only
To wrap up, I found Cat Quest to be a highly enjoyable popcorn style game
You eat it, you love it, it’s bad for you chances are, but hey life is short and there is cats
It’s not going to rock the boat for innovation or expand your mind on new levels of philosophy
What it is going to do is give plenty of entertainment that you or your kid can enjoy together
I personally think it’s a good homage to the ARPG genre and worthy of your attention
Did I mention the cats?Meow!

												I've played more of Kingdom Rush on my iPad than any other Tower Defense game I've ever played - It's absolutely fantastic
The one problem with the iOS version was that  (as is sadly standard for the platform) it had microtransactions - there was a store that let you buy consumables (for gold you earned in-game or purchased) to use in levels, as well as one-time purchases to unlock Hero characters
The Steam version fixes this, and has no DLC or microtransactions at all - all the heroes are included in the game, and it doesn't even have the consumables store anymore
The Steam version also includes a bunch of the bonus maps/mini-campaigns added in updates to the iOS version after launch, with the promise that the rest are coming soon in a free post-launch update that will also add a new bonus campaign exclusive to the steam version
My only small disappointment with the steam version so far is that there's no way (that I can tell) to add a keybind to call the next wave early
There does seem to be some sort of nonfunctional keybind-manager in the game launcher, so hopefully that's something they'll add soon
(UPDATE: This is no longer true - there's now a keybind for this!)Kingdom Rush is, in my opinion, the best TD game out there, and this Steam release is the definitive version
At $7
50 it's a steal (I can't tell you how many hours I've sunk into this game), and I strongly recommend it to anyone who even remotely enjoys TD games

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Kingdom Rush Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: Tower Defense; Strategy; Casual My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 12-25 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Casual gamersREVIEWKingdom Rush is one of the most delightful Tower Defense (TD) games I have ever played
 As far as game mechanics go, it is just another TD game with no real groundbreaking or innovative dynamics
 But something about the art style, the animations, and the soundscape create a nice blend that is undeniably charming
 This should be a welcome addition to any TD fan’s library
Like in all good TD games, the core gameplay is extremely addictive
Kingdom Rush is well-designed to be challenging, yet not needlessly frustrating
 The level design allows for creativity, but also limits your options enough so it isn’t a total chore trying to figure out what to do
 That said, as you get deep into the game, it can become quite a challenge to 3-star levels; but worst-case scenario you can find guides online to help you out
There aren’t really that many towers, in truth
 But there is just enough
And they are all diverse, fun to use, and are all useful at one point or another in the game
 I find many TD games with dozens of towers usually still can be beaten with only the best five, anyway
 Nevertheless, to make up for the relatively low amount of towers: there are twelve hero units each with different abilities
 Trying out the different heroes as you unlock them adds that bit of spicy variety to the game
 I feel it is only fair to point out: you can play the original version of the basic campaign for free on the many flash game websites out there… with microtransactions for some extra “premium” content
 The Steam version comes with all content included in the price, as well as a few extra expansion levels; and of course it comes with the benefit of the “meta-aspects” of any Steam game (Steam achievements, trading cards, screenshots, etc
)
You can decide what is an acceptable price for this
 If you are an advocate of TD games and can pick up Kingdom Rush for a price you are comfortable with, then you absolutely should grab it and give it a go
  Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Kingdom Rush is fantastic
I've played a lot of tower defense games over the years because it's one of my favorite genres (ever since it was invented on Starcraft/Warcraft custom maps), and this is right up there in the top 5 of all time
I first played it a couple months back on Android after it was featured in one of the Humble Bundles, and it is the only game out of that bunch I played for more than an hour or so
I literally would step away from my gaming PC once or twice a day to go lounge around with my phone and play this


It's that good
A lot of people are concerned about microtransactions in this game because that was the main way they made money from the mobile app, but the new PC version is completely different
You don't have to buy heroes, and the gem store -- which was still intact in the premium version I played on Android despite having all heroes included -- has been removed
So in addition to rebuilding the game with the Unity engine instead of porting the Flash version, they've re-balanced the difficulty of certain levels or challenges that used to be really difficult to complete without consumable power-ups
Don't be fooled by those complaining about the $10 price tag (or $7
50 currently, at launch)
A free, outdated browser version or cheaper mobile app with microtransactions is not in anyway equivalent to the brand new PC version
You could play them as sort of a demo to try out the game and see if you like it, but then you should come back to Steam and buy the best and most complete version there is or will ever be
Ironhide Games has put a lot of work into making the game look good at high resolutions and of course the interface and controls have been updated to support the keyboard & mouse
New content updates are on the way (for free), and they're dedicated to quickly fixing bugs and refining features
I'm happy to support them for their efforts in bringing a great game to the greatest platform, and once you get a taste of this TD, I think you will be, too

												My favorite tower defense game of all time
It has literally everything you want in a TD
* Strategic depth - the ability to actually make choices that matter and having to rethink if your choices didn't work
* Increasing difficulty levels
* Extra challenges (heroic mode, iron mode)
* Great music & sound effects
* Addictive gameplay
* Secrets - achievements - clickables
The game is available (not with all the levels, and not with the element of heroes) for free as a flash game
Some people may consider this a negative (amagad paying $10 for a game I can get for free?) but I consider it a positive - the free version is easily accessible, treat it as a demo or play it whilst waiting for this version to go on sale
Kingdom Rush on steam is 100% worth the cost for the amount of entertainment it will offer
			
Posted: 23 November, 2014
												I am quite fond of these games on Kongregate and similar sites


And that is at the same time my pet peeve
Kingdom Rush is one of those better and ejoyable flash games, and it's free
So how does it compute to 9 Euros on Steam?Frankly, it does not - It is the exact same game
No added features (that I can see from a quick look), the introduction level is exactly the same, the mechanics, everything
On the plus side, it runs flawlessly, whereas Flash Games are notorious for frame skipping and overall stuttery performance - after all, Flash was originally more or less a platform for animated advertising, not gaming
Being able to have the game run smoothly on fullscreen is very nice
Still, 9 Euros
I cannot, in good conscience, recommend it at this price
The game itself is a total blast, even challenging, also I just love Tower Defense games, and this is one of the more interesting ones
So, it's really up to you to dish out that kind of money for a game you can play for free off Steam
In fact, I suggest playing it on Kongregate or any other site that hosts the original version - see it as a complete, windowed Demo, to determine if you are OK with the price
TL:DR9 Euros for a game you can play for free is a joke
However, the game is just that good, I would gladly pay 5 for the smoother, fullscreen gameplay you get with this Steam version
Play the free version - if it grabs you, you may have found a very, very enjoyable Tower Defense game at "entry level", meaning the mechanics are quite simple to get in to, not too overwhelming for newbies to the genre, while at the same time challenging and interesting
Torn between my love for TD games, and Kingdom Rush specifically, and the fact that this is more or less the exact same version that is available anywhere for free, I still have to give "Thumbs Up"

												KIngdom rush was always one of my favourite games, mainly on mobile
But playing it on Pc was definitley a change for the better, the developers reallly didnt leave out anything when it comes to attention to detail
The game gives a good challenge to tower defence lovers and will provide you with hours of content

Getting over that

this is a really fun game
Its pretty short itself, But there's so much to do after
It unlocks more challenges, heroes and achievements! The art style is very nice and clean, makes me wish i could draw
If you like tower defense games i would definitely recommend this gem

												This game holds well from its conversion from flash
It's missing a couple otpions, but it doesn't really detract from the experience
All of the strategy and fun is still there
Well worth shelling out a few dollars to get to be able to play it without a constant internet connection

												I recently started playing this game and have found myself going to bed and dozing off thinking about this game while planning how to build better for my next map
The game can get intense and by that I mean am spamming all over the place so I do not leak, my hand spasms and I leak only to start swearing and restart the map! I have even woken up at 4am in the morning to play this game and pick up where I left off
What I like the most about this game is how simple it is yet difficult
What do I mean by that? The basics of building but knowing the best spots and when to upgrade are key points
Position is also another key factor but what also keeps me hooked is the cute and detailed visuals of this game
I can't fully take this game serious when its this cute but neither do I want to continue on to the next map with only 2 stars lolI would recommend this game for the casual gamer who is looking to pass time
You might lose track of time but that just means you are having fun right? Catch this game on sale for half the price on some sites or just buy it off steam because either way its worth the $10 bucks
I def see myself trying to complete this game and having many more clutch moments in this game hehe
