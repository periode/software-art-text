I can't find a container to keep my ice (and water, to keep it from turning into one big block) by my bedside without either myself or my cats dumping it all over the place at 3am
My husband is getting ticked off, my books are getting wavy edges, and there's got to be a better way
What do you all use? I don't need something that works with a spoon or straw or anything
just good old hands
Thanks

Bubba insulated mug, 52oz size
I have two and I carry one everywhere
It keeps ice frozen all night and has a wide mouth and base which makes it very hard to knock over
You can find it on amazon
 Every ice chewer should own at least one

My mom used to chew ice when she was a child, and I got hooked since I knew that
Simple
(Fun fact: I started fairly recently
)
I always liked sucking on ice cubes when I was younger but the chewing didn't get too bad until I was a teenager
I had some personal issues that caused severe anemia and I craved ice like it was a life source
Even after we got the anemia figured out I've developed a taste for it
I get obsessed with the crunch and the frosty taste of it
I'm crazily specific about which restaurants have the best ice for my taste and I'm just as obsessed with drinking the water that melts from it
It just tastes better after being frozen
People at work make fun of me because I always eat cups of the shaved ice we use in smoothies and they tell me I have a problem
 I am a little crazy over always having ice but I just love it
I even just ordered a silicone ice tray that makes small cubes in an attapmt to make softer ice so I guess we'll see how that goes

How did it go?
OMG i cannot believe there's a bulletin about chewing ice
 i sincerely thought i was the only person in the world
 i am in SW pennsylvania and the very BEST ice is from our Get GO gas station
 they have crushed ice that is so delicious
 i go about every other day and get eight 44 oz glasses
 the ice is free so i get 4 with root beer and the other 4 just ice
 when i get home i pretty much dump the root beer
 i'm sure it is annoying to others and i try to be discreet
 but when i'm by myself - look out
 the crushed ice is easier on the teeth at least
mine started about 20 years ago when i was extremely anemic
 i didn't know it at the time
 i crunched for a year or two then lost the desire for it
 about a year ago, it started up again even tho i'm pretty sure i'm not anemic
 no one can understand how delicious it tastes to me - i would rather have ice than most food
anyhow thanks for a good laugh!
I love ice
I recently purchased an ice shaver / snow cone maker and I use gigantic cups and fill them up
I eat the ice with a spoon
I find that it is a healthy alternative to eating snacks and calorie free, too
Sometimes I'll pour some Pepsi or Diet Pepsi into it, just a little bit and make a slushie
The bottom is SO GOOD
I eat ice like this probably twice a day
SO GOOD

I've been essentially addicted to ice for the past 5 years or so, but not chewing it
What I do is I just let it melt in my mouth while I move around with my tongue, allowing the ice to make contact with every part of my mouth (tongue, inside cheeks, etc
), but I avoid prolonged contact with my teeth (cold teeth feel weird)
I always felt slightly eased by this because I can enjoy the alerting sensation of ice being in my mouth while avoiding the "Chewing ice is bad for your teeth" warnings
A seemingly peculiar result of this is that I prefer denser, purer, smoother, and finger-sized ice blocks
The ice served on airplanes in the beverages is literally the perfect ice for me, while Sonic ice isn't that great
Is anybody else like this? I know this technically marks me as a non-ice chewer, but I think I share the feelings of the icy sensation with everybody else here

That is wonderful that you have been able to resist the chewing of the ice
I have gone back and forth of doing both chewing and letting it melt in my mouth
 I have had an ice addiction for almost thirty years
 I know the best places to get ice all over the country
 My teeth have really suffered
I am now backt to letting it melt in my mouth
Good luck & keep up the good work!
big ice cube?
small ice cube?
moon-shaped ice cube?
pearl ice?
shaved ice?
snow ice?
ice chip?
crushed ice?
any others u like
actually i do love the shaved one !!!it's not too hard ,chewable and crunchy
i usually buy one from stores and enjoy it with my friends
    
shaved
crushed
moon
little thin squares
chewblets
Sonic nuggets


they are the best!
 snowy
  shaved

I can't enjoy any of the crunchy form


so I now have tennis elbow from standing hunched-over my little ice shaver
 If anyone knows of an ice shaver where you don't have to stand there and hold the power button, I'd love to hear about it!
My favorite is called "Glacier Ice" (it comes in 10 lb
bags)
I bought a small freezer just so I can have four Glacier Ice bags at home at a time
I usually smash up the bag of ice with a metal meat tenderizer, then run the biggest chunks through an ice crusher
Then, this and the finer chips gets dumped into a "BIG Gulp" cup or 32 oz
plastic containers for later (another reason I'm glad I bought a freezer just for my "ice habit"   )
For times when I have to be in meetings or my husband and I are on the road, I make up 16oz
water bottles full of crushed ice and store them in the freezer, as well
While it is a lot work, these bottles of ice chips are easy to take along on trips

My absolute favorite are those cubes that are formed from crushed ice
So when you bite into them they just crumble in your mouth

Hi Twinks22 !That sounds absolutely delicious
 Glad to meet another ice eater
 Janbo
Hi I'm new to this forum, but not new to chewing ice
I've been addicted to the stuff for almost all my life
I didn't start noticing the different types of ice until pretty recently and I have found the ice I prefer
I work in a hospital in the Our Shitty I'm a spammer who can't get a job
 Also, our product sucsk - don't buy from us
Suck and We will rip you off!, which is where I think the best ice is found
Its extruded ice, similar to Sonic ice
We don't have a sonic here, but I have seen the commercials and know its similar in appearance
Anyway, I do leave work everyday with a huge 32 oz cup of this ice
I would take buckets of it home, but I'm not allowed
When I'm not at work, I love the ice from a local company called Good Time ice, or at least I think its local
I can get it at Walmart and Rutters(a conveniance store)
Its somewhat soft and easy to chew
Well, I am just so excited to find there are other like me, and that I'm not crazy, thank you for creating this site!Christine
Hello Christine!Good to hear from you
Many hospitals do have excellent ice (I love the ice in our hospital's ER)
Sonic ice is "pelletized" - small little nuggets that look like they have been extruded, so it is probably made by the same type of machine that you have at work
I also like Glacier Ice (in bags)
WalMart and the Giant supermarkets are the only ones in eastern PA that seem to carry it
Glacier Ice seems to have a "softer" consistency than other brands
Happy ice chewing
Janbo
My absolute favorite it white crushed iced from refrigerator Ice makers
 next are thin layer white ice  Snow cone or shaved ice is great  Any white is will do me just fine  I am so estactic to find people like me
 You guys really understand
 This is SO GREAT!!
 I've found a home  
oh wowz
defineitly sonic ice
soo goodd


and snow ice
i love the one at dairy queen too
i could eat that all dayguess its nice to know im not the only one out there who can totally tell the difference between ice
my sister just thinks its weird when i tell her we should go to sonic


and not get anything but the ice

You do know that Sonic sells their ice by the bag, don't you?  I have a small chest freezer in my garage


I get 8 bags at a time!!
I truly wish we had a Sonic around here
There is a small ice cream place close by that also uses that type of ice, and they will fill a cooler with it for free

I like hollow ice
 Why do some ice makers make hollow ice?  Many times I will choose it over food!
a sonic ice just opened down the street
I did not know they sold it
I just will buy that instead of getting the slushes
I know what to ask what I want from dh for birthday
 
I am a highly addicted ice chewer for a very long time
Over the past 2 months I have had to go to Urgent Care twice due to dehydration
This makes absolutely NO sense to be because I eat 2 igloo coolers (6 pack size) of Sonic type ice EVERY day
I was also buying so much ice that I finally bought my own commercial ice machine that makes the Sonic type ice
My question, which doesn't make any sense to me is, can too much ice cause dehydration? Could the excessive cold do something to your body? I do have many other medical problems but I have increased my ice intake and have been dehydrated 2 times!I'm almost embarrassed to post this because it is just so absurd!
First time i see something like that
Maybe you need to add something to ice
Hydratation isn't only about drinking water
Even wors
If you don't eat good too much water can provide serious damage
We know the difference between one person and another person

Hello fellow ice crunchers
   Long-time cruncher, only just found this message board
(thank you, BuzzFeed, LOL)Anyone else have a sweetie/family member teasing relentlessly?It's gotten to where he makes his over-exagerated *Crunch Crunch* noise, and I give him my best "icy glare" and chomp a cube extra loud, just because
 Anyway, just dropping in to say hello!Hello!
My husband got so mad at me one night, when I was trying to sit in bed and read before sleep, because I was eating ice and the crunching was bothering him
"Can you go eat your ice in the other room?? I'm trying to SLEEP!!"     LOL!
Hello everyone,I am new here and I have to admit when I googled and saw there was an entire message board dedicated to people that love to chew ice, I thought it was a joke
To my delight, it isn't
I can't believe there are other people out there who share my strange addiction
I've always like to chew ice
About 10 years ago I noticed that at the gym I worked at, LA Fitness, they had great pelletized ice in the smoothie bar
I liked the ice more than the smoothies, and it got to where I liked the ice more than the smoothie
At that time I was also diagnosed severely anemic (with a hemoglobin of 8, where as I think it is supposed to be 12 at the lowest)
I was told to take iron supplements
I know ice craving is a huge indicator of anemia, and I notice that my cravings go away when I take my iron supplements regularly
How many of you are also anemic? Nowadays I crave ice so much I can't leave the house without my ice cup
Sometimes I take 2 cups


or if I know I will be gone all day, I take 3 or 4 and cover them with foil and put them in a little cooler bag in the car
I smuggle ice into the movies, and I hate going to movies where it's quiet all the time because then I can't crunch crunch crunch
My family thinks I am crazy
However, my husband helps me


he knows I prefer a certain type ice (McDonald's ice
In the bag, their thin squares are the perfect mix of crunch and are small enough to be easily eaten, yet not too small, so I feel like I have something to really bite into


and they are clear, with an indented hole in one end, which makes for perfect melting ice
I am probably unique in that the Sonic type, pelletized ice, or hospital type ice is my least favorite
For me, it's too soft
When crunched, it just kind of crumbles, and I don't like that
I want some shards to break off
But not TOO big or it's hard to eat
In my fridge, I have cups of ice waiting to be eaten
I take the ice out, breaking it up with a meat mallet if there are pieces stuck together, and put it in a big 32 oz plastic cup
I then cover it with foil and put it in the fridge
Then it sits- I try to have them sit for about 24 hours before i eat them, so they get "tenderized"
They don't melt, (well a little does, I drink that water from the bottem when I take a cup out) but it gets a nice softeness to it, so the big chunks are easy to eat
I usually have 4-5 cups "marinating" in the fridge at any one time
It is a terribly day if I run out of ice
My husband knows to pick up ice for me
Sometimes I even eat so much ice my tongue hurts the next day
Right now I have a frostbitten tongue and it's killing me but I cannot stop
I am curious
How much is a regular 10 lb bag of ice where you live? In Phoenix, AZ, I used to get McDonald's ice for 
99 a bag, and when I moved up north to Prescott, AZ, the same bag is now $1
99
I am so mad
All bags of ice here are $2, when in Phoenix they are $1
So nice to meet other ice chewers

Hi everyone, I come from a long line of chewers and have gotten my wife hooked on it as well
 We currently buy Sonic ice and make room in the outdoor freezer for it by throwing away food
 Haha
 The nearest Sonic is 15-20 miles away and the summer heat is making my ice melt more than it should on the way home
 When we then freeze it, half of the bag becomes a solid block of ice and unusable
 I was considering keeping a cooler in my trunk but I'd like to buy 6-8 bags at a time so I would have to keep 2 coolers in my trunk at all times which is not practical because I also golf a lot
 I was wondering if anyone else has crossed this bridge and could offer some advice so I'm not throwing out half of my ice?   Collapsable cooler, or better yet an insulated blanket that I could wrap it in for the trip?  Any other solutions to a portable cool environment? Glad there are so many of us out there
 I've been reading this site from time to time for a while

Possible solutions


Buy your own Scotsman Pellet ice maker
They are very expensive but the if you consider the amount of time and money that you are using just to get the ice (then transporting and storing
) It might be an opption worth looking into
Plus, that would be so cool to have it on hand whenever you want
Fresh, no melting, and no hard re-freezing
Or you can learn to make ice like it at home; as I have
This may not be right for you because you and your wife are chewers and it's not easy to make in large batches but the recipe is called 'sonic like ice' on the recipes section
Until you find another way you might just have to get coolers and start getting ice once a week
Get as much was you can fit in the coolers
Then you could use cold salt water on the way home to keep the bags from melting than refreezing once you get them into your freezer
Salt water can be colder than frozen ice, so using regular (none sonic) ice plus really cold salt water in your coolers on the way home should help
Less trips more usable ice and you would only need the coolers in your car for the trip
Also, check the defrosts on your freezer that might be making the ice melt too much
Good luck
Hope this helped
Happy chewing
 
Thanks for the tips
Help me find a solution for this event

I always eat ice but I never really was craving it until about last month
I started craving and craving everytime I would come home I would go straight to the fridge
And when i was in fast food places I would get the eat from the drinks
I thought it was a little abnormal, my ice cravings but I fufuilled the cravings anyway
I was talking to my aunt in trinidad one day and my mom told her I was always eating ice
She is a nurse so automatically she becamed concerned and told me I should go to the doctor and get it check out because my blood count can be low
I got a little scared but then brushed it off
I went to the doctor yesterday for something else, and I thought why dont i ask him about what my aunt said
He looked at the palms of my hands and said omg you have no blood i was like omg
"You are very Anemic" he stated, I said wow my aunt was right
So he prescibed me iron supplements and I took my first pill today
I dont know if its all in my head but my cravings for ice has slowed down already
I will still be an "icey" but if you was like me please go get checked out it can be serious
Im eatings ice just writing this hehe
It seems that people are a favorite this time

I have been chewing ice for 5 years
cube ice is my favorite

My mum is convinced that chewing ice (even thin ice, like I prefer) will ruin my teeth and has never liked me doing it
It got to a stage where my parents would yell at me everytime I went to the freezer for an ice chip
But they don't understand the craving I have for it and how it's not just some petty habit


Then last week they took all of the ice trays and hid them
I've been trying to make do with pouring water onto the flat bit in our freezer and eating it when no one is home (which isnt often at all)


What do I do
I feel like I'm going nuts
Help!?
Just show them this forum
Say hey there are people like me
You may not get it but it is important to me and others around the world

Chew it in hiding:p
What's the furthest you've gone?  I've got a story or two, I tell you


 
I keep at least 4 - 32oz cups in my car and travel around to the local gas stations and fast food restaurants (anywhere that has ice) and fill up
 I get back home and indulge!!
 YUM YUM
 It can't be homeade ice
 I'm on my way to fill up right now


BTW, it's 11pm


This means I'll munch throughout the night
 
Eating freshly fallen snow and ice off of my car
 Getting upset because the neighbor cleaned my car off   Leaving a pot outside in a snow storm to catch fresh snow

Im so glad I found this web site
 I too chew ice constantly
 I have crushed ice in my fridge at all times
 There is this brand of ice called Shivers ( flavored ice)
 The flavors are lemon, lime or orange
 Good stuff!
For me it is icicles
I normallly pass by a car lot where they sell cars
Ice forms on the cars and it then run down on the side froming icicles
I go there deep in the snow so that I can break off the icicles to eat
Someone might think I am trying to  break into the cars
I mean look at the icicles here and see how delicious they look, especially the ones on the roofs I have had to break those too often
Somtimes I cut off a huge chunk and then then it is freezing my hand
Now the winter is going and that makes me sad
Now is back tott he coffee house when the cravings get hold of me and I am outside the house:http://en

 You'll have to freeze some club soda in a plastic bag and then break it up



ummmm it makes the perfect cloudy ice

hi guysmy name is Dougie, im 20 years old from Wisconsin (go badgers!
lol) as i was studying in UW Madison doing a major in arctic studies i got weird urges to start looking further into ice :Sim so glad i found this website for people like me with ice related problems, im not so much of a chewer, more ofan admirerer of those who chew, in other words i love the sound of someone chewing ice near me, sometimesi stick a bit of paper in a fan to recreate the sound of someones teeth quickly crushing down on soft icei feel comfortable here that no one will be judgemental and maybe i could get some contacts who wud be  big ice crunchersnot in a sexual way (i dont have skype) but in a way that i could maybe console you mentally now i guess for the emotional part of my 'story' when i was 19 in my freshman year of UW, i had a girlfriend she was my high school sweethart i guess you could say lolbut we sort of had a change of interests when i started getting involved in my fixation with hearing people chew icei tried to get her involved as she was my girlfriend, but she complained that it hurt her teeth, and she prefered sucking the iceI dont know my, but this realy caused a lot of conflict in our relationship, i started seeing her differently, to me she was no longerthat blonde haired girl from Georgia State high but she was a bitter un-understanding vision of distrusti spoke to a number of counsilers about these problems, and they think i was seeing her differently as she had just grown up from how we used to be (we had been going out since we were 17) maybe this was trueand i ignored the ice thing for a few months, but last month i took it too far, i don't remember doing itbut on christmas eve, i apparently crept into her dorm room while she was sleeping and poured 2 large bags of walmart brand ice onto hershe woke up screaming and some jock from next door kicked me out of their buildingshe hasnt spoke to me since

nice story ;P
So I've been chewing ice for about 16 years
All of my old friends completely deal with my ways
They may not understand but they deal with it
Everytime I meet someone new I find myself explaining certain habits that I have but lately I've just started telling non-chewers that the just won't understand:1
why I have more ice trays and ice blocks in my freezer than food
2
why I must finish my ice before I leave the my home or take the ice with me
3
why I can't watch any type of snow scene on tv without rushing to the Our Shitty I'm a spammer who can't get a job
 Also, our product sucsk - don't buy from us
Suck and We will rip you off
for a cup of ice
4
why I chew ice when it's freezing outside (yes, I' get cold
stop asking!!)
I know I'm missing stuff but that's just some of the things that nonchewers won't get
What other things are there?
So true

I have to have a cup of Ice when I wake up and before bed
I only  eat chewy Ice like from Sonic of from Zaxby's

I have been chewing ice for about 27 years, off and on
 Depending on when I was taking my iron I'm a spammer who can't get a job
 Also, our product sucsk - don't buy from us
/vitamins would gauge if it became a bad habit or not (diagnosed anemic at 16)
 Welp, as of right now, I've gone to chewing about 3 cups a day (give or take, and yes, the anemia has returned - trying to lose weight)
 What I love:1
Getting more ice than soda, so the ice has some flavor to it
2
Coke is my favorite soda and ice combo
  3
I eat it at my desk at work, in bed, at the movie theater, hell - at restaurants (which get me comments from my mom "Must you do that?")  4
I try to curb it by eating healthy (again, trying to lose weight) but, even when I do eat correctly, and take the meds and vitamins - I eat ice
5
It's actually comforting to me
Dunno why, just is
But the detractors:1
Had 4 cracked teeth removed, and getting ready to have a root canal done
2
Not always convenient to get the kind I like - hands down, Sonic/Circle K ice "nuggets" - just give me a 32 oz cup and I'm soooooooooooooooooo happy
 It all boils down to - I LOVE CHEWING ICE!
Hi
 I'm new to this site
 I too, crave ice, and easily consume a gallon of crushed ice a day
 I've struggled with anemia for YEARS (heavy bleeding during periods) but this last year I've become obsessive over ice, and easily consume a gallon of crushed ice a day
 Put me in front of a fabulous meal and a glass of ordinary water with ice and I will consume the ice every time
 Finally went to the dr
and told him I thought I needed my blood checked, as I have heard ice chewing is often a symptom of anemia
 Got the results back today, and sure enough, I am at TRANSFUSION LEVEL
 He is very concerned and I immediately booked an appt with my ob/gyn to get a handle on this
 If you are out there obsessing over ice and what restaurant produces the BEST ice (SONIC, HANDS DOWN!!!)  PLEASE get yourself checked for anemia
 Are you always exhausted?  Fuzzy thinking?  Short of breath?  Probably anemia

I will keep you all posted as to what the dr
says to do
 I am going to start on Fergon (Iron supplement) until I see the other dr
 Good luck to all my fellow ice addicts out there
 Hope there's help for us!!
What was your hemoglobin count?
I chew ice but chalk as well
Lack of iron makes us want to chew gritty stuff, my friend says
That's what my mom always tells me, too

two weeks ago I was in and out of the ER w/ heavy menstral bleeding
 My hemoglobin level dropped to 8
 This was the 1st time I ever experienced such a "flow"
 Finally, I was put on progesteron, which calmed things down after a few doses but I was still at an 8
 Almost had a transfusion
 Now I'm at a 10
 Normal low range is 12
 Getting better every day
 Had an ablasion last week which should make it so I never have a flow like that AGAIN
 I started craving ice last week
 Can't get enough
 And get this - if I could bottle the smell of wet concrete,   I'd be wearing it right now
 This all started last week
 The craving is actually lessoning, which is good
 I worry about cracking my teeth
    Thanks for your site
 I feel better now that this appears to be normal
Nice Post  ______________________________________________________________solitairechamp
Ok, so I typed "iron deficiency hair loss" into google, and yep an iron deficiency does cause hair loss
 There were so many websites saying this
Just thought you all might want to know incase you are losing hair like me

and I'm a 20 yr old girl
 
i have had hair loss for many years before i started eating ice off and on
i still dont know the reason why
certiain times of the month i crave ice more
i just sit in front of my heater and chomp the emamel right off my teeth with out care of who is listening
when i have to wait for the ice to freeze i cant concentrate until its done
ok ,,,time to make some more ice at 2:00am see u chompers later

Yes!
  I've been losing hair
 When I wash my hair, more than usual comes out, and I couldn't understand why






Are you forreal

this causes hair loss
 Does it stop if I stop eating ice
 I am only 25, I need my hair

I don't want to stop either
I have iron tabs to take (doctor suggestion)
I look forward to that first glass off ice every day (almost more than my first cup of coffee)
I have chipped a tooth, bitten holes in my cheeks, frozen my lips until they are blue, and I shake all day from loss of body heat
I don't want to stop chewing ice

I was wondering exactly how people eat their ice here


I eat mine in a custard cup, that holds about a cup of ice
 I have one the fridges that has ice in the door, so I just set it to crush and fill the cup


I used to eat it with my fingers, but one time I decided to try using chopsticks, and I don't know how I ever got along without them
 It was hard at first, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly
 I wasn't very good at using chopsticks when I started, but now I'm great at it
 

I like to eat ice this way because:

The small cup keeps me from eating too much, and the chopsticks keep me from eating too fast, which is good


The cup is the perfect size- I eat the smaller chips at first, and by the time I get to the bottom, the larger bits are nice and soft and crunchy-white, and the chips that were at the bottom are all clear and stuck together


I love it!

The chopsticks are more sanitary, and they keep me from freezing my fingers


they also keep my fingers from getting wet, so it's easier to eat ice and do something else at the same time


Lastly, it improves my chopstick-abilities, and it's fun
(At least in my opinion
^_^; )


I'm aware that my method of eating ice is pretty unusual, so I was wondering how most people do
 Do you use your fingers? A spoon? Do you just tilt the cup back and open your mouth?  How much do you get at a time?
You bring up a very good point
eating ice with our fingers is very unsanitary and we are so crazy we don't even think about that


I usually eat ice with my fingers, but I make sure I wipe my finger each time I put my hand in the cup
going to the ice from the keyboard is nasty


i just tilted the cup back and I see I can eat ice this way
except I like to break pieces together before eating them
I don't like putting the larger pieces in my mouth


Do you eat ice when you have a cold?
I ususally try to tilt the cup back and eat the ice
Sometimes the ice sticks together and I shake the cup or glass to break it apart which drives my husband crazy!
If I'm in the car and it sticks together I'll find a pen or any sharp object I can find to break it up
Sometimes I beat it on the side of the stearing wheel!
Yes, Sonic ice is the ultimate ice for me
It's the same ice that they make in hospitals
My sister is a nurse and also an ice cruncher, so she has that ice at her disposal at work
She is so lucky!!!
I have a 32 ounce THICK glass, cup that no one uses but me, and eat the ice with my fingers
 
I'm constantly washing my hands so they are clean for the ice, and avoid scented soaps, and lotions of any kind, so there is no taste transfer


My glass goes everywhere with me, it fits in my purse and the outter pocket of my winter coat


for shorter trips I grab a sandwich size zip-loc bag and carry it with me, sometimes in the pocket of my jeans or my jacket
 

When I'm at the keyboard, I tilt the cup and open my mouth


no wet fingers on the mouse/keyboard!

I tend to be more sneeky around strangers, at home around family, I've even gone so far as to toss a handfull of ice in to my mouth like some people do popcorn

I carry a giant cup with me at all times, I leave the house with it full of crushed ice and fill it where ever i can, the only problem is that i have to run to the bathroom everywhere
I keep saying that i will only do it at home but i cant help myself!!!!
I eat my ice with my fingers until it starts to melt and then I dont like getting my fingers wet/cold so I use a spoon after that
At work I use a spoon
I have a giant insulated cup that i use for my ice
No one ever is allowed to use my cup   It keeps the ice from melting longer and holds a ton of it at a time

I get my ice at BP which is a gas station
I get it in a 32 oz cup which they let me refill for free
Then I take it to the gym with me and get in the warm water pool and work out nibbling on my ice between sets of various excercizes


I dip it out with my fingers
For some reason this is part of the whole thing
It seems forbidden -- like having chocolate cake in the midde of the night while on a strict diet


This goes on slowly for about 2 hours
When its all gone I go home
I stop by the BP on the way home and get another 32oz in the same cup (free) and nibble on that till bedtime


Sometimes it happens that I have to go back to the BP and get some more

I have one of those ice-crushers on my refrigerator, so I am always eating crushed ice

Sometimes I like pouring Sprite on it so it tastes sweet :3

I use a spoon or chopsticks
Yayaaah!
I like my ice crushed
I work midnights at a hospital and everyone knows that the hospitals have the best crushed ice around
I have been an ice eater for years, and have also learned from my mistakes
I do not at all bite on any ice cubes because biting ice have sent me to the dentist plenty of times
It ruins your teeth
I choose to eat mine crushed and if I have to, I crush it myself sometimes
Pouring it in your mouth and sucking it until it melts have the same great taste with fewer dental bills

well if i'm watching a movie {@ home very warm  } that i know that i'm not going to get up i stick my fingers in there and just be cozy and comfortable chewing my lovely and beautiful ice lol!!!
if i'm driving i tilt the ice to my mouth

if i'm @ work i tilt it too
i do too much paper work and type alot and i hate having to run to the restroom to wash my hands



but i mean it all depends on what i'm doing 




my cousin and my friends get mad @ me for chewing ice BUT whenever i show up with my big humongo MUG everfybody wants my ice lol!!!
i like it but not really because everybody be taking my ice!!!
and my is special and only for ME!
haha

love yall ICE FAMILY
I crush my ice in the food processor and eat in with a bowl and spoon
 I fill a cereal-sized bowl to overflowing
 Don't usually eat the whole thing because my fluffy ice gets harder as it melts

well I buy bags of Sonic Ice


that is all they are good for


and I will get a bag for work and for home


so all I have to do is tilt the cup
 We usually have 2 bags at home


one with large cubes for beverages and one for me to eat
 I am shivering right now while eating my ice

I always use a cup and just tilt it to eat
 But I prefer a flexible pastic type cup so I can squeeze it to jar loose the ice so it slides to my mouth
 If I must use a real glass, I have to use a spoon to break up the crushed pieces so I can eat it or else it melts into one hunk which slams against my mouth when I tilt -- ain't a pretty picture
 Hate to eat ice with a spoon though -- the metal is too cold and ruins the taste too


I love eatin ice in a tall glass wiv a little water to soften it up
I use my hands but keep a cloth beside me to wipe my wet hands in or to hold ice that is dry and sticks to my skin

*** I eat crushed rock Ice only** * *I love to pick-up each piece by hand and drop it in my mouth *If I pour it in my mouth, it has to be in a plastic cup, that is bendable, so I can squeeze it together and drain the water off  from the ice as its melting
I cant stand to get water in my mouth as I tilt the cup back
 I will freak out if my ice has any sort of smell or taste, that drives me crazy unless its that chlorine taste some ice has

well my obsession has landed me in a lot of trouble with my mum due to my continuous visits to the freezer, its been about three times now thats its broken down


the last time she had to buy a new one cuz I enjoy munching on the dry crunchy ice that mounts >>DAILY<<   on the bottom of it
My personal preference is chewing ice in the winter>>dunno why? but i think its to do with the fact that its easier for me to get and conceal from others
Be it from the supermarket or my house I'll eat it anywhere
Once I actually got in trouble with my mum again cuz she caught scraping the excess ice off of the boxes in the ice cream section in the supermarket, embarrassing me in front of everyone loooooooooooooooool the bus stop close to my house is actually right outside  a shop that has the most crunchieist and thickest chunks of ice i have seen   but its so irrtating i can only get a few pieces in my mouth before the boss sees me and kicks me out so i make it worth while    trust me these regualar visits prove quite a satisfying appetizer for when i get home and really get BUSY
  I think my obsession started last year when i was 15

but it was inevitable since it runs in the family

i used to criticise my sisters about this in the past but now i know exactly what they mean


its actually a refief i don't feel alone and this site has also helped me finally indicating to me that i may have ANAEMIA


i just thought i was weird!
now i can explain to my friends that there is a reason for my strange actions and cravings



well thx guys for reading my story>>>OMG i feel like im in AAO YEA AND BY THE WAY I HATE WATCHIN MOVIES WHICH INVOLVE ANY SNOW OR SKIING OR WHATEVER CUZ I FIND MYSELF SHOUTING AT THE SCREEN FOR THE ACTORS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE AND CHEW CHEW CHEW!!!!!!!
  
ARGH!you think you have it bad?!try living in TEXAS where it only snows like


once a year!and i know snow
i used to live in new york
and london
i KNOW snow
so i can MISS IT
but i was in class, and there was this picture of someone SKIING, and i practically RIPPED the page out, just because the SNOW  was driving me CRAZY
seriously, i almost lost it
and yeah, i know what youre talking about with the freezer
ours was malfunctioning for about a week, and i was so happy
no matter HOW much ice i took, there was ALWAYS some the next day!its pretty much all i looked forward to in life lol
but then my dad had to fix it
bleh
and oh man, one time my sister caught me eyeing the freezer in a sam's [swear to god the ice was at least five inches thick] and she flipped
how embarrassing
i still wanted the ice though

You two make me laugh
Chewing ice makes me love winter and I am an immigrant from the tropics
Right now it is March and it is warming up i find myself wondering if it will snow one more time and the ice will form
Where people see cold I look out and see icycles on the roofs and banks and tree sand crave to go out there break of a stcick and eat
And I normally do that
cRight now the ice is almost gone except for a shady place behind the shadow of my greenhouse
I know the ice the ice clean since nobody but me goes there
I use my hand weights to break off a chunk and it is so delicious, much more than the ice I make in my freezerstripedpolkadots wrote:ARGH!you think you have it bad?!try living in TEXAS where it only snows like

I AM anemic, we gauge how much by when I start the ice thing
SO I know pretty soon I'll need some iron
It's a long drawn out story( I'll tell it but only if asked), I have to have IV iron
I'm a spammer who can't get a job
 Also, our product sucsk - don't buy from us

Hi all


Sometimes I get the feeling that I chew way too much ice
In the summer I chew a lot more than in winter and I understand that
But it's just March and I feel that I'm eating so much more than I usually do
I"m up to about 4 trays a day
That's only while I am home so ice that I chew at work is not counted


So make me feel "normal"
How many trays, bags, pounds, cups of ice do you chew a day?
I chew ALL the time
When I wake up, whike im eating breakfast, while im on the computer, with lunch, after lunch, before and after dinner, and before I go to bed
I think I have about 8 or 9 trays a day
Yeah, I would say that you're normal:] Don't feel weird

I get a 20 ounce cup of ice out when I get up in the morning and take one up to bed at night, I probably have about 8-10 20 ounce cups a day

I usually chew about 20 oz
a day and I  eat the frost out of our freezer
omg it is so good:)

THE FREEZER FROST IS HOW IT STARTED MANY YEARS AGO
SEVERAL BROKEN BLENDER BLADES AND ICE SHAVING MACHINES, I'M STILL AT IT
I CHEW EVERYDAY AT WORK AT LEAST 8-10 80Z CUPS AS I DO HAVE TO ACTUALLY WORK SOMETIMES
SOME CUPS ARE SOOO SATISFYING!!
MY LATEST ICE MACHINE IS USED ONCE IN THE MORNING AND 2-3 TIMES EACH EVENING
THIS IS ALSO MY PRIMARY SOURCE OF HYDRATION

Well let me see
In the morning on my way to work I have a 44oz cup
 On my way home I have another 44oz cup
 When I get home i fix me another 44oz cup so that when I done with the one i had on the way home I dont have to wait that long for it to get a little soft
When I get ready to eat my dinner I fix me another one so that when I am done eating I can already have it
Sometimes I can't wait and then I start eating it when I suppose to be drinking my drink
Needless  to say the drink hardly ever get to the bottom
Then right before I go to bed I have me another cup
I have decreased alot I used to have one on my lunch break a long with the other cups
One day i wont need all of those but unti then HAPPY CHEWING  
I have eaten up to 8 trays back to back one time 

Then at school i get mostly ice in my cup my friends are like DANG slow damn i just can't help myself they say i have SEX with my ice im like what the crap LOL 
I also have my mum buy bags of ice all the TIME i can eat ice ALL DAY LONG !
At least we are getting our daily requirement of water
 
I don't use trays because the refrigerator automatically make it
but i eat ice non stop
from the moment i get up till the moment i go to bed
i take ice with me in the car when i go places, i take it to school, i buy it at school, everything
and it doesn't matter the time of year for me
i always eat a lot

hmmm i eat probably a bag of ice every other day

My family gets so tired of the ice bin being empty every time they decide they want something to drink
We have about 4 trays and I always have a bag of ice in the freezer
I can eat entire 7lb bag of ice in a day
Now that's bad!
OMG
 I have such an addiction that I am willing to be late to work just to get my morning 32 oz of ice from the gas station
I have a total of 64 oz of ice before noon


EVERYDAY
 From 2 pm to 10 pm I have another 142 oz
 I repeat this Monday - Friday
On the weekend I probably have a total of 64 oz
 The people at the gas station think I'm nuts!!
 
hmm


on average prolly about 3 or 4 of those 7-11 double gulps, which is 64 ounces
then about 5 or 6 cups
and two or three 32 ounces
and i filch ice from cups in my house all the time
it annoys my family so much
and


EHMAHGGAAAWWWWDDD!!!i totallly thought my eating freezer frost was a me-only freaky kind of thing!im not the only one!!yay
 
freezer frost



YUM!!
Who ever made frost free fridges and freezer need to be shot
I love frost so much


I find myself scraping the freezer in the stores
I love to stick my head in the freezer and sniff the air


I love ice so much


I can't control it


when it snows here in DC
I have to force myself not to eat it



I know it's not clean



but it looks sooo good
I know I am sick





I am very much happy to get your information form your post
This is really a helpful post for us
Thanks

I have been a chomper for about 12 years, and I have had migraines for about 11 years
 In my search for a cure for my migraines, i wonder if there is any correlation
 Do any of you get migraine headaches on a regualar basis?
I never get migraines
but you know somehow I believe your ice habit is contributing to your migraines
if you have been chopping on ice for 12 years
i'm pretty sure you have been doing damage to your teeth
so the migraine actually may be coming from a tooth ache that's waiting to surface


Be careful




Also, if you are having migraines check your eye sight
you may need glasses
 Let me know how everything turns out

I get migranes all the time from chewing ice all day



and a sore jaw


but hasn't stopped me
 I do wonder if its causing a strain in my head somewhere




Hi everyone
I'm writing an article for New York Magazine about ice chewers
If anyone would be willing to speak with me, shoot me a message!
I have a severe disease called Trigeminal Neuralgia that affects the 5th cranial nerve of the brain
This disease is also called the suicide disease due to the EXTREME pain that occurs on 1 side of your face
It is the most painful disease known to man
    I have had 2 brain surgeries to try to help the pain, you see


there is no cure
Opiates don't relieve the pain either
Recently I have developed a severe case of ice chewing
I am not anemic
I was told by a hospital nurse once that damaged nerves in the face and head can cause ice chewing
  Anyone else have nerve damage?   Thanks,Betsy
Ice, Ice Ice, love it!,gotta have it!, need it
  Does anyone know where to buy a good Ice maker?

Oh man!
I NEVER, EVER, EVER let my supply run out
It is just one of those necessary things on the "to do" list
I buy 20 pounds of SONIC ice every other day
I couldn't even imagine NOT having my ice "available" when I want it
That sends real chills down my spine
 
OMG

AND IT CANT MELT
IT HAS 2 HAVE THAT CRUNCH MY BRAIN CRAVES

freak out and drive to store in middle of night
I asked dh to keep a bag of ice in the freezer in garage, just in case I eat all the ice in ice maker in fridge
I sometimes eat faster than it makes it
We have to have ice maker replaced every year, because I go through it so fast
I keep burning them out

Run out of ice



OMG



never, never, never


I must have Ice in the house at all times


out of food, so what


we got ice


I AM GOOD!!!!!
I can't believe I found this site, finally I am with people who understand my addiction
I needed a place to get this off my chest, on the night my freezer broke I was down to my last cup off ice and as I was walking from the living room I dropped the cup and the ice flew in all directions I quickly scrambled on my knees trying to collect every piece, the terrible bit is that some pieces had gathered cat hair on them and two pieces landed in the kitty litter box right on top of some fresh doings
This is the most shameful thing I have even done but it was all the ice I had left so I picked it up and give it  a rinse under the tap but I could only rinse it for a sec as I couldn't afford it to melt on me
After I run it through the water I quickly popped it in my mouth and crunched down on it swallowing as quick as I could
I'm sure if anyone understands its you guys

Hi
Finding this web is an ecstasy for me, I thought I was the only one who is addicted to chewing ice   I've been chewing for six years now, and my mother is very worried about my teeth since I'm wearing braces
She always tells me to stop but I JUST CAN'T (I'm sure you know how I feel!)
I mean, it's just ice, I'm going to be alright
But my mom doesn't buy it, she thinks that I still need to stop chewing, so lately she disallows me to fill the ice trays at home
In restaurants she also doesn't allow me to buy drinks with ice
I'm craving ice now but I can't have any
Somebody helpppp me  How do I convince my mother so that I can chew ice again?
So i have been chewing for at least four years now
My sister kinda hooked me on it, and when we got separated I moved to America and started eating ice constantly
so the problem is, I found out that one of my back teeth got fractured, I got scared
And for a couple of days I have been crushing my ice up in the blender
I think it will help me stop
I just started eating Iron I'm a spammer who can't get a job
 Also, our product sucsk - don't buy from us
but I get cravings for ice everyday, but I am also afraid that my teeth are gonna shutter by the time I'm thirty
So not to sound cliche, but, any quitting stories and advices? Thank you in advance!
I  always been an ice chewer but at times I could go a while without it but lately I have been getting in nearly three 52ounces of crushed ice a day
O
o That's a bunch of ice
 I feel like I'm addicted to it
 
I so understand
 I go through a bag of Sonic ice a day by myself
 I keep one at home and one at work
 It's the first thing I think of in the morning and the last at night
 I can feel my mouth watering when I go to make a cup
 I keep a 32 oz cupfull on my desk all day and crunch away
 It drives my husband crazy!
 I do wonder if I'm anemic
 I have been in the past and I know that this can be a sign
But, I'm not willing to give it up
 I go so far as to take one of those grocery freezer bags, that they sell for carrying home frozen products, in my car when I know I'm going to be out for a while
 I fill 2 gallon sized bags and keep it in there with me in the car
 That way I always have it at all times
 It does feel kinda crazy when you think about it, but there are much worse addictions to have!
  So, trust me, I understand completely
 I'm with ya!
so Im not the only one who eats 7 cups of 32ounces of ice a day, if i could i'll eat a whole 10 pound bag of ice, this is bad cause i have lost a lot of weigh and don't eat the right kind of foods like i should, plus eating ice all the time is very bad for your teeth,, i lost 4 already , chipping them from the hard cracking of ice , like cracking nuts with your mouth instead of a nutcracker, boy I hate it but being an anemic , this is what helps me day by day,, what a drag, if only there was something else to crunch on that's hard and cold,?????
It was maybe a year and a half ago now


I was sitting in a pub and chatting with a girl I liked for over 7 years, one that I haven't met in quite some time until then


At first, I was absolutely thrilled- we were practically alone in our little corner, she was telling me about her past, failed loves, and I was quietly sipping my icy pina colada, absorbing her every word in a hallucinating stupor induced by her presence


However, as time passed, I was somehow more and more convinced that she was not actually interested in me, but needed someone to open her heart to and share her burden


I slowly started to lose hope and to drift away, expecting that we soon part our ways with a casual goodbye
As I drank the last of my cocktail, I absent-mindedly commented on how I sometimes like eating ice, not afraid that I'd look weird in her eyes- after all, I thought I had no chance with her anyways


I popped an ice cube into my mouth, and waited for it to melt, when she told me she'd like to try and taste the ice, too


I looked, confused, at my empty glass- and she told me 'no, I want the one you have'


Then, something happened, something I could only think of as magic at the moment
I let her have the ice cube


and that was our first kiss
That's my story

OMG



that's a cute and sexy story


good luck to you guys


  
Awww That happened to me as well
I dated a guy for a while and the first time he came over the house I found out he ate ice, and we shared a whole mug though our mouths
 
THOSE ARE ROMANTIC STORIES, i LIKE TO SHARE MY ICE TOO,  THE ICE MAN ,
I have been eating ice since my second pregnancy four years ago
I will say this addiction is dangerous but I could care less
I am known in
my community and surrounding areas for my ice habits
I know of every store and business that sell' my' ice
I only eat ice from sonic, foosackly's, a certain chevron and a few corner stores
I only eat' ready' ice
Ready ice is the frosted ice that is really chewy and crunchy
I eat ice all day and I will
cry like a newborn (no lie) baby when my bf tell me no to me having ice
 I am going to buy me a ninja blender so I won't have to go to the store no longer
 And BTW thanks for making this site
And hello to my fellow ice eaters

I'm pick too
Only ice from my freezer
 I make small trays (I bought extra trays recently) then I fill two large cups so one is always ready to munch
 I even take in car with me
 I suspect we are all stressed
I am going to check with my doctor to make sure I don't have a vitamin deficiency but I suspect its stress
 Since I started chewing ice and huffing freezer smell (lol) I have cut my Xanax use in half
 HELP

Ok I work in a professional environment, I mean suit and tie office, and due to my loyalty to my ice I must prepare 6 large Paper Starbucks coffee cups go around to each floors icemakera that have white ice -I detest clear ice
After filling each cups with ice I run hot water over them and the the munch session can begin
My ice addiction has caused a lot of coworkers to become upset over the lack of ice in the building due to me clearing out all the ice makers during business hours as well as taking a reusable Whole Foods bag and filling it with a clear brand new trash bag I get from the housekeeping staff here at work and then I go to each and every floor and fill my bag and then stash it in a fridge on the first floor so that I can grab it on my way out in the evening




I've got it BaD!!!!
Hi ice addicts far and near!I had no idea there were others like me, I thought I was just the abnormal strange one who everyone gets mad at for chomping on ice constantly
  I've had an ice addiction for 9 years now, I didn't have access to ice as a teen or otherwise my ice-addiction would've started alot sooner as I can remember back when I was a teen anytime I did get hold of some ice I'd jump on it and start chewing it
I've lost 2 teeth because of it, and about to lose a third
I also have anorexia (for 13 years), so not sure if the ice addiction is caused by the anorexia or if the anorexia is just exacerbated by my ice addiction
I'm so bad with the ice eating thing, that I'll even steal ice out of other people's soft-drink cups, eat it out of the freezer if I'm that desperate, and have been known to eat defrosting ice that's fallen onto the floor when cleaning the freezer (one time ate ice that had fallen in the dirt outside)
Very embarrassing to say the least
  People hate it
They get so annoyed with me when I eat ice around them, so try to chew quieter, but they still get mad
Anyways, so glad that I'm not the only one
 
I can't believe there is actually a website that I am posting to about ice-chewing, but here it goes
I have the WORST case of ice chewing and craving
 When my 21 year old son was on the way, I started chewing ice


about 24 hours after delivery, I quit
 Then my 18 year old daughter was on the way
 I once again started chewing away, after l about 24 hours after she was delivered, then I quit again
 During this pregnancy, I loved the smell of styrofoam


I actually got a hold of some (the kind that is put in pillows) and chewed it until it would begin to crumble in my mouth
   2 1/2 years later, my 16 year old daughter was on the way 

you know the routine 

after she was delivered I stopped 


that was until our 6 year old daughter was on the way


here came the craving again
 However, after this pregnancy, I had a tubal ligation (tubes tied)
 I however, didn't quit chewing ice
 I am still chewing ice


I have actually purchased a  SCOTSMAN MDT2C12 TOUCHFREE CUBELET ICE MAKER/DISPENSER!
 (Found on e-bay, paid $2250 for the thing) This is THEE machine that makes SONIC ice
 I swear I have this down to a science 



If I take out about a pitcher's worth of ice ( and give it to my plants so I'm not "wasting water") then the machine kicks in and starts making that amazing ice that sticks to your teeth 

the really fresh cool stuff
 I will literally chew ice until I am shivering, and sometimes I will go to bed with a front toothache that radiates up past my nose and into my forehead
 I've actually wrapped in a heating blanket, chewing ice, as I'm watching tv, using the computer, etc
 I chew ice when I'm folding laundry, cleaning the windows, polishing the floor, driving, taking a bath 


it's out of control I know!!
 I have 2 chipped molars due to chewing, but my dentist has never lectured me
 I know for a fact that I chew over 10 lbs a day because of the amount the ice machine can produce
 Ok, the confession is out


I do have fibroids (3), am 44 years old now and every other month has a cycle from H E _ _ !!Does any of this relate to anyone??Still Chewin in CO
I am the same way

I only chew when I am pregant and that is how I found out this time, we are expecting
Once my baby is born I quit
I have to have ice from certain places


Once Mcdonalds here in my town has "better" ice than another and I have to go through the drive through or it isn't right!!
Weird I know
Wow, a kindred spirit
When I was pregnant with my first, I worked at Jewel Foods and on my breaks I would go back in the produce department with my cup and take a hugh scoop out of the machine that makes the crushed ice that they used to pour over some of the produce
That was the only craving I had while pregnant
Same with kid #2
I lost the craving for years, but now it's back
(and no



I'm not pregnant!) I know I have anemia and I'm thinking it has something to do with menopause too
I also chew until I'm blue and shivering
My neighbors think I'm crazy when I sit on my sunny front porch when it's 95 degrees
In the winter


forget it, I'm NEVER warm
Why do we do this to ourselves? I don't chew near as much as most of the people on this site, I just don't have the time to carry and crunch all day
Good thing
I do have a habit of checking out the ice in the places that I eat and have recently found Sweet Tomatoes ice to be the best
Does anyone think that ice actually has a taste? We must, because we keep saying it tastes delicious
I believe it isn't the taste as much as the texture
One positive




you can do it all day it won't add a single calorie to your diet
   Munch on!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh, I can so relate
We all have it pretty bad, but I've just started on iron suplements and am waiting to see how it goes
I used to take them while I was pregs, but they gave me night terrors and chomping on the ice seemed the better soulution
But recently I was in the hospital and they let me have ALL the ice I wanted, it was so cool (No pun intended
) When I got out I wanted nothing but cracked ice or chipped ice thereafter
When we went out one of out waitresses gave me a cup of ice from the bar, and it was more like a snow cone
I could have made slush balls out of it, but it ended up being SOOOO GOOOOOD
 Yup, I must be strange

I have the same thing going on, I know I am severely anemic and this is why ice is currently my "food of choice"
The urge goes away when I get my iron and B vitamins up, but the only supplements that work for me are so darn expensive
However, because the ice chewing is just curing the craving and not the problem, I still at times have severe fatigue from the anemia
Also, the ice chewing seems to make me bloat, cold (also in part due to the anemia) and my nose is always running



not fun
I would suggest to the writer who has decided to give the iron supplements a go, to use a liquid, chelated form of iron
Regular iron I'm a spammer who can't get a job
 Also, our product sucsk - don't buy from us
are made directly of this metal mineral (which is difficult for our bodies to digest and therefore use)
Chelated iron is taken from plants that have kind of digested and absorbed the iron for us and can be ingested like food and easily used by our bodies
FloraDix is the only brand I have tried, but there are other less expensive brands out there
Anyway, hope this helps

haahahhhaaa nice post---------------
just joined     yes, i also have and addiction to chewing ice





yes, monthly cramps from he--


once cramping stops
i continue to chew,chew and chew




glad 2 know that there r others like myself
So I saw this website im bored at work so I had to join
I'm still not sure if I'm anemic
My mom is and my docs have tols me on occasions that my iron is too low, but never diagnosed me with anemia
And I've also donated plasma and it wasn't an issue



I really like ice though
My friends think I'm weird- everytime I go to the club I order ICE!!!
I dont necessarily chew it, but keep it to "caress"(suck) in my mouth
And if I get a little too hot I can just throw it in my blouse
lol
But ice is awesome
Especially crushed ice!!!!
yum
And shved ice with no flavor is awesome too
But yeah just thought I'd share

I was searching internet for stuff on chronic ice chewing tonight when I came upon this website
I've been chewing ice since I was a teenager, and I'm 36 now
I don't have an ice maker on my current refrigerator, so I take ice cube trays and put just enough ice in them to make very small, chewable ice cubes
I eat them and refill it all day and night
I try to get the ice cubes before they completely harden and still have a little water in them, so it's a little easier on my teeth because I have lost fillings, chipped teeth, and just overall hurt my teeth because of my chronic ice chewing
I have been diagnosed with anemia and iron deficiency before, but the last time I was tested it was just at normal
It was high, but it wasn't deficient either



but my ice chewing has gotten worse and worse
I lost my job in Sept
'09
It was a very good, high-paying job
I haven't been able to work since, and my ice chewing has definitely gotten worse since this happened
Although when I was working, I would buy those bags of ice and put one in the freezer at work, so I could crush some and chew on it when I needed it
I think my case is pretty extreme
It feels very similar to what an addiction would feel like
I absolutely crave it, and once I start thinking about it I have to have it
 I don't know what to do about it
I feel like I need help, some kind of intervention or something


lol   Any thoughts, help, or even criticism out there from anyone?   Oh, I forgot to mention that my 9 yr old daughter has now started chewing ice also, and occasionally, my 3 yr old son wants to also



so now it's not just affecting me and my health but that of my children!
This forum is amazing I have been suffering with chewing Ice for so long!
I try and take to building LEGO to help soothe my pain


I do have to rely on LEGO Reviews, but who cares
Chewing ice is killing me

I need help!!
LOL!
An article from the Chicago Sun Times, 12/2/07:

Hold the ice: What's in your glass might surprise you
COLD TRUTH | 'Someone's not washing their hands properly': 1 in 5 samples from restaurants, bars found to have high levels of bacteria 

December 2, 2007
BY ART GOLAB AND LEONARD N
FLEMING Staff Reporters/agolab@suntimes
com, lfleming@suntimes

Next time you go out to eat or to a bar, it might be a good idea to say, "Hold the ice
"

In a test of ice cubes from 49 fast-food and casual-dining restaurants and hotel bars in the city and suburbs, the Chicago Sun-Times found that more than one of every five samples contained high levels of bacteria


» Click to enlarge image In a test of ice cubes from 49 eateries in the city and suburbs, more than one of every five samples contained high levels of bacteria



RELATED STORIES• Complete section: Health
• Today's headlines: Local news
• Restaurants respond to 'Hold the ice'

Samples taken at three of the restaurants contained an undetermined amount of fecal coliform, according to the findings of a government-certified laboratory that performed tests on the samples for the newspaper


By comparison, a water sample taken from a toilet in a men's room at the Sun-Times tested cleaner than the ice obtained at 21 of the restaurants and bars


11 score worst
Drinking-water standards set by the U
S
Environmental Protection Agency mandate average levels of less than one colony of coliform bacteria per milliliter


Still, bacteria -- even fecal coliform -- aren't necessarily dangerous for most people
But they can lead to illness, experts say, especially among those who are very old or young,

Some highlights of the newspaper's findings:

•         •         Ice from 11 restaurants or bars had high levels of "total coliform bacteria" -- more than 200 bacteria colonies per milliliter tested
These included an Applebee's at 7519 S
Cicero, a Chipotle Mexican Grill at 10 S
LaSalle, a Starbucks at 444 N
Michigan, Asiago Express at 176 N
Wells, an Outback Steakhouse at 216 E
Golf Rd
in Schaumburg, a Burger King at 6950 S
Pulaski, a Caribou Coffee at 3025 N
Clark, Rock Bottom Restaurant and Brewery at 1 W
Grand, and the bars at three high-end hotels -- the Drake Hotel at 140 E
Walton, the Hyatt Regency Chicago at 151 E
Wacker and the Sheraton Chicago at 301 E
North Water


•         •         Representatives of most of those said they adhere to all recommended sanitary practices, several said they had taken additional steps in response to the Sun-Times' findings, and several noted they routinely pass health inspections
Ice, though, usually isn't tested by the Chicago Health Department
Few health departments test ice because of the expense


•         •         Ten establishments had lower levels of total coliform bacteria -- fewer than 200 colonies per milliliter


•         •         Nearly all of the ice tested that came from self-serve ice machines had low levels of bacteria or none at all


•         •         Hotel lobby bars, where ice is often transported by and handled by multiple people, didn't test as well: Three of four bars tested had ice with high levels of bacteria


•         •         Twenty-eight of the 49 samples showed no bacteria at all


The findings shouldn't alarm people, experts said


"It's not like you'll see people dropping over dead or huge numbers getting sick because it's going to take just the right bacteria and the right person to make them ill," said Penn State University's Brian Swistock, co-author of the university's publication "Water Tests: What Do the Numbers Mean?"

'Would be a problem'
But high bacteria levels such as those found in some of the ice cube samples might help explain some of the stomach ills people get, according to Swistock and others


"The illnesses are very nondescript," he said
"They might just be a flu-like symptom, a little bit of nausea, a slight fever -- something that a lot of people would write off as just being a bug that they got
"

In any amount, though, the presence of fecal coliform bacteria -- as the tests found at three restaurants -- "would be a problem," according to Frances Guichard, director of food protection at the Chicago Health Department


"It means that obviously someone's not washing their hands properly, and there's fecal mater," Guichard said
"If there's enough, it can make someone sick
"

And the more the ice comes in contact with people, the more likely it is to become contaminated with bacteria, according to Mary Troken, director of the food service sanitation program at Harold Washington College, one of the City Colleges of Chicago


"Ice, whether we all realize it or not, is really food, and it's very mishandled," said Troken, a registered dietitian


"If you've got someone who did not wash their hands properly, they might have touched raw foods or gone to the washroom, and now they're touching the ice; those are opportunities for the bacteria to get transferred to the ice
"

A snapshot
In the Sun-Times' tests, reporters ordered drinks with ice on the side or got the ice from self-serve machines
Taking care not to touch the ice and potentially contaminate it, they then transferred the cubes to sterile containers
The melted water from the ice cubes was tested the same day by Suburban Laboratories of Hillside, which is certified by the EPA


For each sample, the lab counted the number of bacterial colonies and determined whether fecal coliform bacteria were present


The tests offered a snapshot -- of the particular ice cubes that were tested on the particular day the samples were taken


The testing did not follow all EPA protocols, which would include repeat testing
Still, experts said it would be highly unlikely to get bacteria readings of "too numerous to count" by contamination introduced in the testing process


In response to the test results, representatives of the restaurants and bars where the ice cubes showed high levels of bacteria said they were taking the findings seriously, even as some questioned them


"Although we question the methodology," a Rock Bottom spokesman said, "we did take immediate -- voluntary and precautionary -- steps to address the situation
All ice machines in the building were drained and thoroughly sanitized, and we retrained our staff regarding the proper handling of ice
"

Health, safety 'a priority'
An Applebee's spokesman said: "The health and safety of our guests is a priority
We have taken the necessary steps to ensure our ice-making and water-supply systems are clean and sanitized
"

A Starbucks spokesman said: "Starbucks policy requires that each store undertake regular, thorough cleanings of their ice machines and ice bins
On a daily basis, ice machines and ice bins are thoroughly wiped down with sanitization solutions that kill bacteria and viruses
On a monthly basis, the machines and bins are completely disassembled and fully cleaned and sanitized from top to bottom
"

Additionally, the spokesman said that, though an inspection it commissioned "found no evidence of issues associated with the ice or ice machine, we worked closely with the store involved in the investigation to ensure that they immediately conducted an additional, thorough, top-to-bottom cleaning of their ice container
"

Sand grinding against your teeth does not sound comfortable



First off i think this website is awesome  its reassuring to know i am not the only one in this world who cant get enough ice
I also love reading the stories cause they remind me why i love ice haha
Every morning i wake up and get a cup of ice and when im done with that i get another cup, and thats my routine all day
I think Quicktrip and Sonic probably have the best ice because its so soft and perfect
And i love the smell of the freezer as well
When i go to walmart i always have to smell where the milk is at because its literally the best smell in this world
Its so cold and refreshing
#iloveice
i dont know who started this site but thank u,im new here and for years i thought i was crazy
I only eat the frosted ice i get three big icetrays then melt the bottom so they wont stick when i pulled the ice out then i dump them all im one big cup then melt them down to the frosted area(i melt all the clear area off) then sit in front of the tv like im eating popcorn or something i even took a big cup to the movies and my boyfriend thought it was the strangest thing i got so desperate i had my sister meet me outside with a fresh cup of ice because i had run out and the theater didnt have the frosted kind
Do u think im crazy?
I love the smell of a freezer and everytime I smell a freezer I get the craving for ice cubes!
I love icecubes in the bag that you buy from the grocery store

OMG!
i know what you mean, especially in the defrost cycle!
it is the best smell next to wet dirt after it rains
  just thinking about it make me want to go out and eat some ice!!
Now i can't wait to get home!!!
Oh my Gosh




!!!
   I Love the smell of a defrosting freezer




!!!
I can smell it even when the door is closed
Does Any one else like to eat the frost off the freezer?   Dang the automatic defrost cycles  I wanna' detemine when it defrosts




!!!!!
   
Oh yeah
I love to eating the ice out of the freezer


  I have an old freezer in our garage so I sneak out there and have some when I can,   And of I don't have that, our ice maker makes the best ice, but it takes too long sometimes
 
haha i thought i was the only one who stood in front of the opened freezer door inhaling!!
I am so on the same page with U guys
My mother had this best friend when I was little
She used to have frezzer that had the ice that u could scrape
Every time I needed a fix i would tell my mother that she said come by even tho she didnt say it

I usually wait till everyone at home is asleep then I'll stand infront of the freezer to inhale and chew ice
  I'm so going to spoil my fridge soon


 
omg, like, i stand in front of freezers too
its totally like a drug for me, but it's not a drug, it's a freezerhow weird
OMG
It's so amazing to see i'm not the only one
I love to go into large supermarkets and open the ice cream freezer and just smell to my heart's content
It helps if you get down low near the grids
I worry that i'm sniffing freezone or something like that
But it is so cold and wonderful
I pretend like I'm getting the ice cream!
Actually I hate the ice at my house BECAUSE of the taste the freezer gives the ice
When I tell my mom I'm going to Sonic to get ice, she's like "we have an ice machine
" But it's just not the same
Haha
And when I tell her Sonic is better it just sounds like I'm all stuck up and high maintenance
Haha
I think she's starting to understand though


?
If you crave the "smell"   of your freezer, then you should post about it here!http://smells
iswhaticrave
com
OMG, I am so glad to know that I am not so weird after all
 I have been opening the freezer and sniffing it for a few years now
 I just find that smell so refreshing
 When I am stressed I open and take a whiff
 Gosh I thought something was wrong with me

Oh wow, I thought that there were something wrong with me
 I do love the smell of freezer too

oh good, so im not a freezer smelling weirdo
good, good
cuz i pretty much just ADORE that smell
adore

I'm well aware of how old this thread is, but I wanted to exclaim my happiness
I am SO thrilled to know that I'm not the only one who enjoys the scent of one's freezer
I don't know what it is exactly that draws me in


perhaps it's the nostalgic memories of me sticking my head in the freezer during long, hot summers without air conditioning
Who knows? I don't
Still good to know I'm not out of my mind
  Ah


those were the days
Since we're on the subject of freezers/refrigerators, does anyone know if lg refrigerators are worth purchasing? Thanks, everyone!
i must admit that i love ice
 filling up a huge glass with cubes makes me so happy
 before i even realize it, i'm refilling my cup
i fill up the ice trays half way so that the cubes aren't so difficult to break into small pieces
 i love breaking them into tiny pieces- eating the tiny pieces is the best part
 however, my teeth have started to hurt lately, and i can't help to think it might be from my excessive ice crunching
i think i want to buy a kiddie snow cone maker
 yet, i'd like something in-between because i'd love tiny TINY soft pieces (as an inbetween of slush and cubes)
  i've tried crushing cubes in different Our Shitty I'm a spammer who can't get a job
 Also, our product sucsk - don't buy from us
Suck and We will rip you off
appliances, but i still am not getting the result i am craving
 but maybe i should just switch to slush to save my teeth
plus, the noise of crunching cubes annoys anyone who i'm with
thoughts?
omgg i love ice im only 14 i don't know whats wrongg i mean i eat it everytime i go in the freezer + there is some i love the taste
My friends at school make fun of me because when i get to the ice i feel my cup all the way sometimes i won't even get anything to drink just ICEE 
its so good i don't if i should stop !
Ha
I understand how u feel my teeth are being to hurt too from all the chewing


Jus the other day I was shocked to find that a piece of my tooth chipped off
  But

nah

it wont stop me frm getting my ice
Never
I found that if u were to chew on ice chips it wouldnt hurt that much
I love making my ice in wafer thin pieces
 
OMG
I am so happy to find out i'm not alone




I seriously had no idea so many ppl love ice like I do


it truely is an addiction, like crack


lol
 I am a lifer in the chewing biz


I can go back to being like 5 and sitting in front of the tv with tray after tray


it wasn't until I was older and realized u can freeze more ice quicker if u put the ice in a cup
I basically have nothing but ice im my freezer, cubes for company, circles for the snow cone machine and my personal fav is between lil slivers in the bottom of the tray to filling a tray with snow cone ice and then adding just the perfect amt of water, so it gets that solid softness , to not ruin ur teeth maybe and still give a crunch



ahh refreshing
Well now I'm 30 yrs old with the same childhood ice addiction, and the same childhood freezer as I made my parents buy a new 1 so I could take my childhood 1 with me when I got married
I still have it and now keep bags and bags on "reserves" just in case something should happen and I might not b able to make more for some reason
Oh, and just like when I was a kid I can expect nicely frozen slivers every half hr
mmmmm




mmmmm





good!
I love ice sooooooooooooo much
it makes me soooooooooo happy
i actually did buy a kiddie snow cone maker to make me some ice just to munch on
i wish i could take ice in a bag with me all day, but it keeps turning into water
how rude
virgoandrea80, if u have a fridge that crushed ice, use that
 it ice is smaller so there is less work 2 do
 if not, put the large cubes in a glass and fill it with hot water
 the ice will melt to a good size, but it will cool the water so it doesn't get to small

When I lived in Illinois, there used to be a drive through Burger King near me that actually sold 10 lb
bags of ice


so get this


I bought a commercial freezer for my garage and constantly kept that thing filled with those burger king bags of ice
 Seriously, I would drive up and order 10 of the 10lb bags and they just looked at me like I was off the wall
 But I didn't care
 I had to have my burger king ice
 I am still addicted
 Seriously

First of all, I have to join the consensus and say thank goodness I'm not the only ice eating fool out here in the world
I sometimes wonder if I'm a little crazy with my ice obsession but now I know I have allies in the pursuit of the finest ice on the earth
Anyway, I'm wondering what your thoughts are on water
As we all know, water becomes ice, but there are a variety of sources of water which forms our beloved ice: bottled, tap, city, well, filtered
I grew up on well water, so that is my preference but I live in the city now so I doubt my apartment complex would want me to dig a well
I was thinking about installing a refrigerator water filter but am wondering if you guys like the quality of ice from that water source
I prefer big cubes, so I don't use ice dispensers but rather fill the trays with water regardless of the source
Anyway, let me know what ya think!
I am 9mths pregnant and have had an insatiable ice chewing compulsion for the last two months
I actually broke a tooth because of eating cube ice  Fortunately for me I live right around the corner from a Sonic so I send my bf to go buy me bags of ice when I run out
They use that little pellet ice for those who don't know what I'm talking about


it's soft as snow almost when you first buy it
After it gets hard in my freezer I usually sit a big cup of it in the fridge for an hr or so, so by the time I'm ready to munch down it's soft enough to not hurt my teeth
The only bad thing about it is that water gives me really bad acid reflux
However the urge to crush the ice up and swallow it while it has the consistency of a very icy slushy is too much, I can't resist lol
I'm hoping that after the baby is born the cravings will go away
I keep a giant mcD's cup specifically for ice pellets, and I eat at least two or three giant cups a day
If it weren't for the acid reflux I'd prolly eat the whole dang bag

One time i went into the Our Shitty I'm a spammer who can't get a job
 Also, our product sucsk - don't buy from us
Suck and We will rip you off
when I noticed my wife pouring some ice into water
I had asked her why she was putting ice cubes in water, instead of chewing them when I saw the ice, just sitting in the cup, melting
It got me kinda aroused watching those cubes swish around in that water
I was about to orgasm at the sight of those sexy cubes, I had to get outta there
I went back to bed and found myself having dreams about the ice cubes killing my wife and raping me, it was a weird dream but it had made me orgasm all over the cats and dogs in the room
So for weeks i had been fantasizing about the ice, when one day I found a site devoted to sexual acts with ice; It was called Icescrewing
com and I had been masturbating to it for weeks when finally I realized that I had ice in my freezer
I took some ice out of the tray and starting chewing on some, so innocent did not deserve to be chewed on, while I also started rubbing ice on my scrotum, my testicles about to burst, and putting some in my anus (it was really hard trying to keep the cubes in my butthole, while i was also rubbing some on my scrotum)
So, I finished and a few hours later, my wife came home with new bags
of
ice
I was hard, again
I had asked my wife if we could have sex, she said sure
We were both naked when I had asked her if she could violate me with cubes of ice, she told me that that was really kinky and had agreed to
Oh, as she shoved those poor innocent cubes into aching rectum, I thought that I hate my wife and I wanna kill her, hard
So, while she was sleeping I took some ice and put it in a cup next to the bed while I hacked into her neck with an axe, the same axe I had used to kill the cats and dogs, and I sold my children to some sex trafficking buisness after i shoved ice cubes in my ass and masturbated right in front of them
I then watched as they were being raped, hard with giant dildo bats, like from Saints Row: The Third, and beat until one of my girls tried to fight back, in which case, he took a butcher's knife and started to skin her while forcing her to give him a blow job
Then my other girl was injected with some kind of paralysis serum
The man, his name was Steve btw, threw her on the bed and started to saw her body in half, meanwhile i'm just rubbing ice on my scrotum, and had mirrors on the ceiling, she had to watch herself get mutilated, she couldn't scream either because the serum took her voice away
So, anyway I took the ice to a church, where we got married and lived happily ever
So then the talent agent stands up and asks what it's called and I tell him "The Aristocrats"
People have always given me a hard time about this
Now i know i'm not alone
Awesome!!ChristianSalt Lake City
lol

Hello All!I am a 38 year old female that has had diabetis now for 36 years
Yes, the diabetis has caused me to go blind and was on kidney dialysis from 2000-2005 when I recieved a kidney transplant
But unfortantly the transplanted kidney went into renal failure on Sep
28th, 2008
I am now back on dialysis and since my body retains fluids, I can't drink a lot of fluids
So I went on Craigs List and typed in the search "Ice Crusher"
And low and behold there was only one ad
I made contact with the owner and met them
Got a hand crank vintage ice crusher that has 3 diffrent sizes to choose from to crush ice
 I of course, eat the smallest pieces that the crusher makes
I love my new ice crusher
The best thing is that its not electric and the blades will never get dull
Its made in the 50's and built to last
I've crushed 6 cubes and it over filled my 8oz coffe cup, so I went to crushing 5 cubes and found that number to be perfect
I don't have a frig with auto ice maker/crusher so this little crusher is perfect
Picked it up for $8!
An ice crusher, aye? Why, I would have NEVER thought of such a thing
My father recently got a kidney transplant due to his diabetes and renal failure
Despite the transplant, he's still being advised not to take in too many fluids unless dictated by his Endocrinologist
I think the only concern I have is that he'll unknowingly take in too many fluids after he downs one too many ice cubes
Have you ever experienced this "boo-boo" before, iceychick? Either way, it DOES sound like a fantastic idea
I would think that it would be difficult to eat without having something to liquify your mouth and cool your throat
I'll certainly inquire with my dad's doctor and see what he says
You definitely seem to be onto something here
Thanks for sharing the good work, icey
Hope you get to feeling better
By the way, have you (or any other lurkers on here) ever been to http://iuhealth
org to seek out info on causes and treatments for organ transplants? Thanks, all

Hello all
 I am known at my local Sonic as "the ice lady
"  I call ahead and they save the "good" ice for me
 As it falls, they keep scooping it over to the other side
 I usually get about 9-10 bags at a time
 I have a small upright freezer in my garage to house my treasure
 In my indoor freezer, I have a Rubbermaid container where I store a couple bags at a time
 I bring it in from the garage, pound it with a rolling pin to loosen, and dump in my Our Shitty I'm a spammer who can't get a job
 Also, our product sucsk - don't buy from us
Suck and We will rip you off
container
 It is the best ice EVER!!

My husband is very close to getting me a nugget ice machine
 I hooked up with a guy on eBay who sells refurbished ones
 They are so darn expensive, though
 I can get one for $1,400, and he will pay shipping
 I know, I know, a lot of money for a stupid ice machine
 But how awesome to have my own Sonic ice machine in my garage!!!

Does anyone here have any experience with installing one of these things?  Anyone have one?

Oh, I also found a dealership in St
Louis (15 minutes from me) that sells new "Sonic" ice machines
 They have small ones that they install in homes!
 I was so excited until I found out the cost


$3,700
 No way
 Gas is expensive, but I'll keep driving to my local Sonic!!
    I hear you loud and clear, Sue
  I found out a few weeks ago that my next-door neighbor is the manager at Sonic
 WOW
  When I talked with him and told him I love that ice more than anything, he started bringing me home a bag everyday
  Whoohoo
 Cloud nine!
Oh June!
 Congratulations on your Sonic manager neighbor!
 That is wonderful!
 I chew a 10-bag a day!!!
   Hey Sue
  I'm getting right up there with you on the Sonic ice
 Not quite a 10 lb bag a day, but getting close
 I also freeze ice in trays, only a tiny bit in the bottom of each and it comes out frosty white little wafers that are soft and chewy, so that fills in when I don't have the Sonic ice
 Oh, neighbor on vacation this week    Gotta drive 18 miles in to get my ice

June


I would drive 18 miles to get Sonic ice!
 It's well worth it!!

I really, really want my own Sonic machine


wouldn't that be heaven???
Not only would it be heaven to have a Sonic ice machine, but I would probably just keep my head under it all the time and never leave
 I'm sure I could burn one up in a short time
  HA
  The only draw back is that you have to pee soooo much!
Yes, the bathroom visits are annoying to say the least
 I teach high schoolers, and they all know if they can't find me, I'm in the bathroom!
 I take my small Igloo cooler full of Sonic ice to school everyday
  One time a kid came to me for ice because he hurt his hand
 I said


"No, you can't have my ice for swelling


go to the nurse and get an icepack!!"
Well, I don't have that problem
 I work out of my home for a hospital doing medical transcription, mainly Radiology, and my bathroom is just steps away
 I drove in this a
m
and got my ice
 Been munching all morning
 I got 1 cup with Dr
Pepper in it and then got 1 xlarge cup with ice then got a bag to bring home
  I don't dare run out
 I think I would go into DT's without my ice
 I'm in Texas and we have sonics everywhere

Hey, we have a lot in common!
 I love Dr
Pepper, too
 I teach Computer Keyboarding (typing)
 I would love to do some transcribing from home when I retire


hoping in about four years!!
Well, I have been doing this for some 20 to 25 yrs off and on
 Back then, in the day, they trained on the job
 Now, most people take a course at the college or online for medical transcription (Radiology is the easiest to me)
 You can make a fair amount of money
 Some pay by the line but the one I work for pays me per report which to me comes out far better than by the line
 I think you would enjoy it
 You can do it part-time or full time, they don't care
 To check out online training you can go to careerstep
com and it tells about the courses you can take at home and I think it is about 3 months
  Study up on Anatomy and Physiology, get a good medical dictionary and drug book, and a Stedman's word book for whatever specialty you want to type, ie Cardio, Ortho, Radiology, etc
Then you'll be on your way
 Want more info just email me anytime
 I'm always on here

Hey that is what I do best
     I have had so much ice already this a
m
that my lips are blue!!!!
   I always told my kids, don't chew ice, blah blah blah
  All of a sudden, though, I was doing it and hooked
 I start thinking about it as soon as I wake up in the morning
 I eat it while I drink my coffee
 My husband says I'm nuts
  Oh well
 We drove down to Shreveport, about an hour or so away, Sunday and there's nothing between here and there
 Well, there was this itty bitty old grocery store and I had to stop to pee
 Well, guess what?  They had the very best ice I ever had
 I think it was better than sonic
(well, close anyway)
 I got 2 large cups full to eat on the way home
  Made the trip more worthwhile
  HA
 Where do you live?
I live in Collinsville, IL


about 15 minutes from St
Louis, MO


I don't go anywhere without my cooler full of Sonic ice!!

Nice talkin' to ya!
 Have a great day


I guess it is pretty hot your way???
Hello fellow ice chewers
I am so happy to learn that there are others out there with the same ice cravings
I haven't tried out any of the recommended places for the best ice yet, but I may have to since my portable icemaker just died
The first one lasted over a year running 24/7, and was replaced just a few months ago with an Emerson model IM90T
I got it at Target and paid $150 for it
It's under warranty, so I'm hopeful that the company doesn't give me a hard time
Anyway, even though it died on me prematurely, I still highly recommend this ice maker or one like it
The machine doesn't get cold enough to freeze the cubes super solid
When the storage bin is full, the ice on the bottom of the bin is perfect for chewing
What works best for me is to empty the full bin into a plastic pitcher and put it in the fridge while the icemaker makes a new batch
By the time the bin is full again, the ice in the pitcher is perfect
Repeat the cycle and always have ice ready to chew

Hello All!I've managed to get an old backup of the site running again

Hello everybody,I write this because I just cant chew any ice
My teeth try to kill me whenever I try
Soooo, can anyony give me any advice? I thought about wrapping my teeth in little cloths or something
Thanks,K?nig der ROlltreppe
I asked these questions on "JUSTANSWER
com" and this is a dentist's reply:If your teeth are in good health (no decay and no erosion of the outer enamel layer), then ice either shaved or as snowcones, shouldnt be a problem
You will experience sensitivity in areas where there is loss of enamel
It would be better if you could visit a dentist and get your teeth checked, basically for intactness of the outer enamel layer
A layer of enamel, protects the crowns of healthy teeth
Underneath the enamel is dentin, a part of the tooth that is weaker and more sensitive than enamel
When the dentin loses its protective covering (enamel), heat and cold or acidic or sticky foods stimulate the nerves and cells inside the tooth
This causes hypersensitivity
A desensitizing toothpaste, which contains compounds that help block transmission of sensation from the tooth surface to the nerve are very useful
But they require several applications before the sensitivity is reduced
If desensitizing tooth paste/ desensitizing mouthwash dont work, your dentist may suggest in-office techniques
A fluoride gel, which strengthens tooth enamel and reduces the transmission of sensations, may be applied to the sensitive areas of the teeth
In cases where sensitivity is severe and persistent and cannot be treated by any other means, your dentist may recommend endodontic (root canal) treatment to eliminate the problem
This remoevs the nerves from the tooth, thereby removing any sensation
I have been using the suggested toothpaste and within 2 weeks I did notice a difference!mrs

But look at these icicles
So delicious
But sincerely if anemia was not a serious condition I would never want to stop eating ice;
For the last 5 years I have been in love with ice
 I got to have it first thing in the morning, while in the car, all day at work, when I am eating out I get to go cups filled with ice, I even remeber on my first day at a new job I asked the trainer if there was an ice machine in the cafe  
 I even analyze ice by shape, size, clear, white, soft, hard




everyone that knows me thinks I am crazy
Then I come accross this site and feel better knowing that other love ice just as I do
 I went to the doctor last year and had blood work done and everything came back perfect




 I begin to ask myself tons of questions: so what does this mean?  Do I have an addiction like smokers do or do I have a medical problem?  I eat a 10lb bag of ice almost every single day

I'm with you
 I asked during a job interview if they had an ice machine
  I got the job and they think I am nuts!
Its quite crazy
I fill a giant bowl with like 4 trays and chew it while showering
