there's something that i couldnt describe how unique and how much i love this game
 It's a sort of child-like trust towards an adult that's so innocent that you can't help but love Niko back
 We love pancakes
- I love this game, therefore this review is biased
 You can definitely tell that a lot of care and love was put into this game
 If you love Tower-Defense games, or a game that will give good entertainment or a good laugh, this is for you
 I∆d dare say this game made me actually fell in love with Muxin for the duration of the game, and several days after that, even right now as I type up this review
 Plus, I love Muxin and Muxin only, so the storylines that doesn∆t involve her‡yeah
She appeared in front of me,like a godness,She made me know, what is the feeling when you fall in love with a girl
She made me know, if you love a girl,how happy will you feel when you see her smile
Put her hand in your hand,and say"I love you"
