["The most beautiful bridge in the world.I simply love this bridge.We can cross by foot above the traffic and the River.Great view and an amazing trip.I must return", "Having been to NYC many times, there are some attractions that I don\u2019t do every time. The Brooklyn Bridge, however, is one that I always find time for.I would recommend anyone doing this to take the subway to Brooklyn (possibly early morning and stop for brunch in Brooklyn like I do) and have a wander around Brooklyn Bridge Park before crossing the bridge- this is where you get a clear view of the bridge with Manhattan set behind it.By walking from Brooklyn into the city, you have the incredible view of the city in front of you all the way across, as opposed to having your back to it and turning round every few minutes.", "This has to be one of the great, iconic bridges in the world. It was a sunny but freezing day when we walked across it from Manhattan to Brooklyn and back again. You can only marvel at the architectural triumph of the bridge and enjoy the stunning views back to Manhattan. On the Brooklyn side it is well worth walking a little further to the Brooklyn Bridge Park where you can get some breathtaking views back to Manhattan. There's also a great little cafe there to get a drink and something to eat.", "I didn't have time to walk the whole bridge, but it seemed nice. There are separate lanes for bikes and people, and the riders are very serious about not having walkers cross the line. Rude walkers who cross the line put themselves at risk. Unfortunately, the bike lane is on the side of the Manhattan Bridge, so getting a good picture of the Manhattan Bridge can be difficult.", "The park on the Brooklyn side is a great place to get pictures of the Manhattan skyline. Fun walk across the bridge, but lots of people!", "The bridge is a preferred place for bikers and walkers.. couples, street artists, elderly, teens.. you name it.. you can get there by train, the stop is Brooklyn bridge City Hall. There is food and ice cream around. And it Is a safe and police guarded place. The view.. the New York way.. beautiful as always.", "Had a hard time finding this huge bridge :). We used the subways and got off a few stops too early. It\u2019s jam packed but worth a walk. We went in the early evening - as people were finishing work - we walked from Manhattan to Brooklyn. You have to be prepared for crowds and crowds. It\u2019s hard to get a good photo at this time of the day. I did think, while walking across, that to get \u2018the photo\u2019 it would have been better to walk over a bridge either side of the Brooklyn Bridge. It\u2019s a must see though!", "Easy access and the area has coffee and other shops. Nice park area too. The Bridge has a lot of history and is definitely worth a visit on a nice day. Don't drive, walk instead.", "It will take about 90 minutes of moderate walking to cross the bridge (stopping for pictures) and return back on foot. It\u2019s a must-do experience! The walking can be crowded so be patient with all the other tourists! Obey the pedestrian/bicycle lanes for safety (and as to not cause an accident). Another iconic skyline view!!", "Catch a subway to Brooklyn and walk back towards Manhattan so as to face the best view. Takes about 40minutes to cross, taking into account frequent stops for photos and battling with the crowds. Watch out for cyclists, who seem to think that this is part of the Tour de France race. Recommended.", "The Brooklyn Heights Promenade is a must for anyone visiting the area. Popular with tourists and residents alike, it offers a spectacular vista of New York Harbor, downtown Manhattan, Governor's Island, the Brooklyn Bridge and the Brooklyn Bridge Park below. You can enter from most streets in Brooklyn Heights and there are plenty of benches.", "In the evening, particularly Spring through FallYou can walk several blocks, while in Brooklyn viewing the luxurious sights of lower ManhattanIncluding World Trade Center, Fulton Street PierJust to name a few. Go at night to see all Buildings/Landmarks across the water all Lit Up.Also view boats, ships in water. This Downtown Brooklyn area have great restaurants too, walking distance. The area is very upscale, blocks are lined with Brownstone homes. This area is easy to travel to by all transportation. This Promenade have been Filmed in many Movies. You'll be able to say, \"Ive been there before\" It's a Great Place to stare at NY and dream about conquering your goals. Enjoy!", "Brooklyn Highta is a very pleasant neighborhood with many histrionics buildings and restaurants. I strolled around here for many hours. One of the highlights is of course the amazing view of the skyline on NYC from the Promenade. Highly recommended.", "Came here on a very chilly night, but it was certainly worth it.Being a photographer, I would recommend visiting here during the evening/ night, so you can capture some great long exposure images.", "After this walk along the pier you can continue and cross the Brooklyn bridge the fall is a perfect time to walk on sunny days", "It's interesting and often doesn't occur to you that the only way to see the Manhattan skyline is from outside the city. Besides New Jersey and LIC, Queens, the Brooklyn Promanade is the best. Overlooking parts of the Brooklyn Bridge Park, it gives you a panorama from the Statue of Liberty, lower to mid town. It's amazing how you feel like you're on a movie set. With historic homes behind you, people relaxing on benches, and the skyline right up close. Sometimes it even feels like you can reach out and almost touch it. It's especially engaging from Spring to Fall.", "The view of Manhattan is stunning and worth the visit. The gardens alongside walkway are very nice. The view of brownstones and brick buildings is great !", "One of my favorite Brooklyn locations for over 40 years. Spectacular view of Manhattan and just the most senic sites. You can get lost in your own private world and have the most heartfelt conversations like your in a private garden. But when you look around you have New York City at your fingertip. The upgrades over the years make this a secret garden many people don\u2019t know about. I would highly recommend and walk over from Court Street to Montaque to see the historic homes and enjoy this special quiescental piece of Brooklyn. Once you visit you will return again.", "For many decades this was the place to go for the best views of lower Manhattan. It still is a nice viewing area to sit or stroll, but now there is the Brooklyn Bridge Park along the East River below the promenade and it has even better views. So if you are not going to explore the attractive adjoining brownstone Brooklyn Heights neighborhood, I think you should skip it and just go to the Brooklyn Bridge Park.", "I live to go and just take a moment to walk the brooklyn promenade. By day or night it is a breath of pleasure just to stare at the amazing view. Such a worth view of the skyline!", "Visited on a beautiful, sunny, October day and while there were lots of people around, it never felt crowded or noisy. Brooklyn Bridge Park is a great place to walk or to just sit, relax and take in the views. I loved the cute chairs and tables near the water. A beautiful area to see, add it to the list!", "Beautiful park great place to take photos of any kind. Close to NYC ferries as well as subways and buses. Many great restaurants in the area from pizza to breakfast. Nice little family trip or even a date. Something that will be remembered for life!", "Went for a stroll in Brooklyn bridge park and area at the end of October. Haven\u2019t been in this park for a year! Many things have changed. We were happy to find many new restaurants and eateries, new paths and roads. Really enjoyed it.", "Beautiful views, cool tire swing!Suprusingly enough, it never seems too crowded. Needless to say, it's also a beautiful area, so plenty of places to grab a bite.", "Every weekend I bring my son and daughter here to enjoy the sights. We have ice cream and walk along the piers. My son loves the basketball courts and my daughter loves to go skating and the rink. My favorite part is Jane's Carousel!! I love to ride the horses, especially at night time when the lights light up the place. This is a beautiful park and a beautiful sight to look at if you want to bring your family here for a stroll or sometime some night life.", "Scoped our the various Piers on the left side... not much ch to see. Then realized the picturesque part was to the right. Scenic walk is enjoyable, and you can catch a ferry to the city from there. Lobster roll kiosk looked promising, but I didn\u2019t try it.", "one of the most important places between Brooklyn and Manhattan. Yes it is magical in any weather. All of you of ci=ourse see this magical bridge in movies. Ok now you walk brom Manhattan side or Brooklyn side. Really doesn't matter, you will be looking on booth sides on a walkway and will take a lot of pictures bridge is not vey long about 30 minutes easy . from Brooklyn back you can take f train or after you should make walk in Brooklyn heights and Brooklyn bridge patk take train back to Manhattan from Borough Hall station its right there. Enjoy", "This is a beautiful park with some nice views. Park lawns are very well maintained, I liked sunset view. If possible try to visit at sunset time.", "Some of the best views of Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge can be had from this relatively new park (new piers have continued to be added) and the park itself is beautiful). The park was made not by the city but by a nonprofit organization funded by controversially\u200b allowing condominium construction on a portion of the land. They have done a beautiful job and the park has become a very popular destination both for tourists and locals.If you are here in the summer, Thursday evenings you can catch al fresco movie screenings on a giant screen with a backdrop of the view of Manhattan. You can reach the park by taking either the F train to the York Street station or the A or C to the High Street station.I would suggest walking back over the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan afterwards (it is better than the opposite since this way you are facing Manhattan as you walk).", "I am very happy that finally they revived this park. For years it was just there this place like they have forgotten about it. And now it is such a pleasure to walk and enjoy the views and activities. In summer time you have free shows and lots of different activities. You can barbecue or even eat an ice cream or a sandwich in the different restaurants. Highly recommend it", "The grounds of this cemetery is very well maintained. I have been here a few times for cremation ceremonies which are in a beautiful area. The entrance of the cemetery looks straight out of the movies and they offer tours.", "I love visiting the cemeteries everywhere I go. This is one of the true gems! It's huge, overlooking the beautiful city, really peaceful and has a lot of nice art and architecture. It's over 150 years old, you can tell. I regret not having enough time to walk all over,it's gigantic. I also saw the grave of Samuel Morse (yup, that's the guy that invented the Morse Code). One of the best cemeteries I've been to.", "Be sure to take the tour !!!The history surrounding this cemetery is incredible. Not too much walking, so those of you with limited mobility can still see most everything.Stunning mausoleums with surprisingly famous folks inside. Lots of insider stories as well. I was a sceptic, but not for long. Definitely worth the trip to Brooklyn.", "I\u2019ve been visiting this cemetery for decades. It\u2019s always beautifully maintained, uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time. So many emotions run through you. It\u2019s so nice to see people appreciating its lovely grounds. Historic and personal at the same time.", "Visited on a beautiful, sunny, October day and while there were lots of people around, it never felt crowded or noisy.

Highly recommend it", "Prospect Park, also designed by Frederick Olmstead, is really fantastic! Historically, this was Olmstead's favorite, and it is easy to see why! The foliage, water features, building, bike and walking paths, gardens, all gorgeous! Go and visit! You will not regret it!!!", "We stumbled on this by chance after being shocked at the price of admission to Brooklyn Botanic Garden, so refused to go. It was pretty, centrally located but peaceful. However no toilets to be found anywhere. Those that were signposted were closed. Shame.", "This was one of the weirdest museums I have visited. It felt like a art gallery with museum exhibits. Great visit for anyone who loves art or architecture as their main hall is stunning, but not worth going out of your way for otherwise. (Unless your into really creepy animal mummies- they have a lot of them!)", "This museum is a gem. Off the Manhattan charts. Centrally located and easy to get to. It's withing steps of the Brooklyn Public Library, the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens and trendy Park Slope", "I have never been disappointed here. There\u2019s enough in the permanent collection to make a visit worthwhile, but their temporary exhibitions tend to be the draw. Visiting Judy Chicago\u2019s The Dinner Party at least once should be a requirement for all. The Elizabeth Sackler Center for Feminist Art that surrounds it is provocative, strong, and contextualizing. Their free Friday night events are great community builders.", "This museum looks rather big but it's not. It's a great way to sample a little history for the whole family. It's a pay what you think it's worth, which works out to a little over $2.00 an hour, so not too bad. I went at 4 pm and got a full two hours in. Just enough to time to see a little bit of everything it offers. But go early as this area is kind of scratchy,so day times the best. Make sure you have your directions down as cabes sometimes don't know their way around either as I found out.", "Its hard to compete with the Met, MOMA, AWhitney and Guggenheim. But keep this museum on your list of things to do one day. And the neighborhood is getting quite upscale.", "Visiting grandparents, local parents, and 2 children LOVED the First Saturday evening event, featuring two good bands, beer and wine and Jamaican beef patties (to purchase), and free entrance to the galleries (because it's sponsored by Target). There were other scheduled activities too, but the BEST was a Hands on Art session for children AND adults, where we drew and glued happily with the children, then took our artwork home to tape to the fridge. The 5:30 band was family friendly; the 8:00 music was adult and VERY popular; it was great to see such a diverse group of people having a rollicking good time in a museum.", "You head down into a decommissioned subway station in Brooklyn to enter the NY transit museum - and then have the chance to walk through and sit on old subway cars (and buses) from throughout the past 100 years - including time-appropriate advertisements. Fun and informative, also has the occasional special exhibition.", "It was really a good way to kick off for summer after the school year was ended. We were there to represent Literacy Inc. The trains and tracks. bus and turnstiles are the same was except older. It was really impressive to teach my child history. Story telling by Ana was awesomely great and excited. They also have a cafeteria so lunch was good as well. Will definitely recommend.", "A somewhat dated, slightly musty underground experience that is pretty great for toddlers-preteens. There are interactive buses and exhibits just below ground for poking and steering, and down another level are all the old train cars for running and riding. Perfect for a few hours on a rainy day! In keeping with the subway authenticity, very difficult to access with a stroller- but what more could you expect from the MTA? Once inside, there's stroller parking.Pro-tip: The exhibition of old train cars goes back to the turn of the century and design nerds will love it! A hidden gem if your parents have seen all the city museums and you just want to kill some time not shopping or eating in downtown brooklyn. Can walk here easily from the Brooklyn Bridge exit.", "I learned so much in my recent visit here about how the Dutch settled Brooklyn and Manhattan, and how that history has been erased. I was very impressed by the exhibition created by Brooklyn high school students on the third floor! Be sure to check out the library; it's a treasure.", "very majestic. not the kind of place you expect to find in the middle of that section of brooklyn. great or taking pictures. i have even seen a movie being filmed on the plaza. the library at grand army plaza is amazing. also right by prospect park with all that has to offer", "A beautiful park and arch. Centrally location within steps of the Brooklyn Public Library and the Brooklyn Museum. Also a short walk from trendy Park Slope with all it's restaurants.", "This is one of the CIty's most beautiful monuments-located at the entrance to Prospect Park -and both are landmarks-created as part of the City Beautiful movement at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th Centureis-alongside the Main Public Library, the Botanic Garden, and the Brooklyn Museum its a main NYC tourist attraction"]
