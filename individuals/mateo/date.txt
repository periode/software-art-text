I enjoyed this third title quite a lot and right now it’s my favorite from the whole franchise
 Maple and Cinnamon are adorable together, and it was cute to see them both pursuing their dream
 The VN is cute as always and there’s a lot of adult scenes (which are censored in the Steam version, but you can buy the R18 patch at Denpasoft to unlock the “interesting” stuff lol)
9/10
 Even without the patch, it was cute as f*ck, I don’t care
 Worth every cent

This is the story of Marsh, the kid who played it as cool as possible until the bittersweet end
 Obviously, as an American, my study habits are different than that of a Chinese student
 Comparing Gaokao to something like the SAT test is a world of difference
 So for my playthrough of the game, I played it exactly like I do school in real life
 In the beginning, I had it all
 The girlfriend, Muxin, friends, and generally nothing to worry about except the first Simulation test, which was about 30 days away
 There were a surprisingly large amount of activities to choose from when free time was available, so I thought that the game likely wanted me to see what it had to offer
 How wrong I was
 After about 30 days of a happy, cute, almost relaxing little game of high-school antics, I screwed up on the first Simulation test
 After all, I had barely studied at all during my free time
The tone shift after messing up that test was jarring
 The music pretty much ceased altogether, except for this haunting song that played rather frequently when I would have arguments with my dissapointed parents
 Muxin wasn't the same either, as her score was rather low as well
 Marsh used to be a nice kid, after all, I was the one making his decisions for the most part
 After the arguments got more and more intense (to the point where coming home was dreaded), I was no longer able to study
 It wasn't my decision any more, it was my character, Marsh, taking the wheel
 The arguments got worse
 Marsh needed to bring up the test scores, and after talking with Muxin and deciding that the RELATIONSHIP was likely the reason for the low scores, Marsh dumped Muxin after screaming at her about his feelings
 I (the player obviously) had no say in this
 And the arguments kept getting worse
 Marsh's father eventually smacked him a few times
 The game was now very depressing
 After sleeping outside under a bridge, he finally slipped from all that I had made him
 If China wanted him to focus on the test and nothing else, it succeeded
 Marsh snapped
 Test problems became his entire life for the next 50 days
 Grades sky-rocketed, but all of the old characters were nowhere to be seen and health was declining
Eventually, after not eating for days, Marsh collapsed
 And I was given a decision after a LONG time
 Whatever I did, I picked the right thing, because Muxin, Xiaohan, and Stom saved him, and Marsh was back where he belonged
 In the end, I got a decent score and had no girlfriend
This game was an emotional rollercoaster, and it's not just an "anime game", it's WAY more than that
 I HIGHLY recommend it, and I'll be playing through it again very soon
Posted: 4 June, 2015
So basically, I paid $10 for my own biography
Over the course of the visual novel, I broke up with my girlfriend, failed all the important tests that would determine my future and became a video-game addict
 All that's missing is a sub-plot about killing tourists and burying them in the Blue Mountains

As a Chinese student who experienced "ZhongKao", the entrance exam for Chinese high schools, I had similar experience
I could still recall those days when we had endless practice tests, papers, teachers getting crazy and try to raise our score (because they get more bonus
)
 Parents getting worried on us, believing in nonsense extra classes, useless lectures even fake nutrients, is there gonna be an end
And back to GaoKao, a much more serious situation than ever (however I didn't experienced this, but I could imagine)
 How are the students doing
 Endless hell, again
 This is the truth
"You have so many chances to change your destiny, but GaoKao is the only time when your destiny gets decided
" (I played in Chinese so maybe this is not the actual translation) - Ms
 MeiI mostly care about the storyline instead of animation or style
 GaoKao
Love
100Days is reflecting the truth of a typical Chinese high school senior (with girlfriend)
 This might be one of the few games that could actually bring myself into deep meditation
 Masterpiece
Presentation: 9/10Easy to catch up, easy to play
 Although the tutorial was given in-game by his classmate which seems to be a little bit awkward, cookie let the player to speak out his name loud in the beginning of the game is quite interesting actually, especially when you put a funny name in
 Graphics: 9/10Great adapting Japanese's drawing style, however in China everyone wear stupid school uniform
 Umm I said too much
Music: 10/10The only way to judge is to listen
Gameplay: 10/10Not too complicated, not too easy
 But this game offers much more choices than a typical gal-game
Story/Background: 10/10The school, parents, the ambition, so much reality
 Can I give more than 10 points
Overall: 48/50

I've recently finished my first playthrough of this game, and was compelled to write a review
 I've played several Dating sims/Galgames, but it's never been my cup of tea, so to speak
 The whole idea felt interesting yet impractical, I didn't expect much from this game when my friend recommended it me
 This game however, is a whole another deal
Currently a college student, the feelings of being a high schooler still lingers inside, and this game has brought it all back
 Once again it hit me: the insecurities, the increasing pressure of schoolwork, the overwhelming want for some love, the struggles, and the urge to be live up to your parents' expectations, your peers' expectations, and perhaps most importantly, your own expectations
 Throughout the game there come times where it was too emotionally difficult for me to continue playing and I had to pull myself away for a minute or two
 You might be skeptical about how I can be so immersed into a seemingly simple game, and yes, I was skeptical about it afterwards
 But if there are teenage memories that you still held dear, play this game and all those will come alive again
 I’ve played countless Galgames that are simply made to give the player pleasure out of playing them
 You start the game for 30 minutes and suddenly all 25 girls in the game are devoted to you
 Of course, that is an exaggeration, but you get my point
 This game is an entirely different ballpark: it’s realistic
 Consequences come when you least expect them, and you have to work hard to pull off anything
 Sometimes there can, and will be times where you just can’t do anything about the horrible situation no matter how hard you work, and that’s just the way it is
 Yes, it is extremely frustrating and stressful, but isn’t that just like real life
Never have I in the course of only a few hours, experienced so many emotions
 I was so ecstatic and overjoyed during the good times that I caught myself smiling at the screen like an idiot several times
 But multiple times my head ached and stomach churned from stress that applied onto me through the main character’s words
 When Muxin broke up with me (Sorry, spoiler alert, but this is only one out of 50 ways that the story could go), even though it’s temporary, I couldn’t stop tears from trickling down my cheeks when all these pressure from teachers/parents/myself that I’ve been enduring was for her
 Heck, there are so many times when I said something in response to the situation, and the “me” I’m playing as in the game says the exact same thing right as I clicked through the text
 This game really digs deep inside, and I can testify to that
Of course, there are still flaws to this game
 In my opinion, I was able to be so immersed in the game because I understood Chinese
 The voice acting was spectacular (even though could be cringeworthy at times, yes I’m talking about Stom), but if you couldn’t understand what people are talking about, it really takes you away from the experience
 Also, multiple translation problems are still present in game
 From what I remember (which is not much, since I was so absorbed), the use of auxiliary verbs felt funny, even awkward to me
 For example:“Why she do that
” or “Why I need to go to school today
”Should be something like “Why would she do that
” or “Why do I need to go to school today
”
Notice without those auxiliary verbs, the meaning can change drastically
 “Why would she do that
” does not equal “Why did she do that
”
 I don’t have the Chinese manuscript so I wouldn’t know the real intention, but this is something I would like to see fixed, because without these little details, we aren’t getting the complete meaning behind each line here
In the end, this game blew me away
 I’d dare say this game made me actually fell in love with Muxin for the duration of the game, and several days after that, even right now as I type up this review
 This game definitely separates itself from the genre and stands as one of the best, if not the best
 I can’t wait to play more and see what’s to come, since I’ve heard there’s a total of 50 ways that the story could go, but I’m not sure if I want to experience the emotional trauma of preparing for Gaokao again
 Plus, I love Muxin and Muxin only, so the storylines that doesn’t involve her…yeah
 Now, because this game is so well made, I guess I’d like to recommend the game for you, whoever’s reading this
The thing is, Muxin is mine and mine only, so don’t do it
 Please

"if brought back to the past,which way would you choose
"I was ever a senior high school student in China ,same as the characters in this game, 1 year ago
i cried when i finished the game and got the end 10,the warmth of Xiaohan
Do you know
There was ever a girl in my life,a little similar to Xiaohan
 Oh,but she was not my neighbor
She appeared in front of me,like a godness,She made me know, what is the feeling when you fall in love with a girl
She made me know, if you love a girl,how happy will you feel when you see her smile
But,she also made me know, what is "pain"and what is "regret"
I lost her 
Both of us were under the control of our parents,teachers and the Chinese education systerm
And i feared being refused by her,even i knew,she wouldn't
I am a coward
I hate myself forever
Xiaohan is her,it is my first idea when i saw the Xiaohan in screen,then I made the decisions opposed to the reality
But Xiaohan isn't her
I have lost forever
Every day without she is like a book without pages
I don't know how she is now
I lost in touch with her
But I always recall her at night
 I always worry if there is a boy who will dash away her tears when she cry
 I always worry if there is a boy who wil
make her laugh when she is bored
 I always worry if there is a boy who will remind her of
dressing more when the winter comes
I really hope there is a boy besides her,who can look after her and give her happiness instead of me,though he is not me
To be honest,my English is not good
But I insist on setting down it by English,because I want you to know something
I don't know where you come from
Maybe US,UK or Australia
Millions of Chinese boys envy the freedom you have
So ,don't waste the freedom
When you see the girl sent to you by god
Put her hand in your hand,and say"I love you"
Don't be a coward like me

Positive:- # of endings (over 60
)- A relatively short dating simulator/time simulator with about 6 hours of gameplay
- Great story- Great character designs- Great music- Great characters- Lots of Achievements- Low priceCons:- The 100 days, of which you have to play through every single one, can seem long at times
- You can only do one choice/action a day (besides phone calls, changing
your helping items, etc
)- You can only increase one subject per day- The English translation was off because whoever translated it into English from Chinese did not have a strong enough grasp of English or proof readers
 It detracted from the experience and immersion a bit
 There were misspelled words, words in the wrong order, missing articles, etc
- The music drowned out the voices a bit
 (At default setting)- You can feel helpless at times going through the game (especially going trough it blind)
- Lack of default names except for one
 I would like to name my character something other than "Lee"
 And I don't know if that's his first name or last name
- Flashing bug ((The screen flashes sometimes during cutscenes))- The game affects Steam broadcasting, making it hard to live stream the game
- I can't figure out how to play the DLC Gaokao
Love
100 Days - Yes Monitress
Overall:I really enjoyed the game and thought it was lovely
 I've reached one ending at the time of writing this (Ending 39), and will definitely go back and play some more
 Another good thing is after you beat the game once you can skip read dialogue (default setting)
 I look forward to diving back into the world and
playing it through blind a few more times
 If China really has to go through Gaokao like this, then it's quite harsh
 All I have to compare it to the SAT, which doesn't hold a candle to it
Posted: 3 June, 2015
This game is exceptionally entertaining and engaging for Asians that had stressful public exams
People studying in the West may not feel that stress during the exam preparation period due to different education system , family and society conditions
The game well protrayed the what if you have a girl friend before public exam situation and the tricky thing is how do you spend your time
 All in for studying 
 All for dating
 Just like those harsh choices in real life
The game content is quite rich and consists of many endings
 It worths a lot more than 9 USD
The soundtrack ,artwork and character design is quite good
 The only thing i hate about this game is the poor CV for certain supporting characters and not all the characters got their voice
Sometimes the game crashes and i have to play all over again
 So, save the game constantly
It is a good try from Chinese developer
 Good Job
 You have set a new standard for the industry

This game made me cry, made me sad, made me depressed, and made me happy
 This game is such a feel twister and mood twister
 This game will make you tear and happy at times
 This game is great, this was the best 10$ I spent on steam so far
 This game has so many endings and routes to take that it never gets old
 If you're looking for a game to keep you hooked this game is for you, just do me a favor
 Don't cry waterfalls like I did
 *Sigh*
Posted: 7 September, 2015
First, I'd just like to say that this game makes me really thankful that I didn't grow up in China
 Gaokao seems like the SATs put on steroids
 Anyway, I have so far completed 12 endings out of the 57 (
) in the game, in 40 hours of gameplay
 As a result, I definitely recommend this game to people who are looking for a game that will take a long time to complete, and will provide many hours of entertainment
 The storyline in the game is absolutely amazing, and so is the character developments of Muxin and Xiaohan
 There are quite a few translation errors in this game, so I wouldn't recommend it for those who care so much about grammar
 Completing all the routes in this game will take a lot of help from game guides, and the only really good one is pretty vague in its descriptions
 If you're looking for a story-rich game that will give many hours of entertainment, or even if you just want to complete only a few routes, I would definitely recommend this game

After a little tinkering got R18 version up and running, so i will spend holidays shagging drawn virtual anthropomorphic cats, and only God can judge me
Now let's get serious
 If you're on this game's store page, you already know what you're looking for
 If by mistake you stumbled upon this and don't know what to do, i will explain:1)This is an eroge, which means it's a picture book with music and drawn porn disguised as a game, where you "play" as self-insert main dude and swim in pussie
2)Steam version have porn removed
 Apparently game about having your own bakery with harem of submissive catgirls made by hentai artist is also suitable for children, so god forbid they see any adult content
3)With a clever use of hands and internet you can still enable it4)There's a slider that regulates how bouncy boobs can be: from "british royal guard" to "screw physics, full Gainax" mode
5)There's 3 languages avaliable: english and two types of extraterrestial doodles
6)You get Steam achiviements if you play it with extraterrestial doodles
7)Art looks good if you're a fan of generic anniemays
8)Actually animated
9)In Russia it's possible to end up doing time for playing this
10)Music is upbeat and voice acting is
 ugh
11)There's also apparently some kind of story
12)Stuff like this stops me from reading serious vns
13)There's nothing wrong and shameful in playing this
14)Really
If you ask me why should you buy something like this on Steam - hell if i know
 I have no idea why its here in the first place
 I will, hovewer, give this game 100 boob bounces out of 100
Posted: 3 January, 2015
The only game on Steam that has a "Chest Bounciness" slider in the options menu
Absolutely revolutionary

I'm gonna start saying that I bought Lucy just for the sake of buy something and 3 months went away before I decided to finally play it
 Now that I've finished the game I can safely say that I want to punch myself in the face for not playing this earlier because Lucy ended being one of my favorite Visual Novels, this is coming from someone who has read a whole lot of them
Okay so, what's Lucy about
 Trying to not spoil anything (because the story is the main focus of this VN), the game is set in a distant future where Androids are a normal thing to have in every house mostly to help in household chores, you are a 18 year old boy that the game refers as to "You" (yes for 99% of the game we don't know the Main Protagonist name, but luckily that's not a problem because the game is written in a way that the MC's name isn't important until the very very end) who absolutely hates those Androids for reasons that the game eventually explains, one day coming back from school you decide to cross a junkyard to save some time and you find an Android on the middle of this junkyard that was going to be destroyed in a matter of minutes if you don't "save" it, obviously you saved it because reasons and repair it, this Android who calls herself Lucy Valentine ends up being one if not the most advanced Android ever created who can mimick a person even better than a real person, with this premise we start to live our daily lifes with Lucy at our side who suddenly changes everything on it
The game starts slow by creating the scenario that will make the reader eventually ask himself questions like "Does a machine can ever have feelings
", "Does her feelings are even real
", "Do androids are really inferior to humans
", "It even matters if she is an android or a human
"
 What comes next is a story about morale and ethics, a story that made me feel anger to some characters, sadness as to what was happening and nerviousness to think what could possibly happen next, and at the end of everything when I finally reached the ending (which the game has two) it gave me a plot twist that no way in hell I was expecting that made me cry so much but also made me incredibly happy
The fact that this 5 hour visual novel made me feel the things that I mentioned in the last paragraph when I didn't have a single expectations when I first started the game is the reason why I 100% recommend this game at full price if you are both interested in starting in the world of Visual Novels or if you are already a veteran
To end this review I want to mention that I usually don't make reviews like this but after finishing the game I had the urge to write one as a thanks to the developers for making this game
Posted: 7 October
-Spoiler Free-I started out really disliking this Visual Novel
 As someone who has played many, many Visual Novels over the past few years, several things really stood out to me as incredibly irritating about this one
 On the surface, this visual novel gets everything right that most VNs can't, and gets everything wrong that even nukiges manage to do decently
Until you get towards the end, that is
The protagonist comes off as an angsty, brooding teenager that is incapable of any kind of reasonable decision making or conflict-resolution
 This isn't the case

Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- developed by Modern Visual Arts Laboratory or "Mvizlab" in short and published by Modern Visual Arts Laboratory themselves they are an indie game development team made in Korea and is very new but to my surprise their first visual novel is surprisingly good I was not expecting this quality at all
 In Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- players are given choices to make in the game and depending on your choices it will change the outcome of the story
 It features 2 or 3 endings
 1 of them being a Bad end and the other being a Good end
 Relevant links will be can be found below
The StoryLucy ~The eternity she wished for~ is a Visual Novel, about a boy and an android
 You play as the boy, who faces decisions and moral dilemmas that he struggles constantly in this near-future world
In the near future, androids have become the way of the norm they can be found everywhere in human daily lives
 Emotionless husks of metal have become a part of human society, much to the dismay of the boy because he had always preferred the "old methods"
 The robot he found at the dump site though, this one was different
 It laughed, it cried, it smiled, just like a human… It has emotions
Audio and Visual elementsBackground, CGs
art – Backgrounds are generally average nothing too fancy to talk about the background art, but as for the CGs I felt it is a little wasted not saying that it is bad in anyway but the CGs they tend to use glares to cover up the background which makes it bright which is good, but at the same time taking away the atmosphere that it could have been created with backgrounds to add more to the game as a whole
 Something which caught my attention is that the UI or menu is very beautifully done I love the direction off the VN that it makes the menu and UI looks very realistic which contributes greatly to the overall atmosphere
Audio Elements – Nothing really stand out for the audio elements except for the fact that it cues in nicely and properly to fit in with the mood of the characters in turn manages to set the atmosphere perfectly every time
 There is also voice acting for Lucy available both in Korean and Japanese voice
To sum upTo sum up will I recommend Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- 
 Simple answer yes, it is well worth your time and money for sure and for people who likes a sad story or maybe Sci-Fi be sure to get this game

The steady advance of technological progress has brought us many unforeseen challenges
 With robotics and AI slowly but surely encroaching on what we used to think of as uniquely human, we are confronted with the question of what makes us so special and on what basis we deem ourselves superior to the intelligent beings we create
 Take this cerebral topic and intermingle it with some comedy, drama and romance, and what you get is one of the most promising indie VN releases of the year
Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- is a short visual novel developed and published by Modern Visual Arts Laboratory
 Set in a mostly contemporary world where robots and AI are ubiquitous and have almost reached the point where they are difficult to distinguish from humans, it tells the story of how a prototype android upsets the fickle balance in a conservative family critical of such technology
 A chance encounter has the teenaged main character take "Lucy" from the junkyard, pitting her exuberance against his cynicism and ensuring comedy hijinks as well as drama and tragedy
 While his struggles to integrate Lucy into his daily life play out on one timeline, the story intersperses snippets from the android research laboratory about the man (referred to as "Doctor") who pours all of his energy into assembling Lucy and protecting her from government interference, leaving the reader to hypothesize early on about how Lucy ended up at the junkyard
In terms of visual novel mechanics, Lucy packs few surprises
 The above average amount of choices packed into its three to five hour main story leads to many of them feeling a bit railroad-y, even though there are multiple endings to be conquered
 The visual presentation is crisp and polished, the backgrounds and CGs are of a high quality
 While there is nothing wrong with any one character sprite by itself, at times their visual styles are noticeably different, which can make scenes look incoherent (some more than others)
 The soundtrack is fitting but not particularly memorable
 Korean and Japanese voiceovers are provided
 The lack of multiplatform support (the VN is available for Windows only) is regrettable
 Something that is definitely worth pointing out is the absurd amount of post-game content and alternate endings that bumped my own reading time from just three hours all the way up to five – I am a quick reader though, and looking at the reviews, playtimes of anywhere between 7 to 10 hours seem within the norm
 The post-game content also provided the story with some much-needed rounding out, so you will most definitely want to keep reading after the credits roll for the first time
Thematically the VN attempts to cover a lot of ground
 At face value there is the "cute robot girl" story, which would have been easy to turn into clichéd "fated love" schlock, but thankfully the story stays very light on the romance elements and delivers its tender budding affection so subtly that you could almost miss it
 Lucy's character itself is less immune to clichés, seeing as she is rooted firmly in the "clumsy, ditzy, caring but naive" tradition of robot girls, and her characterization is at least consistent and believable even if it's not innovative
 Most of the situational humor falls in line with what you would expect from this part of anime culture, with Lucy being oblivious of her surroundings and the main character having to clean up behind her
More interestingly, the story also makes a more than solid effort at tackling the philosophical questions that arise when robots become almost indistinguishable from humans
 For example, part of the story's tension is derived from the question of what grants one's identity if memories as well as body parts can be replicated and replaced as needed (the Ship of Theseus is even mentioned by name)
 As a narrative theme, the idea of artificially created humans has a long literary tradition
 VN aficionados will of course tend to notice the many parallels to planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~, both overt and more abstract, but in the broader cultural world the concept dates back at least to the story of Pygmalion and Galatea of Ancient Greece and the golem from Jewish folklore, and has had one of its major spotlight moments in the form of Shelley's Frankenstein, which Lucy's story also reflects in many ways
 Now, like then, the question is posed what it is that supposedly makes us humans more deserving of a self-determined life than the ones we create as our servants
 The VN is not shy about exploring these questions even at the expense of subverting its own characters (such as when the protagonist shows a
knowledge of Schopenhauer uncharacteristic for a teenager who claims to have no interest in formal education)
Another topic that Lucy tackles is the question of labor automation
 Androids capable of sophisticated reasoning are pushing humans out of the workforce because electricity is much cheaper than minimum wage
 In the world of the VN, this seems to be just as much of an open question still as it is in ours
 This topic manifests itself very clearly in the character of the protagonist's father, who I suspect is hostile to the point of belligerence towards androids because he identifies so deeply with his work and considers his role as a productive employee the central aspect of his own sense of purpose
For all its interesting thematic points, there are also aspects of Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- that I had to grapple with, the biggest one being the general unlikability of the main character
 A lot of this can be explained away by his age and familial situation, but with as many external sources of tension as the story possesses, I wish they had relied less on the protagonist's egotism and carelessness as a source of drama, since it tends to strain the immersion
 In terms of minor nitpicks, I didn't care for how the screen showing Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics was used as a scene transition, since clicking through it every time quickly became tedious
Overall, Lucy is a very well-written story that profits especially from the aforementioned post-game content
 Even though this review is, as always, as free of spoilers as I can manage, I absolutely cannot avoid highlighting the brilliance of the final reveal during the true ending that astonishingly weaves everything together and tempts the reader to start the story over again right away
 It's just one moment out of many, but I appreciate the careful construction of the story leading up to it immensely
Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- stands on the shoulders of giants and it knows it
 Its themes have been explored in other works before and the VN has references aplenty
 However, it is still a worthwhile story on its own that is sharp and polished and has everything a good visual novel would need
 If you absolutely cannot stand ditzy anime girls, this may be too much to stomach, but if you're up for a cutesy tale about existentialism and sociotechnical progress, you can't go wrong here
Posted: 28 February, 2016
Straight to the point:Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- is definitely a Visual Novel worth experiencing
Simply stated:Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- is a thought provoking and emotional tale
The art is lovely and gives the characters life in the story
The music of the soundtrack is spot on,
both provoking and enhancing the experience
Production values are high and quality immediately apparent
What it's about:A coming of age story for a young man almost completely at odds with his world and his relationship with Lucy, an android he came to know by chance
Through his eyes we examine the role of technology in human society and effects upon that society
Through his experiences, we question aspects of "nature vs
 nurture" with regard to individual beliefs
Within the experiences surrounding his fateful discovery, we question what it is that makes a human "real"
From his experiences, we question values, what is love and what it is to love
My impression:One will smile, laugh, scowl, grimace and possibly cry during the course of the tale
The overall atmosphere of the story has elements reminiscent of Planetarian and Narcissu, while the story touches issues in a manner that reminds me of scifi films A
I and Bicentennial Man
The tales journey, as with life, is not always an easy one, but is worth the effort
Judgement:Recommended
Notes:
1- In addition to Steam, I have 10 hrs of play on my Playism copy
2- My review was made after achieving a couple ends prior to finding the True End
 Having now finished the True End (11
5 hrs in), like I said initially, this is a Visual Novel worth experiencing
3- With achievements and
extras to unlock, replay value is also good with this lovely work
Ahhh, the smiles

TL;DR - Buy this
 You won't regret it
 [Don't read if you don't like UI related spoilers]I've never been a fan of visual novels
 None of them managed to hold me long enough to make it to the end
 Then came along Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For-This game showed up in my recommendations list one day and I saw the "Overwhelmingly Positive" response
 Then I started reading the reviews and thought, can a visual novel really make that big an impact
 So I decided to pick it up and try for myself
The story started out strong but then started to drag and I started feeling bored
 I dropped the game about 3 hours of playing (spread over 2 days)
 4 days later I came back because I really wanted to see what the fuss was all about
Then the ending came along and the credits rolled and it didn't have that much of an impact on me
 Once the credits finished and the main menu showed up, there were some jumbled letters instead of the "Start" button
 I thought it a bug and restarted the game, but they were still jumbled
 So I clicked on them
Then the REAL ending played
 And boy-oh-boy did I gush like a baby at the impact this sequence had on me
 I buried my face in my pillow and cried until I could cry no more
I've not been hit so hard by emotions for a long time and I thank the developers for bringing such an experience

Beautiful StorylineBeautiful SoundtracksBeautiful ScenesA true masterpiece
10/10
Posted: 3 March, 2016
Funny, Heart Warming, Gut Wrenching, Sadness, Anger , thought provoking and REAL are all things I felt or thought when reading this Visual Novel
As someone who has read many visual novels , graphic novels and comics, this is one of the finest things I have ever read
 PERIOD
I laughed, I cried tears of sadness, tears of joy,
I bit my tongue in anger, Questioned what defines life truly and most importantly I was touched inside and began to question some of my own demons in my life
 I will say that the people who wrote this were not your run of the mill writers, but were both very articulate and intelligent
 I won't state my reason for believing this due to possible spoilers but I must say they certainly must have pondered the very topic of this Visual Novel themselves, such as
using
Asimov ((who is one of my favorite writers)), and a few other thinkers and writers as an inspiration as well
Now I will get to the pros and cons
Pros
Great Artwork
 9/10Good Mood setting music
 7/10Not a lot of Characters but the ones in the Game are meaningful and all are key to the entire plot
 Quality over Quanity
 10/10Main Protaginist Feels very real, as do his supporting cast
 10/10Plot Twist with true ending that was very emotional and well done ((not to mention the very meaningful and Emotional Epilogues too)) Thought provoking, morally and spritually
Good Customer support after I had issues starting the Application
No forced romance , friendships or plot, things developed in time and all are meaningful when they do
Cons
Had an error starting the game, but that has been fixed
Predictible in some ways to a veteran of visual novels of what the "right choices" are to get the true ending
Wish the game went on longer just because I got attached to the characters ((not really a con just me whining it had to end
 :( ))Would I recommend Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For
 Yes, but see Below
I would recommend it for those who are looking for a thought provoking, emotional roller coaster of a visual novel, But for those that want a visual novel with the main plot being sex, or nudity
look elsewhere this one isn't for you
Once again thank you for taking the time to read my poorly written review but I can not express enough of how impressed I was with this little Visual Novel
I would like to say excellent work to the team that put this together and made it all possible as well
Kind regards

I'm not crying, you're crying
 
 
 
 SHUT UP
In all seriousness, if you like a touching story (and can forgive a little over-the-top melodrama), give Lucy a chance
I got it on sale, and it was well worth the $5
 Nice production values including gorgeous sprites, beautiful (and plentiful) CGs, some voice over work (Lucy is the only one with VOs, albeit not in English) and excellent sound design
Has in game achievements as well, though they aren't actual Steam achievements
Posted: 7 April, 2016
Never has any piece of media made me experience so many emotions in such a short span of time
 I went from mildly interested, to completely invested in virtually no time since the writing in this VN was so spectacular
Then, once Lucy had her claws in me, the feels trip didn't stop
 I flew between the emotions of happiness, anger, and sadness faster than I even knew I could
Then, when I finally achieved the true ending, I couldn't have been more satisfied
 And just as a side note, I will never forgive that prick of a father

What I learned
Cats sleep a lot
Our Earth is pretty old
Buying a bong for a drug addict is romantic
Giving fairly racist items to the appropriate race is "sexy"
Asking for a person's cup size makes them attracted to you
Fairies are real
Oranges cost $600
Being asked "What the hell are you playing
" is normal
I love it

CLANNAD is one of the most well-regarded visual novels in the world, boasting an epic 80-120 hours of content; about twice the size of the Lord of the Rings trilogy
 It starts off at a very slow pace with lots of light-hearted comedy, but once you begin getting involved with each of the characters' individual conflicts, the story ramps up into some gripping emotional storytelling, sometimes sprinkled with a tinge of supernatural intrigue
 The character routes are very worthwhile in their own right, but the true value of CLANNAD is to be found in its final route: After Story
 It doesn't matter how emotionally hardened you think you are; After Story will hit you like a sledgehammer with its relentless emotional impact, and you won't come out unscathed
So, yeah, CLANNAD is kinda cool
 Changed my life / 10
You can read my full review at Kazamatsuri below:http://kazamatsuri
org/clannad-review/ 
Posted: 29 May
When I first looked at this game, I thought "Typical anime high school girl nonsense"
 How wrong I was
 What I found was far and away the most engaging and heartfelt story I have ever experienced
 I absolutely love Clannad and cannot recommend it highly enough
Clannad is a visual novel originally released in Japan in 2004
 Voices were added in a 2008 rerelease
 In 2015 it was given an official English release
 It is regarded by the visual novel community as a paragon of the genre and one of the greatest ever
Clannad has several different plotlines which can be read in almost any order
 These plotlines are mostly love stories
 The content and quality of these are what make Clannad a legend
 Rather than pander to sexual fantasies, Clannad's stories aim straight at the reader's heart
 Some of these hit really close to home for me
 At multiple points, I had to stop reading for a few minutes to collect myself before I could continue
 Some were so good that I had to go back and reread them again just a couple of days later
If you complete Clannad, you will cry at least once
 Accept this going in
 If someone tells you they completed it without crying, they're a liar
If you're still on the fence, then consider that I was once in your position
 I was unsure of if I should even give this game a shot
 I took the chance based on word of mouth
 Now here I am gushing over it
 One of the best works of fiction I have ever experienced

Posted: 27 December, 2015
Simply put, if you aren't in tears after playing this visual novel,
you're not human
Clannad is the best visual novel of all time, a roller-coaster ride of emotions that will change your life
The popular question of, "Is it really worth $50
"
Yes, in fact, it is worth infinitely more
 You can't monetize a life changing experience, and playing through Clannad will provide exactly that
Posted: 23 November, 2015
Finally, the wait is over
 After a year of anticipation and throwing almost all my money at the Kickstarter campaign, our beloved Clannad is here
 All you VN lovers should already know that Clannad is a universally-acclaimed masterpiece
 But for those who don't know much (or anything) about it, know this: it's one hell of a rollercoaster ride
 Clannad will have you laughing, crying, happy, angry, and a whole slew of other emotions
 In fact, Clannad (both the anime series and the VN) is the only story that has truly made me empathize with the characters and relate to it in my own life
 I dare say it to be a life-changing experience if you open your heart
While Clannad is almost always described as a romance game, there is so much more than that
 While there is a lot of romantic material, Clannad offers an endless ocean of life lessons around family, friends, overcoming hardship, making excruciating decisions, dealing with change, and much more
 Clannad really made me take a deep look into my own life and helped me overcome many personal barriers relating to my own family and friends
 It has positively influenced my outlook in many areas of my life and I will forever be grateful for it
Even if you don't think you would enjoy it much, do yourself a favor and pick it up
 And if you already previously played it, buy it on Steam
 Compared to the original Full Voice version, it has so many new enhancements that warrant playing it again (as if the story alone wasn't enough
)
 The HD assets, Steam achievements, and Dangopedia are all big bonuses to me
 The only things missing are trading cards and emoticons
And lastly, join the Clannad steam group for all your Clannad needs
 We're active and very friendly and love discussing all things Clannad (as well as other games, anime, etc
)
 You could say we're Steam's very own Big Dango Family
 Also, if you ever want to talk about Clannad, feel free to friend/message me

Great game, very high quality and the most important part - fluffy eared girls
+Visuals - beautiful animated
 girls, plenty of various dresses and my favorite type of eye coloring <3
+Soundwork: Amazing OST, everyone fully voiced
 great seiyuu work and other sounds are nice too
+Gameplay: This novel is huge, seriously multiple routes for 4 different girls, each long AF
 But all the current game problems are hidden here:1-No language except Chinese or Japanese
 (well it's been said that English translation is coming as soon as possible), you can try to use an atlas or some kind of that
2-No Rx content at all (Srsly this game is full of ecchi scenes, but all of them cut, and there is no available patch yet, which could be paid addition :\ )+Cool steam cards
-No steam achievements - yet

It's like Nekopara Vol

And then you experience this and all the worries in the world become silent

(Acutal Review BELOW)Showed my parent some gameplay
Dad is proud of me
 Mom is not letting me come closer to my little sisters and the cats anymore
10/10 - would make dad proud again
UPDATE: My dad increased my allowance after i patched the game
11/10 - would make mom love me again
Edit: Since most of you want an actual review, I'll give you one
 I'm not a professional reviewer or anything, just a simple closet weeb :^)Nekopara is a VN that sets apart other VN on steam, due to it's animation mostly
 To me, Nekopara is a nukige because the plots are pretty decent, but the H-scene are what we are here for
 So lets break it down part by part
CG/Graphic - This is what makes this game a bit different than other VNs
 You don't see many VNs that animates the sprites during conversation, let you pet them and make their "coconuts" bounce
 I also love the E-MOTES system in Nekopara
 The backgrounds and the colours are really lively and heartwarming in a way
 So it's a plus in my book
Plot - If you like the plot from Nekopara Vol
 1, you should be fine with this plot but it's a bit shorter
 One thing I find lacking in Nekopara are the plot
 I understand making a harem + ecchi plot can be difficult because there's a ALOT of VNs out there have the same genre with the same-kind plot
 My kind of plot that is to my likings are the Clannad, Grisaia type of plot etc, where they have proper routes and different ending
 I think Nekopara is the nukige kind of plot c: 
 Anyway, I'm pretty sure you guys bought it for the "plot" am I right
Voice/Music - I'm the type of person who will go on youtube and search "Anime OST that will make you cry" while reading his manga
 Yes, I think OST/background songs plays an important role to VNs
 This is because the purpose for OST is to make the VNs to be alive, make you want to be part of the story
 And Nekopara OST are pretty good
 Not gonna lie, I like some of the OST from this game
 The voice actor are all great and lovely, if you play Imouto Paradise or any loli VNs, you should be okay with some of the high pitch voice (Some of my friends don't like high pitch loli voice lol)H-Scene - All scenes are fap-licious c: You got to thanks Neko Works for making this game and releasing the patch straight after the game launchs
 Animated H-Scene are my kind of game, like Ultimate Boobs War
 I know some of you will get the patch without paying, but if possible do continue to SUPPORT the content creator <3Overall -
I have no complains for this game
 Just another VNs added to my collection
 I enjoy the VNs especially the H-Scene :^)

The devs would have you believe you play this game by buying it and launching it and clicking your way through a cute and sometimes racey story about a guy who can't get a bunch of cat-human hybrid girls to leave him alone
 Here's the real way to play:STEP 1: Buy the game
 STEP 2: Download and install the 18+ patch from somewhere reliable
STEP 3: If you live with your parents, lock your bedroom door
STEP 4: Get a big wad of toilet paper or a box of kleenex
 You'll need more than you think
STEP 5: Boot up the game, speed through it but read just enough story to know what's happening when you eventually reach the H-Scenes
STEP 6: Beat the Bishop, Polish your Mustang, Manage the Glue Factory, etc
STEP 7: Sit there like the pathetic waste of matter that you are, droplets of baby batter running down your stomach
STEP 8: Regret everything, put in a refund request for the game
STEP 9: Try to rekindle a relationship with a past love interest IRL and fail miserablySTEP 10: Out of frustration, flirt with multiple girls who remind you of the original one
 STEP 11: Ruin your reputation with any and all females you were friends with
STEP 12: Go home and feel bad for yourself
STEP 13: Go on Steam and see Nekopara on the front page
STEP 14: Repeat from Step 1

Nekopara is the story of a dude that runs away to open up a cake shop using his rich parents' money
 Two "catgirls" sneak their way into the luggage and surprise their owner in a "we're too far from home so you can't get rid of us" way
In the first part, you take advantage of legalized slavery to get Chocola and Vanilla to dress up as cute maids, which brings a lot of creeps and virgins customers to the shop
 It's pretty obvious that you wouldn't have any customers without them, yet you find the MC constantly complaining about them

Nekopara Vol
 0 is the prequel to the events that occur in Nekopara Vol
 1
StoryThe story is pretty much outlined in the description on the steam store
"The eldest daughter of the Minaduki household and their 6 catgirls go to wake up their master; prepare breakfast; clean up the house; go out on a walk; make dinner; take a bath; sleep together; et cetera, et cetera
 "Sadly it outlines the majority of what this visual novel has to offer, which can be a bit of a spoiler, but the interactions and personality of the catgirls does offer some light comedy
 Their differing personalities, as well as their curuiosity, does lead to them to sometimes being more troublesome than helpful
 This being said, the visual novel is a bit short, and can be fully read in about 30 to 50 minutes, depending on your reading speed
Notable features-As you all may have noticed, there is a hand on the top right of the screen while playing the game, pressing it engages in a petting "minigame"
 This minigame pauses the game's dialogue, allowing you to pet the characters on screen
 This is not limited to the catgirls, you can even pet shigure
 The petting feature goes a bit further, making the characters react differently; based on where you choose to pet them
-Trading cards with more cute backgrounds and emoticons
-Artwork is similar to that of its predecessor, having some scenes played out in their adorable chibi form, and many other scenes in their normal form
 Art is a bit more lewd, as it has a shower scene with shigure as well as the catgirls
(use your imagination)Verdict 7/10At the time of this review, there is a small typo, in which Maple asks Coconut if she is sure she can finish all the food she wanted, but refers to her as cinnamon

Posted: 7 June
A game that revolves heavily on the fact that the player either owns a cat, a sister, or a computer
 The second reliance is upon the player to be the kind of person that would willingly purchase a VN, on steam, and remain completely unashamed playing it for all his friends on his roster to see
 As a man that makes his own money and uses that to build a $700 PC, I can say that somehow I fit into one of the previously stated categories
 The core of the VN surrounds several catgirls going through an entire day without their master/owner
 Much like real cats they tend to be complete dumb-asses that make a mess and fight causing you to watch their shenanigans as well as their breasts bounce around the screen significant something; possibly violence, maybe sexual perversion brought about from Hiroshima and Nagasaki
You, the player are not the master; even though at certain parts you see though his eyes
 No, you are a disembodied spirit the stalks the girls around their house and town respectively
 During certain parts you can use your ghost powers to pat these girls on their head, poke their bellies and grab their boobs
 Similar to real life these girls react positively to being fondled, but unlike real life they never sit you down in an interrogation room, show you the video of you fondling a girl and force you to sign a mutual release because you didn't know she had a boyfriend and that man was a lieutenant for the state police

Emily is Away Too is the sequel to Emily is Away
The first game, which was free to play, was absolutely fantastic, especially because of its finale:
no matter what you felt or what you wanted to do, your choices would always bring the same conclusion of you unable to say to Emily that you wanted to be more than friends, and her spending the summer with her boyfriend
 But that was not because of "lazyness" by the developer: it was intentional, and in fact, towards the end of the game,
even if you try expressing your feelings your character would delete what you wanted to say replacing the messages with generic questions
 In my opinion, the intention was to deliver the message that
sometimes in life, especially when dealing with relationships with other people, there is simply nothing you can do except accepting other people's choices and move on
It was a very powerful ending that left me thinking about it for days after finishing the game, even if it was a short experience
Unfortunately, while playing this game I did not feel the same, powerful emotions that I did with the first one
 This is because the game features several different endings, this time with two girls instead of just Emily, which isn't a bad thing per se, but it contrasts with the power of the message of the first one
 Moreover, here
you can actually achieve not one, but several "good" endings
I liked the integration with your desktop and browser, plus the many different references to artists, TV shows and movies from 10 years ago
There are still some "twists" present here, and if you make certain choices you will encounter situations similar to what you do in the first game, but as I said, I feel that they are not as effective as the original game
That does not mean this is a bad game by any means: I would still recommend it, especially for its low price, but make sure to download and play the previous one first
 It's free, too

Posted: 10 June
Despite it’s flaws and simplicity, the original ‘Emily Is Away’ managed to capture a poignant snapshot of youth navigating relationships throughout the transition from high school to college, set entirely within a lovingly recreated AOL-like messenger system
 It not only ignited imagination and nostalgia, but allowed itself to tell an emotionally engaging story in very low-tech yet aesthetic means
 Through a storyline that’s arguably simple and cliche, the novel method of storytelling is able to shine, employing creative devices relevant to it’s context; the use of typing indicators to create suspense and convey hesitation, the occasional forced re-wording of idealistic dialogue choices which protagonist finds himself unable to go through with once it comes to hitting ‘send’, the difference between Emily or the protagonist being the first to initiate a conversation
Posted: 25 June
Possibly one of the best western visual novels I’ve played so far, even tho I didn’t liked the ending too much
 I’m going to be honest, at first I thought it was going to be an okay title with pretty art, but ACE Academy is actually really good
 And one of the keys of success is the MC: he’s funny, kind of a jerk sometimes, can be a sweetheart… I loved him
 It’s a slice of life with mecha action
 I was interested more because of the giant robots at first, but the comedy and character interaction were surprisingly good
 There’s a lot of mentions of other famous games (such as Persona 4), the amount of choices and the way that they change the story is awesome, and the voice acting is great
 All VAs did an excellent job on this game, seriously
 About the routes, I enjoyed Kaori’s a lot
 I’m not so fond of the “tsundere” type and yet I liked that character a lot
 Her voice fitted her so well that I think that’s one of the reasons why I liked Kaori: the girl is stubborn as hell, but you can feel that deep down she does have a good heart, and she’s not simply grumpy for no reason
 Also, I liked Mayu
 (Yes, the madwoman
 Yandere is my guilty pleasure, I’m sorry
 lol9/10
 If you want a good and light comedy to read, you’ll enjoy this VN
 But if you don’t like games with “no closure” or with cliffhangers, you might get annoyed
 But honestly, the character interaction and the scenarios are so good and enjoyable that I feel like “forgiving” the ending
 I really hope that there will be a sequel someday

Early Access Review
Do I recommend it, even though this is only the first episode
 Yes I do
The scores below are from 1 to 10, 1 being terrible, 5 being average and 10 being excellent
 I am confident in this Visual Novel and I think it can be one of the best Western Visual Novels
 Keep in mind that the scale I am using is the same that I use to evaluate japanese visual novels (like Grisaia no Kajitsu):Story: Not rated at the moment (episode 1)Since this is only the first episode and was pretty much about introductions (and there's still another girl to be introduced in the next episode), I can't rate the story
 My personal thoughts are that this is going to be a straightforward comedy slice of life romantic visual novel, so I don't expect any serious developments or mind blows
There's not really much I can say about writing
 It focuses on the dialogue and the protag thoughts, and doesn't waste time in detailing objects/sceneries
 It's an easy to read writing and direct to the point
There are some references and easter eggs
 One of the best scenes in this visual novel is a small battle between the MC, Kaori and a Tech Gosu
 Their battle is a little parody between Android, Apple and Microsoft
 Another is when choosing a movie, you get to choose a movie of a list of movies that all are based off real movies, and the characters leave their comment on it
Visuals: 7The backgrounds are just too good
 The artist makes such a good job of using lightning to give more life to the backgrounds
The characters also look good in my opinion
 The big drawback here is that, probably due to financial limits, secondary characters don't have fully drawn sprites
 Meaning that their sprites are just black figures
Gameplay: 9This visual novel, just like many others, is about making choices
 Difference is that this one has tons of choices that drastically change the story, while the others only have a few
 If you need a comparison, compare it to Walking Dead videogame from Telltalles games
 Some choices only change a few lines, while others change a lot of what happens
 For example, earlier in the game, you can choose to go to school by bus or with the bike
 Depending on what you choose, it will change what characters you meet first and what will happen in the next day
 Not only that, but if you decide to be an A hole with someone, that someone will remember it later and act accordingly
There's also the rollback feature
 Rollback is the feature that allows you to rollback to your previous choice and choose another option
 In this VN, you are asked in the begginning if you want to disable it
 If you do, you will get achievements and "other possible goodies"
You can also name your protagonist and choose his background trait: athletic, intelligent and intuitive
 If you choose to be athletic, you will have no problem carrying luggage, if you choose to be intelligent, other characters might ask for your help with the studies, etc
 This also sometimes highlights the best options in some choices, for example, if the teacher asks a question, the correct answer will be highlighted if you chose the intelligent trait
This visual novel also features mini games
 In the first episode, there are two type of mini games, if there will be more or not in the future I don't know
 One is a simple press the right combination of 5 buttons scattered around the screen
 In this episode, it appears only once to callibrate the MC's mech
 To be honest that minigame feels unnecessary (especially because your penalty for failing is just repeating the mini game), however one of the devs said that he plans to use it again later, so I assume that this one can serve as a tutorial kind of thing
The other mini game is the combat
 I am pleased that they improved it a lot since the alpha
 Now it's a lot better and it feels like I am actually doing some damage
 This mini game is simple: Just press WASD according to what appears on the screen
 If it appears W, press W and your combo will go up
 You have limited energy and the enemy has HP
 Depending on how well you do in the combat, the other characters will react to it (if you did well, they will praise you, etc)
 However, the bad side is that the mini game is too easy (for me at least)
Sound: 7They really did a good job here
 The music is good and one of the tracks even got stuck in my ear (it's one that plays when riding the bike if we choose to go to school with it)
 That's a lot more than I can say for many visual novels
 You see, I am like this: if I like the music that is playing, I continue to play the VN with it on, if I don't, I turn off the music and play my own
 I didn't turn off the music in this VN
The voice acting is also good
 The voices match very well with the characters (Shou especially)
 Obviously, we are talking about low budget voice acting, so don't expect voice acting on Morgan Freeman level (aka God level)
 It's good, but not something that will blow you away
 But considering that one can count english voice acted visual novels with just one hand, this is a really good effort from the devs
However, there are at least two moments where secondary characters don't have voice
 Considering that I reported this in the last alpha, I am going to assume that their lack of voice is intentional and not a bug
 This is weird because everyone else is voiced
 I will update this if they add voices later
Characters: Not going to rate yetSome of the characters are inspired by your usual japanese anime stereotypes, like tsundere
 However, they don't shamessly try to imitate them to the letter, which is good, because english voice acting + japanese stereotypes = usually not a good idea
 It's not by chance that "Idiot
" doesn't sound as good as "baka
" at the end of "I didn't do it because I like you, baka
"In the first episode, you are introduced to an uncle (Kaito), sister (Nikki), friend (Shou) and the romantic options: Mayu, Yuuna and Kaori
 There's also a french girl appearing in the next episode, Belle (Ooh là là)
 And there's also other guy that you may or may not meet in this episode depending on your choices, Akira (I got my eye on you, you white haired *insert swear here*)Because we are only in the first episode, and also because I'm lazy, I will refrain for now from talking of each one individually, but what I can say is that they feel compeling and I want to know more about them
Enjoyment: 9I am a sucker for choices
 I am a sucker for consequences
 So I had a blast replaying it multiple times and roleplay differently each time
The only complaint I have is that this episode felt a bit shorter compared with the original demo, but other than that, it was fun
Final rating: 8 (episode 1)TL;DR:Just buy it
 I kid
 You should buy it if:- You like light hearted stories;- You like mechas;- You like tons of choices;- You like easter eggs/references;- You want to support western VN's
You shouldn't buy it if:- You want a serious story (again, this is based off of the first episode, it might get serious moments later on for all I know);- You don't like any kind of mini games in visual novels;- You prefer more linear stories
If you have any questions or you want to point out something, feel free to comment
 I will reply as soon I notice it

ACE Academy is a story-rich visual novel developed and published by PixelFade Inc
 Following your little sister as she begins her studies in a new country, you find yourself transferring to ACE Academy which is a premier school for Cenorobotic studies in Japan
 "Cenorobotics" is a new academic field dealing with the study and use of GEARs which are giant mechanized robots originally developed for military applications
 The popularity of arena GEAR combat has enveloped a number of different areas with engineering, sponsorship, entertainment and weapons development just to name a few
 How will you and your sister adjust to life in a different nation, will you be able to make friends or possibly find love and most importantly will your piloting skills position you and your GEAR at the top of the Cenorobotics program
 Welcome to Japan
Usually I skip the gameplay portion of a visual novel review because it's a visual novel and there is no gameplay
until now that is
sort of
 Strangely enough, there actually is some gameplay involved in ACE Academy whenever there is combat with the mechs or GEARs as they are properly refered to
 On the battlefield, as advances are made by you and your opponents you are quickly given a list of actions to make with your GEAR and you only have a very limited time, seconds at best as a countdown timer initiates, to make a choice which really adds to the tension of the battles
 Do you block, evade, fire weapons or go in for a melee attack
it's all very well executed into the story quite nicely with animations during the battles
 In summary, this additional dynamic really had me even more intrigued with the narrative in ACE Academy as I found myself eagerly looking forward to the next engagements with the GEARs
Visually, this novel is really stunning with it's top notch illustration and professional presentation
 The manga inspired artwork is some of the best I've seen in any V
N
 and is filled with bright cheerful colors and terrific shading
 Even the menu screens are beautifully done which shows the commitment that this development team really put into this title
 One very eye-catching feature is the animation of the characters in this story
 They certainly aren't the static 2D figures that you see in most visual novels no
 The people in ACE Academy are wonderfully animated
 Their mouths move when they speak, their eyes blink, they even show different emotions with their facial features like blushing and getting upset or angry
 Sometimes even cute little speech bubbles with different animations in them like a heart or a tear pop up over the characters heads depending on what they just said or what they're feeling it's all very manga-like and fun to observe as you read the engrossing narrative
 They also change clothing on a regular basis, whenever you meet someone outside of the Academy for a social engagement they are always wearing something different
 I found this to be a wonderful little detail and something that you don't often see in most visual novels
 On another note, the sound is of the upmost quality
 It's truly immersive as the development team has managed to include ambient noises such as doors opening/closing, phones ringing, birds chirping, vehicles etc
, basically all the sounds you would hear as the characters interact with each other and their environments as the story progresses
 I really love it when these sounds are incorporated into the V
N
 because it truly immmerses me within the story
 ACE Academy has voiced dialogue and typically I like my V
N
's without it but I must admit that the voice actors in this title have done an impressive job with the script
 I find them all endearing and quite believable in what they say and how they say it
 Also, your little sister Nikki has the cutest voice ever
 In conclusion, with all the effort put forth in just the visuals and sound quality of ACE Academy you would be hard pressed to find another visual novel with as outstanding a presentation as this
To date, ACE Academy has been without a doubt the best and one of the longest visual novel experiences that I've had on Steam
 The story is extremely well written and quite entertaining and some of the more emotional scenes will even bring a tear or two to your eyes
 There are many unique characters to interact with and an abundance of choices to make throughout the branching narrative and let's not forget the fun GEAR combat
 There is also a ton of "pop culture" references thrown at you in this V
N
 so that was an added bonus as well
 As far as options go, there are the basics for audio, video and text speed
 Also included is an unlockable CG gallery and a very memorable original soundtrack with a few homage bonus tracks thrown in for good measure
 Sadly there are no Steam Achievements or Steam Trading Cards to collect which is a shame because those would go over nicely with this title
 As most of the V
N
's that I've tried on Steam have been fantasy based or occuring in present day, it was very refreshing to finally get a quality title that was purely science fiction
 In conclusion, featuring a truly intriguing story in which you actually get to pilot a mech, amazing artwork, a rich cast of memorable characters and a terrific O
S
T
, ACE Academy is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to visual novel fans, anyone wanting to experience a great sci-fi story and definitely to anyone wanting to try a visual novel for the very first time

If you ever wanted a visual novel where you can troll the hell out of everyone in it, look no further
 ACE Academy is a western VN with a lot of humor and English voice acting (that manages to not be terrible)
 I have to be honest, the first playthrough I wasn't that impressed
 I chose the sensible, serious dialog options and found it to be an average slice-of-life story with a pretty disappointing ending
Then for the next playthrough I went full-on troll mode and it got way better
 Humor is the biggest reason you should pick up ACE Academy
 It had me laughing out loud many times, and that's enough to forgive it for its flaws (lackluster ending, some unvoiced dialog, minor characters are represented by silhouettes, etc
)
In summary, there is a dialog choice that says "Swiggity swooty, I'm coming for that booty
" I think that says it all

+ Main cast are standard anime tropes, but likeable+ Several girls to get your dating sim on, and thus replay value+ You are not the center of the universe (see below)+ Number of enjoyable, selectable scenes to get to know the characters+ Quality of CGs and sprites, it's a "cute" game+ Interesting setting and good world-buildingo Combat is infrequent and bland enough to be unnecessaryo Reused backgrounds and silhouettes for many side characterso Forgettable but passable soundtrack- Many story elements feel rushed and half-baked (see below)- Voice acting, particularly for secondary characters, is weak- Far too many pop culture references that will age the game terriblyACE Academy is tough for me to review
 There's plenty to like about it, but it's clear that it's PixelFade's first effort, and suffers from its original episodic release
 I assume the latter was a budgetary requirement to raise more funds through Early Access, but it's probably responsible for some pacing and focus issues
First, I will elaborate on the "pro" above: you are not the center of the universe
 You can pursue a variety of romance options, and beyond that choose which friends you spend free time with
 I was pleasantly surprised to find that characters I didn't pursue still clearly had a life outside of the game's scenes
 Girl who hit on me constantly that I rebuffed
 She got another boyfriend
 Standoffish teammate that I avoided until the end
 All the while she was working at a daycare and has a heart of gold
Now, the "con," which ties into my point about PixelFade and the episodic release
 Story elements, like a big, brewing conspiracy and the fate of your family, are repeatedly teased and then tied up far too quickly and cleanly
 There's some build up, but no climax, no payoff
 So why include them at all, really
 I suspect as they released episodes the game expanded in ways PixelFade didn't plan, and came to a point where their limited resources required they call it finished
 So they did
 but it's not satisfying
 This seems to happen even with bigger-name episodic games, like Life is Strange
 It is simply hard to maintain quality and cohesion this way
Steam tags call this an "RPG," but ACE isn't and by trying to be (with a kind-of "story arc" and characters "classes"), it dilutes itself
 In actuality it is "slice of life" and should have embraced that
 Drop the abortive mystery and rivalry and just be about a schoolboy and his friends
 As written, this practically begs for a continuation or sequel that seems unlikely
 That's too bad, because the bones of a really compelling VN are here
 I would love to learn more about GEARs and how they define people's lives
 I would love to keep following these characters and their relationships beyond the beginning stage (but that's a general gripe for too many VNs)
But still, I do recommend ACE Academy, maybe with the caveat of waiting for a sale
 If you like VNs (and if you're reading this, you very likely do), I believe this game will be enjoyable, but not mind-blowing, for you
 It was good enough on its own merits, and has me interested in PixelFade's further work
 Apparently in their next game, Crystalline, there is only one love interest for the main character that will be relatively complicated and fleshed-out
 That's a very promising direction in today's mile-wide, inch-deep world of dating sims

Wow
 So, this one came in as a complete surprise
 I didnt expect much when i bought it, but boy was I wrong
TL;DR:Pros:
Intriguing Story
Good, genuinly funny writing
Tons of choices, that also have an impact
Unique and likeable characters
Fully voice-acted
Decent length
Nice Artstyle & SoundtrackCons:
Abrupt, unsatisfying ending
Minor: Artwork occasionally gets re-usedIn Detail:Pixelfade
 Never heard of that Developer before, nor about the game itself
 So I expected a pretty run-of-the-mill Visual Novel
This was not what I got
 The CharactersThe character cast in ACE Academy was great across the board for me
 The romancable characters are unique and differ heavily from each other, but all of them are very likeable
Other characters such as your best friend, or your little sister etc
 are just as loveable
 The Dynamic between them is great and the game manages to convey a real sense of belonging
 You feel like a real part of the group
 The StoryThe Story is what I would probably classify as mildly interesting
 That doesnt mean it's bad, far from it
 For a VN it's actually rather intriguing and does the job well enough
 It's nothing revolutionary, but compared to a lot of other VN I would say it is above average
 RomancesNow as mentioned before there are 4 romancable characters
Each of them has unique traits but all of them have very rewarding and heartwarming moments in their respective routes
Through the excellent writing the progression of these romantic relationships also feels pretty natural and not forced
 Game Length & Choices After doing all the routes I capped at roughly 20 hours
 Now, I will not lie, I didnt really check my playtime after I first reached the ending , but it should last you a good 10 hours
However that is only if you play through it once, there are a lot of reason to play through it several times
At the start of the game you name your MC and select 1 out of 3 personality types
 Depending on your type you will get unique dialogue choices as well as different outcomes in some events
In additon to that you also have the above mentioned different romances that I encourage you to explore
Lastly this game throws a ton of choices at you from the get go
 Some may just slightly alter a dialogue, but there are also a lot that affect the story and that have actual impact

Early Access Review
Firstly I’d just like to say as this is the early access and still has a lot more to come I thought it was extremely good
 The story was enticing and kept me very interested in the characters throughout the first part of the game
 I also enjoyed little mini games within this visual novel which kept things interesting
 Secondly the music to this game is very good and fits the rhythm of what is happening and the mood that goes with it
 I was very surprised at how well it was done for a company’s first work
Finally all the characters to this game have a lot to them and are all very likeable
 This made me enjoy the story so much more and felt more connected with each character
 The voice acting is also good and fits the characters all very well giving them all their own great personalities
 There are also many different choices you can make which help keep the game fresh and mean there is much more replay ability
 In all I feel ACE Academy is definitely worth a buy
 It’s a lot better than most other visual novels I have played on steam
 Especially seeing as the first part is longer than most of them, it is defiantly worth the money
 If visual novels are your thing I think you will enjoy it as much or maybe more than I did

So I was looking for Visual Novels on Steam which are on sale (Everyone wants sales) then I came across this VN
 I didn't deem it as something good because it was on sale and probably because I never heard of it before add to that it was made in the west
 So my expectations were set to low and I played the game to basically laugh at how terrible it might be
 Then it happened 2 hours in and I can't get the game off of my mind
 The characters are too damn good, the interactions are superb, there are a plethora of choices and scenarios to see and of course the protagonist is realistic
 I'm not a fan of Mech and the future but this is an exception
 An exceptionaly, wonderful VN for those lost in the dangerous seas that is called VN hell
 I finally found something I'd read 'til the end
 Simply amazing, no amount of praise can amount to the light I saw yesterday

Early Access Review
As one of the earliest and largest supporters of the project, back when it was known as ‘Kendo Crush’, I have to say, that I had a great deal of fun with the original demo
 However, I have since given up support for the project, through no reason other than the unfortunate issues the development staff encountered at many steps
 What was originally intended to come out fully in June of this year, is now still in early access
However, this is to be expected
 They have changed the game considerably, and picked up new staff, despite the issues encountered
 As a mid-tier backer of the project, I was given early access to builds of the new ‘Ace Academy’ game
 All I can say is I found the quality of the writing to be greatly diminished from that of the original demo
 Without spoiling anything, certain character interactions with a girl named ‘Kaori’
 She’s quite temperamental, and I was originally satisfied with how much you were able to tease her
 From what I played of the current game, there have been far less options to do this
 In general, I found the comedy of the original to be much more prominent
 There are some improvements over the redo
 The art is much better, and I’m sure the futuristic appeal of the game will be more enjoyable to some, over the original Kendo focus, which some might have seen as boring
 I must admit, that it was probably a better move for the game to be redesigned, but that doesn’t change my opinion on the matter
While I can guarantee the game is worth the price, it just isn’t there for me

Analogue: a Hate Story certainly isn't billed as a feminist game
 It's creator, Christine Love, cheekily describes it as being more about transhumanism, traditional marriage, loneliness, and cosplay
 Maybe that's true
 All I can say is that as a man, the game struck me as unflinchingly feminist

What would you do if you were to wake up tomorrow, having been thrust into a completely foreign society
 Being greeted by your "new family" who tell you what to say, what to think and even how to feel in order to not violate their social norms
 Being told that your identity, the place you carved out for yourself in the world, is long forgotten, but that they already have a new role good and ready for you
 That your dreams no longer matter
This fate, among many others, is one of the gears in the complex machinery that would end up removing all traces of life from humanity's great hope, the huge pioneer starship Mugunghwa, in Analogue: A Hate Story
In this unconventional sci-fi/mystery visual novel, you are a space investigator hired to find out the truth about what happened to the Mugunghwa and how it got lost on its mission to settle foreign planets
 Arriving at the wreckage and linking up to the ship's computer, you are greeted by the archival A
I
, who offers to help you sort through the letters, reports, and diary entries of the people who lived on board before a mysterious catastrophe killed everyone
 You quickly learn that very little is as it seems, and there are so many personal motives wrapped up in the situation that actual honesty is hard to come by
The presentation in Analogue sets up a computer-y atmosphere with abstract backgrounds and actual in-story explanations for things like the multiple choice "dialogue wheels"
 The effort put into the art is largely concentrated into the two highly detailed on-screen characters, who delight with a plethora of poses and facial expressions to convey their emotions
 The soundtrack, especially the character themes, features recognizable melodies (sometimes in several variations) realized in a consistent style that works extremely well with the atmosphere constructed by the rest of the story
For most visual novels, the user interface tends to be an afterthought, and only rarely is it a point of contention in a review
 Analogue, however, eschews the medium's tradition of a branching linear narrative and forges its own path in regards to navigation inside the story
 In essence, every piece of text that you can find is one of the "files" of the ship's archive that you can view in any order, and you can also talk to the A
I
 or drop back to the command-line interface at any point
 This provides the player (a term that I use deliberately, because for Analogue, being a mere "reader" really isn't enough) with a high amount of agency that few visual novels choose to provide
 It also creates a proportionally high number of opportunities to fail, for example if the player is not quick on their feet when it comes to using the computer terminal as the situation requires
This sets up an interesting contrast with the main character's agency in the plot
 After all, many years have passed since the events you read about and there is no way to influence the outcome or to save anyone
 The only thing you can do is to find out the truth
 There is a present-day plot involving the main character and the two artificial intelligences that still reside on the ship's computer, but the focus is on the mercilessly unchangeable past
The people on the Mugunghwa lived in a surprisingly traditionalist society with strong codified gender goles and rampant classism
 The members of the noble families all struggled for power, but no one seemed to heed the big picture or pay any mind to the ship's course
 It was a troublesome situation in which a little girl from hundreds of years ago was awakened from cryostasis
 Her family hoped that the Pale Bride might bring them salvation, but what could she do to find her way in a society that was so radically different from the one she knew
 You notice early on that she seems to be somewhat of a focal point for the events on board following her reawakening, but how does she factor into the eventual genocide
 What caused the ship's undoing
 And why do the two A
I
s despise each other so much
Analogue is, at its core, a mystery story
 While it is still a visual novel and you can gloss over most of it without really internalizing it and still get to the end, it is a more rewarding experience to actually untangle the relationships of the characters and understand how their motivations propel them to do what they do
 There aren't really any mechanics in place to support this endeavour, other than the family trees that the A
I
s helpfully provide you with
 I found that my enjoyment of the story increased significantly as soon as I started taking my own notes with pen and paper
 I would encourage you to do the same, because otherwise it is very easy to lose your perspective as you wade through the countless documents, each colored by its author's perceptions
Bit by bit you wrestle the truth from the ship's archives, and slowly you piece together the puzzle until you are able to see the full picture in all its horror
 All aspects of it, from the psychological through the sociological to the interpersonal themes of the story, paint a drab picture of loneliness and despair
 It poses the uncomfortable question of whether the ship's population as a whole might have been beyond salvation for who knows how long, doomed many years before the finale of the story; whether the event that put an end to all biological life on board was merely the logical conclusion, much like you would turn out the lights when you leave an empty room
 It's hauntingly honest in its depiction of the darkest depths of the human soul, and after completing the story for the first time, it left me with a strong feeling of unease about what any one of us might be capable of, given the right circumstances
It does also have its lighthearted moments, and even though visual novel connoisseurs will find many tropes and clichés conspicuously absent, Analogue coquets with the expectations carried over from its genre siblings in certain moments, such as when one of the A
I
s invites you to dress her up in various outfits
 It's no stranger to fun and there is plenty of clever humor to be found in the data logs and the A
I
 banter
The overall execution in this VN is so congruent and polished that any perceived shortcomings almost have to be rooted in personal taste
 Some people might not care for the minimalist presentation, others might have preferred a more linear way of storytelling, yet others may have their reasons for not wanting to read a story where gender inequality is a prominent theme
 But judged on its own merits, I can find nothing but praise for Analogue: A Hate Story within me
 It's unique and interesting, and if you think that a mystery visual novel with deeper than average gameplay mechanics might intrigue you, I can recommend it without reservation
Posted: 25 November, 2013
This is ancient history now, but for a while, back around 2005 or so, there was a perception, largely created by a single translation group, that the "visual novel," a format of linear text adventure that grew out of the Japanese PC games scene, might actually have something to offer beyond cheap titillation
 They chose short, indie works like narcissu, Planetarian or OMGWTFBBQ, melodramatic stories of finding that last emotional connection in the moments before your early and miserable death
 And then they pretty much stopped doing it (at least for free), because, hell, translating this stuff is a pain, and that was the end of that
Analogue feels much like the promise of those earlier works
 Written in English by a native speaker and skilled writer, with a great sense for how to use the interactive features of the format to really draw you in, in a way that "an ordinary book" can't
 It's smart, somber, and complicated; it's a well-told story, and not just "for video games
" And really, I just have a thing for simulated terminal interfaces
Posted: 27 October, 2014
I will start off by saying that I am a great lover of Visual Novels and games of the sort
 I will admit that coming into Analogue: A Hate Story, I was fairly skeptical and I wasn't sure what to make of it
The only real negative was that I found the game did not make it very easy to get into and I felt like the user interface was a little bit unclear in sections
 A factor that I have no doubt would initially put people off
Little did I know that later on I would come to the conclusion that this game is worth every second I invested into it
 The story is incredible once you have managed to piece things together and after some time you begin to learn new things and discover new secrets
 The level of depth and thought that has gone into the creation of this game is incredible and I would reccommend everybody to play it
 There are some fun little additionals which are added into the game through the use of the command centre, which is a nice little addition which I haven't seen implemented in too many others
At £6
99 it is incredibly reasonable for a visual novel and there isn't really a good excuse not to buy it
Posted: 4 June
There's no doubt that Steam has been flooded, for better or worse, by visual novels as of late
Now, don't get me wrong, Indie titles are great, but amidst the endless stream of "waifu"-bait visual novels (VNs) you'll see here on Steam, I think you'll be hard-pressed to find many decent stories with an intriguing plot that aren't about getting in a girl's pants for an affordable price
 That's par for the course when discussing visual novels, but that's also why I tend to trust VNs from well-known studios/devs, because at least you know you'll get plot while playing VNs of acclaim like Clannad, the Grisaia Trilogy, or The Devil on G-String in exchange for their premium price
But, let's rewind time back to 2012, when Gangnam Style was top of the charts around the world and every tween and their literature teacher was dying to see Shaky Camera: The Movie The Hunger Games
 In this archaic age of yore, there were, quite frankly, no good visual novels on Steam, save for one: Christine Love's Analogue: A Hate Story
 Back then, I wasn't sure how much story ten bucks could really buy, but boy I was surprised
Analogue eschews all the teenage high-school setting jazz you'll see in 99
9% of visual novels out there
 Instead, it opts to tell the fate of a ruined colony ship, the Mugunghwa, in a decidedly sci-fi setting
 It does this with considerable polish
Analogue's presentation is simple, nothing more and nothing less required to tell its story, letting you explore the lore of the ship's mysterious downfall at your own pace as you literally read through logs like the investigator you are supposed to be
 At the very least its more interactive than half the VNs on the market, with a very entertaining minigame thrown in halfway through the story
 Now then, you can hold off on impulsively buying those tempting 11 Anniversary Lootboxes in Overwatch since for those same ten bucks, you get a substantial story and can brag to your friends all about the "Joseon" Era of Korean history
And at the end of the day, what's more important
 Getting yet ANOTHER Tracer legendary skin or knowing what "Joseon" means
 You be the judge of that question
Just uh
don't blame me if your 10 bucks gets you neither of those, in the end
Pros Absolutely riveting plot Cute AI girls Different outfits on a whim for Cute AI girls More game interaction then smashing "ENTER" every 10 seconds Stop a nuclear explosion with your hacking skills A feminist game that makes sense You can achieve the impossible dream every indecisive teenage Light Novel main character wishes they could make by quite literally cheating the systemCons No voice acting, but that's completely fine Relatively short, but there actually is a sequel so more playtime there too I guess Learning about how unpleasant people from the Joseon Dynasty could be is disgusting, but that's the point Not that I care but its based off of Korea and not Japan so you "purists" may have some beef with that
No but seriously
 Play Analogue

Do AIs give you feelings

 All these things and more are available in Analogue: A Hate Story

You should really play this game
It was one of those things that just stays with you, and you keep thinking about it the rest of the day after you’ve played it
 It’s also not that long– I got 98% completion in, according to Steam, 2
8 hours
 So it’s more than worth the investment
There are two stories here
 The frame story is that you are sent as part of your job to go through the records of a recently rediscovered lost ship/space colony that has been gone for hundreds of years
 You head over and start sifting through the log files with the help of the ship’s AI
 The second story is what actually happened on the ship
 The setting is simultaneously a future dystopia and a past dystopia– the frame story takes place more than a thousand years in the future, while the secondary plot takes place six hundred years before that
It’s hard to describe the game without getting into spoiler territory, but I’ll do my best: the gist of the secondary plot is that on this space colony, some unspecified disaster caused major social and educational regression and an extreme population reduction that ultimately resulted in the establishment of an extremely oppressive patriarchal society in which women rarely are allowed to leave the home and are often married off as young as 12 or 13
 A young girl put in stasis before the disaster due to an illness wakes up hoping that a cure has been developed, only to find the world has gone to hell
The game is simultaneously a reflection on the horrors of the past– a particularly disturbing post-game author’s note lets you know the circumstances are based very heavily on actual customs of Feudal Korea– as well as a warning about where we could head in the future
 The girl wakes up and tries to tell her new “family” about her illness by emphasizing how thin and pale she is, but all the men hear is a woman’s whine and all the women hear is bragging about good looks, which would sound extreme if the exact same thing hadn’t happened to me in the past
 It’s an examination of the ways women survive in such an oppressive society, and what happens to those who don’t fit the mold
The final reveal of the girl’s storyline was something I saw coming by the time I got there but was hoping wouldn’t happen all the same
The gameplay itself was clever, if simple
 The navigation was freer than you usually get in a VN, as the interface is of a computer system you can explore more or less however you see fit– as the AI offers commentary– though the AI will dole out information based on how you interact with them so the story itself it ultimately nonlinear
 In addition to reading snippets of the ship’s logs and chatting with the AI, there’s also a command input console where you can type in whatever you please to the ship’s computer
 I thought the puzzles involving the commands were interesting enough to require some good thought while also logical enough to be solvable on your own
The weakest part of the game to me was the ending of the frame story
 The story itself is somber, serious, and tragic, but the AIs end up flighty, silly, and almost like caricatures
 Like, after everything that’s gone on, Hyun-ae suddenly turns into terrible tsundere and decides she’s in love with you and wants to get married
 What
 The LAST thing she should be interested in after what she’s seen is some kind of weird relationship with a stranger
 The tone shifts from torture and oppression to some kind of parody with no warning whatsoever, and it’s like she just forgets what you were looking at
 It’s jarring, but also comes off as though the game doesn’t take its very, very serious subject matter seriously at all
 “Oprression and mutilation destroy lives
 CAN I BE UR WAIFU
” Just wat
In the same vein, I thought calling the “best” ending a “harem” ending was ridiculously tacky
 In a story where women are literally being forced into harems, just what the hell
 Is it supposed to be a joke
 Why is that something to joke about
 Is it some weird attempt at meta-commentary on VNs
 Wrong place, wrong time
So yeah, the last five minutes or so of the game are… bad
 They’re just bad, there’s no way around it
 But overall
 This is an engaging, emotional, tragic story with a message that hits close to home, and I really recommend it

This is a visual novel that does not overly rely on anime tropes, but instead draws from the darker points of Korean history, places the plot in a distant transhumanist future and uses this seemingly incongruable mishmash as a setting for a social commentary
 While the game has been called feminist, I would actually say it goes quite a lot beyond that
If you are interested in sentient AI's, dark family dramas and human rights issues, you might enjoy this strange little gem

I bought Analogue: A Hate Story on a lark
 It was on sale, and I was bored, so I figured I'd give it a shot
 I'm a big fan of the science-fiction and transhuman genres, and Analogue seemed to offer a bit of both
I was not prepared for what this game had to offer
Perhaps calling it a "game" is a bit generous
 It's an interactive novel, with almost no action sequences to speak of
 The closest you'll come to any sort of twitch-reflex or quick-time events is typing into a terminal while an angry countdown clock stares you down
 But still, there are choices to make and consequences to pay, with five potential endings - four of which can be carried right into the second game, Hate Plus
Don't go into this game expecting action and excitement
 If you're looking for that, then you're in the wrong place
 But if you enjoy a gripping tale of political intrigue, psychological horror, and surprisingly dark themes - then this is absolutely worth the price of admission
 Don't let the cute, anime-inspired artwork fool you
 This game is absolutely for adults, and not because of any sexual themes or nudity (although there IS a bit of the former)
If there's anything to complain about, it's perhaps the usual drawback of an interactive novel
 It's relatively linear, fairly short, and light on replay value
 Oh, sure, it's worth trying for the different endings (most of which require their own distinct play-through), but you'll still be forced to read a lot of the same letters and dialogue
 And, while the writing is absolutely fantastic, it still gets repetitive the second or third time through - especially once you've learned all of the twists and turns that the story has to offer
But still - if you're into mature, psychological tales of intrigue and murder, then this game is absolutely worth at least ONE play-through
 You won't regret it

Doki doki is not oki dokiI find myself losing some screwsDue to heavy plot line I'm confusedWhen I try to care They ruin slice of life atmosphereWhere I don't belongBecause I'm as quiet as a stoneNone of these girls wear a thongI thought I'd write a poemAbout this crazy mazeThat loops around when it's light outsideAnd makes me go insaneI hear Sayori yellIt gives my ears a scareAnd fills my mind with strange remorseWhat have I done to her
I thought that we were friendsBut we can't make amendsI trusted you but all you didWas break my heart and spit on meNot to mention you scared a girlThat I was hitting on beforeYou should've been more honestPerhaps I didn't care that muchYou were the best of friendsBut in the endI took the blameI thought of spending timeWith Natsuki by my sideWe made a promise to one anotherTo have fun with none other than each otherRead manga, bathe in the sunBut someone let us down -Then our Yuri came to townAnd of course to ruin our fun,She desired it the mostWe weren't even close
I don't know where she came fromBut that girl is insane, though
I swear I'm not to blameWhen she sneaks a peek of meDo you want a piece of me
I will not get up and leaveThat's right, I'm not that goodI'm just a boring dudeDon't tell me you're obsessed I can't even wipe my @ssWithout Yuri following me aroundI will never come aroundI don't think I love youPlease, you do youBut I'm not the one for you
Monika, sweet MonikaYou sound like my harmonicaYour smile is wide and brightAs warm as a sunlight I find it rather suspiciousThat a girl like you have no issuesPerfect, smart, no tissuesHere are the brains and here's a heartPlaying the pianoRunning late for classPretending to be kinder than you actually areYou're mystical and egotisticalFor doing what you wantNot listening to one soulBut one day you will learnYour world does not revolve Around you anymoreI'm sorry I must goI got my life, you knowI hope you understandI shall visit you againWhen universes collideAnd all that left is to dieI'll be there by your side Bye bye, dear Literature ClubI shake my head and give a shrugThis is my last goodbye You'll always beA part of meThat I will not despise

IntroductionI want to try and tell to english-speaking audience why I like this game, an why they should (or should not) play it
First of all - for some people in ex-USSR countries this game is something like half-life 3 for everyone - we waited it long enough to be happy to get it
 Even if it's not perfect, it's still what we waited so long
Well, where to start
 Once apon a time in the year of 2007, on anonymous imageboard 2ch
ru (now closed) one of the visitors posted a picture he draw, of a young girl with blonde hair
 People liked it, so he draw more pictures of her
 Later, he moved to another imageboard, and with other talented people decided to make a game
 It should have been an adult game with USSR-attributes, becase many people grown-up while there was USSR, and had a good memories about their youth
Well, it was easier to decide than to do
 They started
 And there was a lot of promises
 A lot of waiting
 A lot of drama
 Changes in the team
 Leaking of not ready game
 A LOT OF EVERYTHING
 So, when, after all this years, game was published to steam, a lot of people was like "Wow
 They really did it
"
Now, the reason why I writing this review
 Should you, or should not, play it
 Well, if you wondered what is "imageboard", never leaved in ex-USSR countries or just don't like visual novels - probably not
 Not that you can't like it, it's about feelings, that is the same for everyone
 Also, you probably should not play it, if you expect just a game with lot of boobs
 It has gone far from the original idea of adult game, and even though it has boobs, and you may even find adult-patch in the internet, it's still not the main theme of game
If you are (or ever was) alone, if you live (or ever lived) in ex-USSR countries, if you ever visited imageboards (or even still do) - you can really enjoy this game, I recommend it to you
 Or even if you just curious to see, what non-professional developers can do
 And if you waited too long for this game to be made - you probably already played it)Now, something about this game, not connected to this story
GraphicsGraphics has problems
 It's not because it's bad, but because many people worked on this game on different time, so you
can see the difference between scenes
 Not a big problem, but I needed to say about it to impartial
 And the backgrounds is so beautiful, you may play the game just to see it
MusicI don't afraid to say that soundtrack for this game is brilliant
 I just love the main theme, based on soviet pioneer's anthem
 I hope you would enjoy it too
PlotWell, as often in indie projects, it's the weak spot of the game
 Nice idea, a lot of good humor (but many of it connected to imageboards, so not everyone would understand it
 And I have no idea, how good english translation is), and the target audience would certainly share the feelings of characters
 But
 holes in the plot, unjustified twists, and other mistakes of a beginning story-teller can spoil you some fun
 I still like it, because I somehow belong to the target audience, you know :)SummaryOh, whatever, just play it already, it's free
 Even if you have nothing to do with imageboards, never was neither young nor lonely, and believe russians have a pet-bears and wear hats with ear flaps whole year long - there is still something in the game you may like)

Everlasting Summer is a visual novel that was developed by a group of enthusiasts over a long span of five years
Posted: 24 November, 2014
In Soviet Russia game plays you
Thumbs up:+ Interesting story+ Cool backgrounds and sprites+ Marvellous soundtrack+ 13 different endings to discoverDeal with it:* It's not a hentai game
 Though you can return to game some adult content with a patch (Steam insisted to remove it) story is not focused on it* It's not a light entertainment game
 Depending on you personality it may cause feels of nostalgia, melancholy, make you think about your life or even make you cryThumbs down:- Some arts looks substandard in compare with backgrounds- English translation is rather poor at this very moment (but they are willing to improve it)P
S
 I can't guarantee you would like this game, but it's totally worth to try
Posted: 22 November, 2014
Pros:
- Russian girls
- USSR
- vodka
- Hatsune Miku
- you can be pedo
- you don't have to be pedoCons:
- doesn't provide an actual way to go back into the 80s USSR pioneer camp and hit on rebelious punk chick IRL
- no Elektronik's route
- no Shurik's route
- no Olga Dmitrievna route

If you managed to finish it one time, you have played 5% of the game
 You need to play at least 50% to reach the state where you can say this game has some potential
 By the time you got to 90%, get ready to get your mind blown with what they offer in the last few endings
 It was unexpected for me and I learnt that this game was not meant to be played only one time in order to reach the end
 Finishing it one time doesn't bring you to the real ending
I repeat, you need to finish all good endings to have a grasp of whats going on
 And also, ditch the girls, go for Samyon route and aim for Yulya
 It won't disappoint you

Everlasting Summer looks like your usual Japan-inspired dating-sim visual novel but you know something odd is going on when the name of the company making it is "Soviet Games" and the title screen greets you with hammers, sickles and Lenin busts
Don't get me wrong, this really is a Japan-inspired dating-sim visual novel, but it takes place and has been made in Russia so you should expect lots of quirky stuff even when they are just trying to fit a stereotype
 The premise is that you are a twenty-something internet addict with no friends and passions, who get sucked in a 1980 Pioneer Camp, the Soviet version of boy/girl scouts, before the Berlin Wall collapse
 Trying to understand what the hell happened to you and how to get out from the Past you got stuck into turns out to be only half of your quest, while the other half is, of course, getting acquainted with all the girls in the camp, have sex with them, and live amazing things you couldn't experience in your actual, dull, apathetic timeline
 Over the course of 7 days you will make some sparse choices that will decide what ending you get access too
 This is weird cause at first it totally looks like you couldn't choose much, but the game has 13 VERY different endings and I would say that this is where it shines
I got undeniably hooked when I realized how different the story can get based on what "branch" you pick
 The problem is that without a guide, and after your first clean playthrough, it isn't clear at all how to get into a different branch or what you could have done differently
 But as soon as you try to get a little deeper into the mechanics you'll realize the amount of story(es), for a game of this kind, is quite huge
 This doesn't change the fact that Everlasting Summer is definitely too long in some sections and the writing is uneven at best, which might have to do with a different cultural style from what I am used to, I'm not sure
 The different endings though, including a few crazy ones, are interesting and while some interactions and dialogues are beyond childish, there are also times when you can appreciate the education background of the writers
The characters get more interesting through replays, since the first trip through the 7 days don't leave much room for their personalities, but whenever you take a different branch you get to know them better
 As I mentioned before, this is the strength of the game: the 13 endings paint a whole picture
 I am not a completionist but this is one case where you can only really say you finished the game when you got all the endings since only then you will really know Sovionok Camp and the story of the guy who got trapped into it
The character design is weird at first, as pretty much everything that wants to look Japanese but it's not Japanese, but you'll get used to it soon and will probably appreciate it after a while, and the background pictures/paintings are honestly beautiful
 Finally, the 1980s Soviet Union setting is just unbeatable
Don't forget to download the Hentai patch from the official website, since the Steam version will just give you a black screen where you are supposed to see sex or breasts
 It is not much at all, this is not a hentai game, but it's better to see all the stuff instead of censorship blankness

Everlasting Summer is a free-to-play animesque visual novel, created by Soviet Games
The game has a pretty standart gameplay as far as visual novels go: there is a static picture that depicts your current surroundings, character sprites are placed on that picture, you read dialogues, sometimes you get to make a decision
 There are few notable exceptions to that rule, but this is generally what you would expect from the game
Everlasting Summer is extremely story-rich, one playthrough has an average span of seven in-game days, each day takes aproximately one-two hours to read through
 There is an average number of 5 decisions to make per day that do have an impact on the story (so much there are actually 13 endings to discover)
 On top of that, ending of Day 5 and the following days are completely unique to the ending you're heading to
 You will have to play through all of them to discover all secrets of the story
Story itself starts out like this: protagonist is a young man in his early 20s named Semyon (Sam)
 He's has almost no social life
 He lives on his parents' money
 He spends all day in the internet
 He has no will to change anything
One day he takes a bus that for some reason takes him through time to 80s, to a pioneer camp "Sovionok" ("Owlet")
 Semyon then has to find answers
 Why did he end up here
 How to get out of this place
 Does he even need to get out of here
Most of the time you interact with 10 very well written characters that may or may not have a secret agenda related to your situation
 The game packs a train of feels that it will happily unleash on you
 Guilttrips, ahoy
Let me give you a list of pros and cons:
+ Interesting non-linear multi-ending story
+ Heavy emotional investment is guaranteed
+ Amazing soundtrack
+ Beautiful scenery and well-drawn character sprites
+ A lot of references to russian culture, mostly internet culture (protagonist's name, posters in pioneers' houses, bus 410, protagonist's thoughts sometimes)
- There are a few screamers (how many depends on the ending you're heading for, but at least one is guaranteed)
 Normaly I would just laugh at these attempts to scare the player but in the overall upbeat mood these manage to scare effectively
- Steam has removed adult content (can be restored with an easy to install patch)
 That's not neccesarily a bad thing, adult content ruins the mood in some moments but black screens infuriate me personally
- Action parts are few and even then you just read through them, doing nothing yourself
 Those who are looking for action gameplay - look elsewhere
Hopefully, I managed to interest you
 A few words of advice: Don't you dare read any guides that reveal plot elements, play for the first time without using any guides, even spoilerless ones
 Don't even approach Lena on your first playthrough
you're guaranteed to score an extremely depressing ending if you do it wrong
 In fact, if you consider yourself an emotional person I suggest that you just read about her endings after you finish the game for the first time, it will make you feel extremely depressed if you play it yourself
You will probably see it in every other review, but I'll repeat these wise words: don't play Miku's ending at night
To sum up, I definetly recommend to give this game a try, since it's free
Have fun, pioneers

Early Access Review
Despite being a dating sim, this game teaches some valuable life lessons:1: Any girl will forgive you for anything you did if you just pester them repeatedly
 No matter how much they hate you, they will bury the hatchet
2: You can flip burgers, be a janitor, make video games, surf, protest, and go to school all at the same time
3: Any girl will fall in love with you if you poke them in the face repeatedly
4: Everything is expensive
 Because of that, in order to get far in life, you must be Bill Gates
5: You can change your own gender at the press of a button
6: You can travel through realities
 In doing so, all girls you've met will forget you existed and you must make them love you again, but they grow to love you even faster, proving this is the land of Sonic
 You're too slow
7: Sitting still and doing nothing will still make girls love you, even if you completely ignore them
 All chicks love it when you play hard to get
8: Your parents are very disappointed in you for playing this game
10/10 would cheat on everyone again

Okay so pretty much, I was playing this game at about 3:00 in the morning
 I was tired as hell and didn't feel like putting on my headphones, and apparently my volume was really loud
 Next thing I know, My dad just randomly bursts through the door at the exact time I had an itch on my crotch
 He saw my screen then saw my hand on my junk
 He then left my room and never looked at me the same again

Pros:* It's free* It's funny & is fully aware of how ridiculous it is* It's frequently updated* Best, most accurate character creation ever
* It makes you feel thoroughly exploited
 Why is this a "pro"
 Because you're dating a dozen girls at once
 There's a moral to this story
 Cons:* It's a clicker / idle game* Since it's a clicker / idle game, you keep coming back for hours on end just trying to make things that take ages take less ages
* Honestly you shouldn't play this
 It's hard to escape
 You could be playing other things
 You could be doing something useful
 You could have written your own game, or book, or symphony
 But no, you come back and do the same thing you did the last 300 times but slightly quicker
 because it's so easy to do
* You will never escape
 Never
 Unless you cheat and set your clock forward or hack some files
 But
 that's cheating

It's really a very exciting computer game
though there are many elements that make me feel weird in this game (for example, the hero of this game is a person with domestic violence
 Oh
god)But it is still an excellent adult game
I am very glad to see the production team could produce the second masterpiece like this after making the "Gao
kao",which really has a huge help in chosing to study Chinese
And I still have a question:is the voice of the actress really not Luoxiaohan's

I do recommened this game however, I sadly had more negatives things to say 
Great first game and looking forward to further touch ups and improvements in the future 
Bought this because I have much love and mad respect for Game Grumps
However
 I want to give an 100% honest review
 Probably gonna get a lot of hate for this one - please note it's just my opinion
 The game is
 extremely short in a sense and lacks any real "spark" on some of dates
 It can be
 rather boring
 It's quite upsetting that you only get three short dates with one person and then it's over
 It makes it hard to really build any sort of emotional connection with the person of choice (wow almost like a real date
 haha
) It's a hefty amount of reading which is fine with me honestly but as it is said to be voiced, this can be misleading as its 'voices' are grunts, huffs etc
It makes me very upset as a fellow Grump fan to say that I don't think this game was worth $15 USD ($19 AUD for me
) Highly recommened to wait for this game to come out on sale
 It is still a good game and the storyline mainly follows the life of a single dad of whom guides his daughter, Amanda, in the later stages of being a teenager
 The scenes with Amanda are very heartfelt and thought provoking, especially considering I'm a female of whom is not a Dad and doesn't have a child
 If you were to touch up this game it'd be nice to see some "out-of-style-type" cutscenes, if that makes any sense
 Like in Persona 5 for example, they have their art style for when you're fighting and running around etc
 but then they have anime-like cutscenes where it shows lovely movement and flows really nicely
 That would've broken up DDADDS really nicely if it had cutscenes similar to that
To end on a good note
- Amazing puns- Amazing art- Amazing Dads: I like each individuals personalities, they're all quite unique and have varied styles
- Amazing team and crew
Posted: 30 September
I think I need to disclose some things before I start talking about why I do not recommend buying Dream Daddy
 The first is that I adore Game Grumps (specifically Arin and Dan), and that they've had nothing to do with the development of the game save for some voicing-- which is really just grunts and 'ah
's, and some marketing on their channel
 The fact that the Grumps' name is on this shouldn't really be taken into account
 The second is that I bought it pretty much the day of release and had been following it since it'd been announced
 Not as actively as some people, but I knew about all the dads
I'm going to be starting with the negatives-- frankly, the game itself isn't *really* the issue here
 It's the developers
The developers have been a little shady from day one
 Originally, I was unsure if this game was meant to be a joke, like a lot of other people first suspected-- I'm a queer man, so I was hesitant at first
 I think it's important to note that I DID read several posts online about how someone close to the dev team had played the beta and got the impression that this was a grab at Representation Points(tm) and that it was just a cash grab-- here's the post
 [yollgraveyard
tumblr
com] During the release delay, the devs were suspiciously quiet-- they apologized afterwards, but it was still super unprofessional
I also vaguely remember (EDIT: I should mention that I can't be bothered to dredge up proof of this) the devs promising they'd add other dads and extra content, and a few of my friends remember them saying similar
 And these two above points are absolutely tied; we're three months out from DD's release date, and the devs have gone silent
 Since release, we've gotten two patches-- two bug patches, despite fans asking for more
 There's still a bugged achievement that the devs haven't explained, and the second patch was a patch so small that it isn't even mentioned on the Recent Updates section of steam, nor on any of the twitter accounts
The devs have essentially dropped this project as soon as it stopped making money and was no longer in top sellers for the fact that it's a queer dating sim
 Which is what a lot of people feared
 I feel genuinely ripped off by the developers and the game; if it weren't for the fact that I've got more than 2 hours of this game, which is INCREDIBLY short and lacks any real story arc to tie everyone together, I'd refund it in a heartbeat
 This game is almost $20 AUD and yet I wouldn't honestly say it's worth even that much, especially considering a) length and the fact that the game isn't even really complete and b) the devs have abandoned it
It's a shame, because otherwise, the game is really pretty and has some great characters; Mat's route is my favourite and the game introduced me to PUP, one of my favourite bands now
 It's diverse and cute and I love the fact that you can make a trans dad (even if the CC is godawful compared to character art), BUT the fact that you can now tell that it absolutely was a cash grab destroys it all, and
I wouldn't recommend buying
this game to anyone because of it

Tldr: cute but wait for a sale
The artwork is great and the stories I've done so far are cute, but
i just expected so much more
 I really wanted to like this and especially after waiting through delays and being so excited I'm super disappointed
 The game, at least to me, feels cheaper than it is
 I just don't feel the price tag is justified
 I do feel it's important to mention that i love how inclusive this game is, I just really hope the devs continue to add to it and hopefully address some issues
- There isn't proper voice acting- The customization for your dad kind of sucks- it would have been nice to customize your child or at least pick between a son or daughter but that isn't a big issue -while the story is adorable, it feels really basic and bare
 I didn't personally get much connection with the characters something which is important for this type of game
 I know a lot of people will disagree
with my review and that's cool
 I'm glad most people are in love with this, but it's just not worth $15 in my eyes
Posted: 22 July
First of all, I DID like the game
 But it was, at the same time, deceiving
 I'd give it a 6/10, but if it were the right price, I'd give it a 8
5/10 for sure
Let's start with the good things about it: it is a very enjoyable, nice and light game
 Most dads are also charming, the art is great, too
But on the other hand
 routes are extremely, extremely short
 Takes around 45 minutes to complete each route
 Not only that, but the endings are very limited, only having 2 endings, so there's no room for replaying it to find the rest of the endings
 I remember the Official Twitter promised multiple endings per dad
 You don't get to know the characters, and most of the time, it doesn't really feel like you're flirting with them
 I only got that impression with Damien
 It's like you guys are obviously just friends until the end of the third date where you suddenly kiss and love each other
 I was really excited to do Brian's route, but was very deceived to find that his route is just
 being rivals and at the very end kissing
 Nothing more
 It felt empty and superficial, despite the cute shirtless moment or the final kiss and hug at Amanda's party
 Didn't feel like a real developing relationship
 I think that it wasn't only because of how short the route is, but because of how it was written as well
 You could also have a short route where it does seem like they're flirting, like Damien's
Your character also has a personality that can't be changed, which I've found a bit distracting when it came to dating other dads, because I felt there was no chemistry between my character and his love interest even if I really liked the dad I was trying to romance just because my character spoke for me
 I don't know if this is normal for dating sims, though
Next issue is how overpriced it is for such a short game
 15 dollars isn't what this game is worth, in my opinion
 I'm mostly upset about having spent that amount of money on a game that isn't worth it
 Had it been cheaper I would have been content because I paid for the content I was given
 It is, still, a very nice enjoyable lighthearted game
Another thing that bothered me was the voices
 Grunts isn't voicing and it gets really annoying
 I don't care about the Game Grumps, but it feels like they haven't done much for the game
 Would have been better if they hadn't participated in this project at all
And now, this is my personal opinion but
 Amanda can get reaaaaally annoying
 I know it's a Dad game and all that, but when you have to do several routes and hear her story once and once again it gets tiring and irritating
 But once again
 this is a nice game
 Cute, entertaining (except for the Amanda bits
) and with interesting characters, even though they don't really get to be fleshed out
 I recommend it, but not for this price
 I'd wait for a sale
 I really, really hope more content is added later on, because despite my review looking negative, I really liked the game and some of the dads and I'm looking forward to some more dad dating

The only way I can solve my daddy issues without getting naked in front of strangers
10/10 would bang hot dads and help them raise their children again
Posted: 25 July
I really wanted to like this game, and was really excited to play it but honestly for me it was a huge let down
There are some bugs in the system that really took me out of the experience
 For example at the beginning you have to choose if you had a wife or husband previously
 I chose wife but time and time again they were refered to as 'dad' or 'your father', just a small thing but quite irritating when I was given a choice
 I also had some really weird stuff with Robert's route at the end where he got mad at me for trying to sleep with him, and I did nothing of the kind
 It's like the games branches aren't working properly (another example is my character asking him about Val, and in that route he never told me about her
) It just takes you out of the experience and leaves you quite confused
 You think this kind of thing would have been ironed out in testing
 The entire game became quite formulaic to me as just one wrong answer can give you a bad mark and apparently a bad ending, so I took to saving before every answer to make sure I got hearts for it
 Going back and loading and saving for answers that seem really inconsiquential is a silly way to play a game like this but I really didn't want to have to skip through all the scenes again and again to get the good ending because of one wrong answer
 My main gripe however is that the game just feels
hollow
 I really applaud the game for its inclusion, but the vast majority of the characters are really tropey and without any depth
 The dates with them are super short and seem to go nowhere exciting
 Honestly
I think the plots are really dull
 They just do not DO anything
 To have a characters entire story be 'I secretly like a sport that millions love worldwide' is not really the heartwrenching, romantic plot you expect from a dating sim
 There is no build up to these romances, they come out of nowhere almost every time and feel forced and unnatural
 There are so many things that are mentioned that seem important then never come up again, and a lot of the routes are very similar
 In fact they ALL end on the exact same ending which kind of makes it feel like the whole thing was pointless to begin with
 I'm not expecting Shakespeare or anything, but i've played dating sims which have made me tremble with anticipation and cry with sadness for way less money
 (Tbh I wish they put that 'secret ending' in, because at least that sounds exciting, and all the hints for it are in the game
) It's like they couldn't decide where they wanted this game to go or be
- funny, serious, sexy
 So instead it's a mishmash of all those things and all of them fail
 Some of the dialogue is funny but it's not sidesplittingly funny as the situations don't give rise to anything that could be
 Some of the scenes seem like they might be sexy then they cut to black
 Moments feel like they might be serious and finally going somewhere, but then they're over in a click
 It just feels rushed, unfinished and wholly unsatisfying
 I can't even say it's TERRBLE cause it doesnt do anything extreme enough to be terrible, it's just dull dull dull, and in a way, I think that's far worse
 :/

I am always a fan of visual novel and i did not expect Tricolour
Lovestory to be this cheap and still offer good visual art and romance storyline that include achievement and trading cards
 The game is in chinese but it offer english subtitle as well
Cannot complain some character's voice that does not match the subtitle and some error in the subtitle when it is already that cheap
 Well done
 I totally enjoyed it
Edit: The developer is active to read the reviews and check for errors found in the game and fixed it 
 GOOD WORK 
Posted: 21 September
I bought this game as I believed that it was a steal for 95p for artwork of this high class
 I'm not fond of Chinese voice acting but the characters voices are very nice regardless
 HOWEVER, the terrible english translation makes it very hard for me to enjoy this VN
 It's very off-putting for me to have to sort out the word order in my head as I read but I'm trying to put it off as the VN seems very well made and the artwork is spot on
 Creators of this game, I will correct the english for free if you want me to
 I find it to be it's only downside
 If you can get past it, like I'm going to try and do, great game
 Looking forward for what awaits me

This game puts Sakura series to shame
First of all, I just need to say that, YES this game has atrocious translation
 HOWEVER, it is still easily understandable
 Minor grammar issue and all, please stop whining about it
 Yes, it could've been better, but really, if you pass on this one, you're missing out on good stuff
Now, let's get started
I bought this game instantly when I saw the artstyle, or primarily the price
 I'm the kind of guy who judge books by its cover
 However, we will talk about the price later
The arts are solid, the background are nice and pretty, the characters drawn in the style that I fancy enough, but seriously
 Why the hell are we talking about the arstyle
 This is a Visual Novel, godammit
The most important thing in a Visual Novel is the story, and yes, this game has it
 It's really solid, everything is paced really nicely, keeping you on the edge of your seat because it's that interesting
I played this game late at night, left it to sleep and woke up to only continue playing this the whole day
 What I found surprising is, how much they offered in a such low low price
 It has a quite long story, in which by the time I'm writing this, I've only reached chapter 3
 It has full voiced characters, which I find quite good
 I'm no Chinese so I can't really judge much
 It has branching path, and even, uploads your choice to later be accumulated and statistically presented
I feel quite bad for not paying full price, 40% discount for this already really cheap game that offered so much
 Please accept my forgiveness dev team
If you haven't grabbed this one yet, take it
 It's worth your money, heck, they should've charge more
 I cannot say more to what they have offered
However, though
 I do have some criticisms as well
 Probably has some spoilers, be warned
- Need more Daisy
- Better English translation pls
- Daisy
- The progression for Violet seems a bit dull, as the only thing that keeps it going is "They're the same" and that's it
- The usage of flashbacks are quite weird too, for example that time when Daisy wins the competition
 It could've been told linearly like (cause->result->aftermath) but it was shown more like (cause->aftermath->result) -- it might make the storytelling a little bit more interesting, but meeh
 it keeps being repeated
- Daisy
- The branching options also seems a bit dullAs I'm still currently playing this game, I'll take back what I said if there's something wrong in my review
 Thank you devs for making this wonderful world that I will never experience in my life
 Please keep making more quality content
 As well as quality translation, PLEASE
I rate it Daisy/10
Posted: 4 October
pros:+Good graphics,pictures are bright,that makes me feel good
+Good background music
+Shows how Chinese students' life are like
for example the word of 'quality-oriented education',only Chinese people can understand
+Low price
cons:-Personally,I don't like the plot,I don't think it is realistic because I can't understand why all girls in the game fall in love with the protagonist
Posted: 23 September
The English translation has awful syntax
 Cannot say I was expecting much for the price, but currently the translation is syntactically unreadable
I am fairly confident the devs necromanced Shakespeare to do the preliminary translation
Then they handed the script to Yoda to write out the final text
 The resulting translation is time consuming and painful to read
I recommend to wait on this game for now
 Some brave souls are working on a fan translation
I will gladly give this game a second chance if/when that is completed
Posted: 27 September
A great price and the story looked interesting, but I could not get past the broken English
 Having to read a line again to understand what the busted English was trying to convey broke the immersion over and over
Posted: 23 September
This is the best $1 VN you can readit's cheap and the art is pretty decentthe music is good the only bad thing is the translationOverall: 4
5/5 it's a cheap and a really good VN you should definitely buy it
Posted: 2 October
Tricolor Lovestory is very good visual novel with terrible translation
Its chinese visual novel with chinese voice acting, which made it more interesting for me
Art is really good, its comparale with top notch japanese VNs
 Story is interesting enough
 It features protagonist with serious family problems, who is trying to overcome his problems and anxieties with help of his chindhood friend and new genius transfer student 
 who are both in love with him
 Yes, high school love-drama only in chinese version this time
 Even tho protagonist's family situation is so desperate, i coudnt even imagine what it would be like in his shoes
 It kind of makes it hard to connect if you know what i mean
Translation is really bad, its not machine translation, someone actualy made effort to translate it, but its just 
 not english
 Even then, text is still understandable, if you make the effort
What suprises me most is price for this VN, i mean i bought it for 1,2€ with release discount 
 for that price you get VN that could easily sell for 20 - 30 € (if the translation was good)
 Its only first 3 chapters of the story (rest should be added later as DLC
) but its still over 20 hours worth of reading material
If i bought it for 30€ i would whine about translation and gave it negative review but for 1,2€ there is really nothing to complain about
So final verdict
 I like this VN and i have enjoyed reading it despite bad translation

Couldn't really get past the broken english

Had some problems trying to figure out how to play in English, but after following the developer's instructions, launching it from Steam gives you the option to play it in English
 I was launching it from the desktop shortcut
 I never launch games straight from Steam, so if you try launching it from a desktop shortcut it will automatically default to the Chinese version
 Game looks amazing, great price, and so far I'm really loving the music

my own fish shot and killed me

First, it's a text-based game
There are great illustrations, but the game play is all about reading and responding
Second, a single play-through of the game is relatively short; maybe an hour or two
Third, it's gay
The main character is gay
The relationships are gay
The whole approach is gay
It's just as advertised
If you're okay with all three of the above, it's absolutely a great game
The dialogue is witty and frequently laugh out loud funny
The situations and choices range from realistic, to absurdly bizarre, to "why doesn't this ever happen to me
"
One of the major strengths of the game is its branching in seemingly insignificant dialogue choices
Deciding to wear a hat can change your entire life
After a number of playthroughs, I'm still being surprised by the variety of outcomes possible and that some of the paths are more poignant than "happy"
Occasionally, stepping through dialague that you've already been through to get to another choice can be a little long, but that's a minor nit and the payoff has usually been well worth it
The game as delivered used censored illustrations of some of the encounter screens, but I consider this a NSFW game in any case with partial nudity and some written dialogue displayed in large text on the screen
For personal use, the uncensored screens are a fun update noted in the forums
Overall, I found it engaging, fun, and worth well more than the $15
Posted: 14 October
Fantastic game
 Very well written with witty dialogue
 A huge cast of likable (and dateable/screwable) characters
 There are serious endings you have to really work towards, hot endings that are more for
"fun", and there are also some really funny "WTF" endings
 The art is amazing
 The sex scenes are incredibly hot (play them uncensored
)
 I'm so glad Steam is giving gay people a platform in the gaming community
 This game is important
Dream Daddy by the Game Grumps is a good game made by good people, but it doesn't take the risky moves Coming Out On Top does
 What Coming Out On Top lacks in mini-games, it makes up for in genuine, realistic love stories and gay relationships that are actually sexual
 This game gets pornographic if that's where you want to take the story
 It doesn't shame or lecture the player, there are tons of fantasies you can live out in this game
 The steamy (ha, STEAMy) scenes are clearly made for people who appreciate the male body
 There's no fade to black after you start kissing
 COOT has the balls (lol, balls) to actually let you make choices in these scenes
 Want to be a top
 Want to be a bottom
 Cool, you can choose
 But even more than that, what do you say during this event
 How do you want you character to feel
 Is this too much, and do you want to stop
 You can
 Or do you want to keep going and reach the
climax of the scene
 WHERE do you want to
finish
 The amount of choices you get in this game seem endless, even down to picking if the guys have body hair and beards, or if you want to use condoms or not
 This game doesn't hold back
 It's for grown ups, like the old adventure games of the 1980s used to be
Most importantly, this game can be a real tool for people who are thinking about coming out
 It really shows how it's not the end of the world - but it's also not always a cake walk
 You can have a really depressing ending, or you can be brave and fight through some tough choices and get the happy ending you want
Coming Out On Top gets an A+ from me
 A LOT of hard work went into this, and it really shows

"a sim meeting app"
 yeah sure
 whatever
 I choose to test it only because it was queer and i felt
judgy, lets admit it
So it really was about intellectual curiosity to see how well made (design, story, gameplay - I'm a game dev as well) and open mind it would be (playing with stereotypes and fantasms without falling into ultra predictable boredomness)
Damn, I was not deceived
 It's surprisingly really enjoyable (it's ofc way too short ;p )
I never even thought of playing a 'meeting app sim', so I can't really compare thou
Posted: 17 October
One of the best games I have played
 It's nice to feel represented and be a part of the many romances that I've only seen straight people play out
 Whether you have a crush on your best friend, or your professor, or the quarterback, this game lets you live it as the gay man you are
 It also makes gay relationships seem realistic, and doesn't rely heavily upon stereotypes
 All around, this game makes the gay me feel heard, and empowered
Posted: 16 October
Bought this when it first came out years ago
 Really hot
 Between the various guys there's fantasies for pretty much anyone into guys
 It's also just really well written, funny and entertaining
 One of my favourite games
Posted: 16 October
This game defines the term "hidden gem" for it has everything you'd ever want from a dating sim
 Beautifully written story with characters that you simply can't get enough of
 I originally bought this game in 2014 simply looking for a game with hot guys but man, this really exceeded all my expectations
 So glad that it was released on Steam :)
Posted: 16 October
I cannot recommend this game enough
 Bought it on Kickstarter some years ago and didn't cry over the 20 €
 Pro:Finally (
) a dating sim with non-anime artwork, excellent writing, funny lines, lovely pictures, explicit content (if you're over 18), loveable characters 
 and it is all gay
 Hurray
 You can even decide if each of the characters (plus the mc) has beard and/or body hair
 Same goes for all the one night stands
Very nice and helpful developer who does her best to assist with problems
There are just two negative points for me:1
 The music lacks a bit but that's a minor thing since the rest is really done very well
 Apart from the opening track the rest of the music is quite boring
 2
 Some routes are way longer than others
 If you happen to like Alex best, you may find his route is not that much worked out like, for example Amos
 But maybe that is just my personal opinion and you might be satisfied with it
Fish are evil

***Check steam forum boards for instructions from developer on how change to de-censored version***I played this game before it was on steam and I can honestly say that no other gay visual novel compares
 The writing is witty and fun and honestly, if the naughty bits where removed I would still enjoy the game
 Each character has a distinct personality and while I don't think all the routes where equal I found myself playing through each route multiple times to try to get all the CGs
 Not to mention the one-off "Bro-finder dates" which are hilarious and amazing
Coming out on Top is an equally fun, funny, and steamy game
 Obscurasoft made one of my favorite visual novels to date and is well worth a try if you’re into man on man action

I actually have never played a VN before this one so i can't really gauge it accordingly
 I saw it on the store and thought to myself that "well i have this friend that always tells me how great VN's can be and since the guys got my attention"
 In all honesty i thought
this will be a corny piece of crap since i never found a game that respects the context of this game
 Well i was surprised
 The writing was witty and i could actually read all of the content without the need to cringe
 The game in general made me feel ok to be gay and did not try to dirty it or make me feel ashamed so the main thing i want to say is thank you to the developer for making it
 I don't know if i will ever play another VN but never say never especially if this developer makes more
Posted: 29 April, 2016
First impressions of this game are excellent
 Pros - amazing art style- japanese voices for basically every character but your own- 10 routes
 There are a lot of people to choose between and you can have routes with girls or multiple people
 Sadly, there are some routes with basically no romance
 (ie, the one guy who is so friendzoned that the protagonist Fuka thinks he's a girl at first)- you can disable your portrait if you want to be more immersed- there's a tonne of options in settings
 Plenty of save slots, audio options for literally every character bar a few, an option to full screen and windowed mode
 Also, lovely options for skipping- tonnes of options
 I'm 20 minutes in and I've already been given 5 options
 - super sexy and unique characters- a metric tonne of endings
 There are bad endings and even an ending where you choose to dump a person and date another, which is insanely rare for an otome
- it doesn't demand you pick a person to try dating in the very beginning, which is brilliant because you get to know the people and then make a decision
- the heroine isn't a complete waste of space- there's a log of previous dialogue that you can scroll up at any time in case you miss something someone said or don't understand a character's response- you can name your character (this has been known to cause glitches, but the developers are very attentive and fix this as it happens)- there's no percentages for available romances so you go in blind- the characters have clearly defined personalities, no more guessing what to say randomly and being totally wrongCons- there's no percentages for available romances so you go in blind- no steam overlay and no taking screenshots- no steam achievements- no steam achievements which makes it stupidly hard to remember what endings you've actually done
 There is a grand master ending unlocked after you completely finish routes, and I think a lot of people will find that hard to keep track of what they've done
 (Edit - there is a CG gallery that tracks overall completion
)- the fullscreen mode lowers the quality of the images (slightly, not dramatically) so all the crisp screenshot examples on the steam store are not so crisp when you actually play it
 It isn't bad in windowed mode or normal mode, however
 - I've come across a few words that are itallian or similar sounding, which kind of threw me off
 It's no more confusing than your typical "onee-san" but they're odd and confused me a little, at first
- it's really expensive, the most expensive otome I have seen on steam to date, but I feel it's deserving of the price
 The only thing I can think that is remotely this quality is Amnesia, and I'd pay double for Amnesia if I had to
I'll be commenting more and editing this review as I play, but this is all I have right now
Posted: 24 December, 2016
I've spend nearly ten hours playing this game
 I've completed few routes (some of Oz guys routes, Scarlet, Brother and Caesar) and I must say, I don't see myself playing this game in the near future, even though there is a secret ending to unlock and a lot more characters to pursue
I will admit, that this game was enjoyable at times (especially during first playthrough)
 It has a lot of content (pursuable characters, CGs, choices, extra scenes, endings, special ending, etc
)
 Translation is good
 Graphic is beautiful
 Story is intriguing, even though poorly executed
 I liked most of pursuable characters, despite them being rather cliche
 If you are an otome games fan and don't see any issues with the things I will list below, I can imagine you may have a lot of fun with this game
 For me, it started as a pleasant experience and quickly transformed into a boring chore
Bad stuff:Protagonist
 This is a first point for a reason
 I feel that Fuka (name is changeable) is what, ultimately, ruins the whole game for me
 I don't think I ever generated this level of hatred towards playable character
 And believe me, I am very well used to idiotic protagonists, with no personality
 The thing is, Fuka is not only brainless, useless, constantly happy for no reason and naive
 She's also unlikable as hell
 I read a few reviews and I've noticed that some people consider third-person narration as an immersion breaker
 I don't think that's the issue
 You can present character's actions, thoughts, reflections and motives in that way
 The problem is, Fuka has almost none of those and even first-person narration wouldn't fix that
 It would enhance it, because then it would became painfully obvious
 She's a walking, talking, smiling plant
 If that wasn't enough, she behave in a way that makes it even harder to sympathize with her
 She says things that are obviously hurtful to other characters (particularly on Scarlet's route)
 She's not caring at all - there are moments, where her chosen one is about to fight someone and she has absolutely nothing to say about it
 Sometimes literally, because even though she's in the same room, other characters decide her fate
 All her "I love you" moments, seem like she is just going with the flow
 And I absolutely "love" the moments, where, after guy risks his life for her and gets hurt over her stupidity, she decide to stop talking with him, because someone told her to
 Bravo, Fuka
 You made me not care about you in the slightest
 No drama, no tension
 I think this game wasn't as bad as it could be for me, because I quickly stopped treating it seriously and manage to look at it as a "silly story"
 As soon as
assassin, who is going after protagonist, instead of killing her, informs her, that he's about to do that, and then run after her through town and then, after she bumps into someone, he kind of threatens her and then walks away, I already knew, there is absolutely nothing to be afraid in this game
 I was right, since
the same assassin comes back and basically announce what he's about to do every God damn time, instead of actually doing anything
 Same goes for drama
 Fuka ruins every more-serious scene she's in
Action happens off-screen
 You hear about something really cool, like festival or fight, but then you get transfer to another day, after all that is over
 At best, you will get a few sentenced about what happened
 At worst, you'll get nothing
 Which leads me to
Unresolved scenes
 So fight is just about to happen and then
 We have next scene and I don't even know how it ended
 Did they kill the other guy
 Did he run away
 Did they let them go
 Did they arrest him
 I guess I should just assume, because game gives zero explanation
 Btw, this a perfect example of moment, when third-person narrative would be perfect to give us, players, some insight, without writing extra scenes/dialogues (as, apparently, fight was completely unimportant), but nah
 Who cares
"Loading screens"
 I'm not sure if this is what they are, because you can skip them with the rest of the text, which shouldn't happen if it would be a loading screen, should it
 This looks like some sort of artistic decision and it was a terrible one
 They didn't bother me that much during my first playthrough
 During every single one next, they were painfully to look at - literally, as the picture and subtitles are very bright on a black background
Rushed routes
 Oz guys have the most fleshed out routes, but even those feel disappointing and lacking
 As for other characters, things happens, because they do, and characters do stuff, because they do, without any motivation, reason or previous setup
Endings
 Again, rushed
 They usually aren't established in any way and honestly I didn't get even one ending that would feel satisfying
Wasted potential
 Transferring well-known characters to the alternate world, where various mafias rule the city, is a great idea
 Setting is amazing, the vision of endless conflict and possible fights intriguing and terrifying
 This game should be much more darker, greedy and action-packed, but this is JUST a love story
 And it's not even good at that
Price
 Price is always a subjective thing and visual novels are often over-priced because of small customer base, but I always try to compare reviewed games to other, currently available at the marker
 My reflection is that:Quantity-wise it is worth it
 If you are looking for a game, that you will play for 20-50 hours, if you want voice-acting, lots of pursuable characters, secret endings and all that good stuff, you will find it here
Quality-wise it isn't worth it
 You can get better plot, deeper characters and better love stories even with some outstanding, free visual novels, not to mention payed ones
Conclusion:If you are willing to overlook classic otome game flaws, poor story-telling and horrible protagonist, you may enjoy it
 Otherwise, spend your money on something else
 
Posted: 29 April, 2016
Overview After about a month of eager excitement, I can definitely say that I'm not disappointed
 Just as the screenshots showcase, the art is beautiful and beautifully detailed
 The options menu has plenty of changeable things (i
e, background music, effects, and voices), including, surprisingly, individual voice controls, which I didn't expect, and the ability to re-size the window box entirely or have a full-screen (which has a minor impact on quality, so I prefer windowed)
 It also has detailed backgrounds, interesting and unique characters, and superb voice acting
 Also, thus far, I haven't seen any major bugs or translation issues; though there are a few instances where the dialogue will refer to the default Heroine name rather than the name you chose--but that's rather minor, IMO
Overall--if you're a fan of a) otome Visual Novels, b) stories or games based on or around fairy-tales, and c) a thoroughly enjoyable experience, I wholly recommend OZMAFIA
UPDATE(April 30th): Also, for a perspective on length, my first route took me almost 7 hours
 Needless to say, it was a blast
UPDATE(May 1st): It seems that the mistake of the game showing the default Heroine name rather than your own has been fixed
 It never really bothered me much, but I'm happy that they care about their costumer's enjoyment so much
Posted: 1 May, 2016
I really enjoyed OZMAFIA
, despite the fact that you have to shout the name
 With so many characters to choose from, and 2-4 endings each (none of which are technically "bad"), there's enough story there to more than justify the cost
That said, I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone
 There's plenty of violence and blood all throughout, and while it's mostly written and not really gory there are some bloody sprites, and CGs that might make people uncomfortable
 The True Ending is also exceptionally violent, even considering the rest of the game
There are also two drugging scenes, and another scene that was likely the result of a drugging
Posted: 6 June, 2016
Posted: 5 March
Personally I really liked OZMAFIA
 I'll put some pros and cons to help you understand whyPros:	-The art is AMAZING
-The CGs-10 Routes-Over 20 endings -*Transfer endings-It takes roughly 4-7 hours to get pure heart ending A or B (the good endings)-There are NO "bad" endings
 Some are worse then others but nothing too bad-The characters -The music-The stories (and how insteresting and unique they are)-Sha la la la la la la la la la -**The protaginist-There are some really sweet moments in each route (except for the brothel route I assume)-Almost every character, even non-important ones get some art done for their facesCons:	-Sometimes the writing goes from very good to just ok for some certain scenes-THE LOADING SCREANS
 After the mid way point in a route there will be a loading screan after every interaction-The Protaganist (yes i've listed her twice keep reading and you'll see why)-Unresolved sceanes or buildup for something and never finding out what happned -***The brothel route*Transfer EndingsTransfer endings are really unique for otome games
 What will happen is if you are on someones route, sometimes depending on the answers you pick, you can leave the guy you are currently with to be with another guy without feeling too horrible (which was one of my main concerns) and get tranfer ending A or B for that guy
 The transfer endings don't take too long (20min-50min) to complete and sometimes they will explain or hint at things in their own route
**The ProtaginistFuka (or whatever you want to name her) Is a bit of an odd character
 She's not the worst otome protaginist but she's far from the best
 In most routes
(Especially in the Oz routes) she's really nice and sweet and what you would typically expect from a otome game
 In some routes though (Brothel, Kyrie, Caramia and sometimes Scarlets) shes a really diffrent person rather being rude, not standing up for herself and just letting someone else control her
 You'll probably find yourself yelling at your laptop saying WHY WOULD YOU DO/SAY THAT
 The best example I can give without spoiling anything is Kyrie's route as a whole
 He will contantly boss Fuka around and bully her
 He even says "I just want to see you in agony" and stuff like that on multiple occasions
 The upside is things do eventually get better but not until the endings
 (Kyrie's endings are pretty sweet compared to his route)
Even in the transfer endings he dosen't really care if you leave him or not making his route feel a little more empty
(got a little off topic there sorry)***The Brothel RouteThis is a really controvercial route
 It ruined the game for a lot of people so be prepared
 Personally, I didn't mind it too much because it explains a lot about the world you are in but like I just said, the MC is a completly diffrent person
 There is a drugging scene and an abuse scene so if you get triggred easily, rather don't play the game or just avoid doing this route (you won't get 100% completion but if it will make you hate the game, its probably best if you don't play it)For order of routes, I would say do these people first to last:-Caramia-Axel-Kyrie-Pashet-Scarlet-Caesar-Brothel-Robin Hood-Soh-HamelinYou can do whatever route you want to but if you play it in this order, things won't get spoiled before you play that route
 But yes, I do reccomend the game, it may have some classic otome flaws but it really is a great game overall :DEdit: When you choose to spend time with someone you'll spend time with them and then go back to content you've already read on other routes so the first route you do will take a LOT longer then any other route you do if you choose to skip content you've already seenEdit 2: I have just 100% this game and holly hell ;-; The epilouge (can't spell lol) was such an emotinal rolleroaster
 I really just want to hug Kyrie

I've just started playing this game but it's beautiful in both art and music, and the voices are all sooooooo good
 I've been waiting for this release since probably around January when I was looking around for new games to play when I saw a tumblr page on it about it being released on steam soon
And here I am
 The moment it was released, I immediately bought the game and got it started up
 Overall, I'm very happy about this game being released and everything about it is absolutely gorgeous in my eyes despite it just being released
 And the music is so beautiful and gorgeous as well, I could listen to it forever
 To be honest, I sometimes come onto the store page JUST to listen to the video for the song
 The art is amazing and I absolutely love that it's made by the same person who did the art for Diabolik Lovers
Posted: 29 April, 2016
I haven't completed a full route but I feel the need to write up a review regardless
 For what I have played I can easily say that it's money well spent
 When I first spied this game in the upcoming games list I knew that I had to have it and I knew that I was willing to pay up to $40 for it
 It looks like a high end title to me, it doesn't look like a VN that's going to take me 2-3 hours per route to complete and I'm so happy that I'm right
 It takes me back to the good otome games, the ones that are released for the Vita and the 3DS
 The otome games like Amnesia, Code Realize, Norn9, and Hakuoki
 I was instantly taken back to the building up feeling, the thought that I actually have to work for the guy's affection
 I actually have to take the dang time to get to know the men of the game and it feels great to be playing such a title once again
 I want more titles like this to come to America
A lot of people fret over grammar issues in VN's that are released on steam, I don't blame you
 They suck, they just do
 Ozmafia laughs at them, they say "We have a beautiful art style and excellent grammar, we make portraits for unimportant characters
" This game is so detailed that shopkeepers that we don't see at all really, have portraits drawn up for them to give us more of a visual aspect to it
 I was super impressed, the music is pleasant as well
My main complaint is small I must admit, the female (Fuka) isn't voiced
 All of the male characters are voiced, including unimportant characters, and even all of the female characters are voiced, except for Fuka
 She's not and she's the main character, so this sadens me
This is a minor complaint and it doesn't take away much if anything from the game for me
 The CG's are obviously gorgeous and given out like candy, the backgrounds can be a little lackluster but the character modules are to die for
 I remember a moment when Kyrie didn't have his hat on and then he picked it up and put it on, the module instantly changed to one with his hat on, simple details that made me smile
 The characters themselves seem very interesting
 It's your typical "Who do you want to see today
" kind of game that doesn't feed you the right answer to the choices
 I love that
 Each character is unique and takes on a classic fairy tale like character ranging from Puss in Boots to Hansel and Gretal
 Buy it
Especially buy it now since it's on sale
Thank you for reading

You found a really good looking person and decided to say Hi
 Unfortunately, talking to him turned out to be a plot to get you killed and you found yourself running away from him
 Amidst the busy streets, you bumped into someone who turns out to be a mafia boss
A charming and sweet otome game that has quite a kick at the true end, Ozmafia still remains one of my favorite otome games since it was released in Japan
 Now translated and localized to English by Mangagamer, I now fully enjoyed being immersed in this exciting fairytale spin-off
There are 12 attainable characters
 10 endings not counting bad ends and divergent routes (so there are more than 10 endings)
 You also need to get all CG’s to unlock Grand Ending and Epilogue
The over-all gameplay is long and it’s worth the purchase ^^
Posted: 9 May, 2016
Ozmafia isn't heavy on story but what it lacks in quality makes up for it in quantity :3The extra scenes that show up when you go through a route for the 2nd time is a nice bonus but some of it is just very short and stupid
 The voice acting tends to cut off in some scenes but that's not really an issue if you're used to it
 Having a lot of characters to choose from and routes to go through it has 26 endings not including the Epilogue
 I find most of the side characters okay but Ande was really annoying -_-'Overall I had fun going through the many stories and endings this game had

No, Amnesia: Memories isn't a horror game, unless playing a female protagonist who can date four different guys (and maybe N from Pokémon) in a Japanese visual novel makes you break out into a cold sweat
 If you keep reading, I’m going to assume you totally came here on purpose and share my strange passion for dating hot, fictional men who just can’t help falling for me…with the help of a walkthrough, anyway
 (Sadly, I have a rotten personality and can never self-insert
)http://steamcommunity

id=506376209Hey look, otome fans: it’s Amnesia in English on Steam
 Those who have been desperately hoping for an English localization of Amnesia (and may even be veterans of the Not-So-Civil Dialoveable-Amnesiac War) will probably get this regardless of reviews
 I may just be writing this for my own amusement, but hey, why not
 Maybe there's someone on the fence
Or in a cage
Like many of the Japanese games making their way to Steam now, Amnesia: Memories is a port
 Unlike most Japanese Steam games’ ports, however, this is Amnesia’s English debut, alongside a simultaneous Vita release
 The text is all translated into English with the Japanese voice acting intact
Fortunately, Amnesia makes a good transition from handheld to PC
 Things that may seem like annoyances at first—such as being forced to left-click to progress the text—are easily overcome thanks to the ability to remap keys and controller support
The game itself looks great in 1080p as well, with easily legible text, though close-ups of characters and backgrounds suffer from minor aliasing
 While the character sprites and CGs are beautiful, the backgrounds seem like stock photographs and simple line drawings with your 12-year-old cousin’s favorite “Unicorn Diarrhea” Instagram filter applied
 However, my BFF (who normally has good taste) calls them “stylized” and “appropriate” so it could just be my severe unicorn allergy speaking
 http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=506379697Plus there are mini-games, so you get to beat your boyfriend(s) in air hockey and cackle maniacally at the first hint of their sad, sad anime boyfriend tears
 Or if they beat you, Oh my god I was playing in windowed mode and I accidentally Skyped my mom when I meant to fling the puck back at you, okay, so get over yourself, Kent
 There’s also Inexplicably Violent Rock-Paper-Scissors if you prefer
 (I would’ve enjoyed seeing additional mini-games, such as Flowerpot-Dodging or Knee-the-Yandere-in-the-Groin, but I understand that this is a visual novel first and foremost
)Amnesia is a traditional, story-focused visual novel without any stat-raising; endings are determined entirely by the series of choices you make and the parameters those choices affect
 Exploring alternate realities and unraveling the mystery of your past(s) is an intriguing approach that takes precedence over the romance in most routes, and completing all five routes is necessary to reveal the full picture
 I recommend seeking out the bad endings even if you’re normally averse to your boyfriends hating, stabbing, or dismembering you
 Then again, I probably took too much fiendish delight in finding new ways to get what’s-her-face killed
Each route begins with already well-established relationships, though our heroine has to relearn (and hopefully remember) the exact nature of those relationships over one month
 Having amnesia’s rough—even when you regain consciousness and immediately find out you have a hot boyfriend
 Ikki’s and Kent’s routes felt like the best introduction to Amnesia’s setting and made the parameters feel especially relevant to the story
 There’s no common route at all, so the scenes and events in each guy’s route are unique
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=506377418The love interests themselves were diverse and well-written, though how appealing the routes and characters themselves are likely comes down to personal preference
 I absolutely loved one route, enjoyed two very much, plodded through another because I totally already knew whodunit, and then one I fdgsffdgguyuggyhuyghgyuyuyuygugujyguyuyyujuyyhgnugngnnggyhdfrtgdhftrsgfdSorry, I must have gotten dizzy after recovering a repressed memory
If you’re expecting light, breezy romance, this isn’t your best bet, but the feeling that you’re one misstep away from a horrible fate is far stronger in some routes than others
 Your adorable giant bug sidekick Orion serves as the game’s main source of comic relief and also doubles as the heroine’s personality, because she apparently lost hers with her memories
 I’m not a fan of “blank slate” visual novel protagonists (probably because of my aforementioned rotten personality), and it was off-putting that the MC doesn’t speak, with Orion reacting, thinking, and narrating in her stead
 Luckily, Orion is the best
 THE BEST
 Even taking my (exaggerated) criticisms into account, I enjoyed Amnesia very much and am thrilled that it got such a fantastic English localization from Idea Factory International
 It took me 47 hours total to complete all the routes with their many endings and they were hours very well spent
 I hope this is the first of many Otomate releases on Steam and I’d love for Amnesia to help prove that there’s a market for Japanese otome games here
One last thing—I forgot to make fun of the guys’ outfits, which made them look like they all rolled out of a Hot Topic going-out-of-business sale circa 1995 and woke up in a giant barrel full of rejected Final Fantasy characters’ belts decades later
 There, my duty is now fulfilled; it is time for me to leave you
 One day (probably today), you will forget ever reading this review…Note: The publisher provided each volunteer beta tester—including me
—with a complimentary Steam copy of the game as a thank-you for testing
 Beta testers weren’t asked to write reviews (only bug reports), so this review is all me, baby

I'm a 100% straight guy and I never liked Otome games
I were only into Bishoujos
BUT I FREAKING CRIED after finishing the last Good End
THIS IS NOT JUST A FLIRTING SIMULATOR FOR GIRLSIf you are a guy and you feel all Otomes are that, try this man
You will feel like that is not the case
Thanks to the girl (devil) who showed me this game
So yeah , Brb, gonna go punching a wall
Posted: 22 June
(Abuse trigger warnings for this game, FYI)If you want a good otome where the MC has personality, the story resonates and the characters are attaching, run away
 BUT if you have a quirky morbid sense of humor, this game is FANTASTIC
The MC is a brain-damaged piece of tuna who gets tossed into a vat of sharks
 To be fair, her passiveness does actually have a plot reason, unlike a lot of other MCs, but that doesn't help your urge to shake her to see if you can hear her brain rattle
 Her dazed baby bunny impression just highlights how crazytoons everything else is
 Characters are walking tropes dialed up to 11, dressed like renaissance fair addicts who got stranded naked one night in a Hot Topic and had to make do
 The story and romances are often plodding, but just as you're nodding off to sleep you'll hit a wrong option and see the bland love story twist and end horribly in a variety of entertaining ways
 For best effect and an exponential increase in the WTF factor, go through in order of line-up: Start with the verbally and emotionally abusive childhood friend; then the playboy with the supernatural roofie ability; continue on with Borg unit 3 of 5; then the other childhood friend, the sweet, sincere one - oh yeah, definitely go out with that guy
 What a keeper
 And once you've survived all those yahoos, you unlock the Mystery Dude
 IT PUTS THE LOTION ON ITS SKIN
 Some parts are boring and some are cringeworthy, and a lotta people will find this downright disturbing, but overall I had just as much fun playing this VN as many others, though probably not in the way the creators of this game intended
 (To be fair, Mystery Dude's story actually turned out to be a bit of a page turner dovetailing neatly back into the other four stories, with the dark humor - or tragic angst if that's how you read it - hitting its apogee, and it actually improved my overall impression of the whole as an actual game rather than a five car pile-up
 Mileage may vary, however
 Definitely get this one on sale, if you can

The only game in recent memory where you have to get senpais to notice you in order to get your memory back
Amnesia: Memories is a port of a 2011 Playstation Portable visual novel, where the player takes control of a young woman who loses her memories and is forced to retrace her steps (and romance one of five vaguely-androgynous men) in order to get them back
 Classified as an "otome" (girl) game, Amnesia is equal parts fascinating and hilarious
The game starts with your character entering a spirit world, where a being named Orion tells you that he has somehow become lodged in your consciousness, and can't leave until you recover your memories
 At that point, you gain the choice of one of four different paths (with one unlockable later), and you have to make decisions over the course of the story in terms how much information you gather and who you choose to romance/hang out with
The most interesting part of Amnesia is that there's a lot of replay value
 There are five distinct storylines, each with a wildly different set of situations and stories that occur
 I was part of the beta testing team for this, and was initially struck by how separate each path is
 The first storyline I played through (Shin's) had the characters attempting to solve a mystery, while the second was so off-the-wall that it might qualify as a parody of visual novels
I know the opening line might seem a bit flippant, but that is the crux of the game
 You can only trigger your memories by spending as much time as possible with your respective suitor(s), who have a bad habit of not revealing anything important to you until later on in the storyline
From a plot standpoint, Amnesia is absolutely bonkers
 In a good way, of course
 The novelty of being a girl trying to collect information about her missing memories is balanced by a set of off-the-wall characters
 Depending on which storyline you play, you'll run into a pair of childhood friends competing for your affections (one of whom locks you in a dog cage for half of his storyline), another teen who has somehow been gifted with the ability to be attractive to every woman he sees (thus explaining why he has a harem of girls who harass the player character) and a "Mr
 Nice Guy" tutor
The art style really sets this apart from other visual novels
 Characters are expressive, blinking, moving their mouths and speaking in full Japanese
 The backgrounds are generally detailed and varied, and there are nice interstitial moments that break up each scene
There are also a pair of minigames that can be accessed through the main menu, but I didn't spend enough time to have much of an opinion
 They're very simple (rock-paper-scissors), but are a neat diversion for anyone who wants to go for high scores
In the end, Amnesia: Memories is one of the most interesting games I've played this year, and certainly among the best visual novels I've experienced in quite some time
 It's well worth a look and offers a lot of value for the money
Definitely worth a look

Thought I was carried for romantic moonwalk on the rooftop, but then he throws me to the death
10/10 Would get thrown again
Posted: 6 December, 2015
Part of the reason I played Amnesia: Memories - my first Otome game - is because of an early GameCenter DX episode
 Shinya Arino was challenged to win somebody's heart in Angelique Trois, an entry in a highly-regarded Otome series
 Despite spending 13 hours, following guides, and doing seemingly everything right, his confession of love to Seiran was met with: "It's 1000 years too soon for you to make fun of me
 Wash your face and try again
" Working so hard only to fail has to be absolutely heart-wrenching, and yet
strangely exciting
 The strength of a game is in its ability to engage everyone outside of its target audience
 On the surface, an Otome game involves romancing attractive men, which to a straight male gamer like myself, doesn't sound all that enticing
 However, by utilizing a compelling narrative and/or intriguing game-play elements, I'll find myself immersed in every aspect of the game
 Despite my inexperience with the genre, I believe Amnesia: Memories is a fantastic game
 It couples a strong plot with great characters, and the few game-play elements bring everything together
Due to the meddling of a strange kid named Orion, you've lost your memories
 As pay-back for the mess he's put you in, Orion offers to guide you through five parallel worlds
 In each world, you meet the same characters, but their personalities - as well as yours - are different
 Moreover, the world you choose determines which man you could have a serious relationship with
 There are other events that can occur, some funny, some dangerous, but all worth experiencing
 Whether you find true love, see the story to its conclusion, or even meet a miserable end, is all determined by what you say and the actions that you perform
As in real life, the lack of communication can ruin any relationship
 Due to your amnesia, you won't know the right thing to say, so you'll have to pay attention to conversations and keep track of the details
 While it would be very easy to use a guide and guarantee the best endings, I think actually putting in the effort to know someone is far more rewarding
 On the other hand, my initial play-throughs mostly resulted in failure, so maybe I'm not cut out for videogame relationships
 The point is that the less hints you have to work with, the more likely you'll become attached to the person you're interested in
 As your story progresses, a handy chart tracks your relationship with the male lead, as well as suspicions due to your lack of memories
 It's amusing that one of the few distinctly "game-like" elements actually isn't all that effective
 For one, it isn't always clear whenever you say the right or wrong thing
 Orion or one of the other characters may chime in, but sometimes you're left in the dark
 The charts are more likely to shift when your attention is elsewhere, not when you're saving, reloading, and looking for the slightest change in your "does he love me
" gauge
 Furthermore, this is all the more reason to not refer to a guide early on
 After all, real relationships aren't forged through the use of cheat-sheets
As for the guys themselves, I think the writers did a fantastic job giving them plenty of depth
 I mean sure, they're attractive enough, but that's to be expected
 The most appealing aspect is finding out what they're really all about, and discovering just how much they care
 These guys know exactly what to say and when to say it, so those special moments really have a lot of impact
 The average story takes about 4-5 hours to complete, and if you're really into someone, there's going to be those few times where he'll really turn up the charm
 I'll admit, I get a little light-headed whenever Shin blushes
 On the other hand, a couple of the storylines are more intriguing and disturbing than they are romantic
 If you've browsed the community hub, or read some of the other reviews, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about
 If not, then my advice is to play through the stories from top to bottom, exactly as they're listed in the game
 In any case, there are more than enough dark and mysterious elements that make for very compelling entertainment
 This game also benefits from having high production values
 Aside from the heroine, everyone is fully-voiced, and the acting is more than serviceable
 The CG scenes are very nicely drawn, and the soundtrack is decent enough for setting the mood
 The fast-forward system makes replays a breeze, and the mini-games are an amusing diversion
 The backgrounds are a little washed-out and bland, but they're the last thing you'll notice when playing the game
 Again, this is my very first experience with the genre, but I can tell that the developers really cared to deliver an appealing product
 Although, I did notice a few typos in this localization
 It's nothing major, especially considering the size of the game, but all the same it's worth mentioning
All in all, Amnesia: Memories is a superb example of an Otome Visual Novel
 Not only are the stories well-told, but the characters are endearing, and everything looks and sounds wonderful
 It'll take 25+ hours to experience all of the content, so anyone out there wondering if they'll get their money's worth doesn't need to be concerned
 Still, I have to admit that I'm a little frustrated with myself
 I played through all of the stories and not once was I able to get a good ending without a guide
 There was always that one moment where I treated the guy I was dating as a third wheel, or didn't appreciate his gestures of affection, or failed his math test
 Ahh
if only relationships were as easy to understand as Dark Souls

I've wanted this game since I heard about the Japanese version back in 2013
 After it finally coming out in English, I am not disappointed
 Beautiful art, pixel men who love me, a lot of CG's of said men, and around 20+ hours of gameplay
Do not delay, get your hot men today
Edit: I got to spend all of last night in a cage, then I fell in a well and died
 Very good

Well, after first watching the anime for this, there's not many suprises in here for me
 But, it's definitely much better than the anime
 Honestly, I was kind of hoping this to be more dark - but the lighthearted touch in it isn't bad, either
 If you're looking for a nice time with guys that like you, give this a try
 I would guess there's around 40+ hours for you to spend in here, and I'd say it's worth the money
 There's tons of pictures to unlock, minigames, extras
 The art's beautiful
 Not to mention, most of the usual heroine dialogue is done by Orion, so it's fully voiced - which is a breath of fresh air for me
Orion starts out as super annoying though, but he grows on you
 After two playthroughs, I'm hoping I will find a path where I can have a happy ending with that adorable spirit that's always there for you
My complaint would be the lack of no quicksave option
 Although right clicking and selecting save isn't that big of a deal, when you're searching for the right options it does make you wish there was a quicker way
Here's to hoping they will add more japanese otome games to steam
 Lets prove there's big enough of a fanbase to make it worth their money

I'm sorry about giving this a thumbs down, but I'm just so disappointed by this game
 I might try again and go for some achievements, but I'm pretty close to uninstalling right now
 I sincerely hope there are updates that will improve gameplay because I hate leaving a negative review
I wasn't Huniepop's target audience (at all), but it was fun and fresh and funny
 I love management sims, and I like the progression of clicker games, so I expected to enjoy this, but it's just boring
 It goes nowhere
 It's so quick and shallow that it feels pointless
 They're calling it fast-paced in the description, but being brief, dull, and repetitive doesn't measure up
 There are no real gains to restarting, so why bother
I have no idea how it took so long to release either
 I almost feel as though I'm missing a huge part of the game
 After a few minutes of playing, I was like, is this it
 (The 'Is it in yet
' response of gaming)
 There was potential, but it completely misses the mark
 It's more like a free flash game
 Sticking an adult industry theme on top doesn't make it any more interesting
I had no problems with the artwork changing, and I wasn't expecting Huniepop 2
 I was looking forward to something new
 But I'm not even sure what kind of game to call this one
 It's not a good clicker without a restart that gets some kind of bonus to get further/do better the next round (the clothes/hair unlocks could give better stats, for example)
 It's not a good management game because you don't get to do a lot other than dragging girls onto a task or holding down a button to get your money faster
 Even the achievements are uninspired
Huniecam isn't long enough to really care about, and there's extremely little of the humour I expected, and even less of the voice acting
 At this time, I can't recommend, and that's so disappointing because I was ridiculously hyped for this game's release
Posted: 4 April, 2016
HuniePop was a perfect guilty pleasure - silly, yet funny, perfect to unwind and challenging at the same time, surprisingly enjoyable and satisfying to play
HunieCam is just boring
 I know there were some discussions about art style, but this isn't what bothers me
 There's really no substance in this game
 It's not a good time management either
 It feels rushed and too fast paced, to the point where it feels like a chore rather than fun experience
 Worth to play only out of curiosity, nothing more

my god this is the most ADDICTIVE game I've played
When I first started playing I was like ''meh'' but within 20 minutes I was hooked without even realizing and eventually had hit 3 hours of playtime non-stop
This was a STEAL for $1 during the steam summer sale
 Get on this ASAP
Posted: 9 April, 2016
While I very much enjoyed HuniePop, I thought that going into HunieCam Studio that I would absolutely love it- especially as a fan of games like Adventure Capitalist and Cookie Clicker
 But I found out by playing it just how barebones the gameplay feels
 In the game your goal is to get as many fans as you possibly can to earn trophies- but you earn trophies in the first 21 days of the game, everything after that has no point or reward
 Sure, the girls are creative and seeing some of my favorites from HuniePop was entertaining but overall besides the upgrades ( which I maxed out in only 40 or so in-game days ) and the 18 diffrent girls there isn't much else to this game
 You drag a girl to 1 of 7 buildings, click or wait for time to run out, and then drag her to a different building all while managing addictions and stress levels
 But other than different addictions ( to alcohol or cigarettes ) all the girls are basically the same- with no prefrences
 I cannot, in good faith, recommend this game despite the fact I love these developers
 I just wish there was more put into this to make it a better micromanagement game then click and drag
 It was not difficult and I really didn't feel like I was ever working to a higher goal
 I was basically done with everything the game had to offer in the first hour of gameplay and the rest is filler while you unlock upgrades that don't feel like rewards at all
I'm surprised free games like Adventure Capitalist kept me more entertained than a game I paid about $7 for, so overall a major disappointment

MOM, I'M STARTING A BUSINESS

Okay, let’s get this one out there
 HunieCam Studio is a management s(t)imulator where you are in charge of your own web cam girl company
 The game was released in April 2016 being both developed and published by HuniePot Studios
 Whilst many will snigger and laugh at the thought of this game, and I will be honest I brought it purely for a joke but when I started to play I found myself becoming horribly addicted to the game play
 The game uses a lot of “clicker” mechanics from other popular games such as ClickerHeroes and Cookie Clicker, but also adds in a large amount of management elements too
 You hire models to work for your company and you can use them to carry out certain tasks
 The tasks consist of shopping which results in getting more style points, going to a strip club to learn how to pole dance, which rewards entertainment points, doing a camera shoot to get yourself more fans, running errands at the shops by collecting booze and cigs, spending the night in a sleazy hotel (doing you know what), obviously you’ll spend a lot of time in the cam studios “performing” , and after all those busy tasks you can reward your girls with spending a day at the spa to relax
 All of these tasks take time to complete, and time is a very limited thing you get in HunieCam Studio; you have a 21 day limit in order to get as many fans as possible; you can continue to play after the 21 days, you just don’t get any rewards for it
The management side of this game is very in depth as you have to match up a lot of things in order to be successful, such as promoting your studio enough to more fans, making sure your staff get paid on time, investing money into improving your company, inventory management, and making sure your models are treated properly
 It can actually get really hectic and you’ll often find there are just not enough hours in a day to get everything done
 Graphically the game uses a really nice art style, character sprites are nicely designed and presented, thankfully there is nothing too crude shown throughout
 Like the store page says “The sexual themes in this game are mostly for fun/humour and don't make for particularly great fapping material
”
The game’s UI could be improved a lot as you find there is a lot of information you need to see at any one time and it can often be a faff in order to get to it
 I found the game to be rather challenging, you can easily get to the 21 days and still only have a handful of fans of your studio, and you really have to min/max your company in order to reach full potential
 This required reading guides and wiki pages for the game as it is extremely in depth
 There is plenty of replay ability and not to mention the addictive game play nature really bodes well for the game
 I have been playing for just over six hours and honesty can easily see me playing for another six hours before I grow bored of what is on offer
 Apart from the UI issues, the game don’t have any other glaring technical problems other than you can’t play the game in a higher resolution than 1080p – but this is only an issue for a small minority right now I suppose
 Most people will look at this game and simply not purchase it out of fear of embarrassment or find the subject matter unsavoury
 That’s fine and it’s complete up to you, but the game doesn’t show too much crude content, the most you see is maybe a “toy”, the actual game play and game play elements are really top notch and this is probably one of the best management games on the market today
For £4
99 this game is well worth it and I can highly recommend it too

As an actual Cam Girl, I was intrigued by the subject matter of the game
 I am also a fan of this style of game though I have only played a small handful of time management and clicker games
 Both things considered, I figured I'd enjoy it
I've got to go ahead and say, a LOT of fellow Cam Girls are highly offended by the over-the-top negative stereotypes that are portrayed in the game
 The addiction and STD themes, especially, but also calling the fans "disgusting"
 The vibe of the game lends to the stigma that only girls who have made "poor life choices" and dirty/addicted/desperate people participate in the cam world
 Hopefully people can appreciate the satire of it and not actually believe that's the reality of the industry, even though there are some "sleazy" studio operations out there
That being said, I thought this game was fun
 I've played through 3 times in order to beat previous scores and get tokens for wardrobe/hairstyle upgrades
 I don't think it will be a long-lasting sort of fun, but it's enjoyable to pass the time if you're in the mood to boss cartoon chicks around and click buildings

HunieCam Studio is a fairly short clicker management parody game
 Your first playthrough should last just over 2 and a half hours, but achievements and the desire to beat your high score can increase the replay value
 It would take 4-5 games to unlock all the achievements
 The game comes with a fully voiced acted tutorial and many cam girls that all have responses when you click or drag them around
 The art is consistent and gives it a mobile game type of vibe
I'm really not sure what to think of this game
 The first hour seems okay and it has its jokes, but the end is just a frantic rush to make money which isn't that interesting
 I just drag all my employees to the Cam Studio building over and over and over again until they build up enough stress for me to drag them to the Day Spa building to help them chill
 Then I just drag them to Cam Studio again
 That’s not exactly compelling gameplay
 There’s a giant lack of depth, even when compared to money hungry F2P mobile games
 Many of those are good until you hit the progression wall
 The jokes don’t even last for this game
 It just turns into an empty experience for the second half
 Then you see the phallic trophy at the end when you win and listen to Kyu for a bit
The game has a meta-progression with cosmetics for your ladies
 You earn tokens based on performance for purchasing hairstyles and clothes in the main menu
 You can unlock pictures if you grab all the cosmetics for a character
 The art is not meant for titillation, but they’ll be in suggestive poses
I will say that I do appreciate the click and hold function to make sure my fingers don't break
 I wouldn't want to actually click that much
 Some of the achievements can change how you play
 The late game is always the same in every session
 Cam Studio, Day Spa, buy Promos, repeat
HuniePop had some real meat to it with its solid match-3 gameplay and dating sim aspect
 This title falls a bit short and definitely feels like something produced in-between real projects
 I don't see much of a reason to play it more than twice
 Or even more than once unless you're a completionist
 I managed 3 playthroughs, but that was to see what the game had to offer
 I wouldn’t recommend this game
 Go buy HuniePop instead if you want a parody pervy experience with some real gameplay

Another one of those games that I wish steams' review system had a grey "neutral" rating for, because "It's complicated" doesn't even begin to discribe how I feel about this release of shuffle
 While I am happy to see the day Shuffle is on steam
 god so many issues
This is essentually the Playstation 2 all ages version of shuffle "On the Stage" which removed all adult content and added two additional routes (Mayumi and Kareha) as a reason for anyone who owned or played the original to have a reason to buy it
I, like many it seems from what I've read in the other reviews, bought this for those additional routes as its the first time we've had them in offical english (I am specifically a Mayumi fan) and while I am semi satisfied with what I got
 This really is a disappointing and inferior game to what we could and should be getting at this point
I am not going to sugarcoat it even as a fan of the series
 Shuffle is old, and has a limited appeal to people, yet they are pulling these blundered moves lets examine things:1) The steam version being non-adult
While this isn't a huge surprise, it is a little disappointing in an era where there are ways to provide adult content and not step on people's toes (taking examples of Nekopara, Huniepop, etc) where a one step disconnection from steam allows people to get their adult content and still sell an all ages product which allows neither market to be alienated
 It really is getting to a point where there is no acceptable excuse for this and either YumeHeaven or Navel is too lazy to look into these avenues, or does not want to give us the adult content, either one is not something I agree with
2) Giving "On the Stage" instead of "Essence+"
The first issue about adult content is annoying but like in the PS2 era from which On the Stage originated, they gave two new routes to compensate it
 Essence+ is a shuffle release that came later that also added adult content to said routes
 Lets once again not sugar coat things; Shuffle is a game that's 12 years old, Essence+ is 7 years old
 Its not a stretch to believe at the very least if they are going to deny people adult content, to atleast give us Essence+'s level of routes and options
 So why give us every single mediocre nickel and dime version in between
These companies seem to live in a world where they think people do not research products and are unaware that stuff like Essence+ has existed for many years
 Which is frankly insulting if you think we're that stupid, it should have been the definitive release of shuffle cause its likely the only one steam might ever see
3) Weird localization choices
I am not going to go too heavy into this cause its barely a footnote for me, but it has annoyed some people so its worth atleast touching upon
 The basic idea of this is the mangagamer script was very well done and established a certain expectation to what things would be called, the YumeHeaven scripts make some completely uneccessary and often bizzare changes
 While I can personally survive these changes, its perfectly logical to why some people are very upset
 In the end Navel/YumeHeaven you should seriously step up your game because while this sold to people, it seriously was weaksauce and many wont be so eager to jump on the next thing you sell
Posted: 23 November, 2016
The short of this review is that the Steam release of Shuffle
 is plagued by various design issues, and is an inferior version of the game to the original Mangagamer release
 If you really enjoy Kareha and Mayumi, it might be worth picking it up
 Other than that, there isn't a reason to get this one
 Phsyical editions of the original Mangagamer Shuffle are still available on J-list, thankfully, so look to get one of those
If you're looking for a more detailed breakdown, read on
:: About the Steam Release ::This version of Shuffle
 is a port and translation of the PS2 All-Ages release called Shuffle
 on the stage
 The game has 2 new routes compared to the last English version
 It's a completely new translation by YumeHaven following Navel terminating their partership with Mangagamer
 You can't buy the 18+ edition of Shuffle
 anymore
 There's not a patch available or anything
 This also isn't the best and most complete version of the game: Shuffle
 Essence+ has 4 more routes than this version
 It's been out for about 7 years now, so people seem a bit annoyed that we're getting this version instead of that one
 Although I would've preferred Essence+ to be translated, I'm sure it just wasn't an option
 Maybe if the game sells well, we could see Essence+ released stand alone or as a DLC for this game
EDIT: Apparently this version of Shuffle drastically changes the dramatic parts of the original to be more kid friendly
 I would wager that it's not because of the western launch they did that though, it's probably just how the game was changed for it's PS2 release
 For that reason, I'm going to suggest buying the Mangagamer version instead of the Steam version if possible
 You wouldn't just be buying it for the H scenes, you would be buying it for the proper tension and drama
:: Functional Issues ::One of the biggest problems with this game is it's missing features
 Functions that you've probably come use to having are just up and missing with this game
 The original Shuffle runs in an engine dedicated to Visual Novels, and it definitely shows
 You have lots of options, the 'CTRL' key is the default skipping button, you can use your scroll wheel to view the text log, you can change the text speed from a turtle's pace to instant, the transitions are all smooth
 Using your noggin, you can probably guess why I'm talking about all the things the original release of Shuffle can do
 I mean, the title of this section is "Functional Issues", right
 Everything I just mentioned is straight up missing in the steam release of Shuffle
 Really
You can't skip unread text, and the only way to skip text is through the spacebar button
 It's also a toggle, which means there isn't a "push to skip" button
 If you try to skip to a certain line in text you've already read, you're liable to end up going right past it because you untoggled the skip function too late
 No problem, you might say
 I'll just return to that line using the text log
 Well
 You can't
 The original Shuffle release doesn't let you rollback the scene either, but this is a completely new version with a completely new engine
 Why wasn't this implemented
 Want to see the message history using the scroll wheel
 Too bad, hope you like hitting the "H" key
 Also, there isn't a way to hide the text box
 Yep, you're stuck with it
 Want to see the character art without the dialogue bothering you
 The only option is to open the right click menu
 Which dims the entire scene and draws a dull looking set of options in front of you, "Save", "Load", "Settings", "Save and Quit", and "Quit"
 The last two actually quit to the main menu, despite just being called "Quit"
 Let's talk about the "Settings" option though
You only have four options for in game volume control and text speed
 Four
 As mentioned earlier, none of those four options for the text speed are "Instant"
 Well
 That's pretty much it
 Thankfully, the settings do allow you to manually turn character voices off and on
 Oh, and it also has a kind of worthless resolution mode
 At first glace, you might think it's useful
 But it's not
 All it does is allow you to choose whether you want to have the sky themed border art
 If you set the game to one of the 4:3 options, like 800x600, then fullscreen it on a widescreen display, it'll scale properly and just have black borders instead
 So, the resolution options do basically nothing unless you want to use it in windowed mode
 Which is good, but if that's the case, why can't we just stretch the game window to the size we want
 It's not like the border art is real proper art, it's just a texture laid out over the unused portions of the screen
The one good thing I can say about this release is that it has controller support
 Definite kudos for that, every Visual Novel release should have controller support
 That one good thing does pretty much nothing to cover up the many, many issues this title has though
:: Translation ::This is one of those titles that don't use honorifics for whatever reason
 You can hear the characters say them, but they aren't shown in translation
 It's jarring
 There's no reason to be afraid of honorifics with a game like Shuffle
 The vast majority of the playerbase jumping into this title will know what all the honorifics mean
 Things like miso soup get mentiioned in the game without a proper explanation, so it's just baffling
 The problem is most exemplified in Kareha's route, where Tsubomi calls the main character "Rin Onii-san", but the game translates it as "Handsome"
 That's definitely wrong
 Even those of us completely unfamiliar with Japanese know that much
 "Big Bro Rin" doesn't sound natural in English at all, but it wouldn't be an issue to begin with if honorifics were used
 It's made even more confusing by the fact that at different points in the game both Kareha and Asa are referred to with "-Senpai"
 For future translations done by YumeHaven, I hope this will change
 Other than that, the translation is quite nice
 It likes to shy away from Japanese onomatopoeia though
 Another good example from Tsubomi is how her "Kyaa
"s are translated as "Eeek
"s
 Both of these words just feel too different
 It's a situation where keeping the original is better
 It's not like "Kyaa
" means anything, it's just the noise she's making
:: The Two New Routes ::Mayumi and Kareha's routes are nice, but they're short and lack conflict
 Mayumi's at least has some conflict, but it's nothing like you'd come to expect from the game if you've played the Mangagamer version
 Kareha's literally has no conflict
 So, if you're looking for drama or an emotional ride, you won't be getting it
 I'd suggest buying this one for around $10 on sale if you've played the original Shuffle and liked either Mayumi or Kareha
My uncomfirmed assumption is that the two new character routes are probably much improved in Essence+
 If I do ever get around to playing that version of the game, I'll update this review and point out any differences
:: Conclusion ::If you can buy the Mangagamer version, buy the Mangagamer version
 If you play that one and really like Mayumi and Kareha's characters, then good
 You've got taste
 Feel it out for yourself whether you want to spend the 20 dollars for both of their routes, because that's the only reason to get the steam version as things stand
 Best of luck to YumeHaven, and I'm hoping to see more and better releases from them in the future

I'm not very happy with this release of SHUFFLE
The only reason you should buy this version is to read the Mayumi and Kareha routes if they were a favorite of yours
 (Mayumi is mine btw)Now I don't know Steam's full policy on exposure, but I had been hoping that this re-release would be a bit of a best of both worlds
 Keeping the PS2 routes and the Essence+ routes while toning them down
 Instead of doing that, we get just the PS2 routes and the same riduclously bad censors that the PS2 version had
 This game doen't have to be E for everyone you know
 The censoring of the girls became too uneeded, almost making the game not make sense
 (I
E Primula's wet shirt, Mayumi's collision, Kaede's sewing scene) Though the Essence+ routes weren't great, why were they excluded
 If you're trying to make a ultimate release, why not keep all the add-ons
 The interface was also tuned down from the original game, making it just volume control basically
 I know not everyone has played SHUFFLE
 Essence+, but that version exceeds this one in every single way
tl;dr Find and buy the Mangagamer release of SHUFFLE
, It's a good VN
 Here's to hoping somebody translates the Essence+ version, it's superior

I wound not recomend this game to anyone as it is an all ages version
 There is a lot of content cut out and even a lot of content related the plot of each route
Posted: 11 January
It had the potential to be a great game but unfortunately due to content cuts, absurd censorship and several game breaking
bugs it has a lot to improve
 I loved what was there but what was missing was to big a part for it to be as good as it should have been
 Also several of the tags advertise content completely missing from the game
Edit most of the bugs have been fixed and the other one was due to a wrong setting
Posted: 22 November, 2016
I own the MG version of Shuffle
Since Mayumi didn't have a route there, I couldn't say no to this one even though I could have waited another few years for Essence to appear
I found out from the Discussions that this is a renamed version of a PS2 game called "Shuffle: On The Stage
"
This is an all-ages version of the game
That means that the mature content has been blotted out
Sometimes in a humorous fashion as scenes where the panty shots are hidden away are done in a way that you end up thinking that the heroine isn't wearing underwear
Then we get to the less humorous aspect of the censorship
I've just completed Asa's route
I like the extra scenes
And the basic idea is the same
 But then we find that the dark undertones have been toned down by 90% to make it child friendly
 I'll say this right now, they don't use a box cutter
They use a mystical necklace that sucks magic power
Even worse, the moments leading up to this scene lack the tension that was in the original
The character is just fine, you just need to fix a small problem
How small
Obviously it isn't life threatening if the one in question is up and about the next day
It was originally a serious problem
They were even hospitalized in the Anime
The cheery extra scenes hurt more than help in this regard
I was particularly impressed with how the CG is the exact same as the MG version despite the above changes
I thought it was losing magic, why is there blood
This game is All-Ages, but that means that the most powerful part of the scene has been defanged and you're left wanting as the scene's impact is inconsistent and feels too much like a joke to be taken seriously
I'm afraid to try out the other routes because of this
Gameplay:10 - 20 hours of gameplay depending on reading speed / degree of completion / usage of skip
Traditional visual novel setup where you have 1 common route with choices that branches into different character routes
Unlike Choose-your-own-adventure games, choices do not alter how the common route plays out aside from minor differences to maintain consistency
This means that you'll end up seeing the same scenes and choices on subsequent playthroughs despite making a completely different first choice on the common route
I should mention that certain choices will reveal hidden scenes where you may be given additional choices
These hidden scenes are key to unlocking certain heroine routes
As I said before though, during the common route your choices do not cause the plot to deviate, so when you find a hidden scene, it will return to the common route eventually
The key to finding a route is by picking the right combination of choices
Thankfully, for those choices where the end result isn't obvious, this novel does provide a clue after each important choice indicating which girl would end up the happiest
Just gather up as many moments with her as you can
Graphics:This game allows you to set a 1920x1080 resolution, but it's sort of a cop out
Unlike the title screen, the game itself has the traditional 4:3 aspect ratio of the original
The rest of the space is filled in with a cloud backdrop on the left and right side of the screen
Even though you don't get HD CG, I'm okay with this since you can fullscreen without getting distorted sprites on widescreen monitors
In the MG version, I had to either play windowed or tamper with my graphics card settings to keep the game's 4:3 aspect ratio
This visual novel isn't one of the recent ones, so you'll find that while it is voiced, you won't get the dynamic animation that you would find in NekoPara, Go Go Nippon, or Corona Blossom
Sound:In a recent patch, the music volume has been dialed down so that it doesn't drown out the voices
The voices still aren't as crisp and clear as I would like though
I'm not sure if it's because it's a port or the VA's are using a low quality microphone, but it feels like the characters are speaking to you from the other end of the room
Controls:You can use a gamepad to play
That's nice
Sorta, you can really only use it to advance and select choices
But it allows you to sit farther away from the computer while playing
Maybe even in a reclined pose
A recent patch has greatly improved the playability of the game
First, the skip key is the [Ctrl] button now
This may seem weird on the english speaking market, but for those that are familiar with Japanese Light Novels, this is the standard skip key
History can be accessed by scrolling up on your mouse wheel in addition to hitting the "H" key
The UI overlay can be hidden with the space key
The config screen of this PS2 port is limited compared to traditional PC VN's
 While you do get the standard stuff, a lot of the quality of life options that you would normally get are missing
 For instance, there is no option to skip read/unread messages when skipping
 And there isn't an option to continue playing voice when mouse clicked to end text layout
 Nor is there an option to lay out text instantly at fastest speed
The songs in the sound gallery now loop so you can keep your hands off if you want to hear a song again
Yay
Language:Japanese Voice
English text, no honorifics
Translation is okay
English is fluent and typos are uncommon
 I'm tempted to call Nerine's shortened-name, Rina, a typo though
Story:This part is currently incomplete since I am replaying the game
 I plan to look for significant differences between this version of the game and the original Shuffle
Most of the changes are generally to fit in the 2 new character routes
It makes me happy to see Mayumi with more screen time
Some scenes have been expanded and moved around
 For instance, observer reactions play a bigger part; it helps with the immersion because now we get glimpses of how the bystanders are reacting
Some of them are even voiced with choice lines like "she's like a doll
"
It's not just the bystanders, the main characters have more moments too
Certain scenes have been removed like that one with the crazy KKKaede fan and its followup
The "bodyguards" are given a brief mention in the text, but without the acting you aren't aware of their true danger
I kinda prefer how the original laid out the routes
In this version of the game, the common route sort of blends into the heroine routes
While you will unmistakably enter a heroine route, common route events will still occur inside of that route
In the original, this blending didn't happen, once you were on the heroine route the story completely changed
The reason why this even bothers me is because there is an event with Kareha that's basically bugged
 This common route event will still happen even when you are on a heroine's route, and if you pick the "right" choice, you will find yourself forced out of that heroine's route and into Kareha's
Conclusion:(6/10)- Those that haven't played the game are going to wonder what's so great about it as the serious moments have been turned into bad comedy
- Those that have played the MG version will be disgusted at the 4kids quality, it's-not-blood-it's-ketchup, censoring ruining the message
For the Mayumi and Kareha fans, still checking the Mayumi and Kareha routes to see if they're worth playing, but I wouldn't buy this to collect it
- With the new patch, in addition to the thoughtfulness of the screen resolution and gamepad input, the game has become comfortable to play

Ill start off by saying that i havnt played any of the other versions of this game (so cant comment on them)and that i got this with a random coupon and using steam cash for selling a card from a game I got for free (in short I got it for free) after coming home from the pub, so my expectations weren't that high
This is a multi path branching choice based VN following some pretty standard VN norms of the protagonist being put into a situation where he has a chance at a number of 'good looking gals'
+OK skeleton for the story to hang fromok art for the time of releasegood number of branches -UI is poor (shows this versions console roots)the story has obviously been butchered to fit into 'all ages' and not rewritten with any skill
There are worse VN's out there but I wouldn’t get this unless it was on a 50% (or greater) sale as this is a lazy attempt to try and cash in on the 'cute' market from the publisher
 The story has far to many fade to black/white screens and its obvious where huge chunks of the original story has been hacked out just to make it 'all ages' (probably from when in went over to the consoles)
 There is no skip forward ability which on a multi path vn means you are stuck clicking through long stretches of repeated material
 The protagonist is actually more believable than most you’ll find in other VN's and the girls paths are all fairly coherent (if you ignore the gaps in the story) and the supporting characters are good if a little over the top
Its a bit of a shame as I imagine this would have been a very good VN if its 'all ages' conversion had been handled with any skill or tact and if they had but some very basic functionality into the UI

Shuffle
 is a charming, quick to medium length traditional visual novel suited for newcomers and veterans of the genre
 While i'm no veteran I have played my fair share of the genre and found it to be a very pleasant experience
 I would consider myself a quick reader so logging 13 hours in completeing every route and every CG I would say is pretty decent for what I paid
 (Bought the game during a sale
) Of course everyone elses mileage may vary because of read speed and/or auto play
As one of the only ways (legally) to get the game now due to the fact Manga Gamer no longer sells the uncensored version on their site it is unfortunate that the version most accessible is not the 'complete' version
 However the experience isn't too badly hampered, due to the fact that this is ported from the PS2 version and is pretty polished
 And because it's the PS2 version Kareha's and Mayumi's route are also within the game bringing the heroine count to hefty 7, compared to the already healthy 5
And if you are desperate for the adult content for research and compltionist purposes you can find it online pretty easily

It's a good visual novel and the anime is good too 8/10
Posted: 30 January
this version of the game is alright
 but it isn't mature
 don't know why a mature tag is on this game lol
 the transitions from one scene to another seems to happen instantaniously so it feels like you acceidently skipped over something when you didn't so you end up reloading just to be sure nothing was skipped
 just an annoyance really
i recommend this game to teens and young adults
 otherwise just move along

So I've never reviewed a game or VN as of yet on Steam, but I can't think of a better one to make my first
 The fact that this was going to explore Yuri romance was all I really needed to be interested in this VN and the previews, description and nursing school setting was adequate enough to make me want to buy it
 The price may seem a bit much, but trust me when I say, it's worth every penny
 However, since you don't know me enough to just take my word for it, allow me to clarify
 Before I get into it, I will echo what I feel can be the game's tagline, "It's Not as it Seems
" It's a bit long, but I think it'd be worth reading thoroughly
 Please also be aware that this is
just my opinion and may differ from others
Just as the description says, this VN ultimately tells the story of an aspiring nurse named Asuka, who begins her first year of Nursing school with her sister
 Early on, she meets two fellow classmates and her teacher, all three of which she comes to form bonds with over her 3 years of school
 The nature of those bonds is where you come in
 The game offers several choices throughout the story and what you choose WILL determine future options and situations, so it requires careful selection
 Even the smallest of decisions may very well shape if you can achieve a good or bad end or any end at all
 Each girl has their respective Good and Bad end and then there's a premature end that will have the game end before it's time and leave you unsatisfied
 Careful selection is crucial to avoid this ending
 Now for more specific review ratings
Plot: 10/10The plot mentioned above is only the start of what this game actually has to offer
 The true story and it's progression will be something you'll never see coming and will shock you, I assure you
 This is coming from someone who's not easily caught by surprise and can usually predict plots pretty easily
 It also had some touching and bittersweet moments, integral in any good romance
 The main plot is one big picture, but each girl's route contributes the minor details of it to make that big picture take shape
 Each girl plays a role in a particular way, each offering new and important information to the main story
 This means that to get the full story as the writer I'm sure wished for it to be received, will require successfully completing the route of every girl, but it's so worth it
Characters: 9/10The characters were all very well designed and developed, as were their individual stories and routes
 They all had their quirks and particular charm, that I feel would be hard to find disagreeable overall and so it's quite easy and enoyable to play through all the routes without getting bored or feeling like it's a hassle
 The only reason it didn't get a 10 was because there were some routes that I felt could have been elaborated on just a tad bit more so that we could learn more on their backgrounds, but it was still sufficient to not feel rushed or lacking to an extreme degree
Yuri: 10/10This is the most important aspect for most I'm sure and so I can assure you it doesn't disappoint in that department
 The romantic developments, interactions and events are all very well developed, enjoyable and satisfying
 Each girl offers a unique relationship type for Asuka, as they all are unique in their expressions of love and personalties
 I found myself in love with each pair for different reasons and never disappointed with any of them
 The good endings were obviously best for each girl, but the bad endings had their own sort of charm too, which was also quite enjoyable
In regards to the pairings, any route is open to be seen as the true route, but as it might be epected as you delve deeper into the plot, I'd say that Sakuya's route may be the canon "true" route, only my opinion though, and so you may want to save that one for last, but then again, the
beauty of this game is that you can play any route, in any order order you'd like
as long as you choose wisely
Medical Accuracy: 10/10If a game is going to make a specific subect a main aspect of a story, then the accuracy of it should be assesed right
 Well as a second year medical student, although a bit different from nursing, I can say that all the medical knowledge and references they portray in the game are quite accurate and complete
 So much so, that I found myself very impressed and this aspect also allowed me to enjoy the game that much more because I could relate to some of the things they covered
 It's all done in a very natural way, never overshadowing the romance nor being too comple or advanced for non-medical players to understand
 This, in my opinion, is another thing that made this game unique
Overall: 10/10I can't say I have years of experience in playing VNs, but playing this one has certainly encouraged me to try even more in both the yuri and otherwise genres
 I had so much fun playing through this VN and experimenting with my choices, mapping out the routes and figuring out my mistakes
 It's similar to a puzzle, where each piece has to fit just right to make the story whole and reach the end you're looking for, but once you get there, the sense of accomplishment is such a wonderful feeling
 Just one final word of advice I have to give you is this, save at EVERY selection point
 It will make your life so much easier when you inevitabley make a wrong choice and get the premature or bad end
 It makes it simpler to backtrack and try a different option and get to where you wanted to go
 Of course there are skip functions, but it's much easier if you can just load up at the spot you know you probably need to change rather than skipping through from the start
 The game took me 20 hours to achieve every route, both good and bad, while taking the time to read the new text each time I reached a new path
 I'm a fast reader and it took me this long, so if you play this game the correct way and don't speed read beyond reason and actually listen to the dialogue, you shouldn't finish to completion in less than 15-20 hours, leaning more towards 20 in my opinion
 At most I'd say it may take slower readers, or those who may not be as quick to catch their mistakes, up to 30 hours
 So my point in saying this and the bottom line is this
for a game that offers a very unique, thorough, medically competent, complex, enjoyable, yuri romance story that takes you many hours to complete and has a great plot twist, is worth $40
 Not even including the limitless times you'll have to replay your favorite routes and relive the story
 So I can highly recommend this game and if you're a yuri romance and mystery lover, this is one you don't want to miss

If your mind is lost somewhere down in the metaphorical gutter of sexual innuendo, you probably looked at this game and figured it'd make fine fap fodder
 A game about Nurses (who are oft oversexualised in games) and the promise of Nudity in the Tags might lead one to believe that this game is just another Eroge that's been "censored for steam
"However, Nurse Love Addiction is so, so much more than that
 It is, in fact, a genius excercise in subversity
With no nudity to speak of and romance taking the back seat, Nurse Love presents us with the story of a young girl
 Her name is Asuka Osachi, and she's just getting started at the Teito Nursing Academy
 However, there's more to her friends than initially meets the eye
 Nurse Love begins as a humble visual novel about nursing and evolves into a full-on mystery that will have you thoroughly gripped throughout
The game has an absoloutely gorgeous art style, perfectly blending watercolour backgrounds with characters in the style of lightly drawn manga
 It's a wonderful combination that gives allows characters their own individual quirks and expressions
 It's honestly impressive that, despite sharing an art style, the six leading ladies all look and feel entirely unique and special
In addition, the way characters are arranged in scenes is utterly genius
 Making strong use of perspective by placing characters in both the foreground and the background, Nurse Love creates the illusion of life in each of its heroines with startling success
 The CG, similarly, uses flash cuts to create action scenes in still images; not unlike something you might find in a comic or manga
 It's such a simple trick, and yet it's so effective at what it does
The music is predominantly played on a piano, which blends seamlessly with the overall theme of the VN and with the art style to create an old-fashioned vibe that suits it very well
 It also achieves this without being overly agregious about it, and trying to thrust it in your face
 The cheery and upbeat piano helps create a smooth flow as you ease your way through the story
 What's more, the further you go and the deeper you dig, the more the familiar comfort of the piano takes the back seat for darker tunes to really set the tone
 But, naturally, it has its issues as well
 I only really have three complaints about the game
 The first is the UI; it clearly carries a school theme, and is very clever about how it does so, but it feels a little too
 Large
 Often concealing the entire torsos of characters, the system window simply feels a little too intrusive
 The font, on the other hand, feels entirely out of place
 All of the fonts in menus are stylistic and suit the game well, but the actual writing itself is much too simple
 It clashes with the soft art style and music, and this is honestly my biggest real complaint
The final complaint is about one of the characters
Kaede
Her route just feels entirely out of place and seems to offer no relevant input to the overarching story
 This
 honestly feels like it was added for the purpose of weak fanservice, if nothing else, to stay true to the game's title
 And there really isn't any fanservice to speak for
 It was the first route I took and left me with a very incorrect perception of the game
 So be wary of that
But in general, I adore this game
 It kept me gripped once I really delved into the main story, and had me constantly "Umm"ing and "Ahhh"ing as new details brought themselves to light as I completed each new route
 It's incredibly memorable with
 Interesting endings that come completely out of left field and that each hit like trucks in their own way
The price tag is hefty, perhaps a little too high for a Visual Novel that lasted me around 20-25 hours (At a guess
) But if you can afford to blow the money on this
 You will not be disappointed
Posted: 9 May
This story takes place across a three-year period where you, Asuka Osachi are training to become a nurse
 Along the way you may find love with someone you meet
 The four potential love interests are your teacher, Kaede Ohara, your two classmates Itsuki Amatou and Sakuya Takeda, or your younger sister (and fellow nurse trainee) Nao
Your choices determine who you end up with, if any of them, and whether it will be a short-term thing (bad ending) or happily ever after
 There are also some heavy twists in the storylines
There is a lot of material in this game, which is good considering the price
 Still it is worth it, if this is your type of game

I somehow finished the VN having romanced nobody
 And after I looked up a guide, it turned out that I made all the right choices to get on the good sides of each character, and said the wrong thing when I tried to pursue the Nao route
I have completed every ending (despite only having 14 hours played, I read faster than the characters talk, and I have a habit of skipping dialogue even if the speaker isn't done
 Rude of me
), and boy are the bad endings something
 I knew that what I was getting into was going to be a bit disturbing because of /u/, but even still
 Yeesh
In terms of the good endings, man are they just smile-inducingly great
 I liked the Itsuki good ending the most because it was just so damn adorable, and I think the Sakuya good ending broke my brain

First things first, solid yuri romance, 4 characters to romance all fully voiced and with their own unique personalities
 The paths eventually taken in some of these chracters (3/4) tends to get pretty trippy and sometimes downright disturbing (especially in the bad ends)
 To any yuri or VN fans who aren't afraid of getting beat over the head with a pile of crazy, this game is one of the best i've played and you owe it to yourself to play it as well
Posted: 10 July, 2016
this game is really wild
 i went in expecting some sweet fluffy yuri and while there's lots of that sometimes you gotta wade through the crazy to get to it
 10/10 tho its legit funny and surprisingly heartfelt and completely off the rails
Posted: 9 July, 2016
I have never been someone interested in being a nurse, but after this
 I still don't
 But that's not the point
 This game gives you a window on how it is to be a nurse
 a bit, but most importantly it gives a great plot about yuri
 After playing "Kindred Spirits on the Roof", months later I was excited to play another similar game
 This game, quenched that thirst
 While it's not as whole some as KSotR, the relationship between the characters made my heart flutter and quiver in joy
 I definitely do not regret buying it
-"I would do my best to stare, glare and ogle" 10/10
Edit: Just finished the game and got one of the good endings
 please send help
 losing deadly amounts of blood
 I might not make it through
Posted: 3 August, 2016
So I have literally just finished all of the routes in this game, and I’m happy to say it does not disappoint in the slightest, which is very relieving considering I checked this games store page every day from the moment it appeared on steam to the day it was released
 Needless to say I hope to see more of Kogado’s games appear on steam in the future
From a technical standpoint the game is beautiful, with a wonderfully detailed art-style and many gorgeous pictures, each character is unique and distinctive with a variety of expression that seem very animated for lack of a better term, there were times when I almost thought I was watching an anime
 And the soundtrack is incredible, as usual I find my favourite piece is the gorgeous opening track but the rest of the music is nothing to sneeze at and keeps the atmosphere going throughout the entire story
 And of course this game is fully voice acted (apart from one or two moments when there didn’t seem to be a voice to the dialogue, though thankfully that was only for a few ‘huh’ and ‘yeah’ bits, and there’s always the chance that I accidentally skipped it)
 The voices all match the characters wonderfully, really bringing each of their personalities to life
Speaking of which, that brings me to the meat of this game: the story and characters
 If I had to choose a single word that described my feelings on this it would be… real
 Which is kind of ridiculous considering the utter insanity that the story keeps bringing with each decision
 I’m not even kidding, this game doesn’t do plot-twists it does whiplash
 I have half predicted about two things throughout all of the routes, and even then the validation didn’t come immediately, and you are not just dealing with your everyday drama when it comes to this game
 But it all works because everything does feel real
 The characters, the decisions, the consequences
 I think that’s what threw me off the most, everything has some kind of consequence
 I mean, look at your four romantic interests
 You can pick from: Your sister, your teacher, and one of two girls who are already in a relationship… with each other
 Just from that line-up you can instantly start coming up with every possible problem pursuing any of these characters
 But it all works wonderfully to make an interesting and fully developed story no matter which way you go, and I really did find myself connecting to everyone involved
 Asuka is a great protagonist who makes mistakes, but you love seeing how she pushes herself to achieve her dreams, and no matter who you choose there will be at least one adorable romantic moment that just makes you smile from ear to ear
I won’t spoil any of the routes, you do need to experience this as blindly as possible, though I will say that you will not be prepared for how bad the bad endings can go
 The only other thing I want to mention is the presentation of nurses themselves
 I’ve never had any interest whatsoever in nursing, either learning it for a career or even reading about it, yet the story goes into a lot of details about the training and tasks for each of the students and each new thing they learned really caught my attention
 I was fascinated by all that they learned and all the theory behind it, it’s actually given me a whole new appreciation of nursing as a whole and certainly makes me want to learn more about it, if only for my own interest
I cannot recommend Nurse Love Addiction enough, it’s a must-have for fans of romance visual novels with developed characters, an interesting yet unpredictable story and wonderful presentation
 If you don’t like Yuri you may not be into it, but I’d say even then it’s worth trying
Also Itsuki is my new Waifu
I have no regrets

Lately, a lot of fowl games have been released on Steam
 This has ruffled a lot of feathers, and with good reason, as there are some real birdbrains making videogames nowadays
 But I'm talon you, this isn't one of those, this game is eggcellent
 You might fink people just buy it for ironic purposes, but it's eggshelly a very good game
 The premise may make you worried that the game's a bit of an odd duck - a human gull going to a school for birds
 To call that "realistic" would be ostrich, so a lot of peeps might wonder how the flock that can make for a fun game
 But if you give it a chance and carrion with it, you'll discover that it is well written, with a migrate cast of characters
 You're bound to have a pheasant time with this, and even if you're still hesitant, you should swallow your pride and buy the game on a lark (it's not that expensive, so don't worry about the bill), and you'll discover an impeckable game with hours of replay value
 So just spend some cash from your nest egg, and from heron out you won't egret your perchase
 You'll have a hoot, guaranteed

Easily the best pigeon dating sim out there

Okay
 uhh
 wow
What to say about this game
It's definitely not something I thought it was going to be
 I originally bought this game for the lolz since the general idea for this game is "Oh it's a dating sim
 for birds
 lol" So originally, I played it as such
 But as I carried on through the different routes you could take, I found each story more and more compelling
 So many twists and turns and things that just randomly straight up hit you in the feels or made you think "wtf just happened
"The main story is really creative and the genre twist really takes you through a loop and keeps you hooked
 And for birds, the characters are really well developed
 I think the makers of this game knew exactly what they were doing
 I want to take the player into a false sense of "This is going to be hilarious and stupid" Which granted, at some points, that's what it does
 Very well
 It's really funny
When really it's building you up for a huge unexpected story hit
 All the different routes are just branches of character developments, readying you for the main plot
 I applaud that
 Over all, I'd actually recommend buying this game and doing exactly what everyone else is doing
 Go in while not taking this game seriously at all and let it change your mind
 Because it seriously will
 Then it'll leave you there to sit there and think about how unexpectedly brilliantly done it is

 hats off to you, this was a great experience

What is Hatoful Boyfriend
 Hatoful Boyfriend is a bird dating sim
I purchased this because I thought it would be funny to say that I was playing a bird dating sim
There wasn’t suppose to be any real feelings behind this purchase, it was all in jest
I launched the game and quickly got to the bad ending
I figured I should at least complete one or two “good” endings before I uninstalled the game and abandoned it to be just another game in my library
To accomplish my goal of being able to complete a good ending, I quickly made a “birds
txt” where I would list everybody in the story with a couple words to allow me to remember who was who
Posted: 9 September, 2014
I'm no longer interested in human males
 5/5
Posted: 4 November, 2014
Hatoful Boyfriend is more nuanced and compelling than it has any right to be
Its outrageous concept is so over the top that it’s hard to view the game as anything more than a joke; something amusing but mostly held together by the mere fact of its existence
 But these preconceptions, strung along by even its own marketing and description, are hiding the shockingly well written and emotionally stirring narrative underneath
To be entirely clear, it is in part exactly what it appears to be: an otome dating simulator/visual novel, set in a world where birds have evolved to be the most intelligent species and humans have been mostly driven to extinction
 Playing as the lone human student at Pigeonation Academy, you are tasked with going about your day, trying to scrape by in your schoolwork while wooing the bird of your dreams
It’s an intentionally laughable idea, and one which at first can seem so ridiculous as to turn those less drawn to Japan’s stranger exports away, but its one which never dissolves into idiotic bird lover pandering (assuming that’s a thing that exists) or outright stupidity with its writing
 Hatoful Boyfriend is entirely aware of its own absurdity, and treats it almost as an afterthought, to the point that the fact these characters are nearly entirely birds became irrelevant at least as far as being a very odd novelty
Hatoful Boyfriend’s writing is exceptional, both hilarious and comical, and heart wrenchingly sad and contemplative
 Though it begins as little more than a silly teenage romance, it spends this time crafting characters that you come to care about, before hurling them into a plot darker and more precarious than I ever could have imagine
 While there are certainly parts (and entire storylines) within the game which are nothing but comedy, allowing the humorous and charming side of the game to take the spotlight for a moment and provide more than a few laughs, it was when the subject matter moved away from this silliness that I began to finally see the hidden brilliance of the game’s writer
It’s shocking to even consider at first, and even now as I’m writing this I’m rather stunned at what Hatoful Boyfriend manages to do with its narrative, but it handles it's incredibly dark material with incredible grace and consideration
 Calculated genocide, mass murder and biological experimentation, interspecies racism, and the value of family are not only touched upon, but discussed at length and in such a way as to not only allow you to take them seriously within the game’s context, but actually emphasize and become emotionally invested in the avian characters that once seemed so innocent and comical
Hatoful Boyfriend made me laugh; it made me smile and appreciate its subtlety; and it made me cry
 The spectrum of emotions I experienced throughout my handful of playthroughs (which should be considered a requisite, as you will miss the vast majority of the game’s content if you only go through it once) was something I never imagined this game to be capable of
 It kept me playing for hours on end, up late into the night, and I’m still attempting to process all that I witnessed
 It could very well be the apotheosis of a game you shouldn’t judge by its cover, and something that everybirdie ought to at least give a chance before writing it off as something it by and large is anything but

Decent plot, good art but VERY short game
 You can complete it in under 2 hours, and it doesnt have any variety
Completing the game once to unlock the whole gallery is a bust as you dont get rewarded from playing it a second time, you only get new dialogue
Choices dont make much difference and there are very few endings, 3 to be exact, not even a hidden easter egg ending
 Shame
Also the pacing was a bit too Sanic
 A lot of new things were just slapped on your face and it wasreally hard to keep up
 Shows that the writer had so much to tell but so little time and space
With slower pacing, would've easily stretched the game to at least 4 hours
Definitely not worth the original price, even at -20% off at 8 dollars it was a bad deal
 Not enough bang for you buck, but worth it if you get it cheap
It had potential to be a much better and LONGER story but fell off short
I'll rate it Manlet/5

Originally written to investigate on potential yuri content, this review is written from a queer perspective, although I do not claim to speak for anyone in the community but myself, and any opinion expressed here only reflects my own personal experiences
- Characters -Shoji:- Main Character, androgynous looking- Some shots show a definite feminine physique complete with a narrow waist and wide hips- Complimented on their feminine appearance, may even get upset when confronted to their lack- Initially identifies as male only, and still refers to themselves as male by the end- Grows up into their female persona, even enjoying it to some extent- Starts thinking in terms of what is appropriate for girls to do together during interactions- Is permanently afraid of people finding out about them being male, feels guilty about it, and becomes afraid of losing their friends if they were to find out about their situationLea/Ms
 Rowen:- The Principal, potential romance- Seems overly enthused about the Shoji's feminine appearance- May buy you female clothing, and even enter your cabin when trying underwear- Definitely into forced feminization, from the way she treats Shoji- When Shoji points out they're starting to enjoy school even if they're not being themselves, she retorts that she doesn't think she would be any different as a person if she pretended to be male, and that interests and clothing should be enjoyed regardless of their stereotypical gender association
Selina:- The sportive girl, potential romance- Genuinely finds you attractive as female - Initially assumes Shoji to be transgender as their female identity appears genuineHoshi:- The nerdy girl, potential romance- Is confirmed to be uncertain about her sexuality- Story -I didn't expect a lot from the topic at hand, given the treatment it is usually given, but was actually surprised with a quite compelling story, with a protagonist that seems genuinely torn between their personal feelings and others' expectations of them, also experiencing what appears like some mild gender confusion along the way, for example, when asked if a lesbian, Shoji will initially answer no, but later feel confused and claim it to be both false and true
 I know there are multiple endings and even if all the romance options knew about the protagonist's identity and only seem to really get involved together after Shoji openly reveals it to them, at which point they reveal themselves that they knew it all along and did not care, because they still are the same person that they have grown to like and/or love, I would say this game did tackle its subject matter rather competently for the most part, subverting the "anime cross-dressing" and "only boy in a girls school" clichés and, in my opinion, even scoring a few points on the LGBTQI side
- Major Spoilers -Selina:- Queer ending, where Shoji admits enjoying dressing up with her and reverting to a female role, albeit privatelyHoji: - Straight ending, where Shoji permanently assumes a male roleLea:- Teacher's Pet ending, literally, she seems to get off on forced feminization a little too much and I found her slightly creepy - Final Verdict -I'll be honest, I was very curious but also expecting to tear this game a new one due to the tropes it's wearing on its sleeves, but I instead found myself quite pleasantly surprised, maybe I'm being biased because I found some parts relatable, sometimes in a reverse sort of way with the protagonist being male but having to pretend to be female because of the plot, lending to a sense of confusion and dysphoria and ending up like one of the most faithful depictions of gender issues I've seen in a video game, maybe I'm being generous on account of what these subgenres usually do, maybe because it's not so much about sex as interpersonal relationships, but I found Highschool Romance to be a cute and endearing visual novel, with some interesting views on gender roles and social expectations
 - Addendum: Theory Corner -As with the introductory disclaimer, this theory comes from personal experiences only, as the more I played and thought about it, the more this game seemed to have deeper layers
Now, this might seem crazy, and can be disproven by a few scenes in the game, but I thought some facts didn't line up, which brought me to an interesting, if flawed, theory:- What if Shoji actually was actually a transgender male student
Let's look at potential hints:- Their mother signed them up as female in a girls boarding school, which Shoji blames on inattention- Shoji's physique shows a distinctly female waistline and hip structure, dressed or not- They might be flat-chested, but they are also arguably the only character with a proportionate breast size in the game- They might make a point about shaving their legs being difficult, but not every woman does- When confronted about their feminine appearance, Shoji questions their actual masculinity- The principal could very well be forcing Shoji to conform to gender norms, which they can refuse- Shoji identifies as "a guy through and through", but reluctantly accepts to conform to said norms- Shoji is a male given name, yet nobody seems to pick up on this fact - at all- On the same note, they show attraction towards girls, but do not identify as a lesbian- Their clothing choice might be masculine, but it is repeatedly pointed out by other characters that they seem to be equally comfortable wearing female clothing, and wonder if the masculine look is more of a statement, the Principal also makes a point about it (read above)- The only person that is not convinced that Shoji can appear like any other female student is themselves- Shoji shows a lot of signs of gender confusion, feeling either complimented or insulted about their feminine appearance, and often getting caught in thinking from both male and female points of viewSo yes, while this theory can easily be disproven by literally one scene, I thought it interesting to include as an after-thought that all along this game, Shoji could also appear to be someone who stongly identifies as male and feels trapped in a female body
…then again, I could just be reading too much into what is just a light-hearted, slice-of-life visual novel

Highschool Romance is a slice-of-life visual novel developed and published by Dharker Studio
 After moving to a new city, it's the start of Shoji's final year of high school but because of a crazy mix-up by his parents, he is due to attend an all girls school
 Backing out now would be a costly process that would delay him from graduating on time with his class, fortunately, the principal has a solution to this strange crisis
pretend to be a girl in order to attend
 You soon discover that what would have been a "dream-come-true" to many a male student is actually a lot more complicated
 In this unusual situation, can you survive, make friends, or even find love
 Highschool Romance is a light hearted V
N
 full of teen angst and hilarious situations
Graphically, this visual novel is a wonderful delight to the eyes and has a top notch presentation just as all of Dharker Studios V
N
's do
 It has a manga-inspired artstyle that is extremely gorgeous and filled with bright colors as well as beautiful effects
 Also of note is the fantastic audio quality and a quite memorable soundtrack which is delightful and fits the story perfectly
 In summary, the excellent visuals and terrific aurals do a great job of complimenting the outrageous yet intriguing plot of Highschool Romance
This novel was a great read with endearing art and a very well written if not whimsical story
 There are many decisions to make and multiple endings so the replayability is fairly high
 Also, this V
N
 offers a few options such as an image gallery to unlock as the narrative progresses, there are also Steam Achievements and Steam Trading cards to collect
 In the end, Highschool Romance is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to fans of the visual novel genre and anyone in general who likes "fish out of water" stories

The art is great
 The music is all right
 The character design is pretty good
 But I can't in good conscience give this game a thumbs up because of the sheer lack of content
 I installed, played, and completed this game in one afternoon
 Less than four hours of reading is not nearly enough, and I saw literally every scene
 The people who made this game obviously did so with love and creativity, and I liked what there was, but there simply wasn't enough
 It was basically a one-act story, without any of the time necessary to produce a build-up of tension
 Not enough time for real conflict to emerge and resolve
There are other details I'm concerned with, like how shoehorned the drinking scene was, but I think a lot of these problems were caused because the writers wanted to cram in a variety of scenes but the game was too small to fit them
 I'm interested in the future work of all the creators involved, because I don't think this game showcased their talents properly

This VN has to be one of the most beautiful ones i've personally read
 When the game ended, I was heartbroken
 That being said, I'm going to lay out some things I liked and disliked about the game
 Pros + Cute artstyle + Gripping story+ Likeable characters+ Decent amount of choices throughout the story Cons - Story went by very fast- Characters become attracted to the protagonist a little too quickly- Some backgrounds don't adjust to the time of day- No illustrations to cover some imagination heavy parts (not really that big of a con but it kinda annoyed me personally)- A few typos that were overlooked during development (another "not so big con" but I felt like I should add it even though with them the text is still completely understandable) My Input Overall I think the game could have become something much better if they had put a little more thought into parts of the story and extended some scenes
 However that does not change the view I have on the game, I still think this game is definitely worth the buy, sure the story goes by a little faster than anticipated, but you'll most likely have a fun time reading through it
 If you arent so sure about getting it, wait until a sale and pick it up for about $6
There are 2
main
endings, with a 3rd one being a little bit of an "easter egg"
there is also a "4th" and "5th" ending but they result in the main character not dating anyone with very little difference in dialogue 
 The game has no real reward for playing again, other than seeing the other choices and adding the rest of the pictures to the image gallery
 One thing I personally enjoyed with this VN is that some choices can
completely
change the way the story goes
 Small Controversy
(Spoiler warning) There is a character in this VN named Lea
 This character is the principal of an all girls high school who IS romanceable
 Okay, well i've seen a few people complain that this isn't "right", as a student romancing their principal would in most cases, be frowned upon, because of the possible age difference
 Lea, also being a principal, dating and marrying a student is a little unprofessional
 If it wasnt for the school being family owned, she could have lost her job entirely
 Shoji, the main character, is a 4th year in high school, placing them at around the age of 17-18
 Judging how the story goes i'm going to assume Shoji is 18
 The story makes points on how Lea is a little young to be a principal, meaning that this could very well mean that she is around 25y/o or under
 Now as an adult this doesn't seem too bad, with the max age differential being 7 years
 I personally do not see a problem with this
 Although it would be somewhat of a problem if the differential was over 10 years
I might be looking a little too deep into it, but I just wanted to address my opinion here, hehe
 Final Thoughts I think that anyone who is into romance/slice of life VNs are surely going to love this one, it is definitely worth the $10
 My overall rating for the game would be about an 8/10, for the reason being that I feel like some things were just
missing
while some things were completely spot on and I had no complaints about
 The story was narrated so well by the protagonist that you felt everything they felt, the wording was just very well done and really pulled you into the story
I'm very excited to hear that a Highschool Romance sequel will be coming out later this year, I will be buying and reviewing that on release day
And that concludes my review for this VN, this is one of the first ACTUAL reviews i've ever done, If you'd wish to discuss anything feel free to add me c: Lea is the best girl~

I told my friends I was idling for cards
 I lied
Edit; Crap
 You put me on the front page, here is a real review
Let me start this honestly
 I am totally biased
 If My Heart Had Wings is the first Visual Novel I ever played, and I love it with all of my little heart
 Also in case you didn't notice I've played this game for more than 900 hours, and only 20 of those hours were idle
 I've run through each route in this game at least 15 times, and I can actually speak really crappy Japanese because of this game
 In addition, I've spent more money on this game for the badges, emoticons, cards, extra cards and backgrounds
So yeah, I am biased
 If you chose to continue thanks, and here's the review;The good parts of this game are extremely good, and the bad parts of this game are extremely bad
So here is the good
 1
 The characters are well fleshed out, being both fully voice acted and having logical lives and choices
 Sure each of them are anime tropes, but the tropes are presented so well that they work here
 Ageha is the generic tomboy, Kotori is trapped in a wheel chair, Amane is the innocent genius, the twin's are polar opposites of eachother that rarely agree
 Ageha's suggestive dialogue makes you smile, and Kotori's fears are understandable
 Even Amane's childlike innocence is presented in conjunction with her hopes for the future, and living up to what it means to be an adult
 2
 Next is the art, it's not the crazy excess
of certain areas
of the Sakura series, or the strange realism of more "American" anime
 Here the character's are mostly normal
 This is a personal preference, but I certainly appreciate it
 3
 The routes are also well done
 Kotori's, of course, is the main route and does have the most story, and in the words of most reviewers "it got da feels"
 But, personally, Kotori is not my favorite route
 I enjoy Ageha's more, as a matter of fact Ageha's route was the first I completed
 Her personality develops as much as Kotori's on the route and becomes as complex as Kotori's
 The same happens with Amane's route
 The twins' routes are probably the least interesting, but still work well
There is more good like the soundtrack, the dialogue, and the story itself but it's time to move onto the bad stuff
1
 Moenovel, and censoring
 These are probably the most obvious problems
 The game was originally published in Japan, and was translated by Moenovel
 They did a pretty crappy job of it
 Not only are their many horrible typos, and brutal censorship, they also directly detract from the story
 One moment in particular always breaks the immersion
 At one point Ageha is explaing that a women can control any man with her big, bouncy, round
eyes
 Now, we all know that "eyes" is definetely not the right word
 This comment which could have gotten a laugh without censorship really crushes me
 I have played this game with the fan-created restoration patch, but it is agony to install
 Overall, I think this game gains a solid 8/10 for most people and a 9
5/10 for me, mostly due to nostalgia
 Definetely worth the purchase at full price, and a steal for less than $5
Thanks for reading, this is my first legitimate review so please feel free tell me if there is something I should mention, or something I could improve on

If My Heart Had Wings is a delightful experience
 Its story is one of humanism, filled with both heartbreak and triumph, a testament to the challenges we as people face in our painfully ordinary yet remarkable livesps

TL;DR: Buy this game to support the devs (and support the devs only), and then get the Japanese version and patch it with the upcoming translation patch
I would like to recommend this game, I really would
 In fact- I do recommend it
 However, I don't recommend you bother with this steam version of the game
 While the story is pretty good as visual novels go, this particular version is mired with two main issues: heavy censorship and blind-idiot translation
The censorship is one thing- it's a bit Orwellian in this case how far they've gone to make it completely PG, to the point of completely destroying one character's route (rather famously), but to be honest this is the lesser problem
 What the slightly bigger problem is that they haven't done anything to deal with the voices, which sometimes end up saying the uncensored lines instead (I'm pretty sure you don't need any formal education in Japanese to be able to distinguish the words breasts and eyes)
But again, this is fine in comparison to the real reason why I cannot recommend this game: from what I can tell, it was translated by a lot of different people, some of which did not know the characters at all, and their raw translations were mashed together to create the final product
 Really, there are points where characters apparently change gender in the middle of a scene multiple times
 There are cases I remember where one character's name (which is SPOKEN IN THE DIALOGUE) is replaced by another's
 Honorfic translations are inconsistent (if I remember correctly) and this also creates a slight amount of confusion
You know it's bad when you're reading a visual novel in your native language and you're correcting mistakes in the translation (incorrect nouns for the most part) from listening to the voice track
APPEND: Wow, I didn't know lots of people agreed with my opinion
 To continue what I was saying, the visual novel I would like to recommend is Kono Oozora ni Tsubasa wo Hirogete
 However, I cannot say this, as I, as with the majority of people playing the game, cannot read Japanese well enough [or at all] to fully enjoy this game
 Therefore I am taking this game for face-value from the Moe-Novel adaptation
To extend: The Moe-Novel translation is poor, and suffer from very large QC problems
 It also has censorship, which unlike many others, I can accept
 If it is for the sake of us getting the game on Steam at all, I'd rather have a censored game (see The Fruit of Grisaia) than no game at all
 The story is pretty stable enough to support the game without any sexual content, but it is a shame that they decided to set their target audience so low as to have to warp the story of one route to allow for this
 Had they only aimed for a 15-17 target audience, then honestly I wouldn't see there being many problems
As you may know, there is a uncensoring patch available, which also tauts having an improved translation
 I have used this patch as well (hence the broken gametime associated with this account) and I can confirm the uncensoring works as intended
 However, I cannot say that I found the translation any more consistent and accurate than the original MoeNovel one, even during scenes that weren't in the censored game
 If you are looking for a simple hentai fix, then this patch should serve you well, but if you are looking for a game with proper quality controlled translations, then I cannot in good faith say it is any better than the original
I can appreciate people downvoting my review
 I can do this because I have been in your position as well, having a game with a good story that you enjoy that works perfectly well for your standards
 But this game is different, so much that I cannot defend it
 Having a game this long and the localisation team did not care about it is pathetic
 Look at Sekai Project's localisations for an example for how you can have a long visual novel that is translated fairly consistently well
 I'm not saying they have no problems, but I can assure you that if I took a shot every time I found a mistake in one of their localisations, I'd be fine by the end of the visual novel
 If I did it for this, even for the "patched" version, I'd be hammered in well under half an hour

Edit: It seems I get quite a bit of friend requests because of this review
 If you plan to add me, please make your profile public as I like to see who I am dealing with
Okay, spoiler alert: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
Oh God, where to start
 This has made me so FREAKING MAD
Now disregard the 0 hours I have on this, I have about 24 hours in the patched uncensored Japanese version
It uses the same translation as the steam version and the adult scenes are fan translated
Now the "company" called Moenovel has made a "translation" of this game, or it should be
The translation is outright terrible
 I don't know what incompetent idiots they hired, but they sure as hell aren't translators
About a good 20 hours into the game, it simply gets really really bad, they're mixing up names
A few examples are:1) At some point they're having dinner and they translate "Hai-yo", which means "(yo) sure", but translated it as "Mornin'" instead
2) "Amane plus knife equals dangerous
 You take care of her, Aoi
" And instead of Aoi, she mentioned Kana
3) Masatsugu: "Ou- Ouch
 Ah
 Ageha
" which should be "Oh, over there
 Heeeeey
 Agehaaaa
"4) (This is seriously the next line) Ma-bou is Masatsugu's nickname "Huh
 Geez, you're such a baby
 And so is Kumoi
"which again should be "Oh hey, if it isn't Ma-bou
 And Akari is here too
" (Akari is the first name of Kumoi
)5) And this isn't the last time they misinterpret "ita ita" as "Ouch
", such is the case here: "Ummm
 Ah
 Ouch
" which again should be "Ummm
 Ah
 Over there
"6) They also can't tell remarks apart from questions, such as translating "uaa, honto da
" as "Wow, really
" instead of "Wow, it really is
"
7) Again mixing up names: "Habane-san wa
" as "And Aoi
" instead "Habane is
" or "Kotori is
", since they always mention her by her first name for some reason
8) Again a simply idiotic mistranslation here "Are te
" as "Arrrrgh" instead of "Isn't that
"
9) Did I also mention these people can't speak English
 "Did you forget about that those legs of yours
"10) "Do you have a twin
" instead of "Where are the twinsisters
" After that our protagonist talks about ramen,but since he doesn't have a voice and I don't have the Japanese text here I am not sure what it said, but he completely fails
to mention anything about the twins here in English
So I mentioned 10 points in a game timespan of about 30 minutes
 BUT THAT'S NOT FREAKING ALL
There is much more
 I guess they somewhat made the beginning a bit less bad,since that only consists of mistranslations and typos
After the 22 hour mark they just plainly give up and put whatever crap they can come up with there
I suppose they didn't expect anybody to read this for more than 20 hours anyway
Is this what the visual novel scene has come to
Translations made by incompetent idiots that do a worse job than google translate
Apparently yes, if you scroll up you can see that this game has a "very positive" rating, VERY FREAKING POSITIVE
Either the players of this are very forgiving and hope the next VN translation is going to be better or steam just hates quality
Now enough about the translation, for the game itself it PAINS me to not being able to recommend this
It's such a lovely novel, the characters are very cute and likeable, has a good story that keeps you interested and the art is great
I really love this novel, but that's exactly why I can't let this pass
 The company has to pay for this pathetic excuse for a translation
So if you want to support the VN, buy the Japanese version instead, but not this one
And as you might have seen, this one has been majorly censored, anything "adult" is censored out
They even censored the kissing scenes
 CENSORED
 KISSING
 That's ridiculous
There is a patch to uncensor the steam version, but it's very buggy
 Which is the reason I decided to download the Japanese version instead
So yeah, if you want to support a localization company, support Sekai Project or Manga Gamer instead

DISCLAIMER: I love this game so much I literally bought it again just to have it on steam
I'm so excited
 Okay, here we go
"If My Heart Had Wings" is a beautiful and touching Visual Novel rivaled only by the likes of Katawa Shoujo
 It is eroge and bishoujo; it's not a porn game, but there are adult themes and elements
 The soundtrack is SUPERB
 The plot is intriguing and every character is incredibly fleshed out
 No two paths are anything close to being alike
 Speaking of paths, there are multiple ways this VN can play out, as is typical of VN
 All of them are deep and emotionally satisfying
 I literally had to take a day off work the day I got this game the first time because I couldn't tear myself away from the story
 The only VN I've ever loved more than this one is Katawa Shoujo, and I keep mentioning it because there are so many parallels that can be drawn from this VN to that one
In the story
 JUST KIDDING
 There are no spoilers in this review
TL;DRIt will make your cold dead heart feel alive again
 Great music, great art, amazingly detailed characters and story
 A Must-have

The idea behind this game is fantastic
 Run a lingerie shop, look to hire girls, why didn't we think of this before
Unfortunately, the game is pretty tame in the visuals department (even with adult patch), with very few events, and the story is really, really lacking
 Most of the story is listening to your main character (female) prattle on about how tough it is to run a store, day after day, and you just keep clicking through those internal thoughts
There was huge potential here but it missed the mark
 After finishing the game in about an hour, getting the "good" Jasmine end, I have to say I saw very little of ANY of the girls, including Jasmine
 It doesn't inspire me go for another playthrough

Posted: 20 October, 2016
If you get one game from Dharker Studios make it this oneI've played through a lot of their earlier works and Negligee really shows the greatest amount of effort
 The inclusion of ACTUAL sex is a welcome (though long overdue) addition
 Assuming you patched the game to include the adult content like a champion, you're treated to a series of erotic illustrations, sometimes animated, and all fully written out in graphic detail
 Score
The storyline exists as a vehicle to feed the player a steady stream of cheesecake
 I can't say the plot takes a backseat though since your decisions will impact who you spend time with
 There's plenty of playful, flirtatious tension to enjoy as your team of new hires compete to impress you
 This makes the writing just as crucial as the trysts you're rewarded with
Each playthrough is rather short, clocking in under two hours
 The game caps off with 3 good endings, plus a bonus true end and several bad ones to hopefully avoid
 Naturally subsequent playthroughs go quicker so you won't need more than 5 hours to see all the content
 If you want to support more lewd games coming to steam, this is where it all begins buddy
 If you like this game then check out Nekopara
 There are a lot of parallels, including an adult patch that restores all the content cut from the steam release
Posted: 28 January
Ever wanted to take a break from saving galaxies, conquering kingdoms and exploring worlds 
 How about waking up to finding out you're the new manager of a lingerie store
Before going any further, I have two things to say
 I haven't played a visual nover before and I played the censored version of the game
Visual novels are composed of beautiful artwork, lots of fun reads and some choices which have to matter
 This is the impression Negligee built for me
 The menu is simple with some ambiental music
 I had second thoughts, but considering that I could finish a playthrough in an hour or so(which meant I could still refund it), I ventured into starting a new game
 It's all cute in the beginning: lovely artwork, nice music and the dialogue boxes that keep popping with new text
 Despite seeing the Visual novel tag, I somehow didn't expect to have so much to read
 Alas, it often proved an entartaining read
 When you first look at the store page, this game looks like it's target audience constists of 15 year old who have yet to discover internet porn
 That may be so, but as someone in his 20s, I can say there's some fun for the older demographics
 Being the store manager that has to hire three good looking store in a place where lingerie gets sold is obivously erotic
 When you have to choose if the employers have to wear their uniforms or do their job wearing nothing but their undies you can tell the game doesn't shy away from being exactly what it looks like
 But it's the way everything is presented, the way it's composed that the content feels mature
 It's the social awkardness that a 24 year old woman(main protagonist) faces when she's dealing with workers that are in their late teens and have a fondness for her
 The different situations and dialogues and the options you have to deal with them makes what seems like a short game engrossing and replayable
 As for the game's length, it depends on what
choices you make
 You can hire someone on the spot or you can give everyone a chance by giving them a trial, prolonging the playthrough by two thirds
 The girls have different personallities, which makes every convesation interesting, especially when you have to pick a side
 You have Jasmin, the oldest and most serious, who wants this job because she's tired of being a stripper
 Charlotte, the youngest, is sweet and extremely shy, being constantly mocked for being 13(she's 18, as she keeps replying)
 Sophie is the smart and ambitious, also the boldest, too bold even with her boss
 All of them make an awesome combo which takes away the boredom from work
 Depending on your choices, you'll have one of two possible clients who are looking for the right outfit
 One is more open minded, while another one is nervous like a virgin who has nuns for friends and parent controlled internet at home
 The artwork is gorgeous and make replaying the game totally worth it, not just for discovering new dialogue and situations, but also for feasting your eyes on tasteful erotic content(though the style might not be for all)
 A big plus is that all attractive images are unlocked in the CG Gallery, should you want to see them later
 Having played through all possibilities I can say I've had some good laughs and genuine interest in what the girls were saying
 The fact that I was playing as a girl was obvious at some points, but that didn't brainwash me into forgetting I have balls
 While I feel like recommending this game to anyone, even those who would be skeptical, I'll confess that I'm still not into visual novels
 However, I might come back to playing this game just for the sheer fun of it and trying out the uncensored patch
 Negligee isn't just some unlockable erotic picture gallery, but also an entertaining adult story which can take many turns

A true masterpiece of allegorical content
 Sakura Swim Club was released on 9/11, and such a date is no coincidence
 The game itself serves as a somber reminder of the event, but most of all as a critique of the American reaction as such
 The two girls, referencing the Twin Towers no doubt, also provide a deep philosophical insight into the post 9/11 governmental response, of the bickering between two political parties despite both of their intents being the good of the American people, represented by the main character
 Truly a work of art and a standout for its deep thematic elements that rival that of any great work

I was torn from writing a funny/witty review or a serious one
 Decided for a bit of honesty
If people are being jerks and being 'go play stardew valley
' then they have a different harvest moon-esque playstyle than those that play this game
 This game is adorable and aims more for the social aspect and imaginative characters that you look forward to spoiling with their favorite drinks
Posted: 25 January, 2016
From what little i've played of this game, it seems very, very reminesent of the Harvest Moon games, specifcally Friends of Mineral Town for Gameboy, which is probaly one of my favorite hand held games ever
 The game is very atmospheric so far, very charming too,
and the little details, like flower petals flowing in the wind, rabbits running around, and birds flying in the sky are much appreciated
 The sprites are very nice looking, and the game looks very appealing (for a RPG Maker game)
 The character potraits
I really like, but I can see why some people might be put off by them
 The music, is great as well
 Very harvest moonish
 Characters are enjoyable so far
 Rather large cast
 (I think I read somewhere that they focused more on the writing then the gameplay)
 Charaters are written very well as well
 Leauges better then Harvest Moon
 Theres alot of unqiue dialouge as well
 (All characters will comment on the weather, the day before a special event, the day after a special event, and more)
 While Harvest Moon seemed only to devolep it's marriable characters with heart events, alot of side characters are given the same treatment with heart event-esque events
From what little i've expierenced from the farming, it's slightly simplfied compared to Harvest Moon, but still very fun
 I'll update this when I get to the mining, fishing, festivels and upgrading the farmstead
 Mining is
rather differnt then Harvest Moon (A good thing)
 Unlike Harvest Moon, you dont need a hoe to go down levels, instead the mine has set room (five in total)
While the further you go down, the harder it is to mine minerals, the better chance of aquiring high quality ones
 Also, unlike Harvest Moon, you dont go gems you can sell right away
 You need to proccess them first (at a special station right outside the mine)
 When you proccess them, you get a random gem stone, that you can sell (depending on the quality of the mineral you mined, your chances of getting low, mid, and high tier gems are increased, or descreased) You can also choose the names for your animals, which was a nice little detail I loved in the Harvest moon games
 Apparantley, you can also rename your farmstead later on in the game after gettinng a certain item, which is cool
Probaly my favorite aspect of the harvest moon series, is the courting parts, acting like a dating sim at times
 Thankfully, it seems the devs have put effort into it
 I've meet several differnt candiates so far, and it seems pursuing and romancing various ones, will add a good bit of repalaybility to the game (which the harvest moon games are known for), as the romance candiates personalities are all radically differnt
One thing it surpasses its progenitor on, is the ability to romance the same gender (which is a feature the Harvest Moon fanbase has been clamoring for, for years)
 At the start when your making your own character, you get the option to choose which sex your attracted too
After being crushed by the disapointment that was Wild-Season, it seems we've finally gotten an excellent Harvest Moon-esque farming sim on Steam
 Whole heardley recomend this to farming sim, Harvest Moon, and dating sim fans
 Really excited to keep playing and explore the vast amounts of other aspects the game has to offer

People forget that this came out long before Stardew Valley
 So Im gunna give this credit for everything that is in it before I credit SV
 Yes SV has more content but overall, out of the 2, this one is more relaxing
 You don't have to run around as much and honestly it has a better sountrack than Stardew Valley
 I own both games
 I love both games
 I will continue to play both games
 If you have the $$, I recommend buying this and giving it a go if your a laid-back gamer like me
 The characters in Worlds Dawn also draw you in more than the SV ones do
 You will find yourself feeling like your really pulled in with this one
Posted: 25 January, 2016
I'll keep this review short and sweet
 I've played Harvest Moon games since Harvest Moon 64
 Harvest Moon 64 and Back to Nature on the PS1 were my favorite games in the series and I've truly loved the series for over 15 years
 That said this game is the closest thing I've found "Other Harvest Moon games included" to recapturing the love I have for the series
 If you enjoyed Harvest Moon 64 or Back to Nature I fully recommend this game
 The only gripe I have so far with this game is the annoying sound that plays every few seconds while running as your energy goes down
 In my opinion the sound should only occur when the health is getting dangerously low as the sound is quite annoying
 Hopefully this is something the developer fixes and or removes or at least gives the option to turn off
Posted: 28 January, 2016
World's Dawn is a game that your either going to love or hate
 It is not a complicated game so if your coming in looking for a deep farming simulation or complex gameplay then you may want to look elsewhere
 What the game does have in spades though is charm
You start off as a new arrival to the town of Sugar Blossom
 You have a small plot of farming land (20 tiles) as well as a barn that can hold 2 cows, a horse, and 4 chickens
 On top of this you have a dog you start with and it is even possible to get a cat as well
 There is also fishing, gathering plants that grow around town, and mining, and mixing drinks/juice/sauces, and a local sport called lockball that you can partake in as well though it all remains fairly straightfoward and easy to understand
So again not the most elaborate set up but enough to let you run your small farm and keep you busy as you progress through the seasons and the story while you learn about the history of the village and the spirits that keep it safe
 Beyond this is the social aspect which is easily the largest portion of the game
 There are 25+ other people in the town ranging from the local baker, an artist, the town mayor, the rancher, a priest, etc, etc and all of them have their own personality's, likes, and routines throughout the day, and you can develop friendship or even romance with some of them if you so deire
It really makes you feel like part of a community as you go about your life in your new home
Aside from all that each season that I've played so far (after 13 hours I've just started Summer) has a couple markets where the townsfolk gather to meet and sell some goods and two festivals such as a horse race, music festival, and a beach festival each with their own mini activity that you can participate in
Altogether as said the game absolutely nails the feel that you are in this small cheerful country community
 It's not complex, it's not buried in deep mechanics for you to manage your life with
 But it is a relaxing and enjoyable way to spend time provided your willing to sit back and go with the flow
If your looking to manage a farm and make a ton of money from it and to see how quickly you can go from rags to riches this is likely not the game for you
 However if you want the gaming equivalent of sitting on your front porch with a nice glass of lemonade and just relaxing and enjoying life for a bit, then I would by all means recommend giving this game a shot

I bought this game because it was supposed to be like Harvest Moon
 I'm now close to finishing an ingame year
+ The town and art style is very much like Harvest Moon+ There are a lot of interesting characters with lovely art to socialize with+ The dog is helpful, barking on spots where you could dig out some items+ Some events, scenes and dialogues in this game made me smile to no end
 This is a happy game
- You have a farmland of 40 tiles and farm by seeding tile by tile and watering tile by tile
 The watering can is your only tool and upgradable to water 3x3 tiles
- Friendship is a grind, as is tradition in the genre
 I once gifted a whole harvest to a girl without visable change in the 1 to 10 affection meter
 After finishing the friendship grind on 3 villagers, the game seemed to reward me with
 some random dialogue lines
- You can only bind the shovel and watering can
 You cannot bind anything else like the brush or milking device or animal fodder
 This makes the daily barn work quite nasty
If you need a Harvest Moon on PC, this isn't what you want
 Games like "Friends of Mineral Town" had a significantly larger focus on farming simulation
 World's Dawn is a small town simulator with a little gardening on the side
Posted: 13 March, 2016
Most people are going to be raving about Stardew Valley rather than this - but I'd just like to say that this game is a worthy competitor to that game
 There's less focus on farming, and more on being a villager in a small town - and that's okay
 It sets it apart from Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon while still remaining a "sister game" to them
 The dev is really cool - he remains active on the forums, he even put out a personal fix for me when I reported a bug
 He wants to continue adding more content to the game, and will more likely do that if there are more sales
 I'll say this - if you've finished Stardew Valley and want to try something similar, totally check out World's Dawn
Posted: 5 December, 2016
World's Dawn is similar to Stardew Valley in that you have just inherited a farm house in a tiny rural village and you can grow crops, fish, mine, cook, and make friends with all the villagers; however, World's Dawn has much more focus on your relationships with the villagers than on the farming and other stuff (especially the mining, that is tiny compared to how Stardew does it)
 If you really liked the farming/mining/fishing in Stardew but not so much the relationships stuff, then this is probably not the game for you
 If you wanted more out of the relationships in Stardew and don't need the farming etc as much, then World's Dawn is probably worth a try
Posted: 26 January, 2016
This is an attempt to bring the farming/social fun of Harvest Moon onto PC
The creator has chosen to focus on writing and social aspects of the game over the complicated farming mechanics of recent HM/SOS games, and I believe he has succeeded
The good:+Well put together world that has personality instead of cookie-cutter characters+A storyline, complete with storyline quests+A great soundtrack that plays into the relaxing mood+A number of secrets to be found in the world+More customization than early HM games, including clothes, your house, and even which gender (or both
) You want to romance
The bad:-Limited controller support-Low amount of guidance early on; almost presumes you have played HM before-No method to switch tools on the fly; you have to use the menu
-Cumbersome energy system: EN
falls fast and you must sit at a table to eat food to replenish it
-3 dating targets per gender, feels limitedThe interesting:*RPG Maker game, which enforces grid movement and other technical limitations, but the author did not use stock art and music
*Higher level of difficulty as you work out what to do in the game, but no time pressures
*Limited map system
Hard to find people, but makes finding them more satisfying
*Soccer based mini game with state increases as you play
*Poems from a posthumous supporting character introduce each season, part of the atmosphere
There are currently some bugs that are going to be patched out in a few days, usual first release issues
Verdict:
I think this is a good entry into the non-existant PC nesting game space, and worth the asking price

The biggest problem with farm sim World’s Dawn is that Stardew Valley exists
It costs $10 normally and is definitely not worth that, while Stardew Valley costs $15 and is easily worth that and then some
 Next to Stardew Valley, Wold’s Dawn is noticeably, suffocatingly small
 The only reason to play it is if you a) love farm sims and b) have already played Stardew Valley, possibly multiple times
 Unlike SV, it has no appeal to someone who isn’t already into the genre, and the only reason someone who does like the genre would play it is if their other options have been exhausted
That said, World’s Dawn doesn’t really do anything wrong, and does some things quite well
 The music is nice, and the art is very pretty — certainly it has an understanding of character design that SV doesn’t
 It has a cohesive plot that puts a nice spin on the usual formula, and a great cast of 32 villagers with their own look, personalities, and cutscenes
 The only real issue is that the controls were a bit oddly done — it’s crying out for a quick-button to pull things from your backpack, and the backpack menus were poorly laid out
 Its hotkey system also felt a little random
 Also, while it was really nice to be able to choose both your gender and sexual orientation, I thought it ended up highlighting how weird it was you couldn’t change your hair/skin tone
The real issue, though, is that it’s so small
 You can only have 7 animals, and only 20 crops growing at once
 The mine is just five levels, with no hazards
 There are only 10 types of fish, and only 10 crops
 There are only a few ‘slots’ you can place furniture in
 The game tries to artificially inflate itself by making items you sell — including crops — worth pennies (the most expensive crop sells for only 48g, and diamonds sell for 72), but this is just an annoying barrier to progression
Three years ago, this would have been a great game to find, but Stardew Valley has so raised the bar for the genre that it’s made a lot of these smaller games basically obsolete, and frankly, I think it puts pressure on actual Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons game as well
 It’s so rare to see a dev, never mind a dev that’s just one person, make huge promises and then deliver, but ConcernedApe somehow did it, and I think it’s going to have a palpable effect on the genre
 For a long time, Harvest Moon proper was all farm simmers had, but the indie revolution changed the quantity, and now from a quality and breadth perspective it’s not true anymore, either — Stardew has shown that not only is it possible to make these games everything fans want them to be, but that there is a large audience for these types of games, and it’s put the audience in the position of being able to ask for more

Take Persona 3/4, remove the heavy story and dungeon crawling gameplay, keep the daily calendar grind/choices and the social links, but add lots of puns to 'em and bam, you've got Cherry Tree High Comedy Club
 It's alright, but it feels like there's something missing, like all you get to see is a small part of a much bigger story
Posted: 2 June, 2014
This was a charming little experience
 It could be described as Persona 3/4 without the drama and battling, or as a platonic dating sim, if you're into that sort of thing
 Expect some routine anime shenanigans, with characters deep enough to be interesting
 It's a very lighthearted, easy-going game, but all the characters feel "real" enough to give it sufficient depth
My first playthrough took about four hours, and my second around two and a half
 It's not a long game, but it's full of characters and personality, like a town from Paper Mario: tTYD, you can keep coming back to people for new looks at them
 The game emphasizes making friends and being a well-rounded individual, which I think is as good a moral as you could get
 I do wish there had been some forewarning about some aspects of the relationship-building dialogues
 For example, you can only discuss a topic once with a "target," for the entire playthrough
 Of course, this isn't a huge obstacle, and it only makes the game have stronger replay value
Don't count on much action, or even multiple dialogue options
 All of the gameplay focuses on skill-building, time management, and selecting good topics of conversation
 This is simply a great game for those looking for solid characters and friendships in a quirky, somewhat-cliche anime setting
 If there's a sequel coming out any time soon, as the end of the game implies, I'm very excited for it

I am Miley; the overly enthusiastic type of anime protagonist
My goal is to stalk 6 people who don't really want to join and nag them to join my Comedy Club while they deal with some actual issues
 I have a friend called Harriet who I have decided to sign up to my club despite her lack of interesting and her having a part time job because I am more important
First was Sara; she is the quiet one who I follow about while she deals with her psychological issues; I got her to open up by knowing a lot about mystery novels which I had spent all night reading
Next was May; she is the cute little one who wants to develop a chest and is dealing with some serious choices about her families future; she decided to resolve them and join my club after I played some video games and stopped being such a NOOB
Next was my friend Cindy who was following her dream; through a combination of guilt playing and following her she finally gives in and joins me
My next target was Vivian, the hockey star who gets ill from people bothering her; I continue to bother her until she joins me through Stockholm Syndrome, ironic as she is Swedish
Tyler was stalking my friend; I give a potentially dangerous stranger my friends number without her permission and use Harriet to effectively trick him into joining
 That's okay though, because I am too selfish to care
Then there is Male Student
 He has a name, but you are supposed to talk to his father, hunt down his name through school and then ignore him not wanting to talk to me by threatening his social life until he joins my club
By doing all of this, I got the good ending
Posted: 23 December, 2013
Posted: 10 October, 2014
First off; I am going to say it is like a dating sim, in that you build relationships and meet people
The game is simple and doesn't try to be anything else, it doesn't shoe-horn in mini games to pass time, it tells a story and introduces you to interesting and funny characters; the more you learn of, the more you discover how deep they all are
The game can be tough, you play a highschool student and have to maintain homework, limit fatigue and all while also trying to maintain knowledge of various topics to discuss with potential friends and peers
If you want a visual novel type story with plenty of interaction and decent length of gameplay, pick this game up

EDIT: In the last few weeks since I played this game a dewesternised version has come out, which I have yet to play
 I will update this review once I've played the new version, but I think most of my points are still valid
+ Free demo
+ No bugs whatsoever
+ You can transfer your Repertoire plus Targets' likes and dislikes to the next save file
+ 
So if you didn't make it the first time, you'll definitely get a good ending with the next playthrough
+ There is a sequel, which is out now
+/- 2 hours per playthrough
+/- Sugary sweet story, very innocent
+/- Perfect for kids
+/- In the westernised version, the translation is aimed at Americans who don't (necessarily) know anything about Japanese culture, even though there are shrines and cherry blossoms - but it works nonetheless
+/- In the westernised version, there are lots of references to (American) pop culture
+/- Simple art style, quite nice but not eye poppingly awesome
- Repetitive gameplay
- Not very original in its genre, both with gameplay and characters
- 2
5 playthroughs needed for full completion and no way to skip the last week or two (which is annoying if you've finished both your Repertoire and your Target list halfway through April)
Conclusion: not very original, but still enjoyable
 Get it on sale
(I played it while offline, so Steam didn't register my gaming time

Warning: Lengthy review incoming
Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is an interactive visual novel with the gameplay of a dating simulator
Before I get into the review, I want you to know, that I played the westernized localization of the game
 I’m going to talk about this in a little bit more detail at a later point of this review
You play as Miley Verisse, a young comedy fanatic, who’s planning on forming her very own Comedy Club at her school
 Miley’s roommate has already been compelled to join the club, but the problem is that school clubs have a minimum number of required members, which means that Miley has to find three more people to join her club until the end of the club trial period
 That means you’ve got two months to manipulate and befriend as many people as possible
 This is where the dating simulator gameplay comes in
 There are six different characters that can be recruited and you befriend them by talking to them about different topics
 You raise your skill levels by reading magazines or visiting places and occasionally you can also find random stuff on the ground that raises your skills as well
 The higher your skill for “fashion” for example is, the more the friendship level of a character will be raised when talking to them about this topic
This type of gameplay can get a bit repetitive, since you do the same thing every day
 You get up, talk to a character, talk to another character, watch some TV and the day is over
 Repeat until some special event happens or until the friendship level of a character rises
To get a character to join your club you have to get them to friendship level 5, which is pretty much impossible to do for all 6 characters in the first playthrough
 Fortunately there is a new game+, which allows you to keep all your skills and only resets your friendship levels
The whole game has a lot of jokes, because, you know… Miley’s a comedy enthusiast and stuff
There were some jokes that are right up my alley that I found really amusing and then there were some others that just fell flat for me
The characters are rather diverse and even though some of them seem pretty spineless in the beginning, you find out that they have a really interesting background story after befriending them
 On the other hand, there are also some characters that still seem rather spineless after you convince them to join your club and their background story is by far not as interesting as you’d expect
A big problem I had with the game is, that it only supports a resolution of 640x480 and if you want to play it in fullscreen mode, the game window gets stretched to fit the height of your screen and you get two beautiful black bars next to the game to fill your screen
 The settings of the game are also pretty limited, but hey, it’s a visual novel and not some fancy AAA game title, so I guess that’s expectable
At the time I bought this game, no original version was available in English, only the westernized version, with different names and locations
With the release of the sequel of Cherry Tree High Comedy Club on Steam we finally get to play the game in English with the original names and the same places as in the Japanese version of the game
For example, Miley turns into Mairu and Cindy suddenly is called Haru
 Also, chilli dogs turn into rice omelets, because, you know, western people only know chilly dogs and can’t comprehend rice omelets or something
All those extremely western sounding names feel a bit out of place, because everything feels so Japanese and all those cherry trees in the background for example definitely don’t make me feel like I’m in the US either
I’m going to be completely honest with you: Cherry Tree High Comedy Club was the first visual novel I ever played, so I might judge this game a lot differently than some of you visual novel veterans out there but for someone new to this type of medium, this game was a really good entry point and even if you’re usually not a big fan of those type of games, you might still enjoy all those cute characters and the nice setting
The multiple endings and the new game+ give the rather short game some replayability, since you will not be satisfied with only knowing the background story of for example 3 of the characters but you will want to know the background story of all of them, even though they might not be as interesting as you’d expect
All in all, Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is a pretty decent visual novel for veterans and casuals in this medium
 It might have its flaws but it is still a really enjoyable game to waste some time with
If you’re a diehard action fan who needs explosions, headshots and a lot of gore to enjoy a video game, or someone who detests reading and dislikes games that heavily rely on text in general, you might want to sit this one out
Everybody else:Should you play Cherry Tree High Comedy Club
Yes
 Yes you should

The goal of CTHCC is to befriend the game's characters well enough to join the school club
 If you've played Persona 4, the gameplay of CTHCC tries very hard to be the town segments of that game
 You train certain skills to relate to people better, then talk to them as much as possible in order to become friends with them, see their stories, and finally convice them to join
 Oddly, you never actually perform any comedy in the game, because it ends on the club registration deadline
CTHCC is definitely not anywhere near Persona 4, but most games aren't
 Unfortunately, this game has the weaknesses of P4's town gameplay as well
 It's very repetitive
 The music would be decent for this game if it wasn't repeated over and over ad nauseum
 But, this game's strength is the character-driven story
 While the characters are not near the level of P4, they were better than I expected them to be, though I wish they had more chit-chat dialogue
This game has some display issues
 Alt+Enter is the only way to make it fullscreen, and even then it doesn't work well
 The art is decent otherwise, for being 2D still images
 CTHCC controls well enough
CTHCC is an okay way to kill an hour or two, but I was getting bored by the end of my three hour playthrough
 I wouldn't pay much for it, though
 Wait for a 75% off sale if this sounds interesting to you
 If not, you're not missing too much by choosing to skip this game

I originally bought this game as a joke because it was on sale
 After playing it for nearly seven hours, I realized this game isn't an H-VN or a decent dungeon crawler, but an abidexterity simulator
 Nearly two bottles of off-brand Wal-Mart lotion in, I've become just as proficient with my left hand as I am with my right hand

On October 31, 2013, a dungeon-crawling game known as Demon Master Chris was released
 On May 31, 2016, its spiritual successor, Sakura Dungeon, was initially released on Nutaku, the version of which I have played for many hours already
 (It’s why I have next to no time played on the Steam version, which I have purchased purely to leave this review
 Yes, I care that much
) Now that it’s out on Steam, I can leave a more visible review of it here
I want to love Sakura Dungeon
 I really, really, do
 I have played and replayed Demon Master Chris for some triple-digit hours
 I’ve sunk more than twenty hours into Sakura Dungeon already, on the highest difficulty no less
 Unfortunately, I’m finding that the more I play Sakura Dungeon, the more it makes me want to put it down and instead boot up Demon Master Chris once again
Where Sakura Dungeon SucceedsFirstly, let’s not sell Sakura Dungeon short where it inarguably surpasses Demon Master Chris
 The artist has noticeably improved in the three years between the games, and the music and SFX are of much higher quality
 Frankly, I think the plot might even be a little better; I enjoy the personalities of the main protagonists more
 If you simply want to ogle cute and busty anime chicks in compromising situations, then stop reading here and buy Sakura Dungeon
 It will be a purchase well worth your money
My problem is that at heart, I’m a tryhard and a grognard who likes to delve deep into the inner mechanics of games
 Just what is the game engine like underneath Sakura Dungeon’s new, sleek, and shiny chassis
 What got tweaked from DMC that had me finding myself wanting to play the older version instead
 In order to make a fair comparison and highlight the minor but important differences, I’ll have to explain DMC’s original system in more depth
 Here comes a massive wall of text
Demon Master Chris’s Combat SystemToo long for Steam
 Read the wall here: http://pastebin
com/1uCLbU4QSparknotes: VP is health, AP is stamina; You only ever need 1 VP but your current AP represents your ability to dodge; keeping AP high is important to survival Guard command lets you use AP to temporarily boost dodge in the short term, while Recover command lets you recover AP for later usage but temporarily decreases dodge; Guard/Recover duality means that defensive play has meaningful choice and means that paying attention to the enemy is important Read your opponent, learn their general rhythm, then try to anticipate it to dodge their attacks and exploit their attempt to Recover Attacks against low AP characters turn into Critical Hits, which also cause clothing damage; naked characters lose all VP regen and thus can be taken down with ease Random encounters remain legitimate threats unless you are absolutely positively ridiculously overleveled Bosses absolutely must be outwitted and stripped in order to reasonably defeat them Sakura Dungeon’s Simplications, Changes to DMC’s SystemStill too long for Steam
 Read the longform here: http://pastebin
com/nyTx2yZsMoar sparknotes: Sakura Dungeon replaces Guard/Recover duality with a single, one-dimensional command that simply restores AP with no downside or other effect, thus removing the rock-paper-scissors triangle of Recover->Guard->Attack->Recover for an overly simple continuum of "be defensive<-->attack more" Dodge gain from high AP reduced, attacks are more accurate in general: now the majority of all attacks hit their targets without having to consider the target's own AP, meaning random encounters become boring and routine extremely quickly Critical Hits now far less dependent on AP state of target; attacks on low AP targets not guaranteed to crit, while high AP targets can sometimes still be crit anyways Less predictable nature of Critical Hits mainly serves to surprise and annoy the player, instead of directly rewarding you for playing well or punishing you for making mistakes Stripping to eliminate regen mechanic simplified; changes rhythm of boss fights entirely, turns bosses into statchecks rather than actual thinking challenges; devs outright encourage the player to simply grind to prepare for bosses, rather than rethink their strategy or try different approaches CP/Flow system that Sakura Dungeon introduced feels snowbally without adding very much interaction with the opponent; since bosses have been turned into statchecks, CP/Flow system only serves to reinforce the mindless, boring "strategy" of "grind until you can beat the boss lol" Where DMC plays like a fighting game with thinking forward and counterplay, Sakura Dungeon plays like a SNES-era Final Fantasy title where you just attack through random encounters and bosses alike repeatedly to eventually take them down at lengthHoly tl;dr BatmanIf you enjoy anime girls having their clothes ripped off in not-so-honorable RPG combat, go ahead and buy Sakura Dungeon
 I will honestly praise the art, music, and overall aesthetic polish that are all a step above what’s in Demon Master Chris
 For all that I’ve vomited about how the internal mechanics are RUINED FOREVER(tm), the game plays out as a respectable turn-based RPG in its own right; I have not yet encountered any major bugs or obviously unintended game imbalances or exploits
 I will also continue playing Sakura Dungeon to its completion, exploring the CP system a bit more, as well as replaying it on a lower difficulty; my views on the game may change and if they do I will revisit this review
But as far as I can tell right now, if you prefer a better-oiled, more strategic and thought-provoking RPG underneath the exposed skin, skip out on this watered-down successor and play the original DMC instead
 (Note: Demon Master Chris isn’t on Steam, for obvious reasons
 Google it yourself
 You’re an adult on the internet, you should know how
 At least I hope you’re an adult

I'm honestly not sure how I can review this game without it turning into a gushy love letter to one of the most entertaining and fun games I've come across, so I won't even try to avoid that
Dear Kitty Powers' Matchmaker,You are the campiest game I have ever played, and you are simply fabulous
 I love you not only for your adorable looks, but also for your sparkling personality
 Often, you can be a bit cheesy, but you always know how to make me laugh
I enjoy the completely nonverbal but totally understandable communication that my clients make, and I love your innuendos and your swingy little music
 Sometimes you remind me a little of Cook, Serve, Delicious, in that you are a very well-balanced, innovative, and challenging game in the guise of a loungey little casual game
 But don't be jealous, honey, because you are definitely an original
I love that you look at a player less for their reflexes and more for their memory and attention to detail
 I really like when you encourage my competitive side and make me want to be the very best (out of all my Steam friends)
 I also think it's really sweet that you've helped me to get love blossoming amongst my friends (who are cool enough to play this game)
I really enjoy your progressive nature, and the way that you make me work to unlock new perks and goals as I play
 You keep adding new and fresh things into our relationship, and that just makes the fun last longer
Kitty, you and I have spent several nights with each other, and every time I just don't want the evening to end and for us to part ways
 Sometimes this makes mornings very difficult, but that's ok because I enjoy every moment of our time spent together
 Basically, Kitty, I am simply crazy about you
Love,Praxis

This game is like eating three pints of ice cream while watching your favorite movie
 You have this sinking feeling that something or someone may judge you, but you know what
 It tastes good and it just FEELS SO RIGHT
This is a very well thought out dating sim game and I'm happy to still be waist deep within it
 Your task is to help your boss, Kitty Powers, make perfect matches
 Send your clients off on their dream dates and make sure they don't blow it
Simple enough, right
 Not quite
 There are types of people to mix and match together while hoping that date goes perfectly
 Will it take one perfect date or do you want to steam it out with three dates
 Guide your clients by playing mini games to make sure they succeed in winning the affections of their date
If you succeed, you get promotions and you get paid
 Getting paid means better restaurants to take dates to, better ways to fancy up your clients (because they REALLY need your help), and other little perks like kicking out the more troublesome clients
The tutorial makes things look incredibly easy, but once that's done, you are almost completely on your own and left figuring out things for yourself
 You'll have to understand clients interests and how your little black book works
 You'll either figure this out through dumb luck or failing
 Either way, there's no harm in making a few mistakes at first
 No one's perfect starting out
 Even I have a completely ruined relationship from a client that I thought were totally into each other
 Oh well, win some and lose some
I love that you get updates from satisfied customers and you get perks from their continuing relationships
 I thought that this was a great touch and another incentive to get things right the first time
 Another thing that I loved
 Making my own profile to send out myself to be a "mystery shopper" for my own dating life
 Can't wait to see the results to have a good laugh over that
The graphics are bright and inviting, reminding me of traditional time management games
 And those games
 Those games remind me of addiction
 They remind me of "just one more level"
 That's what I noticed immediately
 I wanted one more date conquered just because I needed the ego boost
 Just to say I was Kitty's best employee (I have no friends playing this so this is my wild imagination), I needed to do more work for more upgrades
 Just ONE MORE client
 It's very friendly and I'm almost happy that Kitty isn't cartoony because that would take away from the humor that is our wonderful and loving boss
 She is quite sassy and pixels just wouldn't suit her, after all
I especially appreciated that there was a bit more inclusion in this game
 It's not just limited to man-seeking-woman or woman-seeking-man, the devs did realize there's more than man and woman relationships so I must say I appreciated that option
 Thank you
 It means a lot that you did that
There is a bit of stereotyping
but more so on the personality types of "sporty", "nerds", "hippies", etc
 If that offends you then I have no idea what to say
 If you have trouble with characters who are supposed to be "punk alternative" speaking with what seems like (forgive if I read it in the wrong accent
) a Cockney/London accent then steer clear
 Seriously
 British Punks from London stereotypes
 I can't imagine anyone hating that but hey, they're there amongst a few other cliches
 I thought they were all incredibly adorable characters I really, desperately wanted to see happy
 They're very "human" with wants and needs and the need to be validated
Even for cartoon people without souls, yes
 I'm entirely serious
The more things you buy for your matchmaking business, the harder things get
 If you buy better restaurants, you get paid more, but the games get harder and sometimes slightly lewd
 Yes there is a game to hold in your fart
 The fact I can write a review complimenting a game for recognizing that yes, you have to hold in your gas during a date and it is indeed a game of chance is astounding
 I never thought I'd have to compliment a fart mini game
Buy a salon for your business and you can alter your appearance for a better potential mate for your client
 Wouldn't that one guy or gal be great IF ONLY your client dyed their hair lilac
 Now you can
if you do it quickly
 Does that guy/gal prefer a more chic style
 Quickly change clothes after you buy an add-on for your salon
 They say you shouldn't change for anyone but hey, let's make an exception, right
It's an easily accessible game that truly anyone can play
 While I'd keep this for the crowd that can understand dating, I'd honestly say this is really a decent game for anyone to play
 It's cute
 It's bubbly
 You can play against your friends and compare scores
 You can even send your friends personas on dates if they're playing
 You get bonus points for making matches with real life people and you'll tell who they are by the little globe by their profile as you match them up to people
I can't find a single thing bad about this game, really
 It's a little tycoon/sim on dating and it really illustrates the whole luck/chance and repetition that is dating
 And I'm not bored
 There's always some new curve ball coming at me
Plus Kitty Powers is the best boss I have ever had
 If I could just do this in real life with Kitty as my real boss, this would be great

I bought this of sheer boredom
And I hate to admit it, but it's actually a lot of fun, challenging, and incredibly addictive, though it's nothing more than a gloryfied memory game
Played 4 hours in my first session, and I'm nowhere near having everything unlocked, and have yet to get my first achievement
Basically, you run a dating service, and your job is to pair up couples successfully, by comparing attractions, interests and personality types
Take them on dates, pay sincere compliments (or lie), and keep dates interesting by selecting different conversation topics
 While on dates, you get to play different mini-games (mostly memory oriented, as far as I can tell after playing 4 hours)
And occasionally, something incredibly funny happens, and it actually made me LOL af few times
Personalities consist of 5 different traits, each with 2 different mindsets and behaviors connected to them
Combining these with a ton of different interests, jobs, hair styles and colours, clothes style, eye colours and make-up (for women), and facial hair (for men), and different accessories, makes up a dating pool with tremendous variety
And this variety is what makes the game interesting
The really brilliant part of this game is, that you start of by creating your own character, by customizing looks to your own preferences, and answer a series of questions to determine your own personality type
And (if you allow) this character will then become a dating option for other players to pair you up
And the game will then send you notifications on how your 'virtual self' does in the dating world, depending on other players choices and skills to determine your personality type
Your character is given a fake name if allowed in other players games
just in case you're the kind to worry about such things
And as you successfully pair up couples and earn reputation, you unlock different things to add further variety to the game
Such as extented dating options, different restaurants with different difficulty levels, and pre-dating alteration options that allows you to change clothes or hair styles, colours, make-up, or buy gifts to impress your date
This is a well constructed casual game, well worth the price tag, if you're into games you can pick up and leave at any time
I have no problems recommending this game - much to my own surprise

Kitty Powers' Matchmaker is an incredibly fun and satisfying dating simulator that you can't put down
 You want to play for an hour
 WRONG
 You will play for several
In the game you run a dating agency and find perfect and not-so-perfect matches for your clients
Your guardian angel, Kitty herself, drops occassional sassy hints throughout the game which require me to breathe in a plastic bag
The game consists of choosing a client, looking at their interests, personality traits and preferences then finding a match in the little black book (a must have *wink*)
 If the match prefers a certain hair colour you can always change it before the date
 Because who doesn't want to change themselves for someone else
Be careful with picking the right restaurant
 Each has different difficulties and scenarios
 If you can't calculate the right tip, like me - someone who cried on their final math exam, here is a nice link I found to help you out: http://www

htmMake sure you watch out for your mail as the clients will write back to you whether their relationship has grown or dissolved
 With all the weddings I arranged I'm upset I haven't be invited to a single one
I never found anything in my life so satisfying as matching fictional characters and watch them diss each other's outfits and hair
 This is why I'm single and spend my evenings playing dating simulators until 1AM
tl;dr10/10 - I farted and blamed it on the waiter
Posted: 23 November, 2015
It's fun to play when you're new to it, but it's pretty dull after a few hours of play time and nothing new or interesting really happens
 It's fun, yes
 But maybe not worth the money at full price
 you should probably get the game when it's on sale so you don't spend nearly as much
Posted: 22 June, 2015
Kitty Powers is like the transgendered Austin Powers of the world
 It is a fun game and a guilty pleasure, though it does not reflect actual match making abilities

Being a lady with with lady bits I am perticularly good at playing these kinda games
 Except I can't tell the difference between hipsters and nerds
 Actaully I'm not very good at this game at all
 And my friends bully me for playing it
 I don't know where I'm going with this
 Send help

If you're a casual gamer, you'll love this
If you're more a hardcore gamer
Meet your new guilty pleasure
I ain't got too much to say on the game but i'll toss in my buck and a half so to speak
 It's just a fun little dating game to waste some time when you aren't in the mood for something as intense as an FPS or an RPG with a heavy story and themes
 If you want a quirky, bright little timekiller game with a bit of humor then start making love
i mean matches

Early Access Review
Been following this game for about 6 months since before it's kickstarter release
I don't regret supporting these guys on patreon, nor their kickstarter for their latest game
Of the parts I've played, the game has given me nothing but joy
And EVN to set the standard in my opinion
Killer voice cast, I mean there's Amanda Lee, and NateWantsToBattle, Amber Lee Connors, and Natalie Hoover
All great voice actors and fit their roles wellLive2D: As far as I know, this is the first non Japanese game to use Live2D technology, and it's wonderful
The animations give the characters so much life, and they feel so much more real
As for the story, well it's still developing, but the world is fascinating, and they did a good job pushing the character development along
Every character feels fresh and unique, and I want to hug all of them (Some for
 Larger
 reasons than others)If you're interested in trying out a VN, this is a good one to start with in my opinion, it's only the second one I've really played for an extended period of time, and it's incredible
Posted: 27 July
Early Access Review
Let's get the obvious out of the way first: There is only one romanceable character
 If this is a dealbreaker for you, then you should probably stop now, as they key point behind this setup was specifically to just do one relationship and give it a variety of options, which allows for the relationships to be significantly more complicated
 So if you like Leanna, great
 But it's always going to feel like the narrative is trying to push Leanna and the player-character together
 The keyword here is "reactivity"
In this case I'm mostly trusting the developer's words, since I haven't exactly tried multiple routes so far, but apparently the system is designed with a high degree of reactivity in mind, making it so that seemingly disparate random scenes can and will be used to influence future scenes
 I don't actually have proof that this is happening, though there was one point where I was pleasantly surprised to find that a scene that I assumed was just a random one-off event
 Actually led to another scene later on
Perhaps the most impressive thing though, is that they really do keep to the "relationship simulator" concept, and so far it's been pretty clear that they even adjust for the possibility that you just want to remain friends with Leanna
 It's hard to say if things will remain that way, seeing as the game is still periodically pushing you to advance the relationship, but it still feels pretty natural to me, which seems to be their main goal: Making things feel natural
The story itself is pretty standard isekai fare -- Which is to say, protagonist falls into fantasy world with no explanation and needs to find a way home while fighting evil shadow cultists, but let's be real: We're not here for the story, so much as the characters, all of which are overall pretty likeable
 Obviously Leanna gets more attention than the rest (what with being the sole love interest), but all of them are enjoyable in their own ways and the free time events with them are still pretty satisfying
My biggest complaint would probably be that Live2D does not mesh well with my relatively old computer, causing some pretty major lag during gameplay at times, which is always a pretty dangerous thing to have in a game consisting mostly of reading text
My general assessment is that it's a hard sell if you're not interested in Leanna, but it's still worth at least checking out, since there does seem to be an impressive amount of reactivity and the relationship building (both platonic and romantic) is impressively natural, which admittedly is a hard thing to say in games

Early Access Review
Crystalline, another visual novel created by our friends at PixelFade Inc
 If you don't know, these guys are the same creators of Ace Academy
 Since playing Ace Academy, I sincerely enjoyed that game and was excited that PixelFade was releasing another visual novel in a fantasy setting
 I became a kickstarter backer and was given access to the demo for this game really early on
 This review will be edited as time goes on because this game is in early access as of now
PROS- Voice acting: The cast that is presented in this game (so far) has had an impressive showing in the game
 They make it feel believable and real
 You can truly appreciate the hard work that the cast has put into these characters
 Although it is in English, it sets a high standard for visual novels that has English voice acting
- Visuals: The visuals in this game are absolutely stunning
 The demo that us kickstarter backers got transitioned well into the early access state that it is currently in
 Everything was as stunning as I remembered
 Being in a fantasy setting, colors and items are important, I feel like the CGI in this game definitely gives a good feeling of being in a fantasy world
- Animation: On top of the game having great visuals, we have amazing animation to add to the mix
 The characters emote their feelings and actually correspond with the dialogue that is written in the storybox
 With the LIVE2D technology, this feature certainly makes the characters feel and look real
 Things like nodding their heads and having the girls chest jiggle up and down adds to realism
 Long explanation short, boobie physics are great :)- Choices/relationship system: I haven't fully explored the game yet, but from the 3+ hours I spent with the demo and the short amount of time I spent on the early access, the choices are still plentiful and have an impact on the story
 There hasn't really been anything major yet, but we will see in the future
 There is a intricate relationship system being introduced into the game so I'm excited to see how that plays out instead of playing the game again for a different route for a particular girl
 - Characters: These characters make the game that more interesting
 We don't know that much about the main protagonist yet, but the supporting cast around him makes it up by offering fun dialogue and choices for you to read through
 I am certain people will grow to love this game for the fun characters they will meet ont heir journey
Things you may have to worry about- Episodic: This game comes in episodes
 The demo was chapter 1 and now with the game in early access, we have a chapter 2
 If you are the type of person who cannot wait for episodic things, I suggest waiting until this game fully comes out
- Story: This game is still in development, the story hasn't been fleshed out yet so you will be going in blind
 Time will tell how the story will unfold as development continues for this game
 - Romance: There is only one romantic partner in this game from what I've read in the discussions
 PixelFade has decided to focus on the dept of a relationship rather than go for multiple routes
 I think it will be interesting to play, but we'll have to wait and see how it progresses
- Mini-games: There are mini-games for certain scenarios
 The game isn't fully finished yet, so you will have to wait in order to play the game the way it was meant to be played
Overall thoughtsI really haven't said anything negative yet about this game
 I feel like this game will become a gem in the visual novel scene if given the right support and love
 Please, check out this game if you're up for a visual novel with romance, comedy, action, and RPG elements thrown in the mix

Early Access Review
This is another great VN with good characters and just like Ace Academy its in english which is something rare but not bad at all
Hope to see more games like this on steam
Loving the story and emotions so far, all i can say is keep up the good work and that any one interested in this as of 12
08
2017 can expect to have a great time for 4 - 6 hours
It is a shame there is only one romance route , that is a big draw back for me, but its still going to be a fun experience just wish they would add all the girls as romance option or atleast Amelia to have two options
But it is what is
i am not going to change my review to negative over this but it is tempting
So any one hoping for a good selection of romance options like me will be very disappointed

Early Access Review
I'm not a huge anime fan, but I tend to make acceptions when it comes to certain visual novels that catch my eye, which potentially contain that unique and addictive storyline that penetrates your attention and draws you deeper into the plot
 I ended up quickly enjoying the plot, and found many invaluable moments of enjoyment within the story
 That said, when I hit the end of the story, it was to my astonishment and dismay
 I implore you to consider this visual novel, if you enjoy interactive story telling, this game is for you
 I generally go against early access development titles on steam, as their tends to be one gold nugget in a thousand pyrite chunks so to speak
 BUT, again, I tend to make acceptions for games such as these, and I highly recommend you give this game your support and time
 I thought the price was to high, but seeing the attention they put into developing this game, as long as a quarter of the price I paid goes into development, i'll be fine with that aspect
LONG STORY SHORT Buy this game
 Its promissing, its interactive, its covetable, enjoyable, the characters are memorable, and yes its early access but that just means that a good chunk of that price will go to further adding story
 RIGHT PIXELFADE
Take a hint pixel, you got a good start and an excelent pallet
 Don't go bellyup on us

Early Access Review
Graphics 5/5Crystalline is an amazing visual novel with graphics that are absolutely out of this world
 In most visual novels you get still frames and occasionally mouth movements and eye blinks as extra features
 In Crystalline, you get tilting heads, swaying hair, and complete shifts in their body moments that almost creates an illusion that these characters are in fact breathing entities
 In this regards, I have to say, it's pretty cool
 The creators have gone that extra mile, so to speak
 Story 2 to 5/5Let me explain the rating I give towards the story
 Since the story is NOT complete I have to give it a rating of 2
 In respect to the time and effort of what is available at this moment, I have to say the story is really good and deserves a 5 in my expectations towards its final product
 Every character is well developed with depths to their characters
 There are also many dialogue choices and options which ensures active participation of readers who partake in this visual novel
 I like choices
 I like having many choices
 There are alot of visual novels that do not deliver as many choices as I have seen so far in Crystalline
 Mini-Games Pending/5There are a lot of hints of mini-games being developed in Crystalline, but at the moment are not available in its early access
 I am very excited to see what they are and as far as I can tell there are already at least the possibility of 5 if not more once it is completed
 Humor 4/5So far, there is a lot of humor in the story including moments that makes subtle references towards X-men and Breaking Bad
 If you are familiar with those shows, you probably will get a kick out of seeing those jokes
 Final Thoughts As long as the producers finish the story as I believe they will there is no better bang for your buck than by jumping the gun and getting early access
 The time and effort that went into the novel so far tells me it is probably going to jump in price by the time it is finished and depending on the final price, justified
 There is simply too many details and polishing that has gone into the novel so far to suggest otherwise
 Visual novel lovers will not want to miss out

Early Access Review
The best "Early Access" game I've ever had the pleasure of being a part of on Steam
The quality is unreal, and the world is thoroughly engrossing
 I found myself falling more and more in love with both the characters and the world they live in by the minute
The story is crafted beautifully and it has me hungering for more with each line
 The shear amount of promise it holds for exploration of characters is mind boggling and I await updates with bated breath
Would 10/10 recommend to any Visual Novel fan
 Can't wait for more episodes to be released
Posted: 28 July
Early Access Review
I DEFINITELY recommend this game
 I've only just played through the demo once, and I'm so excited to get the rest of the story parts and see the finished project
 I joined the Discord community for this game and the creators seem to be very interested in the input of their gamers, which I love
 Just a random note (: Anyway
 ART: Like- I LOVED the art
 It's very fantasy driven it seems, and it really does look like a wonderful fairy tale you'd like to learn more about
 Constructive - I'd like to see a tad bit more variation, but if the money isn't there, it's still very fantastical and wonderful
 It's just beautiful
 Characters: Like - VERY well rounded characters
 Very real and fun to interact with
 I can't wait to see how their art is finished to see how they are in the live 2D form
 The characters that are done are very wonderful
 Great job
 Constructive - I'd like to see how some of the choices the main character chooses affects them long term
 Since the game isn't finished yet, I don't think I've seen it
 But I'm very excited to see it through
 Dialogue and choices: Like - Very real voice acting and dialogue
 It's fantastic and very endearing
 Like/Constructive: I think some of the humor is wonderful, but I'd love it if it was more pushy
 It's inorganic at times because it seems to sell the easy joke, but if it was more clever I think that would work wonders
 Constructive: With the choices, I wish there was more even-ness within it
 Sometimes it feels pretty level whereas I get to make decent amounts of choices within a reasonable time, but there's moments where I feel like I'm going through dialogue a lot
 Either way, it's great, but could benefit from some leveling out
 Even small choices makes the player feel more
 into the game, versus just reading
 I suppose that's all of my notes
 I loved the game
 I can't wait for it to be finished and refined
 I love it
 And I want to get the previous game made by this company because I just loved this game and want to experience more of this wonderful and story-driven creativity
 CANT WAIT TO PLAY MORE (:

Great game
 Lots of fun and surprisingly deep
 A lot of girls to fall in love with (in-game and irl)
The infamous crashing at chapter 1-2, when you need to choose your path for the rest of the game, happens more often than not when you play it in english
To get past the crash and choose your path:Save your game in chapter 1-2, before doing the Entrance
Exit the game entirely
Start up the game, but choose the game language as japanese before going to the menu screen
Load up your game, do the Entrance, and you should be able to move past the crash
When you've chosen your path, save your game and exit the game entirely again
Start up the game again, but change the language back to english, and contiune to the loading screen and then to your saved game
 Then you'll be good to go
You'll not understand a word of the "japanese", since the letters will be all gibberish
 At least that's what it did on my computer
 Sure, you might miss out on what the girls are saying after you picked the path, and depending on what path you pick, you don't know what you are saying to them, when you get a choice
 It's okay, though, since you can still get the true endings and what not, even if you f**k up the first choice
Posted: 29 September, 2016
Ok so lets skip the 10/10 would be shamed by my family again joke and write a real review for a minute
 First of all its an on rails shooter
 A classic game style that is sadly dying out
 The quality of the shooting segments in this game is actually stellar
 If you forget the context and just consider the mechanics its extremely well done and actually puts most other recent
games in the genre to shame (I'm looking at you Rambo)
 The controls are responsive, there is decent enemy variety, the boss fights are all a good change of pace from one another, and several of the levels are branching with different paths which give you a little extra replayability
Beyond being a shooter the game is also a VN and its a pretty solid one at that
 You have 4 unique main routes with the main characters and then on top of that you can romance literally any character in the game
 All the forgettable characters that generally get pushed into the background as you blast through them in shooter games, yeah they all have little backstories and can become
your girl of choice here (theres a ton of them)
 Which means you can play through this VN a whole bunch of times with at least a degree of variety (although full disclosure I havent tried any of the sub character routes yet myself)
 The game takes a handful of hours for every playthrough so it can potentially eat a lot of your time as well
So you take a good rail shooter and combine it with a good visual novel
 If you like either genre you would probably enjoy this
 I strongly recommend this game
Also for those dying to know the actual pervyness level here is pretty tame compared to some other VNs but it does have the hillarious feature of a panic button ("Mom walked into the room button" is what its called in the menu) that pauses the game and hides your shameful display beneath the veneer of a classic jrpg
 I found that both thoughtful and highly entertaining, thanks devs

It's worth noting that for those hesitant about buying because of the crash some people suffer;If you play through the story, you will reach the 'crash point' of 2-1 in under 2 hours
 So if you are wondering, you can still buy this, quickly play to that point which won't take long, and see if it works for you
 If it crashes, a return is easy enough :) I hope this helps

If pigeons weren't enough, now you can choose between BUNNIES and KITTENS
 Well, kind of
 Unlike the pigeons in Hatoful Boyfriend, these animals fortunately (
) don't stay animals forever
 (I took a bunny with me to the beach; he was not impressed when I put on my $100 dollar bikini, the fruits of MANY nights of labor at the local art gallery
 I would've been pretty weirded out if he was
)Animal jokes aside, Dandelion is a lovely, very professionally done Korean visual novel aimed at a female audience
 I think this may be the first Korean visual novel on Steam, and it's gorgeous, with fully voiced Korean dialogue and English text
 I believe you can set the text to Korean as well
 There are five different possible love interests you can pursue at the start, though at the beginning I swear it plays more like a pet raising simulator than anything else
 Steambuns instead of Nintendogs, right
 But no, there's a mystery that slowly begins to unfold--and eventually romance
 With people
 Human people, I swear
 Just ignore the occasional animal ears
 Yes, the $30 price tag may seem very steep to a lot of Steam users accustomed to cheaper alternatives, but before brushing it off, try the demo (available on Steam right here: http://store
steampowered
com/app/323760/
snr=1_5_1100__1100)
 It doesn't take long to see how much work went into it, and how many visual novels on Steam have extensive voice acting
 Not enough
 I've only noticed a few small translation errors here and there, but they aren't nearly as common, noticeable, or cringe-worthy as a lot of the freemium VNs' rushed translations on iOS and Android
 Overall, the translation is very well done
Hopefully, if Dandelion does well enough on Steam, Cheritz might feel inclined to add Nameless, their latest visual novel set in the same general universe--but with dolls instead of cats and rabbits
 Yes, dolls
 How can any girl resist
UPDATE after completing all routes, including Jisoo's absolutely TERRIFYING "bad route" (totally worth it for the extra CGs
):Yes, I sank 35 hours into Dandelion
 Yes, every one of them was worth it
 I can't think of another visual novel/dating sim that left me thinking so much after completing it
 After completing all 5 routes, make sure to check the bonus content
 I was really interested in the mystery behind the story--who left me with these animals and why
 The bonus content was the cherry on top of an already delicious sundae--and isn't the cherry sometimes the best part
First, I have to praise the characterization of Heejung
 I know most visual novels/dating sims use "blank slate" protagonists (sometimes without eyes--creepy
), but Heejung is the most relatable, realistic heroine I've encountered in a while
 (I may be biased because I, too, wonder where my mysterious new bruises came from and how expensive it would be to install a TV in my bathroom when I take a bubble bath to raise my beauty and femininity stats in real life
) Who doesn't understand the pressures of "making it" and continuously doing things you dread solely to please your parents and loved ones, no matter your culture
 Who doesn't fear being left behind
 The love interests are fantastic too, and are much more than their archetypes may make them appear at first glance (pretty bunny, baby bunny, snobby bunny, sweet kitty, glutton/pervert kitty), though of course I had favorites
 I started with Jihae, whose route seemed like a good one for beginners (just remember to raise some affection with Jieun too
), and ended with Jieun because I was super stubborn about not pursuing a baby bunny
 He's a baby
 Heejung is a college senior
 
But his route was one of the sweetest and actually had the best ending
 Jiwoo's was great too, especially if you've seen as many Korean dramas as I have and can appreciate how the game pokes fun at kdrama clichés
 (Those envelopes of money
 Candy Cinderella and chaebol romances
)There is a LOT of stat-raising, but if you focus first on raising your Stress/Pressure Relief abilities, that helps a lot, and soon you won't even notice your Stress and Pressure stats raising at all
 Make frequent use of Quick Save/Quick Reload if you accidentally poke/show love/feed them fruit in the wrong place (sometimes deliberately
) and get a bad reaction, or if you can't find the bunny/kitten of your dreams anywhere in the entire apartment
If you're on the fence about getting Dandelion, definitely try the demo first--and then just get it
 Unless you really, really hate bunnies and kittens (are you more of a dog and ferret person
), you won't be disappointed
Posted: 7 May, 2015
Let me start by saying that I like this game (obviously, seeing as I clocked 60+ hours on this thing)
 The various story lines are definitely entertaining with more than one little twist and turn that I honestly wasn't expecting and the characters are surprisingly 3-dimensional despite most of them being cat boys and bunny boys
 That's right, ladies; after many long years putting up with the cat girl and bunny girl tropes it is now our turn
 But wait, there’s more
 Not only do we get eye-candy a plenty, but we also get actual personalities with realistic faults and flaws, (yes, even silver bunny and white bunny have their flaws, though theirs aren't quite as pronounced as the other three's)
 Even the main character has a personality – or quite possibly a severe mental condition that, in most cases, she manages to overcome without the need for expensive therapy and/or medication (come forth and bear witness to the mighty healing powers of cat/bunny boys
)
As for the actual gameplay: It’s pretty much a matter of grinding states to progress the story (mostly by avoiding a bad end)
 I know some people don’t care much for this aspect, but to be perfectly honest that was one of the main reasons I bought the game (that and Dodger)
 It does make the game pretty long, I admit, but for me it was kind of cathartic so I don't really see that as much of a downside
BTW: Frequent and blatant abuse of the quick save/load feature is a legitimate part of the game
 That’s my story and I’m sticking to it
So I would love to recommend this game
 I really would
 The story was quirky and interesting, the characters were great, the typos(which are regrettably frequent) are sometimes unintentionally hilarious, the weirdness is prevalent (which I quite enjoy), and the 'true ending' that you get after you complete all the rest was just amazing
 I totally fangirled all over this game for quite some time (don't judge me), but after the most recent update I can't recommend it anymore
Posted: 1 November, 2015
Chu~So, I have finally found time to write a review to this wonderful game
 Please, don`t look at the playtime displayed in my Steam account
 I bought this game almost immediately after its official release on CheritZ, when it wasn`t available on Steam at all and used a special security server to play, and played it for around 6 months (completing all possible character stories, of course)
I actually love Dandelion
 One of the reasons for it is the main character - Heejung
 Even though I never was in the same situation is hers, I still can feel her sorrow and pain
 She is not some lifeless female protagonist that we can see in many otome games
 She has personality and we can see her developing during the game
 If you have heart, you WILL want to make her happy, though the road to happiness for this poor girl is a really difficult one
Now, after I have talked about my main reason to love the game, let`s look in details at what it offers
1)	Characters
 There is a lot of different personalities here: timid and dreamy Jieun, tsundere type Jiwoo, dark and "bad-boy type" Jisoo, mysterious and level-headed Jihae, charming Jiyeon (whom I started to hate at some point because
well, you need to play the game to understand what he really is)
 And of course the Wizard, a crazy person who is obsessed with Heejung in some way (or in all ways)
 There is also Heejae - Heejung`s friend from the university, but he doesn`t play any major role in the story
 2)	Story
 This one is quite interesting
 As I understood, there are two words – the normal one, where Heejung lives, and the parallel one, where animal-people live
 The main two classes mentioned are rabbits and cats: rabbits are royalty and wealthy all in all, and cats suffer from poverty and rabbits` policy
 That`s the reason why Jisoo and Jiyeon – the cat-boys - don`t like three other young man (who are rabbits)
 Developers of the game did quite a good job showing the society of cats and rabbits
 As far as the romantic part of the story is concerned, it is also worth mentioning
 All male characters are really different and their attitude towards Heejung is different too
 Some of them are pretty shocking, to say the least, for example, Jisoo`s one
 He scared me at some point
 However, I don`t want to write spoilers here, so I can`t add anything else without opening some part of his route
 It is also really appealing to me that male characters develop along with the protagonist and that all of them are not what they seemed at first sight
 Don`t trust your first impression, dear friends, because it will fail you
 Every character is unique, so the game has great replayability
 Despite having already completed the game I still decided to start it again in Steam, because it is better than many other otome games, its story is more consistent and it provides something apart from love story
 Yes, Heejung has to fall in love with one of them but it doesn`t mean that everything will be in pink colour
 There is great social context that will make you think about different things, including how to raise your children (Heejung`s mother is one of the worst possible examples, to say the least)
3)	Voices
 Something I really liked was that Heejung has her own voice
 Yes, she speaks, and I like how she does it
 She is emotional and sincere
 Male voices are very good too, they suit the characters well and if I have ever to imagine them in real life, I would give them the same ones
 Though I should also say that at first I found the language funny, no offense here, people from Korea
 It is just so different from Russian, and the way some words are pronounced…that`s fascinating
 Nevertheless, I got used to it pretty fast, so there is nothing to complain about
4)	Interface and game mechanics
 Both were nice and easy to understand in the non-Steam version of the game, but in Steam it has become even better
 I like how the Status of Heejung is shown, I like how simple the stats are that you don`t have to run around the map or house to understand what to do and how to improve the protagonist
 Everything is simple and it is good
 At the same time I can`t but mention that all this stat raising may become a bit repetitive
 By the end of the third route (it was Jisoo`s one, btw) I have already learned by heart what to do and where to go to achieve what I want, so the story is the main feature that makes you want to play, not the process of playing itself
 5) Art and CGs
 I love the style all characters are drawn
 It`s neither childish nor too realistic
 Heejung is not a super model and she never was presented as one, she is just a common young woman who is concerned about her future and current life
 It is also worth saying that characters` emotions are well shown with both the art and the voice acting
 The CGs are all well-drawn, I can see love of the artists who created them
 Some are funny, some are scary, some are mysterious (remember the crazy Wizard
) and some are lovely and romantic
 I strongly recommend completing all the routes and opening all CGs, because you will most probably love them
 All in all, Dandelion - Wishes brought to you – is worth its money and your time
 I do believe that you will like the characters and the plot and that you will not be disappointed with any of the endings
 There is no fairytale here, even though it looks like one
 But there are actual problems of the real world that Heejung has to face every day
 I wish you good game and hope my review will help you in any way
 ^^P
S
 Don`t forget to complete Bad Endings too, they are more then worth it
 As I said before, Jisoo`s one is pretty shocking

Didn't get to screw the bunny (Jiwoo) and instead got a trainwreck of emotions 10/10 would cry hard again
Posted: 19 October, 2014
Well, first off, I have to say this is an absolutely beautiful game
 If you’re looking for a subpar dating sim, you will have to look elsewhere, because Dandelion is very well put-together and a blast to play
 The graphics are very nice and the characters are interesting and adorable in different ways
 The stories for the different boys are very cool to learn about over time and the mysterious voice from somewhere is, uh, very mysterious
 Very I-don’t-explain-anything-but-I-imply-that-there-is-a-huge-background-here-wink-wink-to-those-who-have-played-the-game-enough
 So yeah, very mysterious to me
 One of the only issues that I had with it was the typos that popped up sometimes, but overall the translation was well done
 They did a very good job of maintaining the sweet, giving nature of Heejung while also revealing her struggles and discontent
 She can almost seem too placid, but it is understandable, given her past, and as the game moves forward, she does show signs of a backbone as she comes in to her own (thanks, furry adorableness
), which I whole-heartedly approve of
It takes some time to recognize the voices and names (very creative, Heejung…lots of J’s @_@) but once you do, it becomes very easy to know who is speaking during scenes that don’t show faces
 The different colors help and the personalities are so unique from one another that it becomes clear pretty quickly
 The stat system is very intensive if you want to buff them all out, but the options are cute and for some of the boys, it’s important to max out your stats as quickly as possible
 Just think of it as primping and sketching your way to the top
 I actually do enjoy the grind, because the little illustrations are cute and it’s nice to become beautiful just by taking a bath
 Unfortunately there have been no side effects in real life
The most important thing that you should keep in mind when playing this game is FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS FURRY AND CUTE DO NOT TRY TO GAIN HEARTS FROM ALL OF THEM
 You may think, ‘Oh that’d be nice to be friends with all of them
 I’ll just hang out with everyone and become a more well-rounded person
’ That is the quickest path to a bad ending, except in a few special cases, which I'm sure you'll figure out after a couple of hours of playing
 Yes
 I was there
 Let me lay out the scene for you:There I was on a different guy’s route, when I thought I would go out on the weekend and have a nice, friendly lunch with Jiwoo, you know
 Just two buds hanging out and becoming even better friends
 Maybe he’d even stop calling me stupid one day
 During lunch, he says something about me feeding him, and being the desperate-for-points-and-new-interactions player I am, I chose the ‘Open wiiiide” option, thinking it was a little weird, but hey, I don’t judge friendships
 Then he goes and says something about not dating any other boys
 And if I were really Heejung, I would have stopped in my tracks and wondered, ‘You think we’re dating
’ But of course, I am not her, and the game just continued on, unmindful to the fact that it had just rocked my world
 When I started the game, I thought that Heejung was very oblivious when it came to boys, which was cute but almost a little much
 Now, I know the horrid truth
 I am JUST as oblivious and stupid about boys as a main protagonist of a DATING simulator
 TT_TTLet’s just say there is one bad ending in particular which is more than a little traumatizing and I couldn’t stop thinking about it last night
 On the bright side, they did an excellent job of unobtrusively sliding you into an abusive and very dangerous relationship, with you torn between thinking there is something very wrong, and thinking that it will turn out okay once he calms down
 He didn’t calm down
 I am still a bit emotionally scarred and I have been hesitant to play his good route (I just need some recovery time…)
 I recommend you get all the good endings before you try to get the bad endings for completeness—that way you’ll still be able to sleep at night without thinking someone’s going to be hovering over your bed
 Following you to the bathroom…not letting you talk to people…scarring the actual player for real…or maybe that’s just me
 But, what the heck, do whatever you like
 (It’s your funeral)On a completely random side note, I like to pretend that the silver-haired man in the city panoramic scene that pops up once in a while is actually the main protagonist from Persona 4 (just to spice up the scenery for me)
 Unfortunately, no matter how many times I click on him, he does not become a dateable furball of cuteness
 But I can just imagine him as a large darker gray-haired rabbit, majestically lording over everyone in King’s Game
 X3 He’d fit right in with Jieun and Jihae

Dandelion - Wishes bought to you - is a good game but not the best one from Cheritz
 I found the heavy emphisis on stat building to take away from the main story, the story was good and well written
 If you can get past the stat building I do recommend this game
Posted: 6 November, 2014
Amazing, amazing game
 Finished it within 6 or so hours
 I sat glued to my chair the whole time
 This has been my favorite visual novel so far
 With my first playthough being with Jiyeon
I think next time i will go for Jiwoo
 It had emotions in it that brought me to tears a few times
 Highly recommend this game to anime/visual novel fans
 15/10

Dandelion - Wishes brought to you - is a deep, and well thought out Otome game (visual novel and dating sim) for girls
 I spent 31 whopping hours on this baby and unlocked all CGs, memories, stamps, endings, etc (which should indicate how much I enjoyed the game itself)
 I at least got one hour of entertainment per dollar I spent on this item, especially since I got the two pack (both Dandelion and Nameless) directly from their site
 I'll lay out in bulletin form the PROs and CONs
PROs: Beautiful CGs (special scenes pertaining to which route you choose) Voice acted (though not in English) Intriguing characters An entertaining story that is deeper than it first appears 5 Main routes which have their own unique scenesCONs: Typos, misspellings, some grammatical mistakes (But one can easily figure out what they meant, some of this is probably due to the translation process)
 Some CG body proportions are a bit wonky, but it's not extremely obvious As this is a dating sim, there is a lot of clicking
 raising stats, going through the same motions every "day" of the game
 Some people might find this a tad tedious
 (It's not ultra hard core though, like some others and generally the stats you need are decently easy to obtain once you figure out which areas give you which stats)
Ending comments: You will not regret money spent on this item, as long as you are a fan of the genre
 It's one of my favorites, along with Amnesia and Nameless

OH MY DEAR SWEET OTOME GOD THIS IS AMAZING
 For so very long, even as a girl, I've played dating sims, usually being the guy
 but I don't usually expect a good girl version
 This was by far the most amazing experience I've ever frickin had
 The guys are great (two of which are especially a delicious favorite), one seems adorable but I didn't expect much (BOY did HE ever surprise me
), and one hard to get but one of the most considerate by the end
 the last
 uh
 just goes to show you shouldn't always trust a cute face but
 it was almost too hot to pass up by the end lol The art and transitions are beautiful, the story is in depth, and it even seems to make more sense if you play all the scenarios
 That and you get quite involved in raising your stats which matter a lot
 The opening theme is seriously AMAZING to listen to
 Do NOT pass this up
 This is clearly on top of the otome list
Posted: 20 June, 2015
First of all let's get this out of the way
 There is no nudity and there is no sex
 Everyone is just trying to be funny because
steam reviews
Story:High school student, Kenta, keeps thinking about monsters
 He has constant dreams about them that haunt him
 When a monster does appear in front of him on his way to school, he thinks it's the end for him
 Suddenly, two guardian angels, Sayaka (Yellow-Brown Hair) and Hikari (Red Hair) appear before him and eliminate the monster
 Later on, The two angels transfer to Kenta's school
 Their job is to protect Kenta from the monsters
 That is the basic setup for the novel
Visuals:Compared to Sakura Spirit, this Visual Novel has a similar art style and has some improvements
 The lighting on the backgrounds will change a bit so that the picture isn't just "still" and the backgrounds are more vibrant
 The fight scenes are more interesting to watch
 There are some CGs which actually show the girls fighting instead of just reading how the fight goes
 Something that bothers me is that I wish the artist could draw some people in the background
 For example, in school, Kenta states that everyone in the class was looking at the angels, but not a single person is in a desk
Choices:You are given choices but most of them just lead to different dialogues that don't effect the story too much
 Sometimes, you can choose what you want to know and eventually you will get to pick all the choices
 Sound:Because I can't find the soundtrack anywhere online, I've just resorted to leaving the game's Menu theme on
 Someone was nice enough to upload the soundtrack on Youtube, just got to search it
 The main menu them just sounds relaxing
 Other than that, the soundtrack fits the tone of the Novel, but I wouldn't really say it is anything interesting
 This Visual Novel has no voice acting, only text
 It's kind of a shame, and I hope that maybe in a future VN, they can add voice acting
 
 As of 9/8/2015, I guess my prayers have been answered
 There is now voice acting (only when certain characters talk)
 Sayaka is voiced by Ayano Yamamoto, Hikari is voiced by Asami Sanada, and Yuzuki is voiced by Misako Sekiguchi
Should you buy it
If you liked Sakura Spirit, including the fanservice, you may like this one more
 It has a present high school setting and still has some magic to it
 Don't expect this to be a serious novel by any chance
Posted: 17 January, 2015
They should offer this game as a bundle with a pack of tissues
 Because of the emotional story, of course
Posted: 18 January, 2015
My friends saw I owned this game and now I eat alone
 10/10
Posted: 16 January, 2015
If you have played Sakura Spirit, you enjoyed that game you will enjoy this
 However let me be honest here, I saw it coming when I realized the similiar names and art styles
 However the R17 CG and artwork here are good and I bought the game because of it
 The game takes place as you causally going through your day as Kenta and the "usual" anime route, encounter appears
 You are then saved by two girls who happen to be magical
 You eventually found out they are your new classmates
 They protect you after getting involved
 You have a few options in this game and you will always have an ending
 The game in itself makes you have the option of an end between the two girls, Hikari and Sayaka
 Now there is also an ending where you can get both and that route well is balanced
A few thoughtsUsually in some VNs there are characters there that you know you can't date and I found that with Yuzuhi
 It's like you have that antagonist you like but couldn't have
 That was another defining interest
 It's like wanting to know the face behind Tali from ME
 Or having that one antagonist you wish for that one bed scene you wish
 Yes we've been there and if it appeals and attracts, people will buy it
Nonetheless the game filled the time and made me like it
 Enjoyable
 The story seems short like before and needed a bit more
 A route with Yuzuhi would be nice
 Same with what they could have done with Sakura Spirit with Tsuyuri
 Nonetheless the game cg firs a 5/5
 The story 3
7/5
 Option choice and dialogue, some amusement, some we saw coming
 3
6-4
0/5
 Give it a shot if you like
 I can give a recommend for the art and that's another thing that sold me
 However I think there needs to be more to VNs than just that
 If I start being more detailed and do this out of 10 well I'm thinking 6-7/10 might be it
Basically if you want to get the game go ahead
 Enjoy it
 However if price not for you, you could wait
 There's no rush
 There wasn't any continuations like other games too for instance that came about
 For instance, indie developers who make games don't include a dlc or include expansion after release which is sad because I do believe some games need it
 Otherwise it's just a quick one that people can see then pass up on

My mother walked in on me playing this game, and she thought it was porn
 She wasn't mad, just disappointed
 So very disappointed
 10/10This isn't a joke to be funny
 That actually happened

Sakura Angels is a Anime Nudity, Visual Novel game
 Most of the choices doesn't affect the story line, and the art is similar to Sakura Spirit
I will lists the thing you will love:+ lovely Girls+ boobs+ sexy outfits+ Booty

I've played this game for 15 minutes and there's already so much plot that I ran out of tissues from how emotional this is
 Must buy game

TL;DR: The Muv-Luv trilogy is a must-read for anyone who calls themself a fan of visual novels
 That said, its legendary status is only made apparent after reading all three games: Extra, Unlimited, and Alternative (note that this Steam title includes both Extra and Unlimited)
 While I would be cautious to recommend only Extra and Unlimited, I wholeheartedly recommend them in the context of the entire trilogy
 Extra is redeemed by Unlimited and you will be thoroughly rewarded with Alternative
This is a difficult game to explain without spoilers
 So difficult, in fact, that the official Steam description and preview video delve into spoiler territory
 Regardless, I will try to stay spoiler-free
Muv-Luv is a visual novel trilogy and franchise that is highly celebrated in both Japan and the west
 On EGS (Japanese), Alternative is ranked the #3 VN of all time
 On VNDB (English), Alternative is ranked the #1 VN of all time by a significant margin (July 2016)
This Steam title, Muv-Luv, includes the first two parts of the trilogy: Muv-Luv Extra and Muv-Luv Unlimited
I implore you to not skip straight to Unlimited (Part 2)
 Extra (Part 1), despite being slow, is a requirement to fully set the characters and tone for the sequels
 This series truly is something special, but only when read in full
Muv-Luv Extra is your generic anime high-school rom-com
 The MC, Takeru, is your generic self-insert protagonist
 Meiya is the generic affluent ojou-sama
 Sumika is the generic short-tempered childhood friend
 Ayamine is the generic Rei expy
 I could go on
While Extra is not terrible, it's nothing special on its own
 It's leagues better than many VNs on Steam, that's for sure, but its real purpose is to build up the characters and set the scene for the remaining two games
Unlimited--which is included in this release--is where things start to get unique and interesting (sci-fi, mecha, drama) but you must read Extra to fully appreciate it (and also to eventually appreciate Alternative, which is god-tier)
ART: Despite being an old game, Muv-Luv's art holds up surprisingly well
 The rUGP engine was ahead of its time, and that helps breathe life into the visuals for Muv-Luv
 The artwork itself, while aged, has an undeniable charm that keeps it fresh even in the age of perfectly polished HD assets
MUSIC: You may have heard that Muv-Luv has an incredible soundtrack
 Anyone saying that is referring to Alternative, which does have a phenomenal OST
 Unfortunately, this is not true for Extra nor Unlimited
 The slice of life soundtracks are repetitive in the worst way and there's not a wide variety of them
VOICE: The voices, overall, are pretty good
 I would prefer to have a fully voiced MC, but the performances from the rest of the voice actors make up for it
ANIMATION: Muv-Luv was made long before the Live-2D or e-Mote systems were implemented and stood out as having brilliant animation for its time
 The animation, especially in this renewed edition, still stands strong
 You won't see most of the animated scenes until Unlimited (and only then ultimately polished in Alternative), but these scenes further down the line make you feel like you're watching a well-choreographed cutscene
STORY: The series is praised for good reason
 Unfortunately, it doesn't shine until Unlimited and doesn't fully blossom until Alternative
 You will have to trust me on this one: Extra is a slow trudge, but you'll be happy to have not skipped it when reading Alternative
This ended up longer than I expected
 Should you buy this game
 Yes, absolutely
 But you must also buy and play Alternative for the full experience
Posted: 14 July, 2016
It's difficult to talk about the Muv-Luv series without devolving into platitudes like, "an unforgettable experience," or "one of the greatest VNs of all time
" That's because it truly is something special
 It's an introspective epic, full of action, comedy, and pathos
 I consider it a masterpiece, not only within its genre, but among all contemporary fiction
If you are at all interested in mecha, this is a must-play
 If you are enjoy military fiction (e
g
 Starship Troopers), you will love this
 If you want visceral drama -- if you want to feel hope, horror, sadness, and relief -- this game will take your emotions for a ride
 If you want to read something with intricate detail in military operations and quantum mechanics, this is it
Yet it's difficult to recommend
Muv-Luv is a visual novel (all story, no gameplay) originally released in 2003
 It comprises the first two entries in the Muv-Luv trilogy: Muv-Luv Extra and Muv-Luv Unlimited
 The final and most renowned entry, Muv-Luv Alternative, was released as a separate product in 2006, and, accordingly, the English localization will be sold separately
If that's confusing: don't worry about it
 Point is, this game is only 2/3rds of the full Muv-Luv experience, but it's the entire original game
 For the purposes of this review, I'm looking at the series as a whole
Why is Muv-Luv difficult to recommend to newcomers
 The main reason is its sheer length
 Extra and Unlimited together (that is, this Steam product) will probably take an average reader 40+ hours to complete
 Alternative is about another 50+ hours on top of that
 The whole series is bigger than most other VNs, including Clannad, Fate/stay night, and YU-NO
 It has more words than War and Peace twice over, or all the Harry Potter books put together
 It is long
If that scares you, turn back now
Still with me
 Of course, the prose is nowhere near as dense as War and Peace, and a very large portion is voiced dialogue that goes at a comfortable peace
 The series has highly advanced graphics by VN standards, with moving sprites, traditional animation, and 3D scenes, and a phenomenal soundtrack featuring JAM Project
 It's not a dry read by any means
But compounding the issue of length is that the game doesn't fully blossom until its final part, Muv-Luv Alternative
 The themes that compose its central drama are merely touched upon in Extra, and Unlimited only goes toe-deep into the pool
 For that reason, there are some who advocate skipping Extra, or Extra and Unlimited, entirely
There's some merit to the idea
 Frankly, Extra isn't anything special by itself
 It's a generic romantic comedy, albeit a fun and amusing one, with little of import to say
 Unlimited is largely the same thing, except with a change in milieu and some minor mecha elements
However, I strongly recommend against skipping straight to Alternative
 Not only would you lose out on crucial story, foreshadowing, and character development, it would be missing the entire point of Muv-Luv
I have been intentionally scant on plot details throughout this review, but I can safely say this: Muv-Luv is about what we take for granted
 It's about the duty one bears not only to himself, but to his country and his loved ones
 The protagonist, Shirogane Takeru, lives a blissful, unaware life at the story's beginning
 By the end, he will be confronted and challenged time and again, forced to evaluate himself and strive toward virtue
The banality of Extra, then, is a crucial part of the experience
 It grounds ourselves (as readers) in a world similar to our own, if slightly wackier and more harem-centric
 When that carefree lifestyle is taken away from our protagonist, we feel the loss too
 And when glimpses of it return later on -- fragments of peace amid despair -- we cherish it all the more
What Muv-Luv does is bold and unusual
 The first 20+ hours that a reader invests into the series are of enormously different character than its greatest part
 Pragmatically speaking, that isn't bearable for most people, especially since it's polarizing content in its own right (being anime-inspired, reliant on Japanese culture, etc
)
Moreover, even when Muv-Luv is at its best, it's not the sort of writing that will appeal to all tastes
 Lengthy action scenes are marked by even lengthier build-ups, and there are frequent monologues during periods of reflection
 And tangential “infodump” scenes break up the pace to flesh out the world and explain events in more detail than practically necessary
 These aspects make for excellent immersion and worldbuilding (think The Lord of the Rings), but can be off-putting to a reader looking for nothing more than hot-blooded action and drama
So Muv-Luv is not for everybody
But I love this game and wish for it to be loved by more
 If you haven't played a visual novel before, but find what I've said appealing and aren't scared away by the copious amounts of moe, give it a shot
 If you are a fan of visual novels but haven't played Muv-Luv, what are you waiting for
 It's a masterpiece
Posted: 17 July, 2016
tl;dr: Good title, becomes excellent when combined with its sequel, Alternative, which is not yet released
Ignore the play time, I've read the series before this Steam release
 First things first: if you plan to read the entire series (or even just Alternative), go in as blind as you can for the best experience
 DON'T google search, DON'T search Youtube, DON'T go to wikis, as these are all places where you will likely encounter spoilers in some fashion

-I have read the entire series and more MLE, MLU, MLA
+ So as you can see on the other reviews many people praise this VN
 Yet if you google muv luv reviews you will see a few of the more well known sites bashing it
 So what gives
 I'll talk first about the things that the review sites dislike about the game
 ML; Extra
 Lots of people I know pick up the ML series due to the MLU and MLA parts of it but they hate the idea of trodging through extra
 Extra is a slice of life anime styled story where the main char has a harem
 I know lots of people reading this will instantly cringe at that idea as it really only resonates with otaku weeb trash and I'd agree, I am not really into such stories my self
 However
Posted: 20 July, 2016
So
 By Now you've seen all the reviews from all the people who have played it before
 Every single one basically has the same message, put out in different terms
 But you're there wondering, okay, I'm a noob, I don't know VN, or any of this stuff, and I've never played Muv-Luv
 Where's my voice so I can make an educated decision
I'm that voice
Heads up, I've been aware of VN's but never been able to get them or figure any way of making them work, so the closest I've gotten to this kind of game is my love for anime/manga/manhwa
 That, and reading some reviews and getting the genre shift spoiled for me is as far as I had knowledge wise heading in
First thing's first
 I loved Muv-Luv Extra
 I loved the characters
 The humor made me laugh
 I enjoyed the world
 I enjoyed the different routes I played
 I enjoyed the harem aspect
 I enjoyed working to find one route/girl to pick and seeing where it went
 I enjoyed the cartoons/journal drawings
 I think Meiya is best girl, but ayamine is most interesting
 I liked the mutual violence between Sumika and the MC
 I was happy playing that game
 I do not agree with other's who say that that Extra is trash
 Even without playing Alternative, maybe because I haven't played a thousand other games just like Extra, I had a blast
 Do I believe Alternative is the best ever, and ties in and builds up the other two
 A hundred thousand times yes
 I was looking for forshadowing but couldn't really find or feel any, so if they are as intertwined as promised my mind is really blown
Why am I so confident that Alternative is everything they are promising us it is
Posted: 13 June
You'll never truly appreciate Extra until you finished alternative

«The first 20+ hours of the game are spent in light hearted atmosphere where the player gets to interact with standard anime girls
 Even the beginning of Muv-Luv: Alternative is a power trip where the supersoldier protagonist breezes through basic training and displays his superior piloting skills (mecha otakuness pays off in the end)
 AND THEN IT GRABS YOU BY THE HAIR, PULLS YOU UP AND STARTS F***ING YOU IN YOUR FACE
»- Anonymous board user describing his experience with the Muv-Luv trilogyMuv-Luv is massive, by all means
What on the first glance looks like a generic high-school-romance visual novel in fact turns into a dramatic SciFi / mecha / military-themed universe which took many influences from other franchises such as Starship Troopers, Evangelion or Gunbuster
 The Muv-Luv franchise was actually so successful that meanwhile it expanded into numerous sequels, spin-offs, light novels, anime series and much more
To begin with, this particular release of Muv-Luv consists of two separate games which you can select from in the main menu, Extra and Unlimited
 Extra can be considered as a lighthearted introduction to the main characters while Unlimited finally introduces you to the serious SciFi world in which the franchise mainly takes place
Personally I interpret both games as an overly long prologue to the amazing 50 hours long Muv-Luv: Alternative, the third game of the original trilogy which many players consider one of the best visual novels ever made (not included in this particular release, sold separately)
 That being said you need to bring up the patience and effort to read through both Extra and Unlimited, since in total it takes about 30 hours until you've seen all the endings
 And to be honest, some routes and story branches in both games are not even that interesting
 For instance I found Ayamine's route in Extra exhaustingly tedious
BUT (and here it gets interesting) it still pays off if you read through everything and therefore immerse yourself into Muv-Luv's characters and world, since later in the third game a huge chunk of the story touches upon that
 After sucking in all that what Extra and Unlimited offered, finishing the third game will be one of the most rewarding and complete visual novel experiences you might ever have
Therefore especially Extra may leave you rather unimpressed at first, but the experience definitely takes epic proportions by the time you finished both games and finally start Alternative
In case you never played any visual novel before, here's the deal: You read yourself through textboxes and occassionally make decisions that to some extend change the outcome of the ending
 Everything is accompanied by CGs, an appropiate soundtrack and sometimes even by voice actors
 What may sound pretty boring to many is in fact pretty intense
 Visual novels have the pace and format to tell such detailed and immersive stories that animes, movies or TV shows can't equally pull off due to their technical limitations
 What a movie cramps down to 2 hours, a visual novel makes you experience in 40
The story of Muv-Luv
puts you in the shoes of Takeru, a regular, rather lazy Japanese high school student who's into mecha arcade games, good food and the comforts of life
 He is best friends with Sumika, the girl next door who spent all her childhood with him
 When he's not spending his spare time with her or his other buddy Mikoto in the local arcades, he's usually goofing around at school and interacting with his mostly female classmates
 But everything changes as one day Takeru wakes up in his bed - next to a unknown, mysterious girl
Telling anything more would already result in spoilers, but rest assured that you'll adore the Muv-Luv trilogy if you like SciFi-themed anime with military / mecha / conspiracy / traumatizing vibes to it
 The later parts specifically reminded me of Verhoeven's Starship Troopers, which I already mentioned before
Now the Muv-Luv games initially started as Eroge visual novels with some kinky +18 scenes in it
 This particular Steam release (also known as All-Ages version) has all of the H-scenes removed due to Steam's content policies
 The developers / publishers solved this problem by offering a separately available Director's Cut patch that unlocks the +18 CGs in the game
 While that's technically a good solution, the bad news is that you need to fork out another $10 for that patch, which is quite a rip-off in my opinion
 In the end it doesn't even affect that many CG's and scenes, which are pixelized anyway due to Japanese pornography law
 Furthermore personally I didn't like the kinky scenes that much since they kinda feel out of place considering the intense story and all - but that's up to you
So, should you get it
If all that already sounds too long and tedious for you, then just leave it be
 You'll most likely get bored after a few hours of listening to Sumika's annoying chatter
But if you're ready to dive into this universe that later shines with excellent world-building and geekiness, then come on board and enjoy this rollercoaster full of excitement, emotions, blood and tears
 Consider this release as an overly long prelude to Muv-Luv: Alternative, which will most likely blow you away completely

People often say Muv Luv is slow at the start and gets better as you go
 I'll just say how it went for me
There are three parts in the Muv Luv Trilogy
 Extra, Unlimited, and Alternative
When I first started reading Extra, it seemed inane and cliche
 It took me several months to get through it, because I wasn't really particularly invested
When I hit Unlimited, suddenly it became pretty interesting
 Still a little slow, but I was hooked
 I played it when I had spare time over the course of a week or so
When I hit Alternative, I literally could not put it down for anything
 I literally did not sleep for nearly 72 hours until I finished it
 By the end I was a complete emotional wreck
Coming back to Extra, it's very emotional experience on your second playthrough
 Everything I didn't care about before seems much more important, and there's lots of subtle little foreshadowing
I'll admit that this game is the weaker half of the trilogy
 But I still think it's absolutely worth it, and if purchased with its sequel (expected release winter 2016), then I'd absolutely recommend it
 It goes places you won't expect, and has one of the roughest emotional rollercoasters I've ever experienced

I spent like 30 minutes trying to type a review but nothing I do can serve muv-luv justice
 You'd be better off reading the reviews by Dexomega and RockmanDash online, seriously
 I'll simplify my view with this short piece that really shows the extent of my writing skills: Extra: 6
5/10 Unlimited: 8/10 Alternative (not out yet): 10/10However, after reading Alternative I felt like giving both Extra and Unlimited a 10/10 because of how goddamn well they did at setting up the story and attaching you to the characters
You've seen/read the Lord of the Ring trilogy right
 Imagine Extra and Unlimited as Frodo's time in the Shire up to Rivendell and the journey ends just before the fellowship is formed
 Seems a bit lame right
 Though enjoyable, it's unfullfilled, it had potential, but didn't go as far as it could
 However, Muv-Luv Alternative comes along and finished up the Fellowship of the Ring, Twin Towers, and Return of the King
 The beginning of the fellowship is damn good, but it wouldn't be good if that was it
 That's muvluv
 But its alright, because you're reading this for Alternative
 You're reading the trilogy
 I may seem like I'm underplaying how good extra and unlimited are, but I don't want you to go in with high expectations and not have them met
 Save those expectations for Alternative
 Please read muv-luv
Posted: 29 June
Muv-Luv in all honesty is enthralling tale, about how vastly different one's perspective can shape the world, but most of all how the present is always changing and nothing is set in stone
 However, unlike today's more recent visual novels, where the lengthy and juicy bits are not an issue, muv-luv has a very slow uptake and deserve the readers undivided attention, to fully grasp the meaning behind them
 The difference between extra and unlimited are like day and night, but both cannot exist without the other, since the both complete each other in a way, only after reading both parts, would the reader fully understand, sadly extra falls in comparision when seperated from unlimited
 Tho, the same cannot be said of unlimited
 Another wonderful statement, is how different environment can easily change a person's behaviours and values despite being the same person
 Goes to show how flexible these characters are
 I highly recommend people to prepare and enjoy the ride, one measely mishap can easily ruin the experience, thus reading in moderation might be the best, since some part are best savoured before moving onward

I actually had a "blast" playing this
 Nobody will ever want to touch my 360 controller again
In all seriousness though, the game is rather fun
 Lot's of little easter eggs here and there that are hilarious
 Well worth the time and asking price
I enjoyed it so much so that I even wrote a guide incase anyone gets "stuck" while playing: http://steamcommunity

Ok, so first of all, I saw Markiplier play this
 It looked SO cute and innovative that I had to go straight to Steam and buy it immediately
I do not regret my purchase
 This is well worth the £5, and I highly recommend it to everyone
I have not laughed this hard playing a game with such excellent humour in a LONG time
For those of you who don't know, it's like a dating sim, but instead of sex scenes, you get a "massagy"
That is, you connect a controller to your PC and use the vibration to get a massage on your neck or whatever other part
Each girl whose "massagy" you unlock has a different style and feels different, presumably based on what that character's personality is like
Although, I feel they could've worked on making them feel a bit more distinct
 After a while, it becomes hard to tell exactly what the different massagy's are supposed to be representing about that character's personality, and frankly the only one I really enjoyed was the "tutorial" or "default" girl's massagy
 Perhaps work on tweaking it a bit, developer, so they feel more unique
It's a fun, clever little game that has a unique mechanic dressed up in visual novel-style dating sim elements
Every character has a surprisingly deep personality & feel for a game that's so simplistic in its presentation, and you really feel invested in getting to know each of them in the short time you have together
It can get a bit frustrating trying to 3-star all the girls (getting 3 stars in each "date" grants you a higher-intensity version of their massagy) and a bit more direction or some more hints might be a welcome addition
In general, I would really like to see more characters, and more detailed massagy mechanics to really make each one more distinct
Might also be nice if we could play as a female, optionally
 Like a lesbian option that changes dialogue and some images slightly
I'm fine roleplaying as a man, but I would appreciate the option
The game overall is an absolute laugh riot, truly hilarious and seriously clever with its humour, that'll have you in stitches by the end
That is, until
 ****SPOILER****
until you get to the end credits
Just
 why couldn't that be put in a more serious game, developer
I appreciate stories that can play with your emotions well, but come on, in something this silly
 Really
As much as I REALLY feel for the developer if that's a true story, now I just feel more depressed than when I started
Still, perhaps that's just a "me" thing and I just don't get why it's there; I won't let it spoil my enjoyment of the game
 I whole-heartedly recommend this

I love this game
 I was laughing all the time while playing, the music makes me feel like am inside some kinky club, and the amount of details (don't want to spoil anything) put into the interactions between the characters makes it worthwhile
 Also, look for secrets
 They are hidden and they are dark :DDEFINITELY PLAY IT

SoniComi is a videogame featuring Super Sonico
 You play as her cameraman in a series of visual novel, quick time, and photography sections
 Your actions and choices will guide you to one of multiple endings
SoniComi originally released for PC sometime in 2011
 Eventually, the game had a slightly improved re-release came to PS3 in 2014
The game itself is mostly a visual novel, with a couple of scenes for the Photography segments are in 3D
 Also, the only character model in 3D is Sonico herself, with a wide assortment of outfit and color options for you to pick from
 Obviously, you don't have access to the really good outfits until later in the game
The visual novel sections are pretty standard, with the inclusion of backlogs
 One thing you need to know however, is there's no "Save anywhere" option, like other visual novels
 You are only given save points at the beginning of each chapter, and before the photography segments
The Quick-Time Sections are just slightly different alterations of the visual novel section, where you have the option to interact with Sonico with a pre-selected action, and aim wherever you want
 These actions can vary from patting her on the head, Grabbing her arm, Talking about a certain subject, and more
 These segments of selection are also timed, so it is possible to not interact
The Photography segments have similar controls to a first-person-shooter
 you have free movement around an enclosed area around Sonico at your location, and you must take pictures of her from different angles at specific points
 Time them all perfectly to start a combo, and a traditional point scoring system shows your results
 The outfits you select for Sonico to wear for these segments will determine your ending
This game does not feature any nudity, so if you're here to be lewd, all you'll have are oppai and panty shots
Performance wise, on my beast of a machine (i7 4790K, 16gb Ram, GTX 1080), this game was a breeze to run
 The game supports up to 1080p resolution, and can be played in windowed mode or fullscreen
Ultimately, if you are a fan of virtual japanese idols (including Hatsune Miku), this game is right for you
 If you're here for fanservice, it may not be worth the current asking price
I personally enjoyed it
Posted: 4 July, 2016
An overpriced visual novel with "FPS" aspects and a combo system that nobody really gets
 The main selling points are:- Touching Anime Girls Boobs- Calling Anime Girl Lewd Names- Putting Cat Ears on Anime Girl- Making Anime Girl to perverted poses- Not getting killed by mafia-senpai managerThe game is oversexualized and the gameplay narrows down to lewdness and little to nothing else
So all in all, 8/10, above average for the industry

/10 - still not sure what happened
Posted: 2 July, 2016
Before the game started it asked me if I was good at FPS games and I thought to myself what does that have to do with anything since this is a VN
 Once I got to the camera sections I see now why it asked
 You gotta be quick and move fast if you want to line up those perfect shots at the right angles
Posted: 4 July, 2016
Do you remember Pokemon Snap
 Now narrow that down to one anime tiddies mascot and throw it into a VN setting and you essentially have Sonicomi
 Is it anything ground breaking
 Not at all
 Is it pandering to its audience and primarily fanservice
 Hell yes
 All in all, its as good a reason to have lewd photoshoots as any
 If any of y'all need me I'll be snapping pics of my waifu now
Posted: 25 June
Awahwahwah
 This game is good
Honestly though, Sonico as a character is about as you'd imagine, impossibly cute and endearing
 The 'photo shoot' mechanics are a nice change of pace in what is otherwise a traditional VN
 It's not deep, and it doesn't leave you pondering many things
 But, that's not really the point, is it
Posted: 25 July, 2016
Waifu Snap or Waifu Dress Up Simulator, name it what you want but it's a very enjoyable visual novel with awesome music, funny characters and multiple routes/choices to take to get all the 18 endings
 And after completing each ending, you will be rewarded with new outfits & hairstyles that you can use in Free Mode, which is where most of your time will be having your ''special'' photo shoot with Sonico, amirite
 But seriously, it's really worth buying it if you like visual novels

To be enjoyed both ironically and unironically, 'Magical Diary' is truly the perfect gift for any occasion
 Featuring more animes per second, with only a fraction of the overreaching schmaltz found in second-rate indie competitors like 'To the Moon,' 'Magical Diary' pulls out all the stops and delivers a magical, one-of-a-kind experience that'll have you saying "I actually don't hate this
" for years to come
Is there a demonic wizard bishie waiting in your future
 Only one way to find out

A dating sim for the young witch in all of us
 Like Harry Potter, with a liberal dose of anime and without all that uptight britishness that makes me kinda hate it
 Also a liberal dose of progressive gender and sexuality, which is always a fun one, and racial politics too
 (That said, I was a *little* offput by the 'marriage is kind of a year-long thing' plot point, even if it makes sense in context
)Don't be fooled - this is mostly a dating/life sim
 There are 'dungeons', but they're more obtuse and annoying puzzle roadblocks I could honestly do without
 Persona 3/4 this ain't
 Also, you have to be a girl, though you have a wide range of options for your love life, three straight and two gay, and a wide variety of other non-romance events
 Romance is legitimate and well-handled - the opposite of Bioware's efforts
 (Oh god, flashbacks to terrible competing english VN Planet Stronghold DDDDDDD:)Overall, takes itself just seriously enough not to be a broad parody, but not so much that it's hard to get into or requires heavy investment
 (The default character's name is Mary Sue, if that tells you anything
) Highly recommended for anyone who's even a little into the idea, and even better, sequels are on the way
Sadly, the best character is unromanceable, despite her obviously being open to the idea of a relationship with a student and a lady
 :C Oh, Professor Potsdam, how I long for some private lessons with you
 ;o; (maybe she's married
 i dunno
)
Posted: 24 October, 2014
Ok I'm not going to lie, if I saw this 2 months back I would think,"Nope boring, don't like dating sims,"Then I bought Dandelion Wishes Brought to You, and it opened my eyes to how funny and sweet these games are, they're not just so silly girls fantasy, most of them have a really good story and good/funny charters that you can't help but fall in love with
 And this is another, I didn't think I'd like it as much as I did but I love it, I have laughed so much from this game it hurts and yes tears have fallen from my eyes
 The art style might not be the best but it's simple and that's nice
I now love dating simes because most of the time they have a better story then some shooters or other games, and the best part is that their is more then one story, since there are different charters everyone will have thier favourites and their least favourite which is the best part
 (My favourite is Damien, what can I say deamon boys capture my heart hahah :3 )So if you want to have a laugh and not rage quit buy this game I will guarantee that at least a part of this game will make you laugh, if it doesn't well done to you, because I'm in stiches

This game owns
 You can go to American Hogwarts and learn magic spells
 There are LOADS of spells and I got tonnes of detention, it has Professor Snape (basically him), you can make your own wizard and learn magic, you can kiss people with your mouth and make friends
 It rules
 Play it

+ I love the humor+ Equal opportunity routes+ Memorable characters+ Great use of magic theme+ Interesting lore/world building and magic system+ Uses simplified character customization which includes a body type for big gals which is something that is rarely included in games, I was very impressed by this simple choice
+ A lot of replayability
 The cheat system is a big help to see hidden scenes+/- I got used to the art style fairly quickly, it didn't bother me after an hour or so of playing- Single CG is recycled, romance is very brief- Too many useless spells and not enough opportunities to use them- You only play through your freshman year
 It leaves you wanting to play more
Posted: 23 May, 2016
This game definitely didn't disappoint
 I've only played James's route so far, but the story was awesome and I can't wait to play the others
The only negative I have for this game is the difference in art style compared to the first
 It looks rough and unpolished in my opinion, but it didn't detract from the game at all
 It's more of a personal taste, I think
Posted: 25 May, 2016
First of all, this game was well worth the wait
 While I'm still navigating through endings, I can already say it's better than the first
 Well done, Michalea
 I am impressed, yet again
I do have one problem though: The Wives
 I'm not sure if they were a kickstarter reward or something, but they feel pointless and irrelevant, regardless
 The 4 remaining brothers bring their human (I'm assuming) wives to the demon world to rescue the other brother's wife from the demon world
 What
 I may be missing something, but they just seem to take up space and that annoys me
I'm doing my best to ignore them, so I still think this is a great game
Posted: 26 May, 2016
HERE WE GO AGAIN, AND THIS TIME IT GETS STEAMY
STORYthis game 100% lives up to the excellence of the first game
 I really don't want to spoil anything, but essentially you start where you left off with the boy of your choice, (or Diana) and due to a series of unfortunate events end up in the middle of a demonic civil war
 will your love conquer all
 will you be able to return home with your lover
 WILL SOMEONE FINALLY EXPLAIN WHY ERIC PARTS HIS HAIR THAT WAY
 (the answer to this last question is no)CHARACTERSthey are true to their personalities from the first game, but new things are learned about all of them
 the things the characters must toil through in the game only help them grow as people/demons/demoness'
 they are all very likable and enjoyable as characters, although once in awhile they say something really cliche that makes you want to throw up, but that actually makes them feel even more like real people
SEXY STUFFwhile I love the story of this game, and it kept me on the edge of my seat at times, to be honest I'm a huge pervy weeaboo
Posted: 29 May, 2016
I really enjoyed the first game, so naturally I got this game thinking that I would enjoy it just as much, if not more
 I played for about 3 hours, got a few different endings and was generally disappointed with this game
 It was pretty convoluted and went off topic a bit so the flow of the game kept getting interrupted
I'll give a few examples
 *SPOILERS AHEAD*It made no sense and in fact was a terrible idea that the boys brought their wives with them to the demon world, they are human and therefore would have no way to protect themselves
 They were in the story just to be there; they had no importance
 The malicious voice in the main character's head also killed it for me a little bit, it got to the point where it was just annoying
 I appreciate the attempt at all the little side stories such as Diana's love with her guard and her team wanting her dead, but the way it was introduced was jarring
 Long story short, this game isn't worth $10
00 and if you liked the way the original ended then don't bother playing this one

First, I must say that I loved Matthew’s route
 He’s my favorite character, I love his cute personality, and his VA is excellent
 The bad ending surprised me a lot (and kinda creeped me out, but I liked
 Haha), and the good ending was cute
 Sam’s route was another surprise, I’m not really a fan of “brute” characters, but the writing was good and I could feel that he really cared about the MC
 The art style was good (I’m not so picky about that tho), BGM was great
 But… Let me talk about the things that bothered me
*** SPOILERS ***The wives & absence of Naomi and Suzu: I absolutely adore Naomi and Suzu
 Their routes on the first game were ok, but I love them more as friends of MC
 It saddens me that you can’t interact more with them, besides talking on the phone
 And suddenly there’s the wives
 I honestly felt happy that the other boys (besides the one you’re dating) got married, but I think it was totally unnecessary to make them a part of the story, and interact with the MC
 And… get sucked into the Demon World together with their husbands
 I can understand about the boys, but the wives
 They don’t do ANYTHING
 They show up once in a while and that’s it
 That was kind of a let down, and I really don’t think that the boys would risk the life of their beloved wives on war field
 There might be an explanation for that, but sorry, I don’t buy it
 
_
Erik’s route was all about Diana: Ok, Erik isn’t my favorite guy in the game
 I’m not a fan of the playboy type, but I still care about this character
 But honestly, his route was all about Diana’s sister
 I couldn’t feel a proper interaction between him and the MC
 Maybe it’s just me, but I think that kinda ruined what could have been a good route…Despite my complains, it was great to play this VN
 I loved the fact that each route is unique, the new characters (except the wives lol), the multiple possible endings, and the fact that every choice matters
 I really like this developer, and I wish them the best of luck on their next releases
7/10, because Matthew is love, Matthew is life
Posted: 10 June, 2016
Not only did I fall in love with the first one, I fell hard for the second one too
 Sam maybe my favorite but I love and enjoy all the stories and finding new endings
 I try to save everyone
 I don't want them to die by the Demon Lords hands
 I'm into these kind of stories and I just fangirl over it all the time as I play
 I get so emotional while playing this game, it touches my heart strings so much
 AND that ending song for the credits
 I am head over heals for it
 After the second time listening to it, I caught myself singing along
 It was so beautiful
 I strongly recommend this game for fellow, lovers of anime, fantsy, lovable monsters, sexy men/women, and heart touching stories, each of them have their own unique qualities c; -Wink wink- I could replay the stories from this and the first one and never be bored
 Thank you so much for coming out with a second one
~ May there be more stories to come
 ^-^
Posted: 26 June, 2016
First off, I would recommend downloading the first game (I mean it's free) and playing that through first then play this game right afterwards
 I had some time in between game 1 and game 2 while waiting for it to come out and I noticed that the storyline seemed more sappy
 But when I played it through again after playing the first one, I had remembered my attachment to the romanceable character and really enjoyed it
One unique thing about this game is each romanceable character has a very unique storyline
 There are some parts that remain the same in the middle, but so much is different depending on your "fiancee" that I'd recommend playing every romance option
 This is what made the game worth the money to me since it was more than one storyline and it didn't get overly repetitive to play it over and over again
 The story is pretty short, so you want to get your money's worth
Posted: 4 July, 2016
After playing the first game, I had quite high expectations and this game definitely didn't disappoint me
So far I have played all but Diana's route but from what I have seen I've got my money's worth already
The only thing I felt was negative was the difference in the art style compared to the first game
 Unfortuantley my beloved Sam look completely different and I do not approve
 I also found it a litte bit strange that the incubi would bring their wives into the demon world with them
 Some of them, Irene for example made sense since she belong in that world but the rest
 Not so sure
 I would have liked a bit more main character portraits as well since Mika is very pretty and it adds a lot to see her together with the others but it didn't bring the gaming experience down too much at all
10/10 would bang Sam again

This game was leagues better than its predecessor
 It wasn't as cookie cutter of a story as it was before
 The art style has improved a bit and I was pleased with the writing
 The routes are all very different and the heroine wasn't as helpless, letting her become stronger and develop a sense of duty
 And I liked the new characters and how much Diana changed from the first game
 I loved her more than ever
But while there are good points, there are some places where it fell flat
 The character development of the guys was a bit minimal and I wished to see a bit more from them
 The sidestory between Diana/Saero was a bit out of the way and albeit a bit over the top
 The player wants to focus on their love's route, not someone else's personal affair, especially while pursuing her on her route
 While it was entertaining, I personally believed it was a bit much
 Some of the fights were a bit anticlimactic
 But overall, I liked it better than the first one
 While there are flaws, this is still a pretty good otome game

Seduce Me 2: The Demon War is the obvious sequel to Seduce Me The Otome, created by Michaela Laws, a game which I enjoyed very much and felt had a great amount of content for being a free game
 The question is, was its sequel successful in seducing me
 In my opinion, after playing through three different routes, I find that this is a fantastic stand-alone game, as well as a great sequel, worth the complete full price - and i'll tell you why
 (Ahoy, mild spoilers ahead
 Won't spoil any end-game things though
)+ Story is infinitely better than the first
 It has a more cohesive, fleshed-out plot rather than being all over the place like in the first
 This sequel knows its beginning, middle and end and displays great pacing which makes the game feel wrapped up well at the end
 It embraces the "Demon" storyline as a main factor in this game, rather than having it as a side aspect to speed up the relationship process
 The story is insanely different in each route (I have played Sam's, Matthew's and James' stories, all vastly different and enjoyable)
 There is PLENTY of choice, and the story itself is really just so much fun to experience, with both love and war being the main topic
 I have had so much fun playing this game
+ Art
 The Art was a mixed bag, but I will talk about what I liked first because my thoughts on the art are mostly positive
 It has greatly improved since the first game, and with this improvement the characters have changed slightly
 I really loved this change - mostly
 Matthew looked good
 Sam, James and Diana look absolutely awesome
 The backgrounds were lovely and I thought the game as a whole was easy on the eyes
 There is better art in other VN's, but the art in these two games has a lot of personality imo
 + Voice acting is better than ever
 Every voice actor, yet again, did an amazing job
 I was sort of hoping that "Mika" would have a proper voice this time around, but to no avail
 Anyway, waiting on that blooper reel, Michaela
 Pls
 Need more Jonah and green apples in my life
 + Replayability
 I mentioned in the story section that there are plenty of choices, and there really are
 Each story is so amazingly different, I found out so many different things in three different playthroughs, and I'm still not bored of the game
 I still have plenty of achievements to unlock
 The first game got incredibly repetitive
 This one, while in some parts does still repeat, is not even on the same level of repetition
 + Those sex scenes doe
 This game is like 80% fanfiction lemony smut goodness and it's just great
 Love it
 It's even better that you're granted the choice to avoid them completely - not that I'm going to do that ever - but you know, that's great for people who don't like that sort of stuff + Characterization
 The guys in their routes really shined once more, really grew throughout the story, showcasing their relatibility and flaws
 The side characters were very interesting too when you selected their training, especially Saero
 However, Diana is the character that truly shines in this sequel
 She tugs at your heart strings and makes you feel the feels without even starting her route
 If you hated her in the first game, you'll love her in this one
+
Music is on point
 That piano
 Christopher Escalante you are the man
 I'm not a person that focuses on music, but every time that piano came on I would just sit and listen to it in a dreamy state
 Action/fight music is also amazing and gets you so pumped up
 Overall, the music was never annoying, repetitive or too loud
 - Art - While I overall enjoyed the art, I had a couple problems
 Erik's face was drawn well but his physique looked unnaturally thin, though this didn't bother me too much
 What bothered me the most was Damien
 Suddenly shorter and looking really nothing like what he is meant to, each time he popped up I got annoyed
 His body looks weird
 He looks 5 years younger than he did in the first
 I assume this happened because he is in fact the youngest and they were trying to re-establish this but isn't Matthew meant to be the babyface
 These changes made him feel like a different character
 I suppose the same could be said with Sam, but I thought his change was for the better and was a vast improvement in comparison to Damien's
 - The Wives
 Okay, I've got to say it
 I have no idea if this is true or not, but did some fans win a competition to have their OC's inserted into the game
 Because this is exactly what it feels like
 For majority of these wives, it feels like they were created by a 12-year-old on DeviantArt
 They aren't explained properly
 It's not realistic to think all the guys would be married in a mere two years
 They have no substantial impact on any plot or dialogue
 They are there, purely and simply for one reason: fanservice
 The only wives I liked are Irene (Erik's wife) and Carrie (Sam's wife)
 The rest are painfully hipster and "unique", looking like they haven't started high school yet
 Their addition was forced and broke immersion
 - No art for MC
 This game felt like it was trying to completely get rid of "Mika" Andersons' pre-established appearance from the first game
 In three playthroughs I saw the back of her head once
 I just didn't understand this
 We know what she looks like, why not draw her instead of drawing one of the boy's from a provocative perspective
 (Update: She is drawn in Erik's route, so apologies for this one
 I think she could have been drawn more though)- There's bugs
 Incorrect text from different playthroughs
 I got some achievements that I shouldn't have got
 Not a huge deal, I understand the game was rushed out
 TL;DR: Overall, I enjoyed this story a lot more than the original
 It was more entertaining and well structured than the first, definitely worth $10
 It's 80% lemon
 You get to fight things
 There's lots of nipples for the whole family to enjoy
 8
5/10 - It seduced me again

Overall, Hustle Cat is a great game
 There are a few niggling issues that might be easily fixed but honestly none of them are major enough to detract from what is an incredibly enjoyable game
Hustle Cat is one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long time
 I was immediately attracted to the project; being a cat lover and appreciating its nonbinary options (and Graves having an uncanny resemblance to my husbando) made me back the kickstarter right away
Some basic info:You can pick your pronouns (She/Her, He/Him, They/Them) and what Avery looks like (you have between masculine presenting and feminine presenting and a range of skin tones) but you cannot change the name
 You can change which pronouns you want in the menu, whenever you like
You can romance any of the characters regardless of any options you pick, however one character is a secret option
 One play through lasts about 2
5 hours to 3 hours
 Any subsequent ones will take less if you skip
 There are 6 routes in total
 There are bad ends
The good stuff:The writing is incredibly enjoyable
 It's certainly on the meme-y side of things, but the jokes were great, many had me giggling out loud
 A lot of scenes made me cry; but YMMV
 The characters are all very likeable and have great chemistry with each other
 There are so many scenes I enjoyed, and honestly it was just such a fun experience playing it
 The routes are fairly flexible
 Some visual novels I have played tend to lock you in pretty early and with obvious choices, but with Hustle Cat they have a points system
 Don't feel like picking one option will lock you in to that character
The art is mostly great
 I really like a lot of the sprites, many of the characters have great poses and expressions that really reflect their character
 Art is always important in visual novels as it tends to be what people judge the game on, and I think for the most part Hustle Cat does a great job
The characters are all great
 I was immediately draw to Graves, but then began to love Finley and Mason too
 And then Hayes, Landry and Reese… Unlocking the secret route involves putting time in with everyone, but I don't believe any one of these characters routes was anything less than enjoyable
This is an incredibly inclusive game
 The fact that you can choose your pronouns and date anyone regardless of gender is incredibly amazing and honestly something that just cannot be faulted, unless you are against anything vaguely 'SJW-like'
 The inclusivity is not harming you in any way and you don't have to romance anyone you don't want to; if the games inclusivity bothers you in any way then this just isn't the game for you
A few issues:The screenshot button and steam overlay do not work
 The game is easily tabbed out of, but I found the fact I couldn't take screenshots with steam really quite disappointed
 I wanted to share things with friends who had already played the game and had to use a different piece of software to do so
This is more or less severe depending on taste, but while I thought the majority of the sprites were good, some of the CG were disappointing
 In particular I think of Mason's end CG, which seems to be unshaded and just looks a lot worse compared to the other CG
 It almost seems like it was a time issue; the CG simply looks a little unfinished
The skip button is okay, but could be better
 The transitions still take a while and so spamming space bar is often a bit quicker
 The story feels a little disjointed in some places, and the pacing is rather quick
 At one point Avery started talking about their crush; I had no idea who it was and how it happened
 I know that it was because of a choice I made, but it doesn't make much sense if you play it without realizing that you effectively skipped a scene
 I suppose this gave some suspense as to who I was actually romancing… I would've liked it to have been longer so I could spend more time with the characters, but of course I would have expected the price to be more too
 In my opinion, this game is good value for money at full price
There are so few save files
 Having played a fair amount of visual novels I am used to having pages and pages of save files, but I found Hustle Cat a bit lacking
I enjoyed Hustle Cat immensely and am so glad I backed it on kickstarter
 Whether you're interested in the plot, the cats, the characters, the inclusivity, or something else, you will find this game enjoyable
 Visual novel purists might be turned off by the game's elements that are atypical of the genre, but I believe anyone interested in the premise or any of the game's aspect will find it enjoyable
 If in doubt, wait for steam sale, but if you're in any way excited by the game, buy it now
 Thanks Date Nighto, I won't be forgetting Hustle Cat for a long time

I said I wouldn't buy the cat dating game even if it was on sale
I bought it
I said I wouldn't get too absorbed in the cat dating game
I played it for ten hours straight
I said I wouldn't get worked up over a dumb cat dating game
I have cried at the end of every single route
How dare this game be amazing and creative and emotional and fantastic, I wanted to make fun of the cat dating game
Posted: 6 May, 2016
I bought this game because I enjoyed watching PressHearttoContinue's LP of it
Posted: 19 March, 2016
First, I want to note as a caveat, I have played only two of the game's six routes thus far (with the women, cause i'm gay)
 Note my time played - 3
5 hours, as of when I'm writing this
 Unless some of the men's routes are much longer, which I seriously doubt, I can't imagine getting more than nine hours out of this
 MAYBE if you really like rereading VNs
 Even then, most VN's I've got through steam are quite a bit longer
 (I've since finished all routes)I'm glad I played this game, but in good conscience I cannot recommend a game this short at this price
 It is a VERY, VERY short game, and the price it's at as of my writing this review (17
99 USD) is just totally unreasonable
ETA: I've played all six routes now
 Total play time 8
1 hours on record (I did kinda blitz through the mens' routes; like I said, I'm gay and biased towards the women)
 They were all very well written and engaging, with good art and interesting characters
 I stand by everything else I've said in this review - including, unfortunately, my non-recommendation
I can see why it's priced high; it clearly has very high quality art and text and music (particularly considering that there are six versions of Avery's face)
 But from a consumer standpoint it's really hard to justify
So, on to the good
The art is excellent, and the writing is great
 Mason's route actually had me in tears
 Finley is absolutely adorable
 The beginning, and some short parts near the end, got a bit repetitive, but overall I liked all the different routes, how you learn different things about the characters etc
I like the ability to choose the pronouns for Avery, your character, and also independently select your appearance (there's a more 'masculine' and a more 'feminine' face available, and you can choose between three skin tones as well)
 This is reflected pretty well in the gameplay as well, though there were a couple awkward moments in Finley's route where a side character's dialogue seemed to be making the assumption that Avery was male, and noone corrected him
 (The pronouns still fit, it was a broader text issue
 Maybe just me
)And some small complaints, other than the length of the game
 These don't affect my (non)-recommendation
There's no text speed option that I saw, so you kind of have to click your way through each sentence of dialogue at a pretty rapid pace if you read pretty quickly
 This can also lead to accidentally clicking past a certain portion of dialogue too early because you were trying to get all the sentences displayed, which leads to another quibble
Most other VN's I've read/played, you can scroll back at least a bit to see something you might've just missed
 Hustle Cat, for some reason, does not
 There IS a log, so if you just missed something you can open that and see the recent text, but it's odd that you can't just scroll back a little bit
 I assume this is in Ren'Py, which I KNOW can do that
Also, this isn't something I'm actually concerned with at all, but I know some people prefer much more interactive VN's
 This isn't; in all of the routes, the first third of the game is making some basic decisions about who you get close to, which determines which route you're on; the middle third is non-interactive; and the last third may have one player choice which either immediately leads to a bad end or continues the story to the end
 Again, I don't mind this at all, personally; just putting it out there for people who would
Posted: 27 March, 2016
What really tuned me into the game was as the protagonist you can not only choose female or male pronouns but also nonbinary pronouns like they/them
 That was neat
 Also regardless of what character looks you go for both are the same height
This VN doesn't go beyond kissing so its not very explicit
 You get 6 character routes
 2 ladies and 4 fellas
 Some of them are PoC (another ++ for me because representation is important
 :D ) And you can romance any of 'em regardless of the gender you choose
 The story is really cute and it'll have you squeeing at certain scenes
 Planning to upload lots of screenshots when I figure out why I can't take snapshots in game on Steam
The music is great
 I haven't seen any of the positive reviews mention this but its like really good elevator music
 Like if an elevator was playing some of the tracks that I was listening to in Hustle Cat I'd probably stay on that elevator a little longer d: Like I had hustle cat playing on certain scenes for certain tracks while I was just doing stuff on my computer lolol
Some complaints I'd probably have is how I can't delete saves lol
 Like there are so few complaints that I have about hustle cat and majority of them are just glitches like eyes/nose missing from faces and it happens just a few times but it doesn't really take away from how awesome it is
 But there are things on Steam that I've noticed happens frequently like when I fast forward on hustle cat it crashes
 But again other than all these really small things it really doesn't take away from a great story and characters that you can't help but adore
Over-all no regrets
 You get 6 character routes which is about 15 hours of play time(20+ for me because I just couldn't stop replaying Mason's story before moving on) for a really cute and good story with really great music and really, really adorable characters that aren't perfect which make them perfect
 Like I can name one trait(besides all of them being super adorable) that really shine in each of the characters but I think you'd probably wanna figure that out yourself
P
S
 there are cats
 Theres this one drunk cat I wish I could post a picture of but just look for it if you get this game
So basically you get: Cats, diverse characters, Cats, Coffee, Donuts, adorableness
 And Cats

Pros:+ LGBT+ friendly+ Pronoun selection+ 10 to 20 hours of gameplay total+ Beautiful Artwork+ Meaningful decisions+ Good story+ Amazing soundtrack+ Multiple endingsCons:- Several typos (I only found 2)- Can be a bit cheesy at timesOpinions:~ Characters are very cute~ Hilarious dialogue~ In-game architecture is astounding~ Small but loving fanbase~ Some of the characters are a bit stereotypical~ (But I love them anyway)~ Replaying the game for each route is somewhat tiresomeDefinitely worth the price

I was eyeing this title for a while and finally decided to get it during the Summer Sale
 Zero regrets
 It was a pleasant way to spend a day
 It took me about 10 hours to reach 100% completion (consider that I used the fast forward button a lot during replays)
 Despite completing the game, I enjoyed it enough that I would consider replaying it later
 It's definitely a decent addition to your library, especially on discount
 I have paid more for far worse
 As a plus point, you can pick from 6 player avatars of different skin tones, and also pick your own pronouns (he, she, they)
I don't know why more games don't do this
 Best part is that you can switch the pronouns anytime during the game, so you can use whatever you're comfortable with to complement the character you end up dating ingame
 It's a very nice detail
Do note the game will sometimes crash
 Save often
 Sometimes it crashes when saving too
Story: I was expecting it to be a lighthearted game where cats turn into people and all you do is flirt to get their attention while drowning in catnip and inneundo
 The story turned out to be more complex as you find out more about the cat curse
 However, your options to deal with the curse are limited
 Your focus remains on interacting with the other characters to decide whose route to land on
 Each character is well-written and I loved each of their personalities
 They felt realistic, and I would I love to know them in real life
 I wish there would be a sequel or extra side stories
 Maybe put the characters in an AU
There are a total of 6 routes, including the secret Graves route (unlocked after you complete all the other routes)
 There are several common scenes with very slight variations
 Fortunately, there is a fast forward button to speed through them if you want
 There is only 1 ending per character, and 2 common bad endings
 On average, it took me 1
5 to 2 hours per route
The story was original enough to get my attention
 It has its cute moments and is peppered with humour
 However, it could have used more depth
 Only one route (Mason) explored the difficulties they face from the curse e
g
 Mason pretends she's a regular cat so she can spend time at the corner store
 Aside from that, how long has everyone been cats
 Doesn't anyone realise, especially Landry whose parents live in the city
 And it would have been cool to see all their apartments or wherever else they hang out as cats outside work
 Ok, so maybe this isn't a priority since it's really all about Avery, but it would have made the story better
I thought everything would be explained in Graves's route (common for secret routes), but his ending was rather abrupt
 I was disappointed that they didn't fully explain about his past with Nacht, and about how this whole situation happened
 I think a DLC prequel or sidestory would help close the loop
Music/Sound: There is no voice-acting, which is fine because the dialogue and characters' expressions manage to capture the tone
 The opening theme song doesn't appeal to me but the rest of the music is on point
 They even throw in some sound effects during the story
 I like Graves's background music to the point that I'm thinking of getting the music DLC

"Hustle Cat" is a true gem among visual novels, that are currently available on Steam
 I absolutely adore this game
 That being said, if you are interested in buying it, there are two things you need to consider
 First of all, it's short
 When you look at my playtime (add 1 or 2 hours for offline), you should know, that it took me that little to finish the WHOLE game (all six routes)
 Another thing is that decisions have very slight impact on the game, they are pretty much limited to choosing the character you will end up with
 And while each route presents new scenes with your "chosen one", the overall storyline remains the same, no matter who will you pick
 I write about it here, because even though, usually, I considered things like that a flaw, that didn't bother me at all with this game
Great things:Plot
 It's light-hearted for the most part, but besides humor and warm atmosphere, it has intrigue, danger, it has stakes, it has tension and mystery, so everything you could expect from a game like this
 Plus, writing is great
Protagonist
 Avery (name, for same reason, isn't changeable) is very relatable protagonist
 They are adorably awkward at times, sweet, caring and smart
 Also, I like how you can chose your pronounces (He/She/They)
 I think more visual novels should implement system like this, to give their players flexibility when it comes to romance options
Characters
 They look different from each other and they behave in a different way
 They are not cliche and each of them has an interesting story
 I liked every single one pursuable character
 Graves and Mason are definietely my favorite
 If I would have to pick my least favorite, that would be Finley - I like her as a character, but her route felt waaaay over the top and I didn't enjoy her ending
 Still, all routes are worth exploring
The feels
 I'm not very sentimental person
 I don't cry on "Titanic" and I don't really care about "The Notebook" and other tear-squezers, so when game is able to make me tear up a bit, that game does something right
 Maaaagic
 I love the fact, that this game doesn't take itself completely seriously and, with full awareness, often reminds players that "magic is weird, huh
"
 At the same time, I really appreciate those little details, that are thrown on various routes and explain more about how magic work in this game-world
CATS
Bad things:Skipping
 Dear God
 Scrolling
 Seriously
 It still takes way too long and you can skip over seen text, which is annoying
 There is also a skip button
 That skips everything so slowly, that you can literally step away from your computer and make yourself something to drink
 Oh, but when you come back, you may also realize, it skipped over not-seen text
 This is a basic function for visual novel these days, so it's almost baffling to see how bad it was implemented
Lack of options
 Option menu has like four functions
 No speed regulation, no skipping options, nothing of importance to someone, who doesn't want to regulate music
Technical difficulties
 First of all, there are moments, when you need to click several times before the dialogue moves on (and I'm not talking about those moments, where dialogue is still added to the same box)
 Then, saving either goes smoothly and takes a second or the game will freeze for a good few minutes
 At one of those time, I needed to Ctrl+F4 my way out of it and restart my laptop soon after, because game was still running at the background and slowed everything so much, that I was unable to close it even via Process Monitor
 Then, if that wasn't enough, there are issues with achievements
 I needed to go through one scene like four times before Steam registered that I actually did what I suppose to do
Character's "customization"
 It may seem unreasonable to complain about optional feature, but I feel like there is a reason to do it in that case
 When you start the game, you can chose between two very similar avatars
 Both are rather boy-ish looking, both have white hair and the same eye color
 The only variations comes from skin colors
 Picking between how my character looks did absolutely nothing to make the game more enjoyable or immersive
 I would much rather have an option to change my character's name (it's very strange that this wasn't implemented), than having this slight, barely noticeable difference between protagonist's look
 I'm bringing this up, because I feel like this had an impact on price
 And that lead me to the next point
Price
 When I truly enjoy something, I usually try to avoid judging price as "too high", but in this case, it would be hard to avoid and dishonest
 I like this game a lot, but my playtime, technical difficulties, similarities between the routes and general lack of content (especially when I compare this game to other visual novels in the same price-range), makes it hard to justify selling "Hustle Cat" for 20€
 I've picked it up for half the price and I recommend you to do the same, if you don't want to feel disappointed
Conclusion
"Hustle Cat" is one of the bast "dating" visual novels currently available on Steam
 It has options for all genders and sexual preferences, it has great story, solid writing and absolutely adorable characters, that will stay in my memories for long
 I will probably replay this game at some point and, as someone with a huge backlog, that is not something I declare lightly
 I really hope that developers will create something equally magical in the future (just with better engine)

I got it because of the 1% discountgame has 51% discount this time ++
Posted: 9 August, 2016
I really wanted to like this game
 It's silly, it has a Tommy Wiseau pigeon, and it costs $1
 But some things are just broken
The entire game consists of flying left or right and pressing space to poop on things
 Sometimes the things move, and sometimes there is wind, so your poop moves
 The dialogue between levels is in broken English that is usually understandable if you take an extra second or two
 All of that is fine
 It's funny, simple, and endearing
The problem is the one difficulty mechanic (admittedly I didn't get very far) is wind
 Wind makes your poop move, and wind changes direction, except it doesn't
 Currently there's a wind indicator that shows you whether wind is blowing left or right
 Wind always blows right, even if the indicator says it's blowing left
Also apparently it's just a browser game, because every time I hit F12 to take a screenshot (the default keybind in Steam) a Chrome debugger window pops up over the game
On one hand it's $1 and it's entertaining enough that I kind of don't care
 On the other hand I just paid $1 for a browser game with one mechanic that doesn't even work

Surprisingly difficult
 I had fun playing this game, but you only have room to mess up very few times (1-4 usually)
 Which means that you'll have to restart multiple times to complete a single level
 The soundtrack is pretty good and the English translation is impressive
7/10
Posted: 9 August, 2016
Product received for free
Failed YouTube bait
 Even if you like basic humour that no thought went into, the game is still brought down by the boring gameplay that makes the game no fun at all
Posted: 12 August, 2016
It's cute and funny
 The art is great and the broken English is endearing
 The 2nd or 3rd level after the tutorial the difficulty spikes and it becomes all but impossible
The problem is that the game wants perfection while having random failure coded into it
 You're given very little room for error (12 bullets for 10 targets, for example - oh but there's a sob story about a little baby squab starving so actually it's 10 bullets for 10 targets)
 You are a moving object (a pigeon) trying to hit moving objects (people), Your bullets (poos) are affected by wind, which blows either left or right (you're told which direction at least)
 The degree to which your bullets are affected by wind is based on the direction your pigeon is flying, and the poo's own weight - heavy poos fall faster and are pushed by wind less, while little poos fly all over the place
 The problem is that the weight of a poop is completely random and unknowable to the player, so ultimately whether a shot hit or misses comes down to luck
 You can try to mitigate the RNG in various ways, like lining up your shots perfectly, or trying to aim for "clumps" of pedestrians in the hope a randomly heavy poop will hit someone you weren't aiming for, but ultimately it stopped being fun the 50th time I had to reload a level becuase a shot was randomly a different weight and went flying off in a direction I wasn't aiming
If the game were more forgiving with ammo, or more consistent with firing, I'd have recommended it
 As it is, I ragequit after about 25 minutes (steam didn't record my playtime for some reason
)
 It's worth a buck for the story and art alone, but the gameplay stops being fun very quickly
Posted: 19 January
The gameplay is pretty lame, but I'm hooked on the bizarre story and I think playing this is worth it for that alone
I'm even going back to get the other endings
Posted: 12 October, 2016
I'm gonna do something I don't usually do here, and deconstruct other users' reviews
 Seems petty, right
 Eh, just try and stop drunk me from writing this review at 2am
I've seen several say "It's a $1 game", which is irrelevant in my opinion
 Mainly because there are many independently developed games available online for free
Another review said "I really wanted to like this game 
 it has a Tommy Wiseau pigeon"
 I love watching "The Room" as much as the next bad film lover, however this games' film references (which, by the way, there were plenty of) felt like vapid pandering at best
 Besides, if you're looking for a good game featuring the ever captivating being by the name of Tommy Wiseau try The Room Tribute[www
newgrounds
com]
 It's a brilliant little game, and furthermore it's free
Stuff shouldn't always get a free pass because it's cheap
 This game is basic and repetitive, and the controls are too sensitive to feel comfortable
 The pixel art is good enough, but its' near monochrome aesthetic isn't nearly as thematically suited to it as in Papers Please
 The translation leaves much to be desired, often causing more confusion than good
 Minor gripe, but there's no Steam overlay either
 It sadly, overall, feels like either a free Flash game, a mobile game or a Student Project
Posted: 5 August, 2016
It's a fun and challenging game
You're a pigeon, you poop on things
There are other pigeons that tell you what to poop on
It looks like it was translated with Google translate, but, hey
It's a $1 game
It's $1, I should've opened with that
Posted: 12 May
Who knew a modern Potty Pigeon would have a politically charged storyline with multiple branches that dealt with classism and the crushing realities of a greed focused society
Also you get to poop on people
(not so wild about that because it's really tricky once wind gets introduced, but you can figure out a rhythm eventually)

Not a very good game
 It's cheap, it's full of memes, it's simple and frustrating and boring
All you do is push left and right to move the bird left and right
 It's simple, no physics, left and right
 And you push a button to fire, which goes diagonally left or diagonally right depending on the wind
 You have a quota of walking people and stationary vehicles to crap on
 You also have a very limited amount of poo
 And if you miss, or hit the wrong things so you can't win a level, the game doesn't tell you you're in an unwinnable situation, it waits until you've used up all your bullets then tells you
 Also it doesn't show you what your quota is on-screen so you can count them off
So it's frustrating
 And simple
 And not very good
Do yourself a favour and find a C64 emulator and a copy of Potty Pigeon
 It was a much better game
 It's probably 30 years old now, but was a much better, much more featureful, arcade game than this
 The music was better too

This game gives you the choice of riding a variety of tanks
 You have to choose your tank wisely, as each one has their strengths and weaknesses depending on the terrain and situation
 For example, the M4 is a very versatile medium tank with a 75mm gun, and although it's armour isn't particularly strong, a skilled commander can utilize it's sloped surfaces and rounded turret for maximum effect
 Meanwhile, the T34 has great sloped armour and wide tracks for effective traverse in rough terrain, but lacks the more sophisticated equipment and reliability of the Pz
IV
 Of course, choosing the legendary Tiger I might be tempting with it's great 88mm and thick front armour, but you have to be mindful of it's unreliable engine
I have to admit though, that the selection of tanks could, and should have been greater
 There are several other NPC tanks that you will meet through the game, like the Maus and the B1, but unfortunately you don't get to drive them
 The areas in the game are also not as varied as they could have been, but includes a beach, a mountain and several urban areas
However, despite it's shortcomings, this is a very charming tank simulator

A Kiss For The Petals franchise, Remembering How We Met is a great chapter for those who are new to the series as it tells the brand new story of Risa and Miya romance while looking back on the history of their time in St
 Michael Girl's School
 A long look back at Risa and Miya relationship, telling the tale of how they first met and came to be lovers it follows Risa and Miya’s storyline from Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke o - Michael no Otome-tachi (correct me if i am wrong)Brief overview of the storyThe story starts off with Risa suddenly feeling nostalgia
 It was this very uniform she was wearing on her first day at St
 Michael’s
 The day she met her future girlfriend Miya
As Risa starts to look back this will be a story that shows Risa and Miya’s first encounter, where they were initially antagonistic toward each other as both are smart in different ways
Risa is studious and works hard for her achievements while Miya seeks the freedom to pursue her own interests, bcause of her innate intelligence making class a bore for her, as it all started with Risa just trying to get Miya to come to class
 How did love manage to blossom between them
 Find out as they recount the tale in a sweet loving and charming fashion
Audio and Visual elementsVisual Elements - The CGs of this game are very pleasant to look at and the art style is very "charming" with the use of bright colors to depict the mood and environment
Audio Elements - The music sets the mood for every situation, depicting playfulness, happiness and many more
 While dialogue and voice acting are both well done
 Ending credit music are pleasing to listen to
However there is one problem which i found is that the "applause" sound does not fit into the visual novel at all in
 Eg
 The scene where Miya presented her plans for the tea party and it was perfect, the applause at that scene does not fit in at all
In ConclusionFor those who are new to the franchise, this series is a must follow for every fan of yuri
 As it focuses on relationships between two girls who fall in love with each other, A Kiss For The Petals stays true to the romance between two women
 Though adult scenes are plentiful, this series is charming, and have natural development of relationships as the heroines go on dates, try to steal moments alone to express their love, and bond with each other in a very tender fashion
To sum up i would recommend this visual novel to anyone who are fans of this genre, Yuri
 This visual novel will last 3 - 4 hours
A note - This particular Sonohana title, A Kiss for the Petals - Remembering How We Met, is strictly an all-ages game
 An adult version of this game does not exist
 MangaGamer, as the publisher, did not remove, alter, or censor content for the Steam release

Literally the Metal Gear Solid of yuri visual novels

Things like this are why I still wake up in the morning
Posted: 25 September, 2015
Are you searching for meaning in life
 Tired of pondering the intricacies of the greater universe unfathomable
"A Kiss For The Petals" or Sono Hanabira is the answer
 It is the shining beacon of respite in a world without enough yuri
 When you may have troubled yourself as to life's mundane purpose, you smile, knowing that you must trouble yourself no longer, for it is done, and Sono Hanabira is on Steam
Notes:This was originally a mobile/iPhone supplementary game in the Sono Hanabira series, and this is clearly an experimental English license
 Fans will be supporting this release wildly for further localizations, and for newcomers, it may seem a bit overblown
 This is not a long visual novel, nor is it entirely representative of Sono Hanabira as a whole
 With that said
"What's with 'Sono Hanabira
'"For long-time fans of the series, this is the seventeenth game, and one of two that are 'all-ages' (the other being Hanahira, for those of you interested in continuing your adventure into Sono Hanabira while staying within the 'all-ages space)
 Sono Hanabira started as a doujin nukige (doujin: amateur work by a small group of individuals; nukige: visual novel where the plot is only around to allow for 'plot') that was very well received for its tone, atmosphere, and high-quality character designs
 "Finally, yuri done right
" A core cast of couples was developed, and multiple releases furthered the story between each of them
 The success was too much to ignore, and after ten doujin releases, the company 'Yurin Yurin' was founded and it became a professional endeavour
 "St
 Michael's Girl's School - Maidens of Michael" was released as a full length visual novel that connected, expanded, and meaningfully explored the characters in a way that previous entries didn't have room for
 A shorter sequel was released, focusing on the new couple Risa and Miya (the ones featured in this game
), as were wholly original ventures (such as ones focusing on a post-high school Nursing School) and even a "New Generations" series re-boot with an entirely new cast, as 'Yurin Yurin' was replaced as developers by 'St
 Michael's Girl's Academy' (again, a company founded entirely for this venture)
 At this point, fans are dying to play Sono Hanabira in its wholly professional and full length visual novel glory, but, it has far outpaced the fan translators and official English licensing and releases are wanted
 So, with everything we've got, fans support Sono Hanabira in its fullest with this game
 With enough support, the more lengthy games will be licensed, and the age of yuri can be heralded
Posted: 26 September, 2015
This is a review from a longtime fan of this long running series
The Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke wo series of Visual novels is a purely yuri series, centering around the interactions between the all-female student body of the St
 Michael's Girl's academy
Most the installments of the series tend to be light on choices, and contain a fair amount of adult content
 Each chapter of the original 11 (drawn by Peko and written by Jun) feature an individual couple from the series, with the 11th installment, Maidens of Michael, featuring all the couples from previous chapters
This chapter, along with the overly chibified Hanahira are the exceptions to the rule of adult content as they are both all ages chapters
 This (as far as I know) is the first chapter to receive an official western localization, and is a very light entry into the series, telling the story of Azumi Risa and Ayase Miya, a couple first introduced in Maidens of Michael and receiving their own chapter known as "Maidens of the Atelier" This is simply the story of how they met
 It's as cute as any of the pervious chapters, and features no adult content
 Definitely recommended for anyone who likes Yuri, despite it not having any choices to speak of
Definitely work picking up if you have any history with the series (like me) or if you like Yuri at all

Loren is a fantastic, polished game with well developed characters, fun turn-based battles and interesting, meaningful choices that affect the plot (granted, sometimes in small ways)
If you're on the fence about buying it, or not sure if you'll like it, here are a few details to help you make your decision
* You can choose from one of two player characters - a male human and a female elf
Their backgrounds are pre-defined, and both have access to the same skills
Who you pick determines mostly how certain NPCs react to you (some may mistrust elves, for example) and what your romantic options are
* Yes, there are romantic options in all flavors
Up until the very last screen of the romance, there's nothing risque - just a bunch of meaningul campfire scenes between you and your beloved (kind of like Dragon Age Origins)
The last screen of the romances tends to be a little racy, but it's easy enough to click through it in a microsecond if you wish
Each completed romance also gets a rather sweet scene or two in the epilogue
* Combat is turn-based, and reminds me of the old-style Wizardry games
The screenshots give you a pretty good idea of what it looks like
There's a priority system to attacks, with fast characters going first, slower ones second, etc
Each attack or spell lengthens your wait timer by a different amount
The end result is surprisingly intuitive
* There are a ton of excellent skills to play with
Each character gets two skill trees
The first one is fighter, mage or rogue, and shared with other characters of that class
In my playthrough, I seldom put points there
Instead, I focused on the far more interesting second skill tree, which is peculiar to each character
There you find things like Assassination, Dark Magic, Nature Magic, Berserker, Martial Arts, etc
There's enough variety and 'oh, neat
' factors to keep you experimenting with them for hours
* Though simple-looking, combat is strategic
 You need to juggle placement (fighters up front, ranged in the back, etc
), status effects, buffs, debuffs, attacks with various AoE shapes (all enemies, just a column, just a row), and a Pokemon-like strength and weakness system ('You cast rainstorm at Fire Demon - it's super effective
')
* Let's talk loot
 There's a lot of it here
You can find it by defeating enemies, solving quests or buying it at a shop
Shop prices drop as your reputation in each region rises, so it pays to complete non-plot-related tasks in the towns that produce your favorite plate armor, etc
Each of your followers has a loyalty quest, just like in Mass Effect or Dragon Age
If you finish it, not only will you have learned more about your companion, but you'll have a powerful piece of equipment they alone can wear
* Speaking of Dragon Age, the story here is similar in outline to that of Origins: an ancient evil has resurfaced, but the factions that could take it down are too busy bickering with each other, and it's up to your band
of adventurers to earn the respect and confidence of each region in order to unite them for a common offensive
It's a solid framework that kept me entertained for the 10+ hours I played - not once did I feel like skipping through a text box or chat bubble
* Which reminds me
 the characters are not entirely silent
You'll hear their battle cries and comments in combat
It's a nice touch, but be aware that most of the rest of the game is text-based
The first time I clicked 'play' it was early evening, and I 'just wanted to try it out'
I figured I'd do the tutorial, see if there were any glaring errors or red flags, then shut it off and go do something else
Didn't happen
Instead, I found myself glued to the screen until 6:30 AM
This is a really, really good game, folks, and if you're into old-school Wizardry-style RPGS with memorable characters, you should definitely give this one a try

Loren has the distinction of being the first game ever where I picked the male PC to use over a female PC for a first playthrough
 As a woman gamer, this is really rare
 But Loren presents two interesting backstories to choose from and those backstories really do influence how others treat your character and the dialogue options you have
 So, to back up: this is basically a low-fi version of Dragon Age
 It's heavily story driven, with several interesting characters, tons of dialogue and interaction, huge amounts of world-building, lots of really cool and diverse types of female characters, realistic conflict between characters, and Loren manages to do it all without BioWare's budget or AAA status
 The character designs are really cool (Dora and Chambara are probably my favorites) and once I realized (about 5 hours into the game, whoops
) there was a "fast combat" option in the menu to speed things up, the classic turn-based combat made me fairly nostalic
 My big complaint with the game would probably be the skill trees, partially because for strength-based (warriors) characters most of the skills were useless and for will (mages) and skill-based (thieves) the skills were often unbalanced and there's never a marker to tell you when/how you can gain certain skills (is it progression
 A certain level of will
 What
 Why can I NEVER pick that skill
)
 It gets frustrating, particularly at higher levels, as the skill points you receive are minimal throughout the game
 Regardless of my frustration with the skill trees (and by about hour 7 I just gave up and started auto-assigning), Loren's definitely one of the better RPGs I've played recently
 I'm looking forward to the other playthroughs I intend to do to see alternate paths, romances, and endings
Posted: 18 January, 2014
The game certainly has unique features, but is still very far from being excellent, although the beginning is promising
 For once you do not play as the namesake of the game, but her servant - a "lowly" male by the Amazon's standard, or a female elf (both slaves), accompanying her to go rescue her mother
 You make some choices about your past actions and here you go for your stats boost
 And the whole thing is very verbose, as promised
Problem being that for a game mostly a visual novel (the RPG aspect is just there to flesh out a bit the adventure), the story is too standard
 After rescuing Loren's mother, you learn that Evil lurks
 And yes, once again, it's an Evil that was already vanquished in the past, but as everyone know, there's not a soul in the multiverse able to properly seal any evil being whatsoever
 Fost, said Evil is uninteresting and cliché
 Let's be honest, for the game's lenght, the background is detailed enough, but still
 Too classic
 Elves antagonizing humans, orcs, dwarves, dark elves, demons aplenty, lizardmen, etc
, things we have seen a bijillion times before
 And if there are some talks about tolerance and all that, do not expect much subtelty from the plot, neither originality
 Gather all the nations, go to the Big Bad's lair, insert fights, slay said Big Bad, get the girl, the end
 Now the dialogs are quite decent, and some characters are delightful, like the female dwarf Dora (beg yer pardon, totally not a thief 
) or the snarky dark witch Chambara
 For what I saw, the romances are pleasant too- up to six possibilities, and yes, you can flirt with characters of the same gender as yours
 Concerning the dialog options, you will have three most of the time : joking, friendly or forceful
 Of course other people will react differently depending on your choices, I couldn't estimate if having a majority in one kind really forged a real reputation, but that may very well be
 And where does the gameplay fit in all this 
 Well, you'll have a great number of fights, six VS six at maximum, with some scripted ones (like having only two members in your roster)
 Back row cannot be targeted by melee attacks while there are still at least one unit in the front row, wich make it ideal for missile units (bow/magic)
 On your right you can see in what order characters and ennemies will act, then plan accordingly
 There are three classes (warrior, thief, mage), and each of your characters has a skill tree rendering him unique, like the druid being able to cast a heal spell on all a row
Thieves can use mana for special arrows (fire, ice
), warriors can force an enemy to switch position with one on the back row, etc
 Insert potions when needed
All in all it plays smoothly, but I really fail to see the claim of the developers : there's nothing hardcore in it
 If anything, it's quite casual and simple, not much strategy is involved
 Money and equipment are not being scarce, the game is quite easy
 Towns have an infinite amount of replayable tasks for money, XP and discount at the local shop ; making the possibility of skipping the odd random encounters sound
 Now, I'm one of those stressing the value of story over gameplay for RPG, a reason why Planescape Torment is one of my eternal favorites
 But I must insist : the game's intrigue has been seen too often to really be epic
 The lack of artworks is rather grueling in that regard, many scenes would have benefited from a dedicated drawing to better depict them
 Decently fleshed out characters (the personal quests help) cannot alone bring all the appeal
 This not to say a simple story is something bad, here, it's just lacking in a genre where it should shine
 One great flaw is the DLC
 I do not know about you, but 17 buckazoids is already a bit steep a price
 6€ for content which could (and should) have been in the vanilla game is a blatant rip-off
 You'll even get a message in the base game stating that you could recruit Chambara and a certain monk, but, hey, show the money first 
 Worse, those two characters can have a crucial impact on the game's ending, wich is just wrong
 And as for the replay value 
 Yes, you can still change the starting character, romance other people, make a few other choices
 But is it really worth going back to the same story without any surprise 
 The game itself is not sure of that, as you can skip all the dialogs you want, and have cheat mode enabling you to win all the battles once you have completed the game for the first time
I was intrigued by the aspect of Loren the Amazon Princess at the start and still enjoyed it
 It made me think of a Fighting Fantasy gamebook with actual character development
But if you are tempted, my advise would be to wait for a special promotion like -50%
 14 hours-ish of a classic plot (DLC accounted for) with marginal gameplay and satisfying protagonists are just not enough to be worthy of such a price
 "Two novel's worth of in-game text", by the way, is quite meaningless : are we talking 100-ish pages sized novels, or Stephen King's sized novels

I hate overly positive reviews
 The entire review scale on most websites has been shifted because these incarnations of Pollyanna insist on giving everything 10s
 Just the thought that 3/5 or 5/10 isn't considered "average" makes me want to extract vengeance on the endless parade of perfect scores
 Now that I have adequately set myself up as hypocrite of the year, let's begin the review
This game is about Loren, who happens to be the princess of the Amazons (yes, I am Captain Obvious, and I'm going for promotion - I like the sound of "Major Obvious")
 Going against all gaming tropes, she doesn't get kidnapped, nor do you play as her
 Loren: The Amazon Princess begins with the titular character decapitating some training dummies, then berating her slaves for failing to provide more
 She is then quickly informed that her mother (the Queen) did not return and is presumed dead
 Loren rejects this and embarks on a mission to save her mother, but the captain manages to force Loren to take the Amazon's most prized slave - that's you
This game's greatest strength is its characters
 Sure, Loren may be a terrifying-dual-sword-wielding-badass, but she's also never left the citadel before, and it shows
 Within an hour of starting the game, she will have demanded to speak to the Queen of a republic, choked a bartender for the crime of ignoring her, and referred to the Amazons as better than all other nations
 Other characters are no less entertaining, as you meet characters like Draco Firestarter - a fire mage who likes to start fires (am I a major yet
) and manages to cause the rest of the party to burst out laughing every time he talks, or Dora the explorer nicest thief in town - she teaches that the best way to make friends is to give them money
This does lead me to one of this game's few flaws - while the dialogue is well written all around, you have little insight into what your character will say
 Every dialogue choice you make is one of four options - Joking, Friendly, or Forceful - and occasionally Romance
 While the latter always progresses that character's romance, the first three aren't very clear on what you're about to say
 For example, early in the game you arrive in a nearby city and Loren insults it
 Your response
 Joking, Friendly, or Forceful, without any indication on whether an option agrees with Loren or not
 The only surefire way is to save before you choose, then pick every option and see which you'd prefer
The graphics are a matter of taste - this game isn't meant to melt your GPU to your motherboard
 Many of the reviews seem to hate the graphics, I personally enjoy the graphics
 The only graphical issue is with a few of the backgrounds - I noticed stairs leading up to a castle tower looked exactly the same as stairs to an inn's rooms
 Minor, but a little strange
 Overall though, I'd suggest looking at screenshots and seeing for yourself if you like the graphics
 I really don't suggest deciding to purchase (or not) a game based on graphics
 The gameplay is fairly straightforward if you've played RPGs before - everyone is either a warrior, a thief, or a mage, and you've got Strength, Skill, and Will to put points in
 Certain enemies might be weak against or resistant to certain elements (you used typhoon on fire demon
 It's Super Effective
)
 However, there are a few gameplay elements that aren't self-explanatory, and they aren't explained to you either
 For example - dual-wielding carries a penalty (except on Loren, who has a skill to remove this penalty)
 However, if you wield a dagger in the offhand, you aren't penalized - the game never actually tells you this
 It also doesn't bother clarifying stats such as "Attack" , "Damage" (aren't they the same thing
) and "threshold" (I still have no clue that this does)
The vast majority of modern games have a few places at which you can choose a different path - and it almost always comes across as a failed attempt to get the player to play the game again
 This is one of the few games where it actually works - once I finished the game, I was ready to start over with another character right then and there
 Very few games have such replay value, but many of the choices you make actually give you a different story for a while
This is one of those rare titles that actually appeals to gamers that care about characters and story, rather than running 4096x2160 at 120fps, or shooting everything you see with generic guns and getting racial slurs in return
 If this type of game doesn't appeal to you, then go download Duty of Calling: Fieldbattle 12
 But if you care the slightest about deep characters or a game that can pull you into its world, then I can't recommend this more
Posted: 19 November, 2014
If you like giggly romance, simple dialogues and a regular fantasy setting with a few rpg elements thrown in, then this might be for you
I did like it, but it's still hard to recommend from a neutral perspective
 If you look at the game mechanics, writing, character depth, story etc then this is all quite average or below
However, for a Ren'Py game (the engine) it's way above average
 And if you know Ren'Py games/visual novels in general, then you already know what to expect: a bit of silliness, lots of romance and recurring pictures
 Don't get me wrong
 that's part of the charm and quite on purpose
The only thing that disappointed me a bit is the climax of the romance
 It could have been a bit stronger, more dramatic or so, honestly
Although I'm not entirely sure, I'm giving this a thumbs down because I think the price is too high
 Maybe get it when it's on sale again and if you liked the demo (available on winterwolves homepage)

I recommend this game under the condition that it's in a HumbleBundle or more than 75% off
 $20 is too much for what you get, but if you pay less than $5 then it's well worth your money
 Keep in mind that that this is pretty much a visual novel with some RPG elements/combat tossed in
 Pros:- Fun, casual gameplay - Catchy soundtrack- Artwork isn't bad- Male/Female playable characters- Many romance options- Random encounters are skippable (as opposed to having to "flee")- Combat system is interesting and relatively intuitive- Many different classes and characters to fight with, all with a broad range of usable weapons and armor- Cheat mode to skip combat after beating the game once, to view different endings more quicklyNeutral:- There is A LOT of dialogue, and there are plenty of times where somebody repeats what they already said to you to another character- Elemental weapons are an option, but they aren't entirely useful due to enemy resistances; you're better off using normal type weapons for consistent damage and leaving the elemental attacks to the mages' spells- Some unique boss drops can be purchased in shops, for some reasonCons:- As previousy discussed, the price tag- Story isn't anything new or special- Cliche/annoying character personalities- Can only romance one character per playthrough- Only one or two background images for each location, plus a few common ones that get recycled (tomb, forest, etc)- A few continuity problems with the dialogue depending on your previous choices/the order in which you choose to do things (like when Dora exclaims her fear of Death Knights and how she has never seen one/hopes to never see one, despite having already battled one)- Combat mechanics don't seem to work consistently; sometimes using Taunt III will increase your aggro by 30%, other times by 4% (and the enemies will attack somebody else anyway)- There are fights that require certain characters to be used, which can be annoying if you don't usually use that character and they are underleveled/poorly equipped as a result- There is a severe lack of cloth/padded pants and belts in the shops; Dora and Draco were bottomless for the entirety of my playthroughOverall, it's an enjoyable little game to waste some time on, but wait for a sale

Loren The Amazon Princess is my favorite Winter Wolves game, by far
 This is most likely due to the fact that this is a lot more RPG than VN, but some of those are good as well
The combat is enjoyable and has a fair amount of depth for what is available, with a wide assortment of enemies with differing strengths/weaknesses
 There is a wide variety of characters (+3 more in the DLC) who are all completely different
 I loved pretty much every conversation with them
 The characters all look fantastic, as do the various backgrounds
 There is a LOT of text to read in this game, but if you're used to RPGs/VNs, this should be no problem
 Depending on the difficulty chosen, the game can offer a decent challenge, requiring careful consideration of abilities, items and attributes
Despite how much I loved it, I'm hesitant to recommend it at the full purchase price of $20 ($25 for Deluxe with DLC)
 Several of my hours spent were in 3rd/4th playthroughs for achievements
 Whenever there's a discount, go ahead and pick it up; you won't regret it

The biggest issue the game has are the dialogue choices
After the character creation, every dialogue option is: Joking, Friendly, or Forceful
 (and sometimes "romance" >_>)
These descriptions are simply not enough to make the choice you want
It forces you to either pick dialogue options you don't like, or (if you're like me) just save before every single choice and then try all three answers to see which one you like most
Update: I've learned that you can use the mousewheel to scroll back to the dialogue choices, and choose a different option
This makes figuring out the dialogue choice less tedious, although it still is annoying to have to select and then back out of each option
To give you an idea of how bad these dialogue options are, lets do a scenario
Person A Is arguing with Person B
They turn to you for your thoughts
Your options are Joking, Friendly, or Forceful as always, without giving you any indication of who those options side with
It's only through saving and reloading 3 times that you learn
Joking and Forceful side with Person A, and Friendly sides with Person B
Very tedious
Very annoying
Now imagine the above scenario for Every
 Single
 Dialogue
 Choice
TL;DRThe dialogue system is an utter failure
 (and that's without mentioning my issues with the story or the problems with combat)

I got curious about this game when I saw the idea of fusing RPGs and visual novels
Though I've seen the mechanic a few times, "Loren" seemed to focus on doing "more" with both of its parents
I can't call the game an insta-buy at $19
99 -
it's going to depend on wether it's for you
Me, a person who likes his RPGs with loot, skills, story, and choices (and now and then likes a game that you can sit down with for 30 minutes or 2 hours), thinks he got his money's worth
It is definitely a replayable game as well, so if you're the kind of person that likes to try different endings and plots, then that's a plus
I found a full playthrough is about 10 hours (winning unlocks
cheat mode)"Loren" is the story of an amazon princess who's mother vanishes, presumed dead, and promptly gives up her queenship to find her
She's given a single slave to help her - that's you by the way - and very quickly you're necessary as Loren is essentially a niave, unsubtle, combat machine
Very quickly Loren and your chosen hero/heroine (who you do get some customization of) end up caught up in wars and intrigue, and collect a ragtag bunch of somewhat familiar characters
So it's off to battle orcs, lizardmen, demons, and more because the world's problems are a LOT bigger than a missing queen
 
 
 The game mixes visual novel style branching storylines and classic "Camp" dialogue with point-and-click maps and classic RPG combat
It actually balances all of these pretty well - most events are "bite sized", combats don't drag on for long, and there's a pleasing level of detail in things like equipment, character development, and battle strategy
If you're an accomplished RPG player you probably won't find "Normal" too hard, though there are moments that will push you - you do have to pay attention
The best part of the combat and character building are how different factors interact - Status effects are a big part of the game, and soon you'll be trying to figure the best way to put your foes off guard
Classes are meant to work together, especially in boss battles - and every character is "dual classes" with a generic class and a specialty class, adding a nice bit of customazation to the usual trinity of Warrior-Mage-Theif
In short you're always "this basic class and 
 
 
"The story is the big selling point, and frankly, "Loren" delivers a giant heaping helping of common fantasy elements and characters that we're all familiar with (perhaps too much), but then actually goes the distance to add little personal details that bring the characters and events to life
Sure the prose has a purple tinge, and some elements border on stereotype, but it's fun and you'll find a few surprises - you actually get a nice amount of character backstory if you dive into it, as well as interesting romantic complications
There are parts that will definitely pull at your heartstrings, and I found myself geniunely liking some of the cast
So a buy
I'd say if you like your RPGs with story, want a good RPG you can play in short bursts or long sessions, and if something a bit experimental like this appeals, go for it
I think this is also a game to encourage, because the fusion is quite satisfying - and I'd like to see more
Posted: 24 October, 2014
Let me just say that Winter Wolves is a company who ought to get much more in the way of support- because this game is essentially one of the greatest visual novel games I've ever been able to play
Loren the Amazon Princess is a game that is actually worth the full price- a rarity in these times, but if you like fantasy or adventure games, you'll want to grab this
For once, you don't even play as the title character- instead, you play the second banana- either a human male slave, or an elven female
The character you choose may have different observations about certain scenarios, and they may have a different set of people they might start a relationship with, but to be quite obvious, that's all the difference between them
Both the male or female characters can get the same moves and the same classes, so really the only thing you're getting is a different view of the world
Combat is actually very well-handled- you just place your characters, and go
Their turn comes up, you pick a skill or an item to use, and then you repeat until the combat is done
You'll always have a healer on hand, because whatever you pick for your character- gender or class- you get a class of Healer right off the bat
As far as the story, it's actually well-written, and the characters have their own personalities
You can talk to them in camp, you can flirt with a certain few of them, and if your scores are high enough, you'll even end up having to make a choice in a lovers' triangle between two party members- or maybe even more
 There are both gay and straight options for both male and female characters- even more than Dragon Age, for crying out loud, and that's saying something
There's even a bit of DLC, which unlocks four more party members and expands the third chapter with an entire new area
It is completely worth it, no matter what
Finally, a bit of warning:
Yes, the Steam version is the toned-down version
There's a wokaround that you can use, but fair warning- this does create some NSFW scenes in the story, and changes some of the outfits on characters
Take it as you will
All in all, I would play this again and again and again, unlike some full-price console games and the like
Go buy this game

Come for the dragon booty, stay for the feels
Alright, jokes aside
It's a visual novel
 You're not going to get much gameplay, but you should know that already
It's sort of a 'choose your own adventure' style book with some twists
 If you're fine with multiple playthroughs (the game gives you skip options) then it's definitely worth it
 If you're not, then it's not your kind of game, silly
Posted: 29 May
This game is
interesting
 The story is bizarre, the characters are quirky, and the premise of the story and the origin of this dragon society are just plain *zany*
 The story's tone frequently crosses the line between serious/somber and lighthearted silliness without care
However, once I got over the shock of how weird the premise is, I found this game to be a lot of fun
 This game knows how silly it is, and is filled with jokes and easter eggs that had me chuckling pretty often
 The individual characters are for the most part fun, unique, and well-written
 Most are likable at some level and have their own demons that give them depth and make them relatable
 I think this is where the game is at its strongest, and it makes the game worth it
Being an interactive visual novel, the player is given many choices in the story
 There are many endings
 Each of the five main characters has a good and bad ending
 There is also an additional bad, neutral, and true ending
 I would say the majority of choices impact either your relationship with a character or the main story in a substantial if only minor way
 It's nice to see the game reference an action you took far back in the story (or even an earlier playthrough; yes, the game has meta-narrative elements)
 As the game requires several playthroughs to achieve the true ending, it is fortunate that you can skip any scene
 You can also blaze through text you have already read, and the game will stop automatically if the dialog has changed from any prior playthrough
 You'll be using this feature a lot if you want all the endings
 You can save also save at any point, and the game offers plenty of save slots
Now the mystery elements
 Again, if you can suspend your disbelief and get over the bizarre premise (why is an alien ambassador who appeared mysteriously from another time only watched by a single unarmed bodyguard
), there is a fun little mystery to figure out here
 Figuring out how to achieve each character's good ending is compelling enough, but the true ending I think is where the game could have done a little better
 Instead of playing through the game several times to figure out a specific set of choices that will result in a good ending for everyone, you simply need to achieve each character's good endings in separate playthroughs
 From there, the true ending more is more or less automatic
 You basically run through the story as you normally might, and most of the bad stuff that can happen pretty much just prevents itself from happening
 When you get to the end you are simply given the option at the end to say "OK I want the true ending now" (to be fair, there is an explanation for this, albeit an outlandish one)
 You are then given some additional cutscenes and all is revealed
 Because of this, the game is less so about solving a mystery and more so about achievement hunting
Because of how the mystery is solved, I would say this game is a dating sim with mystery elements rather than the other way around
My only other complaint is the disparity in quality/style of art used throughout the game (as mentioned by many other reviews)
 Most of the backgrounds are professional-grade stills done in an anime style, and there are also some very nice looking stills of the characters that are shown in different scenes as well as the gallery (I really like these) outside of the story
 However, the character art for the dialog screens is done in a simple cartoony style that I find clashes with the rest of the game's art (Lorem for example always looks so out of place)
 It took me a bit to get over this
 Also, it's obvious that the backgrounds are stock and were not made with the game in mind in order to keep costs down and save time
 For example, I'm pretty sure most dragons in this world would not be able to sit in a restaurant booth (at all
) clearly desgined for humans
 I understand the game is targeted at a small niche and only costs only $10 at full price, but I feel this won't stop it from this problem bothering most players
In regards to music, there are some nice although generic ambient tracks in here
 I'll be checking out Crinkles' other work in the future
Overall I had a lot of fun with this game and am very happy with it
 It has its shortcomings, but it holds a special place in my heart as a unique experience that dared to be something so strange with strong passion behind it
 It's a silly dating sim in which you get to know some suspiciously human-like dragons from an alternate reality but with some mature and relatable themes
 If you are interested in a unique story-driven experience and have an affinity for cartoon dragons, I think you'll find something to enjoy here
 Otherwise, it's hard to know whether or not you'll enjoy this--it's too bizarre and incoherent thematically
Posted: 1 February
So, some pros and cons to this game:+ It's adorable+ Like really, wow
+ The story is believeable and wonderful to be a part of- Believeable up to a point+Character art when being introduced to them is generally fantastic- The transition between cutscene art and ingame art is jarring+ Ingame art represents emotions of individual dragons fantastically- Reza has a very punchable face+ Reza has a very punchable face+/- Music was not memorable, but fit with the needed scenes+ Each character felt real and unique, even the side characters you could meet+ This game will eat your heart and spit it out on the pavement- The heart is not designed for this kind of torture- What is wrong with you gamedev that's just cruel+ Game deals with certain subject manner in a way that would be weird if anyone mentioned it ever but no one does so itsokaytodothedowiththedarginOverall, 10/10, would go gay for large brown muscle dragon again and again

Product received for free
Like most people, I started playing Angels with Scaly Wings during a drunken blackout
 I apparently announced that I'd purchase and play the game if the people gave me a bunch of money
 Somehow, this descended into a full week of me streaming the game, inviting various people into a call to voice the characters, and generally making a community activity out of it
Despite me and 40 people spending seven hours a day streaming this game for a solid week, I still have no idea if it's actually good
 Like, it walks this sort of strange line between being legitimately good, so bad it's good, and legitimately bad
 The game is this bizarre checkerboard mix of good and bad execution which, to its credit, is much more than I expected from a dragon dating sim I was literally paid money to play
 However, in more than one instance it comes tantalizingly close to being extremely impressive, and that near-proximity frustrates me to no end
I think the biggest issue I have with this game the metagame - or more specifically, the amazing metagame it briefly looks like it has
 Like, relatively minor spoiler you learn after the first playthrough: the game involves a time travel loop
 There's this point around your third playthrough (or I guess "third loop") where it really feels like it's going to involve exploring the different paths, learning the effects of your actions, and discerning the perfect combination of moves to facilitate the best possible outcome
 One of the characters talks about this as though it is the goal, and there's even a relatively unique spin on it with the discovery that you can carry physical items but not complete memories back through time (something I thought was a glitch until I realized it was an intentional gameplay mechanic necessary to solve problems)
 The problem is, when you get a good ending, that character's problems get solved on all subsequent playthroughs
 What seems to be a game where you try everything in order to puzzle out the perfect combination of actions instead becomes a game where you do everything and then
 just sort of win, because you did everything at least once
 The end result is that you basically just end up ignoring a character after they've been "solved", and this choice really hurts the game's later parts
 Like, don't get me wrong, the individual character endings were written very well - and not just "well for a game", I mean regular well

Thought I was getting a cute game where I could date dragons
It is cute
 It has dragons to date, too
But nothing could have prepared me for the tidal wave of feels I'd get with each replay
10/10 would shower with a wyvern to hide my tears
Posted: 5 February
(The review is first, but quick details on why the game is friendly to different sexualities, lifestyles, identities, etc
 are in the comments, if you're interested
 I hit the character limit and couldn't fit them into this post)Someone bought a friend of mine this game as a gift to troll him, and after watching the trailer, we thought it was corny and might get a laugh out of him playing it on the big screen
 Having played several visual novels, already (mostly on console or handheld, I'm not big on PC), I somewhat knew what to expect and was curious about how this game would handle its premise
 I mostly expected it to be laughable, semi-pornographic bait, and was ready for it to be either amusingly bad or over-the-top in obviousness of how badly the creator would have been attracted to their own characters
 Instead, I was treated to a much more thoughtful and wordy experience than I could have expected
 Within an hour of him starting his game, I was already asking him to stop so I could go and play a copy I'd just bought, privately
 For the next few days, I was hooked, spending huge portions of my day playing it and finding myself deeply involved in both its story and characters
 I kind of ended up falling in love with the game, and it's arguably my favorite visual novel, at this point (provided you don't consider Shu Takumi games visual novels, just adjacent to them)
 Angels with Scaly Wings is a visual novel that is a tad more verbose, grounded, and dry than many of its peers, but I feel this ultimately works in the game's favor, in some ways
 I know it may sound ridiculous to call a game with a muscular Dragon wearing a police badge around his neck who you can engage in relations with "grounded," but I genuinely believe its characters to be far more founded in realistic, down-to-earth personalities than that of comparable games who typically lean toward ridiculous exaggerations of their personality types
 While most other VN's with dating sims element reduce their characters to their appropriate "type" (i
e
 tsundere, genki, nerdy), I feel like this one had a lot more depth and facets to its characters, should you be willing to sit through a lot of relatively ordinary conversation with them
 For many, I'm sure this means they'll complain about the characters being either too boring or too uninteresting (I'm sure some will call the characters by their stereotypes - alcoholic cop, clumsy introvert, etc
), but I feel this is because the game is more focused on fleshing out the characters through dialogue and companionship than it is defining them through larger-than-life events you'll experience, together
 Despite an overarching plot that contains a lot of intense drama, most of your time spent with the characters defines them through mundane experiences
 You're never offered particularly dramatic moments to prove yourself to them, and your relationships are strengthened almost exclusively through emotionally compatible dialogue
 For me, this is a wonderful change of pace and allows me to feel closer to the characters - it's almost as if they were people I knew
 For most people who play games to feel constantly empowered, I feel like this might leave them cold and having less empathy towards the characters because of the lack of forced drama allowing them easy opportunities to feel more superficial connection
 For example, another visual novel might allow you an opportunity to stand up to a bully to protect an introvert and use that as a point of bonding with them - in Angels with Scaly Wings, however, simple opportunities to quickly build character like that are largely absent and replaced with lots of talking about yourselves
 For everything you see in the world that doesn't initially make sense, you'll tend to get a (generally lengthy) explanation for it
 Dragons using human-looking furniture and buildings was rather ridiculous to me, at first, and something I was having trouble dismissing, even though it was likely just an excuse for environmental art to be easier
 It does end up being explained with well thought out reason, however, and so do most other indescrepencies and loose ends
 It tends to do so in casual dialogue with characters more than it does in huge exposition dumps, leading a lot of it to feel naturally explained to the player, rather than beaten over their head - of course, there are still some large exposition dumps
Like many visual novels, this one tends to work on a mechanic that revolves around restarting your experience with minor knowledge of previous events, and it uses this narrative device much the same way that other games that use this do
 If this is something that tires you, by now, I can't say that you're really going to be turned around on the concept
 I understand why they used it, however, and feel like it does ultimately end up adding to the story - but this is a personal feeling, and at the same time, I feel like it's almost impossible to use a device like this perfectly elegantly
 Subsequent playthroughs become more about dating, and lose a significant amount of the grip that the drama had their first time around, because you're skipping through what you've already seen
 The game is, at least, very good about its skip features
 I found the art done for the game to be perfectly adequate, and didn't find problems with the quality differences being jarring, as some others seem to have
 The dragons are cute, the detailed transitions in more serious moments are nice despite the obvious change in artists, and, overall, I felt it to be a largely pleasing game from a visual standpoint
 Full disclosure, here - I'm a furry, and though not really a particularly big fan of dragons, I do like them
 Whether or not you think this indicates a bias is up to you, but I've played through several visual novels I've enjoyed despite not liking the character designs (I nearly loathe the modern anime aesthetic, especially how it depicts women), and feel like I would have still greatly enjoyed this with worse art or human characters
 The music is also surprisingly good, and there's a shocking variety in the amount of tunes to keep things from ever getting stale
 Some compositions feel like they were banged in an hour or two while a few others feel as if they had more work put into them, but the sheer number tends to ensure that if you don't like a few songs, you're going to be rarely hearing them, anyway
 Many lower budget visual novels often suffer for trying to find someone to score their game and end up losing a lot in terms of mood, but there's a definitive victory scored here in terms of both quantity and quality
 Ultimately, I feel like you should pick the game up or give it a chance if gripping, somewhat slow-moving drama with surprisingly rounded characters is your type of thing
 Or, y'know, if dragons are your thing
 Cuz this game's sure as hell got dragons
 I honestly found myself growing significantly more fond of the concept of dragons over the course of playing the game, and felt like the overall tone of Angels with Scaly Wings was one of compassion and empathy
 More importantly, it's about such sensitive things without constantly beating it over your head, and it develops them slowly, subtly, and for me, ultimately more meaningfully
 While there are moments that player avatar compassion feel forced, and the game obviously leans toward you doing good, I feel like this doesn't diminish the work put towards those positive feelings being ultimately genuine and with more depth than its peers

This game reminds us all of one thing:Furries/Scalies dont deserve all the hate they get
*especially when they make you feel*
Posted: 31 January
Disclosure: I backed this game on Indiegogo
 One of the developers recently friended me on Steam, but I don't know them outside the context of bug reporting
On one hand, Angels with Scaly Wings is a slice of life comedy about hanging out with dragons in their suspiciously humanlike society doing things like getting drunk, playing video games, and going on a scavenger hunt for pizza coupons
 On the other hand, it's a mystery where you're trying to track down a serial killer and prevent the apocalypse, and even the good endings are somewhat bittersweet
 In some ways, though, that incongruity worked for me, creating an atmosphere where the serious parts weren't too heavy and I was willing to suspend my disbelief for the more handwavey sci-fi elements
The art's inconsistent, as well
 It's pretty common for character sprites and CGs to be drawn by different artists and even in a different style, but the decision to introduce characters with their CGs before showing their sprites makes the contrast rather jarring
 The amount of artwork is nice, including character sprites for even minor roles and bonus artwork that unlocks when you reach certain scenes and endings, but I wish there was also a gallery for the in-game CGs
Spoilers for story structure: the story is based on a time loop, where you must use the knowledge you gained from previous loops to affect events in this one
 Blurring the line between the protagonist's perspective and the player's metagame knowledge of characters and events is an effective way to justify unlockable choices and paths, so even though it might be an overused premise for visual novels, I like it and I don't care
There's more gameplay than the average VN, with lots of dialogue options in conversations, story choices, and a few random minigames
 You can skip read text with the tab key or use a menu option to jump past entire scenes you've already viewed, which makes replaying to find all the endings and secrets a lot less frustrating than it might have been
 As a fast reader, it took me a little over 10 hours to get all the endings and most of the achievements, and with the exception of one event (that stupid sphere in the park) I found it easy to see the way characters and events interacted across routes and figure out what to do without a guide
Unfortunately it looks like the demo is no longer available due to changes in the final version, so I'd suggest checking out some gameplay videos on YouTube
 If you like the characters, the feels you get will probably be enough to let you overlook the game's flaws
 If not, you'll probably just find it annoying

I thought that this was going to be a silly game with gender swapping, but I’m glad I was (partially) wrong
 Yes, there’s a lot of fan service, but honestly, Max’s Big Bust is a good visual novel
 You solve mysteries and you can romance one of the other characters (women and men), and the dialogue between the characters is pretty funny some times
 I liked the fact that the game makes fun of itself; not in a tiring way that at some point you get annoyed (at least in my opinion), but in a legitimately funny way
 Everything can happen here, the universe of this story is totally crazy together with its characters
There’s the animation too
 Some scenes were actually animated into a short anime, and I found that amazing
 Also, the “after credits” nearly made me choke of laughing, now I want to see a zombie version of Dancing Guy in another game
9/10, I highly recommend if you want a visual novel with more gameplay, and if you really want a "non sense comedy" to read and have fun

Early Access Review
It's like L
A
 Noire but made by weebs with a gender bender fetish
 Highly recommended
Posted: 24 June
It's a cute visual novel
 I use that term advisedly, because that's what it is
 It's not a game, per se
 It's a story with a set beginning and a largely concrete end
 There are puzzles, and objectives, but it's only a question of doing them well or doing them poorly
 You can't skip them
So, what's here that's worth your time
 The art is quite good
 I understand it may not be to everyone's tastes, but I enjoyed the artistic direction of the project
 The writing is excellent, though slightly slapdash at parts
 The animation, when there is animation, is top notch
 The characters are strong and well-defined, except when they aren't, which is usually for the sake of humor
 There is one gag towards the end that relies both on the static animation and the fact you probably haven't given a particular character much thought that I thought quickly redeemed whatever flaws there were here, so I'm certainly pleased
 It's a fast game, if you let it be
 You could easily get sucked into the writing and spend hours at each decision point, trying to obtain more of it
Now, a few words about the
 let's say content, might not go amiss here
 Yes, it involves a full-scale magical sex change
 Two, in fact
 The story, insofar as it takes a stance, could also be described as sex positive
 There's a great deal of sexual content and innuendo
 Outright nudity
 That I didn't see, though that's not to say it's not there
 You can tell at a glance
up therewhat the usual 'level' might be
Soundtrack is
 basic
 Very basic
 It seems to be largely stock music, and it was probably the weakest part of the game for me
 Since there's no speaking outside of the animated sequences, you could easily play with the speakers off and your own music on
 I'm not going to recommend that, but it's something you could do

Early Access Review
6 hours of gameplay so far and it's still in development
 Wow, I sure feel that I got what I paid for
So after running the game from beginning to the current end, I have to say that I am not disappointed at all
The plot (scroll down to my review below to avoid spoilers)The plot is apparently set in the near-future, where it's been popular with transformation-gas and half human-half animal surgeries and stuff
 The technology is quite similar to current, with taser-weapons as regular non-lethal weaponry, normal TVs, cars on wheels and trains still on tracks etc
 The gender-transformation is apparently still in its early days with a few biproducts (like lactose-intolerance being a biproduct of cat-ears)
 Our protagonist however, is a young police officer with about three years of experience
 He and his partner, Brad, are part of a department that deals with drugs and stuff and they are currently trying to deal with a new sort of drug called MinX
 During their first dispatch, our protagonist ends up having a "tiny" bit of an accident and ends up as a woman
 Now, for all of you that came here just for that par, I can promise you that he's not the only one that ends up having to deal with a female body
 *giggle*Now, here's my veiw on other features in the series:Music/soundI like the music and sound effects, but I miss being able to hear voices and possible have a on/off function of this
 What I think would be great is if one could choose between having the characters speak or not
 I like the game, but it's a shame when I have to read things 2-3 times because I can't seem to register what I read (this often happens when I'm feeling a bit tired, and that I do often)
 I also think this could help making the game differ more from other visual novels
AnimationThis part I feel should be separated in two parts: the animated scenes and the regular scenes
I have to say that I love the scene from the trailer
 However I have been playing for 6 hours and only at the current end did I get to enjoy a new, short animation that looked quite similar to the last one
 To be honest I feel a bit disappointed
 I would very much love to see action or comedy-packed scenes receive even just a short scene now and then
 Especially special scenes containing unique situations or characters
 It would give the game more interesting content that adds to the regular content
For the regular content I want to make one thing clear; NEVER use a picture of the character that doesn't fit in with the action
 It's important with variation to ensure that it doesn't look cheap and poorly made
 So if a character is bloody, it is bloody, and if a character got ther gender swapped and they have a belt to their pants, they won't try to hold them in place with one hand all the way to their boss's office and then all the way home
 Besides,
a womans waist is wider than a mans, and hence it doesn't add up that the protagonist lose his pants (and not the underwear
) when turned into a woman
 But enough of that pricky stuff
 Overall aside from these few things, the content is good-looking and most of the time it fits well into the situation
TextingI've found some, but very few errors to the texting
 So far I guess I have only found places where words are missing, so I just add them in my mind when reading the sentence a second time
 It would be nice to see these minor errors corrected, but it's not something that would need to be prioritized at this stage
 It may actually be a good thing, as the reader has to stop and read one more time to get the whole picture
 It creates a pause and a difference, and it certainly gets the reader's attention back a little
 As long as it's only happening 4-5 times in like 6 hours of content, it's not something to get all worked up about
interaction with the gameI simply love how one can affect the game with multiple choices and this should definitely have a continued focus throughout the development
 Even though it's a story-based game it should give the player the possibility to interact and affect the game, and even though I haven't really got to test this out much, I have to say that it's still a bit funny
 In my case I'm a justice-person so I have an issue with accusing the wrong suspect and stuff like that, in fear of getting both the hard-working protagonist and an innocent in trouble
 But I did get an opportunity to run away from a certain cute-girl loving maniac that eventually stunned/tazed the protagonist and dragged her to a swimsuit shop
 it was quite funny actually
And that's it for my review
 Personally I don't think I'm the right person to set a "grade" on stuff, but in my case I would say 8/10
 As the game is not finished yet, my estimate is only for the content so far, not for the finished product
Posted: 9 February
Even though it looks like it's just another boob VN, Max's Big Bust actually has a nice amount of content in its bosom
 There are a few parts where you actually get to do what can be loosely considered police work, talking to suspects and doing goofy Phoenix Wright-style hijinks to catch criminals, there's a poor imitation of a pet raising game on your phone, and there's even random trivia games placed everywhere they could fit one
 The story is pretty good, and the budget seems higher than most similar games, including having a few animated cutscenes (though it seems like they were animated by a Japanese studio, so the dialogue is in unsubtitled Japanese explained in-game by a joke, but the dialogue isn't that important in the scenes that have it) and subjectively good art - most of the art is pretty well-drawn, and the characters who have questionable poses or designs get mocked by the other characters pretty often so it feels more like the game is laughing with you
 One route of the game took me 15 hours to finish, and I doubt the other romance paths will take as long but that's still a pretty good length for an Australian VN to me
Posted: 26 July
I'm really wanted to recommend this game
 I really like some aspects of it
++ The music is really good, to the point that I actually left the game open to listen to it while doing other things
+ About the first third of the game was good
 The characters interacted well, the story was good, the jokes were alright (not personally my cup of tea, but fine), and the little investigation puzzles you did were a rather nifty
There were also things I personally liked, but I think some people would be mixed on
 +/- While I personally was not bothered with it, I can see some people really not liking the art in this game
 The backgrounds are perfectly fine, but those characters
 It's a generic animu style, complete with nonsensical proportions and bad shading
+/- The game also has some animations, which I find is another mixed point
 The also has that animu style, except now instead of being poorly shaded, it has wonky physics and for some reason has Japanese voice acting
 The Japanese is handwaved in game, but that doesn't make less odd
 While it is rather cool that the developer included these scenes, I would have been perfectly fine with them being left out
+/- Another mixed point in this game is the player's input within the story
 Your actions in the game don't change anything about the ending, they only change which character/s you end up with
 However, to make up for this, the game has several puzzles, each increasing in difficulty
 While I found the puzzles a nice tradeoff, I can see people really not liking the lack of player induced change
 Also, while almost all of the puzzles were good, I found the very last puzzle more tedious then challenging
There was even something that, while I personally didn't like it, I could see someone else liking it
-/+ The CGs in the game I did not like at all
 They, for me, crossed that line from being animu but fine to looking like DeviantArt trash
 Proportions were completely off, to the point that Max's spine looked broken in most of them
 Sometimes the characters in the CG looks little to nothing like the characters that are meant to be in them
 However, if you can look past those two things, then they are rather nicely detailed, colored, and shaded
However, there was one thing that made this game unbearable
 Around the point that Max's apartment flooded/burned or about 1/3 of the way through the game, the entire thing became completely unenjoyable
 I enjoyed this part the game so little that everything wrong with the game at that point was a major issue
- What happened to the humor
 It turned from a mix of deadpan, referential jokes with a mild hit of random/stupid humor to being entirely random and stupid with the occasional deadpan joke thrown in
 This got to the point where there is an entire sequence where the only thing going on and the only joke occurring is that Max thinks that a cardboard cutout is really a person
 Why did you do this
 I at least found the first part's humor harmless
 Now I just want to hit all of the characters (well, mainly Max)
- Also why is everyone sexing
 Max, Brad, and Ethen will no matter who you’re going for, as do Holly and Ember, and Victoria and obvious villain number 1
 I have no qualms with multiple relationships at once, no that's not the issue
 First off, if you go for Brad/Ethen, you have to have a scene with the both of them, and if you go for Holly/Ember/Victoria, you have to have the scene with Ethen and Brad
 So, I hope you wanted Max to get with Ethen and/or Brad
 Second, while Max/Brad/Ethen was hinted at, and Victoria's was hinted at, Holly/Ember is not, leading me to believe that their scene was added as fan service
 Thirdly, all of these events happen/ are repeatedly brought up at in the same sequence, which makes them all really off putting no matter what
- Because of the two points above, all of the characters are ruined, as they do basically nothing else
- The entire story is also frequently derailed due to this
- The ending contains a not really twist that I predicted
- The very ending contains a stupid joke they decided to make an animation for because
reasons
Due to the latter portion of the story, I cannot recommend this game
 The good parts are mostly ruined by the bad
 If you can get the game for ten dollars or less, then it might be worth it, but even that's a stretch

Max's Big Bust is a Life Sim/Visual Novel that begs to differ from others
 It is just so abundant of contents that compliment each other
 The game has well-written events, variety of unique and attractive characters, interactive puzzle and investigation sections, many different locations, diverse routes for relationship choices, and great humors
 The progression of the story and the dialogues feel smooth and natural, and the characters' reactions feel understandable and not overly exaggerated or cheesy
 I also love the variety of locations, background musics, and their transitions for different moods
 I must say it's also quiet immersive and interactive with the puzzles and the investigation minigames and different choices for building love relationships with interesting choice of partners in a universe of fantasy filled with interesting anime characters in terms of both appearance and personality and TG possibilities men like me would die for
 Not to mention that the game packs great Australian humor that anyone can enjoy
 I am certainly enjoying it

This is a game involving transformations, primarily focusing on guy to girl
Though animal ears and tails are pretty prevalent too
If you dont care for that kind of stuff you should probably just move on, because though there is more than that to this game it is the central theme
The main character is a Police Officer working in an elite unit tasked with taking down a new drug, MinX
Through a bit of stupidity, the character gets turned into a girl
This is a world were people can buy drugs to alter their appearance so it's not considered a big deal
You have the standard romance options with the people you work with
You also have some detective type puzzles to work through, which i rather enjoyed
Other than that there's alot of dialog to go through and it feels very well written
I rather got to enjoy the characters in the story
The game world itself is an extension of another game, "Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme"
As a result the game worlds lore actually has some depth to it, though its mostly only hinted at here
I'm not sure but i think this game picks up a year or two after the last one ended, and in a different city
You will see some return characters though
Simply put, this game is better than its predecessor
Or at least i think so, sure you don't get to jump around characters like before and see their different angles of the story
But, this game seems like it will ultimately be larger and already has more variety of actions, namely the detective style puzzles and i'm hoping they do more with the mini game on your phone
Regardless, if you liked the previous game get this
If you thought it was lacking a bit, get this
If you hated it, don't get this
And if you have no idea about the other game ask yourself two questions
Do i want to play a date sim style game
Can i tolerate transformations that include gender change
The only thing i didn't really care for was the serious lack of variation on the characters picture's
I'm hoping its nothing more than a mark of being early access
Admittedly it was funny when the characters made a comment about this in regards to a criminal but i'd rather have more variation than a sly 4th wall gag

Surprising, thought provoking, and puzzle solving are all played out through this fun title, and that is only the demo for right now
 Being a fan of visual novels, I can say that this has a lot of elements there that hook someone into enjoying it
 I enjoy the thought of the idea "What if
" throughout the whole process and making it come alive throughout this title is something to enjoy unlike in some other games that lead you into a false sense of choice
 Overall, great presentation so far with what is given in the demo, favorite part through the story is the fox girl cafe ^-^ and thats saying a lot because "sakura spirit" almost destroyed my love for fox girls in visual novels
 Overall rating: Its in the demo stages right now so I cannot give it a score for the time being
 I will give it a rating of "Enjoyable and want to see more to come
"

This is the best visual novel i've ever played EVER
The story is VERY good (even though its in development)The art is very good (cg,character sprites,ect)I've never played a visual novel with full motion video cut scenes fully animatedThe interaction is the best i've ever seen in my life(visual novel wise) you investigate crime scenes, you can actually play on your phone
 my virtual pet died :(One thing it lacks, but is made up for in the other feaures is that there is no voice acting, but this is not the first visual novel i've played without it
The action scenes are good
It also has a very good soundtrack serously make a DLC for that
This game is one trillion times better then sakura spirit (sakura spirit was the first visual novel i've played)I've payed CDN$28
04 it was -15% best 28 dollers and 4 damn cents i've spent (and also the most i've put into one game)
I Recommend this game for the visual novel fans out there or the people who want to check this genre out
BUY This damn game its worth EVERY SINGLE DAMN CENT
If I was to give this game a rating on a scale of 1 to 10I would say 9/10

 North Korea Best Korea
Posted: 31 May
went into Stay
 Stay
 with low expectations and had them exceeded
 I didn’t think it’d be much more than a cheap cash grab, but I enjoyed my time more than I thought I would
There’s still not a lot here as far as gameplay and content is concerned, but what’s there is pretty good
 It’s not the best visual novel of its type out there, but it’s definitely far from the worst
 The humor and surprisingly unsettling insight into True Best North Korea made this game much more intriguing and entertaining than I would have thought at a first glance
Altogether though, both girls are somewhat lacking in depth
 While more aspects are hinted at least a little bit in places, most of the time the game plays it completely straight with the characters
 You’ll largely know what they’re like within the first five minutes of the game just from cliches and tropes alone
 That doesn’t make them uninteresting, mind you, just somewhat predictable
Even with that said, the humor and cute interactions are generally entertaining enough to keep the game from being dull
 Couple that with the above sections regarding Korea itself, as well as some nice art, and you've really got something
 While I’m not about to take to forums and start declaring who I think is Best Girl, I did enjoy my time with both options
Amidst all the humor and romantic interludes, there was a genuine sense of unease that affected both the protagonist and the player
 It truly felt like you’d have to watch everything you said and did to avoid falling out of line -- and even if you did everything right, you were still very much unwelcome
That’s not what people are coming to play the game for, mind you… but the fact that these real situations were addressed in such a manner caught me completely off guard and is absolutely worth mentioning
 Couple this with frequently clever dialogue and humor, and the writing quality in Stay
 Stay
 proved quite impressive
I can’t really say I’d recommend it at its price point to anyone but an enthusiast, but should you find yourself considering it, know that there’s a fun experience to be had
My Verdict 6/10 A short, sweet, and funny visual novel that is much smarter than it looks but still far from brilliant

 you play as an American Marine capitalist pig-dog on leave from a tour of duty in Afghanistan Western imperialism and his first ever trip to North Korea Best Korea
 He is heading there to meet with some pen-pal friends in the People's Army expecting them to be men like him, but when he gets there he finds out they are actually two cute, young ladies loyal servants to Glorious Leader, Jeong and Eunji
 Not that he is complaining
 During his stay in North Korea the one True Korea, his female friends, acting like tour guides, accompany him to see various sights and cities of a totalitarian hell-hole with crushing poverty and human rights violations the greatest country on Earth
If you are reading this, then you probably already know that this is a parody/comedy game
 Specifically, it is a parody of the visual novel Go
 Go
 Nippon
 ~My First Trip to Japan~ (2011), one of the more well-known, though some might say infamous, visual novel offerings available on Steam
Having previously played and very much enjoyed DEVGRU-P's hilarious parody game Panzermadels: Tank Dating Simulator (2016), I looked forward to seeing what they would come up with in Stay
 Stay
 Democratic People's Republic of Korea
 Suffice it to say that I was not disappointed
 Everything that made Panzermadels a great parody game is improved upon in this release
To start off, the art in this game is very well done
 I initially went into this expecting sub-par art since it is a parody game, but my expectations were exceeded
 Indeed, everything from the character designs, backgrounds, and CGs are beautifully done as would be expected of any professional visual novel
 The music is also a nice treat as it adds to the experience of the game
However, the main reason anyone is going to be playing this game is for the writing and humor
 This is where the game truly excels
 From beginning to end, there is almost non-stop laughs at the various types of humor in the game
 Many points in the game lampoon Go
 Go
 Nippon
 and otaku-pandering from the contrived premise to fascination over minor things
 Perhaps one of my favorite jokes is the overly-elaborate description the protagonist offers of a "plain and ordinary" toilet, parodying a scene in Go
 Go
 Nippon
 where a character is amazed over a Japanese toilet
 But besides the direct parodies, there is also a lot of satire in the game of North Korean life such as the cult of personality surrounding the "Glorious Leader" and various other things North Korea has been involved in over the years
 There are also various self-referential jokes such as making fun of visual novels in general and some hilarious fourth-wall jokes
 Really, there is so much humor you really just have to play and experience it for yourself
Because this is a parody game, there is not really much of a story going on
 There is a twist that happens much later on and there is a bit of a plot near the end, but it does not really amount to much
 Overall, there are four separate endings you can achieve in this game depending on what choices you make during play
In my review of Panzermadels, one of my gripes was with the poor interface
 However, I was happy to see that DEVGRU-P really stepped up their game in this regard and really polished the interface
 You have the option to skip text that has already been read and more than enough save slots
In addition to the content available in the game, there is also an adult patch made available just recently, and I played the version with it
 It adds some nudity to a few scenes that previously had none
 It does not really add or subtract anything from the game unless you really enjoy seeing anime-style nudity
If there are any criticisms I have of this game, it would be that, despite the amount of laughs I got, some of the jokes did not always work
 For example, Eunji is written as a parody of the tsundere archetype character and this is referenced multiple times
 It was funny at first, but after a while it started feeling a little tired
 Still, this is a minor point that really did not affect my overall enjoyment of the game
In conclusion, this game is a hilarious parody
 Though it might be a bit unconventional considering the material being lampooned, it is nonetheless very humorous
 I would recommend this to those that might appreciate a parody of visual novels or a general satire of North Korea

As a person who actually went on a tour to North Korea I have to say this game protrays a lot of the elements of real NK accurately in a very humorous way
 A good galgame to lighten the mood
except that all the endings are kinda depressing
 Still, it won't have the same effect on the players if all the endings are like cheesy galgames
 That's what I think is the best of the game
 In the end, humor ends, and reality comes in
 also waiting for the adult package

Equal parts wit, satire, and adorableness compose this visual novel
 Having played Panzermadels through a whole run and this through a whole run, it's great to see that DEVGRU-P is focusing on creating more content and choices: while I didn't count the amount of choices, Steam did count the time spent on each playthrough
 Panzermadels clocked in at two and Stay
 Stay
 DPRK
 at six
 That's three times more content
I also feel more compelled to play the other routes now that I've completed one
 It gets very serious towards the end, even referencing that poor sap that tried to nab a propaganda poster
[www
nytimes
com] For reference (serious spoilers follow:) I got "Apathy Is Death", the "harem" ending that also ends with you renouncing your American citizenship and being stuck in the DPRK forever
 It is the darkest timeline
 Panzermadels, on the other hand, I felt would've had a lot of the same content in each route unless I stuck my barrel in crazy
Art and music have also received a substantial upgrade to "average"
 Hell, some of the backgrounds are even wallpaper-worthy, I'd say
 Considering they were working with less than the average price of a used car, I'd say they did a good job
Characters, save for one person you meet towards the end, are fairly predictable
 Not to say the story they tell isn't interesting, but as previous reviews have mentioned, your two choices are fairly archetypal
 So what type of story do they tell
 Surely you're curious how North Korea is portrayed in this piece of media
 Satire is heavily employed, but for those who can't interpret that, there's also plenty of reminders that this is indeed North Korea, and therefore not a good place to live or visit
 You aren't getting the wrong idea just because anime girls are on the screen and in uniform
 I figured out fairly early why I was there, but didn't fully piece it together until the end
 Despite its predictability, the going from tourist destination to tourist destination with the girls was fun
 Be sure to stop by the Pueblo for a great photo of our sailors giving their detainers the respect they deserve
Overall, I'm bad at numbers, so I'd just say it's a quirky game that made me laugh out loud at the lighthearted parts and yell at my own mistakes towards the end
 Out of ten
 Pick it up if the price of a nice lunch doesn't deter you, or wait for it to be the price of a McDonald's lunch
 And remember: post-launch sales are what fund the H-patch

Early Access Review
Take it from someone who's played this all the way through: do not buy this game, even as a joke
It violates almost every rule of storytelling and player agency that exists
For starters, the game itself is built on a shaky foundation
 For reasons that completely elude me, the dev chose to make a visual novel with the RPG Maker engine, something it's not very suited for
 The game itself is entirely uncompressed, making it a space hog, made even worse because a huge chunk of the game's resources are *default RPG Maker* files
 Being built in the RPG Maker engine, it also has other leftovers that bleed in through the, and I use this term loosely, gameplay
 The biggest issue is that the save function is busted
 That's right
 You can make dialogue go by pressing one of several buttons, but if you save your game with anything other than the Enter key, it doesn't record, even though it makes the noise
 You're not told this, and don't find out until you try to continue the game later
 I also found out that several other functions from the RPG Maker are mysteriously still in the game, such as the options to always dash even though you never go to any sort of overworld, and the fact that a stat menu can pop up between dialogue if you press a certain button
 This is also never used, since you never have any battles
 Since this is a visual novel, art is also an important part of the game's quality, and also another area in which it falls flat
 While the character art somewhat decent, it's hampered by the fact that almost every character only has two images: one when they greet you, and one that they use from then on out
 On top of being repetitive, it creates situations where a character's image is totally the opposite of how they're acting
 For example: there's a character that's always sticking his tongue out in a playful manner, and there's one instance where he's described as crying with that same image; the whole thing just comes off as weird
 Every character also uses this really odd pose for their “intro” picture, and it's very easy to notice
 Backgrounds are just images with a blur filter
 So after describing this game's technical problems and its art, we're left with what really makes up the meat of a visual novel: the writing
 It is very difficult to describe just how truly awful the writing is to somebody who hasn't played this game, but I will do my best
 First off, most if not all the characters have any kind of voice
 They all sound pretty much the same, save some terrible “gimmick” that would distinguish them, such as one character constantly asking you about his dead mother
 At several points, characters show opposite traits they're described in the game as having
 For example: one character being described as being “smart” and “well-spoken” when *in the same scene* he's obviously awkwardly weird and unable to solve basic math problems
 Everyone in the game is laughably incompetent at their jobs, even when the game tries to claim they're professionals, and the player character is just profoundly stupid
 There's also many, many instances where characters do things that make no sense, would normally get them arrested, or would instantly make everyone think they were crazy
 The writing itself is a slog to read, and spends paragraphs doing what could be said in a few sentences
Things that were explained half an hour ago are re-explained, and if you play this all the way through, there's one point where the *entire game* is recapped up to that point
 There are typos everywhere, wrong use of words, and wooden dialogue from start to finish
 Not only that, but the game switches scenes constantly, and this might be its biggest sin
 You're constantly shown what's going on in every fact of the game, even ones that are completely pointless
 But the worst is how you literally see characters discussing plot twists before they happen to you, completely taking out *any* kind of suspense Major/Minor hopes to give the player
 The game also, at several points, either retcons something that happened earlier, or just straight-up admits previous information was a lie
 And even though some things are over-explained, there's others that are either poorly explained or not at all
 And finally, there's the choices that Major/Minor advertises itself as being central to the narrative
 I can tell you, right now, that absolutely every one feels meaningless
 They never seem to have any kind of consequence beyond a text box in the top left corner telling you it was the right choice or not
 Not only that, but the game's written in such a way that makes it so many choices means the same thing happening either way, and the ones that aren't that only result in dialogue with a different person
 There's one exception to this, but because of the aforementioned poor writing, is a hard choice if only because you don't care what happens to either character
 There's music, but it's very forgettable
 Major/Minor is a terrible game from top to bottom
 Shoddy programming, bad use of art, bland music, and some really truly awful writing just puts the whole thing in a league of its own
 I haven't even mentioned that one of the most “important” characters in the game is the developer's own fursona, but I'll skip that since he seems to have a nasty habit of flagging negative reviews for being “abusive”
 Whatever score this game has at the time of this review, believe me, it is a lie
 Avoid Major/Minor at any cost
 It has no soul, no care, no signs that it's anything other than an ego stroke with a price of admission
Posted: 13 October, 2016
I powered throught he complete edition and the story is still a sophomoric mess that left me feeling like I wasted a major chunk of my time
 There's no real incentive to even replay it since unlike basically every other visual novel, this one is made in rpgmaker and the dev, Klace, decided that the usual conventions of a visual novel were unimportant and made trundling through his baffling display of making even what could be ~maybe okay~ plot elements plodding chores to get through
 I won't lie; like I said, there are some interesting things about it, but the ideas are openly aped from various other games, and the inability to do seemingly simple, expected Visual Novel amenities - skipping already read text to choices, saving anywhere, a wide variety of facial expressions for the characters - really hurt any drive to want to play this game ever again
 There ~are~ different portraits of most characters in the game, but only one other, sort of introductory portrait, and then you rarely if ever see it again in the game
 There is a rare example of one entire character having a different set of expressions and they honestly should have been taken out because it simply doesn't fit
There's a wide variety of reasons not to play this game, but I can't stop being fixated on how Klace chose to use RPGMaker's engine to make this instead of an engine made for visual novels
 The "Command Remember" artifact from rpgmaker default menu options will probably remain there for some time
 I believe before there was an "Always Run" option that was an artifact
 Did Klace remove the latter and not the former for some specific reason
 Who knows
 Not being able to rewind text to review conversations, another staple of most VNs, is upsetting and unfortunate
 Having ~save points~ designated combined with the fact that you speed through text you've already read to choices means that you'll sped a lot of time clicking textboxes or tapping enter and probably sighing and wondering if you really care about the game this much to go through this
Do not waste your money on this
 There are far better visual novels out there
 If you are a furry and find some appeal in this visual novel because of that, don't
 It's just not good
Go play Analogue - A Hate Story or Hate+, its sequel
 Or Digital: A Love Story
 Or hell, play Saya no Uta or one of the many Higurashi visual novels that are on steam
 They are all less of a headache than this

Early Access Review
Okay, so I don’t know why this is the “Definitive Edition” when it’s Early Access, nor why if it’s definitive you can still buy the non-definitive one, and anyone trying to get answers out of these developers is frankly barking up the wrong tree
 That’s a confusing thing that doesn’t make any sense to me, but that’s OK, that’s fine, it’s not something to get all catty about
 And I don’t want to just make jokes about furries here, because that’s cheap and doesn’t say anything about the game or the problems it has that are fundamentally there regardless the whole business of day-glo ferrets hobbling about the place
Posted: 19 May, 2016
Product received for free
I've had experiences with both the original and this new version of the game, writing this review on the release the game is still somewhat of a mess, the lines used in the screenshots and description are misleadingly selected and quite untrue upon experiencing the game
 So far the changes made seem to make the story even more of an all over the place mess and some of the backgrounds being used now are very unfitting and silly (First scene on the subway for example, giant chairs
)
This game does have a rather nice soundtrack, character art and it is not unenjoyable if you don't try to take it to seriously, if you are deadset on playing the game I would advise doing it with a group of friends, each reading a character as I have done this in the past and it made the game a whole lot more fun
 And I have to give credit to the developer for making this version of the game free to those who own the base game
To sum up, it's not really a good game, but it's not godawful either in my opinion
If you are walking into this game wanting an idea of what the furry fandom is or to learn about furry culture this game gives absolutely no experience of those topics, it is simply a story that takes place using fursonas belonging to members of the furry fandom
I don't want to start any drama, buy the game, don't buy the game, it's up to you, but to me it is still a rather bad game on it's own, and I wouldn't recommend buying it at this point in time, but who knows
 It's still in early access after all, and the developer really does seem to be listening to fans
 For better or for worse

Early Access Watcher Reviews Major / Minor - Definitive Edition (EA)Update Version: Initial EA releaseDisclosure: This game copy was bought by the reviewer
Disclaimer: As of right now there are two products on the market with this content, but no clear explanation for it
 The developer has stated on the discussion board he has a explanation for this and will have it posted in the near future
 Special Note Edit: I had stated in the previous version of this review that crashes were a concern
 On inspection it was a faulty download on either Steam's part or a faulty install to the drive on my end
 I let the game run and retested the parts the game crashed at and have not had an issue since
I will take the opportunity to use my introduction paragraph as a disclaimer for what I hope the reader to expect in the coming review
 I am no way affiliated with the anthropomorphic community nor do I understand the terminology used by them on a daily-basis
 I am not knowledgeable in the least about what a fursona is or the stereotypes used by them, but I do understand the usage of a stereotype and the tropes established by them
 This review will not focus on the insertion of the real people apparently using these characters in everyday life or of the scandal I researched that took place with the original release which I have not played
 All I plan to do with this review is determine from the bugs, cliches and story structure if it is a recommended product to pick up at the current interval at the current asking price
 That said, I will begin with the most important issue: artwork
Visual novels are usually known for their wide variety of artwork and character models, but in this case the art was left at the curve
 Backgrounds are slightly faded pictures of random locations while character models are stuck with one pose (two if you count switching the facing direction)
 The only person who had more than one pose was named Eclair, a cafe maid feline you meet along one of the branching paths
 This would have made it very difficult to follow dialog, but thankfully a character portrait is placed next to the text box to designate who was speaking
 The actual artwork was decent, but I will say some of the designs left me trying to figure out the gender of a certain character
 This is not a fault or a pro, it is just a little observation
 The music was rather pleasant, so I do commend the audio wizards for that
One factor I will consider a fault is the off the wall pacing and stereotypical characters
 The story was not hard to understand, thanks to very minimal spelling errors and grammar issues, but the structure was throwing out random monologues in one direction and character backstory in another
 You have the main conflict discussed, but some elements are introduced and fall of the face of the earth to never be discussed again
 It would not be an issue if the characters were not so stereotypically written
 Each character has a forced cliche approach, which feels stale and plain boring to read when the dialog comes from such sterile personalities
 I felt the urge to skip most of the character monologues on several occasions just for this reason alone
The branching paths determined by dialog selections does have an impact in certain situations
 Two of the choices very early in the game will allow you to meet a certain character while others will open additional character arcs for the reader to experience
 Thankfully, the game provides very ample opportunities to save, even if the amount of available save slots is restricted to 20 right now
 Actual outcomes are up for interpretation
 I played through the game three times to try and get an idea of how different the outcomes can be, only to discover the story follows the same general direction
 The people who die are still the same and the events that you are involved with are still the same
 Maybe it will change once the rest of the story is released, but for now it is really is just a cosmetic feature
As I mentioned in the opening paragraph, this is not a judge of the actual story of the elements surrounding the content (except for the stereotyping)
 Most of the problems stem from a disjointed flow
 It took me about 2 hours to get through the first playthrough and four hours total play time with all three playthroughs
 For the price, I would say it is a little light
 This will hopefully change down the line, but at this point I cannot recommend the product
 As per my policy, I will return to this visual novel sometime in the future to reevaluate it and hopefully change my initial opinion
Pros- Spelling and grammar is up to par- Soundtrack was decentCons- Stereotypical characters - Very erratic and out of tone pacing - 2 hours to get through a play through

"Early Access Definitive Edition"
Posted: 13 June
I decided to have a look into this visual novel as I got the chance to by family sharing
 I didn't really want to put 19€ into this and to be honest - After playing it through just once I'm reassured that it would have left me with a feeling of wasting my cash
 First half of the game makes you wish you had the chance just to skip entire scenes
 The story began to pick up towards the end but you feel larger amounts of confusion all the time as you're just pushed around as a pawn
 The decisions that you can make seem of minor to none scale most of the time and you can only evaluate their worth bei picking up "TEF" (true end flags) which are the ending that you're probably aiming for as "the good one"
 As many reviewers have said before me, there's an astonshing lack of features that the game was advertised with and the few bonus lines of dialogues for chosing to "please" NPCs in dialogue aren't really much but sequences of giving you facts about their backstory which, at no point, involves you actually interacting with them any more than talking
 (It's like they're really just explaining theirself more and how exactly they ended up in the plot
)Also - The choice of music really was off in the beginning of the game
 Didn't feel as bad later on but it sure feels like the dev
 actually began rolling this game out as they were still learning how to actually create the game they wanted
All in all not worth 19€ at all
 Why'd this even get considered for a award
 Lack of better entries
Posted: 23 April
This is by far one of the worst visual novel I ever played
 I don't know why has so many "positive" reviews when is clearly not a good one
 So let me explain why I think this
I start with a personal conffesion, I was browsing for any "furry videogames" and I found this game, I do enjoy some visual novel because I like simplicity some times, but I do also enjoy a good story wich this game does not have
 Then my first point:The Story:Jumps between "worlds", introduce many many characters with no explanations and most of the time you dont even interact with them, they are literally tons of dialoge on wich only the NPC's interact alone with other NPC's, being a visual novel you miss the point, because it's need to be you being involved in those situations and then make decisions to change the courses of events
My second point, the choices:You have barely about 20-20 "decisions" in all the whole game
 Again hundreds of text to read but less than nothing real interaction with the characters
My third point, the false advertising:In the same trailer of the game you can read "manipulate reality", "nurture friendship", "date" and "send/recieve text messages"
 None of then are in the game, if by nurture the friendship between 2 character you mean make 2 or 3 choices I can say that I would expect more than that
 You can't date the characters and also you cant send text message
 This is really disapointing becuase create expectations about the game and these features are clearly not present
Final words:I am consider myself a furry but also a gamer, I do want to support the furry comunity but I cant condone when is clearly a scam, poorly backgrounds and even mistakes in the character desing (Eclair have two left hands in some scenes), this it's not even a visual novel in my opinion
 One of the worst experiences that I have the mispleasure to play
Posted: 29 October, 2016
I can't
 I just can't
This game, there's no words to describe it
 It's bad, awful, a vile piece of work developed by one man who seems to have used an Engine ("RPG MAKER") for a Visual Novel and did not even program it correctly to act along the Visual Novel setting
From save game bugs to the most basic spelling errors that even a 2nd grader can spot - I just can't
If you're a furry, like me, who enjoys the art of writing and this game seems interesting to you I have to tell you one thing buddy
 Don't waste your money, save it, better yet give it to charity
Aside from my mindless rambling about how bad this game is I'd like to name this game the "No Mann Sky of Visual Furry Novels", a title it truly deserves
The Story:The plot is really bad, like really
 The 2016 Election would make for a better plot for a visual novel than this game; Your character is so lackluster - It feels like your playing a mindless zombie and it's worse than a telltale game, your choices don't really matter unless you want the ending which is defined as "good"
The game tries to reeeaaaallly push out "morality" in your face by giving you a bunch of moral questions throughout it, Are these moral questions good
 No, they can be answered by a kid with a capable mind
The characters are either boring, dull or plain stupid - I'd love to name names but I know the history of how reviews here get flagged, so I'll be good and abide by the Rules & Guidelines
Anyways, the story is set in some sort of hyper-dimensional time wish washy thingo mingo let's all go to bingo; It's extremely saddening to see
Throughout the story you'll be able to experience the Developer's inner mindset by seeing and noticing what books, video games or political thoughts he might have had throughout the making of this game - Which keep in mind just makes this game a bunch of other "things" combined up to this monstrosity
 The game is set up in Japan, but everyone speaks English and everything IS English (just a silly note)
If you're here for the "novelization" of an epic, choice-thrilling quest of adventure then you came to the wrong place buddy
The Visualization:Oh, the Art style is fine, it's terrific actually - the one bit I'll give the game a plus in
 But that's still like 1/10 lads
The characters don't have emotions, sometimes when they are supposedly sad they still use the "preset" face and look happy as heck, or dull - Which takes the emotional part of visual novels away, How is this a visual novel if their emotions are not visualized
Surprisingly the Developer and another character you meet in the game (Yes, the developer is IN the game) are the only two characters with multiple expressions
 Yep
The Sound:From what I can enquire the game uses preset soundtracks and even if it doesn't, It's still bad sound
 You'll need your own soundtrack to play through this mess, believe me
Programming & Code:The game runs on RPG Maker; An engine made for RPG games, not visual novels - I mean, it can be used for Visual Novels, it's not like it can't but still
 The Developer didn't even remove some parts of the Engine that still exist
 Pressing enter is the only way to save the game when you get a chance to do that and even then, Saving doesn't always work (so save multiple times)
It feels really boring when your game crashes, you can't save or when some sort of weird bug happens - It destroys the game, but the plot already did
Anything Else:There are SEVERAL characters missing from the game - Once more I can name them but I choose not to for the safety of my steam account lads; It seems that they were removed from the game by a personal dispute with the Developer
Most characters are those of backers who've donated a fair sum of money to the game and or are friends of the Developer - some of these people have reaaally weird stuff on the backend of things
Also, It appears no girls have backed this game as all the female's within this game are OC's and they are HEAVILY stereotyped females
 - Everyone in the game is either a masculine man, or a feminine boy, or a female stereotype
I feel sorry for anyone who has donated for this game, I feel sorry for the Developer who had to go through the trouble of making this mess and I feel sorry for anyone who has bought it
 I just do
In three short word's I'll describe this game to you "Bland, disappointing and sad" - It had potential, It had potential
 If only where the criticism of this game picked up by the Developer instead of pulling out a George Lucas on us all
If you're still thinking of buying this game after my review, or would like me to answer you some questions - Please, feel free to add me and take a moment of your time to think for yourself if you really want to buy this
 In the end of the day, it's YOUR investment
[Alongside this review will be published a video review in the upcoming months, so be prepared my fellow gamers and writers] 
Posted: 4 February, 2015
Nameless ~the one thing you must recall~ is the second game by indie developer Cheritz, widely known for their very popular otome dating sim, Dandelion ~wishes brought to you~
Unlike Dandelion, however, Nameless is a straight visual novel with very little game play outside of making decisions at key points in the story
There is a LOT of reading, so anyone expecting a similar experience to Dandelion may want to do a little more research before purchasing
For those who enjoy well crafted visual novels, this is just the title for you
Our story begins with the protagonist, 16 year-old Eri, living alone since her grandfather passed away nearly a year ago
Her parents have worked abroad her entire life, and even now at this critical time of loss, they leave her to manage alone save for the benevolent, although slightly oblivious, school principal who keeps casual watch over her as he resides in the same building
But life goes on
 until Eri wakes one morning to find her treasured ball-joint dolls, the only beings who have kept her company these many lonely months, have magically come to life
Now she must figure out how to work her new "family" into her daily life without drawing suspicion from those who know her best
At its heart, Nameless is a tale of loss and abandonment, but it's also one of hope and renewal
 And despite it's very romantic narrative, the underlying themes elevate it to something more than your standard "feel-filled" dating sim
 The premise may seem a bit odd, but it works, albeit slowly
The novel's greatest strength is in how every thread ties together the fabric of the overall story, but in a sense it is also its greatest weakness
It is only through reading and experiencing everything the novel has to offer, including the multitude of bad endings, that one can fully grasp the scope of the story and realize just how closely every event is intertwined and how damaged each character truly is
And it's only by reading the final hidden chapters that it's revealed how deeply our protagonist is scarred by the neglect she's dealt with her entire life
These revelations breathe new life and meaning into the characters and will have you examining the story long after you've closed it for the final time
 Unfortunately, some may lose interest well before those threads begin coming together, especially considering how slow the reveals prove to be
Despite the absurdity of the situation, by outward appearances this is a slice of life tale
As such, the narrative pace is slow but nuanced with details that build upon another painting a portrait of Eri and the world she lives in which is explored through each additional story route
 It takes well over half of the game to see the inklings of an overarching narrative, however, but patience is handsomely rewarded
Your second and third readings of the common route will reveal new dialogues with characters whose routes you've previously finished, further developing their personalities now that we understand them a bit better
And once you unlock the final two characters, things get quite a bit more interesting when darker undertones surface as you piece together just what has been going on all along
I found it incredibly intriguing how precarious the entire situation is, with tragedy often arising from the most innocent of decisions
 Make no mistake these darker aspects of the story will hook you like nothing else
Nameless is indeed much darker than it first appears
Themes of abuse, obsession and abandonment play prominently throughout the character routes and are most apparent in the numerous bad endings
Some scenes made me incredibly uncomfortable while others had me close to tears
There's also quite a bit of sexual innuendo and suggestive language as well as some mature situations
Although nothing explicit takes place on screen, I feel at times the narrative may be inappropriate for younger readers
For the romantics, there is no shortage of romance here
The story will play at your heart, twist it into knots, break it in two, and when the final confession of feelings plays out, race faster than it ever has as you wait with bated breath for that first lovely kiss between Eri and her chosen beau
By the time the credits roll, you'll have fallen in love with each of the boys along with her, even the ones you couldn't stand from the start
The presentation is phenomenal with artwork that is both detailed and emotive
Each character is creatively designed and drawn over beautiful backgrounds
Gorgeous CG's highlight important story points while
the pastel palette paints a soft picture of youth and innocence with sepia undertones lending a nostalgic lens to the scenery
Delicately crafted acoustic music selections complement the imagery with romantic, yet somber, melodies
Most themes have multiple versions that intensify at key moments enhancing the emotional resonance of the story to great effect
As one who normally turns voices off in these types of games, I found myself spellbound by the incredible performances
After turning them briefly on to get a feel for the quality, I couldn't bring myself to shut them off again
The actors do an incredible job of bringing each character to life with top notch performances that fit their personalities perfectly
Every piece of dialogue is Korean voiced including all minor characters, something that is altogether uncommon for non-Japanese visual novels
If I had to complain about one thing it would be the typos and awkward phrasings that are sprinkled throughout
Most are rather minor and do not disrupt the narrative flow much, if at all, but they can be a bit jarring when they pop up during important emotional scenes, briefly pulling you out of the experience
Odd phrasings (most likely due to sticking to the original Korean meanings a little too closely) can take a bit of getting used to as well, but everything is coherent and understandable, even if in a slightly roundabout way
And now the nitty gritty, the price
$33 is a hefty sum for any game, and considering Cheritz has never been known to offer a discount on their titles, you're unlikely to pick up it up for less than that
So then, is it truly worth it
In my opinion, having played at least a good 10-15 visual novels on Steam, and pretty much all of the otome available here (and elsewhere), you're not going to find better value for your dollar when it comes to the genre, at least not unless we start getting official Japanese localizations
Fast readers generally log around 30 hours to completion while slower ones may take upwards of 50, assuming they're letting the voice actors play out their dialogue
 Given the high quality of every aspect from the artwork to the voice acting and music, Cheritz probably could have asked for more and I would maintain it's still worth the price
There are some who feel that no matter how high the quality, visual novels should never ask as much due to the nature of the genre itself
In that case, perhaps this game isn't for you
 But for anyone else, do yourself a favor, save up that $30 and buy this gem
Every penny is worth it as long as you allow Nameless the time it needs to win you over
Bottom Line: Highly recommended for both otoge and visal novel fans as well as anyone who enjoys a complex and well-written narrative

My original review was too long it didn't fit, so I've cut parts
Considering that a) not many English translated otomes have been released (small target audience)b) many otome prices regularly spike up to $60 c) you’re in for at least 25-30 hours of gameplay & d) the effort put into this game by a small indie company as well as the efforts the company puts into listening to its fans & improving their products is amazing
the money spent on this is well worth the buy
 Dandelion will forever be in my heart, but Nameless was an incredibly fun & thoughtful journey
Unlike Dandelion, Nameless doesn't rely on interactive simulation stat-raising and instead is a traditional visual novel where the choices you make determine which ending you get
 The prologue is long, don't worry over not getting to the OP right away
 Most scenes appear in Eri's school, house, and the café Tei works at
 The recommended playing order is Lance>Yeonho>Yuri>Tei>Red
 Routes average 3-6 hours each
 Story/Characters
(THE MEAT
 THE TURKEY
 THE LETTUCE TO YOUR SALAD)What’d happen if your dolls suddenly became human & lived with you in everyday life
 I’m pretty sure they've done this already (coughLife-Sizecough) but now as a dating sim by Cheritz bounds are, things are going to be…interesting
 Each of the dolls can, for the most part, function normally due to their doll concepts (interesting thing, as someone who is picky about typical tropes/illogics I found that any appearing worked well for the game because the guys were actually limited dolls with unconditional love)
 However, two have come from previous owners & ALL of them, being dolls-recently-become-human, are VERY MENTALLY FRAGILE/INSECURE
 Every guy was fleshed out enough to be understandable and loveable
 They all developed very nicely & EACH surprised me despite first impressions
 I loved how character “opposites” ended up complementing each other in each other’s routes
The routes are also tied to a deeper plot
 It made playing them have meaning, which overall is a very smart thing, making the game end feel more complete & satisfying (well, it’s Cheritz, so
semi-satisfying & partly angry)
Ironically enough, in comparison, the actual human characters end up not being as human
 The bonus diaries help, but I would’ve liked a little bit more meat (heh) with some of the side characters, ex
 Shinbi
 The ones worse off hands down, however, is Eri’s –incredibly shallow- schoolmates-cough-sheep
 Oh my gosh
 I get why they appear like this, but WHY
 WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BE SO SUPERFICIALAnother of the issues I have is with some of the bad endings
 A few, though creepy, were unclear/unbelievable on how they might’ve unfolded
 They also kinda overdid it with one of the characters & led me into believing that he knew more than he did, & it was really unclear what he was trying to do with some of the things he did in his route
 The last problem is more of a nitpick, but is just questioning why the MC is many times described as “plain” when she’s friends with the 2 most beautiful girls in school
 I know it’s a thing regularly used but…gah
Although the cast is younger, the script is more
perverted
heh
GameplayPress CTRL to skip unread text, right-click to access menu
 It'd be nice to have a little picture of a keyboard & mouse on the options screen showing keys you can press to do things
 Would’ve LOVED to be able to go through text by pressing arrow buttons instead of clicking only
 Changing the screen to the minimized “window” version also made it difficult to access the quick save/load buttons at the bottom of the screen
A few minor spelling errors (the diary has a bit, also at some instances they mention a girl speaking when a male voice is used & I still can’t get over the phrase “He is my fist doll”), but these appear significantly less often than Dandelion’s
 Yay for improvement
 :DA few other things: - Texts on Eri’s phone that pop out on-screen during scenes have to be clicked again after in order to be recognized as being read
 - After some Bad End titles appear, & midway through the transition to the title screen, the bad end’s music plays again for a couple seconds
 - Some awkward white transitionsEDIT: Major issues have been fixed and I've removed them
 Still some small spelling errors but not so many that the ones left are more of a nitpick
 THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING QUICKLY <3Extra features included Eri's texts and diary being readable in-game, and in the Special section being able to read other character diaries as well, which was great and added some more depth
 Unfortunately there was no translation for the audio clips in the Bonus section, so I didn't look into this that much
The gameplay expects you to start a new game completely after finishing one route in order to grab a few more tidbits
 The problem with this setup, though, is that most people are tempted to just start over at a common route save file instead, because going through the entire thing again with not much new content is really t e d i o u sVisualsABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, this is what many people are raving about
 Lovely cell-shaded character designs, & soft hues of purples, reds, & greys
 The character animation is done very well – I notice a lot more movement while characters talk to one another & it’s not sudden or awkward at all
 A good variety of facial expressions & they blink, too
The rain & snow animation is excellent, maybe a little too good, because the feather animation looks a little too cartoon-y in comparison
 Backgrounds are nicely detailed
 CGs are well-drawn
 Personally I didn’t like the MC’s non-uniform outfits, but that is my own preference
 Other people might find them very nice
Opening & ending videos, for some reason, didn’t appear as high-def as the rest of the game
 They were nice but a little grainy
(also, there are VERY SUBTLE references to Dandelion, both in background, plot, & even once in casual script…”an orange, an apple, &…cat
”)SoundSoundtrackI am someone who is a huge fan of game OSTS
 This one did not disappoint, it's wonderful
 Being someone who’s listened to quite a few drama/video game/anime OSTs, however, I was hard-pressed to find one that really stood out to me
 Regardless I am still heavily considering buying the soundtrack
In contrast to the mellow OST, the opening & ending songs are pop-py & upbeat
 Like Dandelion's, the lyrics relate, something that I always look for
 There are 3 regular end songs shared among the dolls, & all the songs are sung by the dolls’ voice actors which was A REALLY NEAT IDEA
NOTE: The opening song is sung by Red’s & Tei’s voice actors
 They also sing their shared ending song
 Same goes for Yeonho & Lance, & Yuri's is with him &
the creepy doctor Yujin both…Voice ActingI became highly invested in Dandelion & its characters in large part due to its EXCELLENT voice acting, Nameless proves superb as well
 It is very WELL
 DONE
 DO NOT TURN OFF THE VOICE ACTING
 THIS IS THE THING THAT MAKES YOUR PURCHASE WORTH
 SO WORTH
 (I think one evilly laughing voice actor had way too much fun)I also liked how the MC’s name appears in the script, & therefore –seemingly- appears in the voice acting, although it’s not actually mentioned
 The one problem I have with the voice acting, however, is that the MC has none
 It also made it difficult sometimes to discern whether she was talking in her head or out loud
 I guess this is to get players to “become” the MC themselves, but emotional voice acting on their part actually helps me identify with them more because then I can get how they feel in a situation
 They feel more humane & realistic this way
Due to a cut review I am pointing out issues/opinions more, but aside from these, this game is great
 I cried a bit
Play it
 Enjoy the ride

WARNING: If you suffer from an intense fear of dolls, Nameless will justify every single one of your fears and manage to create many, many more
How to review a game without a name
 A game in which you read extensively rather than running around smacking things with a giant sword or building stuff out of blocks that definitely aren’t arranged in a way to suggest inappropriate aspects of human anatomy
 By saying IT’S TOTALLY AWESOME, that’s how
 You’d think I’d have far more sophisticated vocabulary after so many hours of visual novels, but no
Yes, Nameless (if that is, in fact, its real name) is a visual novel, and unlike its predecessor, Dandelion, there’s absolutely no stat-raising at all
 Some people weren’t fond of the excessive, sometimes tedious stat-raising in that game, but here there aren’t any stats to raise, part-time jobs to do, or gifts/power-ups to buy
 That may be a plus (if you’re like me) or a minus if you enjoy some sort of “real” gameplay in your visual novels (and/or are a masochist—kidding
)
 Still, I’d wholeheartedly recommend playing Dandelion before Nameless if you can afford both, not just because it’s also awesome but because there are some lovely references sprinkled throughout Nameless—but they each can be enjoyed completely separately
 There's a certain character you'll appreciate a LOT more if you've played Dandelion first, however
You might have noticed the distinct lack of giant…bosoms featured in the art on the store page for this game
 Yes, those are all guys, even if some of them are exceptionally pretty
 No, this is NOT boy’s love/yaoi/dudesquared or whatever the proper term is
 You play a lonely, secretly grieving high school girl, Eri (or whatever you choose to name her), who takes solace in her collection of ball-jointed dolls
 (Google "Crobidolls" if you want to gaze upon their beautifully creepy splendor
) Thankfully, Eri's not your typical crybaby doormat “n-no it’s embarrassing” otome protagonist
 Her “seriously unimpressed face” (you’ll know it when you see it—and you will see it often) alone has endeared her to me forever
 Though, like many otome game protagonists, she does seem to have issues identifying basic human emotions and physical responses sometimes
 Yes, why does one's heart beat faster when an especially hot guy is nearby
Those pretty boys in the pictures--Eri's ball-jointed dolls who ~somehow~ turn into hot human guys and end up living in a house with her (potential band name: Dolls II Men)--are her romantic interests, and they all have interesting and varied personalities
 The doll-guys aren't your usual one-note, wish-fulfilling otome game love interests, either, with some of them having serious psychological trauma that needs to be worked through in their specific routes--but they can all be extremely entertaining and heartwarming too
 If you’re familiar with Dandelion, you may already be prepared for them to make you laugh, cry, and possibly curl up under your desk until the pain goes away
What’s a visual novel without choices
 Probably something along the lines of a moving picture book
 Luckily, that’s not the case in Nameless
 To replace the stat-raising, dates, and stuff-buying of Dandelion, Nameless offers a lot of choices for the player to make
 Sometimes it’s not entirely clear which choice leads to which outcome, which is exacerbated by the absence of some sort of “love meter” common in similar games—like Dandelion
 I’d recommend Googling something along the lines of “nameless [doll dude’s name] walkthrough” if you want to make sure you’re on the right track the first time around
 Each character has a “happy” ending (relatively—the developer, Cheritz, is deliciously evil, as you will soon discover) as well as MULTIPLE bad endings
 Yes
 Multiple
 Bad
 Endings
 ENJOY
 They’re still worth seeing, however—the story and universe are fascinating and elaborate and it’s worth digging deeper, even if you have to spend a few hours crying under your desk afterward
 If you encountered Jisoo's "bad end" in Dandelion
you ain't seen nothin' yet
Others have mentioned the top-notch voice acting (in Korean), the gorgeous art and CGs, the lovely music, and the fleshed-out supporting cast of characters
 One of my main criticisms of Dandelion (and various other otome games) was that once you choose your guy and start down his path (which doesn’t begin until after you finish the prologue and a small number of “common route” chapters in Nameless for the first three available routes), everyone else sort of fades into the background or disappears entirely
 It’s just you and your man
 Okay, looking at these men, that may be nice, but still
 It's definitely not a problem in Nameless at all, since the story will keep the other guys and supporting cast around
 Other people live in this world too, and they’re worth getting to know
One last thing: please go easy on the super-enthusiastic reviews from people with very little playtime—as mentioned elsewhere, Nameless originally came out in November 2013 on Cheritz’s website, and is one of the VERY, VERY few (excuse me while I wipe away a tear) otome games made outside of English-speaking countries to have an English translation provided right off the bat
 It was released on Steam on Christmas Eve, 2014
 (A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE
) Otome fans tend to be very eager to support future possible releases (like the next game Cheritz is working on
) and are often overflowing with enthusiasm for their favorite games and game characters
Posted: 13 June
I love that this game has a larger story tying together all the routes
It creates a more satisfying sense of completion when you finish everything
 A story concept that seems cute and innocent is really much more than that
This game touches on themes of loneliness, abandonment, self worth, self hate, and acceptance
These topics resonate, and they create an experience that is sure to stay with the player long after the game is finished
I also recommend to play Lance, Yeonho, and Yuri before you play Tei’s route
Some things that occur in Yuri’s route are referenced in Tei’s route
My personal thought is to start with Yuri because his route has the least spoilers
Playing Lance and then Yeonho after Yuri creates a really nice linear story as well
Posted: 1 February, 2016
If you came looking for a light, sweet, casual otome game, you might be in for a big surprise
Nameless tells the story of Eri, a young female high schooler with a very lonely life
 Ever since she was little, her grandfather has been taking care of her because her parents are too busy with research and are often out of the country
 Eri's grandfather does his best to raise her but eventually, he passes away (about a year before the game starts)
 To combat her loneliness, Eri starts to collect ball-jointed-dolls of different types, talking to them as if they're really alive
 It helps her deal with the sad reality that she's lost her beloved grandfather and that her parents rarely have time for her
 But then one day
 Eri wakes up to five strange, bickering boys in her living room -- her dolls have suddenly come alive
Nameless deals with heavy themes, from abandonment and loneliness to obsession and identity
 Eri herself struggles with her lonely life, but her five now-human-dolls also struggle with their own existence -- some have to deal with issues left by their previous owners, others are unsure about their own self-worth and identity
 Through each doll's romance path, Eri helps her dolls deal with these issues
 There are also a few bad endings that are definitely 100% creepy, occasionally violent, and very dark
Pros+ A tremendous amount of character development for both Eri and the five guys+ A deep & profound psychological background for all characters+ Fully voiced with high quality voice acting+ Gorgeous art and CG+ A mysterious, dark overarching storyline+ The "game" is aware of how far you have progressed and changes accordingly+ Nice soundtrack with custom songs for every doll/guy+ Lots of save slots and a skip option (though you won't need it often)+ Two close female friends who play a role in every part of the game & are very supportive of Eri
Cons- A few grammar mistakes & typos, but not many- In order to finish the game, you will have to play through ALL the romance routes- Some of the CG pieces are a tiny bit awkward proportion-wise (especially Tei's)- More of an actual visual novel; lots & lots of reading with not too many choices- Some of the bad endings might be too disturbing for some (though nothing is explicitly shown)This is just a really, REALLY good game
 I'm all about character development and psychological backgrounds that actually make sense, and this game gave me all that
 I had a lot of feelings
 I cried a little
 I would recommend this 110% if you like visual novels and if the themes of this game appeal to you
 It's better than any visual novel + otome game I've played so far

Five dolls, Five butts to touch, Five times more tears shed
What's there not to like
Posted: 2 December, 2016
Product received for free
Nameless ~The one thing you must recall is that you’re going to cry a lot~Dandelion is a very special game
 But I must say, after playing Nameless, this one too became really important to me
 My grasp on the English language is very limited, I’m sorry, but I’ll try my best to express how much this visual novel means to me
This game will break your heart
 It will break you in pieces, make you cry, and make you wish that things could’ve been different
 But it will also make you smile, it will take all your broken pieces and put them together
 This is without a doubt, one of the best visual novels I’ve ever played
 The story is somewhat similar to Dandelion, but “darker” and most fitting to my personal taste
 There’s a lot of touchy subjects such as fear of being abandoned/replaced, physical/mental abuse, obsession, etc
 But nothing here is just thrown in the air, everything has an explanation, and you actually feel bad for the characters
 My favorite route was Tei’s
 My heart really ached for him, and I cried
 It’s been a long time since I’ve cried because of an otome visual novel, but his past is just too much to handle
 I loved all the characters, but Tei… I just want to hug him really tight and say he’s not broken or dirty
 He’s special
The “true ending” blew my f*cking mind
 I won’t spoil it, you’ll have to play the game
 But I can tell you this: prepare your tissues because you’re going to cry a lot
 Not in a bad way, I guess
 Cheritz is a really amazing developer team, their games have an unique style
 I’m looking forward to play more of Mystic Messenger too, and I wish they can make another PC visual novel soon
Yes, there are flaws in Nameless
 But f*ck it
 10/10, totally worth every cent and if I could, I’d buy everything again

Pros:- Delightfully twisted characters
 If you've played Dandelion these characters are definitely darker
 However they're not just like that as flavor
 Their problems and pasts, and the way it's affect them, flow very well with each of the characters
 They're all very distinct
- The MC's friends actually matter
 Her friends Soi and Shinbi actually have their own personalities and matter throughout the course of each route
 They plays active roles in helping the MC out, as well as receiving help
- Compelling story that gets progressively darker the further you get
- The Art
 The character designs, sprites, were all lovely
 The backgrounds were nice, but in general I don't pay too much attention to the background art
 (Unless it's Cinders, so pretty
 *_*)
- I'm in the camp of those that enjoyed the audio, especially the music when things were going wrong
 XDCons:- Typos/Grammar Issues
 Honestly my brain tends to auto-correct things to the point I don't always notice small grammar issues or typos when I'm not reading to edit and I'm incapable of editing whatever I'm reading, but I did spot some
 I never felt like it ruined the game for me though
 I've spotted typos in published books
 It happens
 It sounds like others have had bigger issues with this in the game than I did, but given the enjoyment I got out of this VN it feels like nitpicking
- Some of the CGs were admittedly pretty awkward, especially those belonging to Tei
The Price:I understand a lot of people look at the price and wonder WTF
 This is one of the higher quality games on the market with 20-40+ hours of gameplay depending on your reading speed
 I played this when Cheritz first released the game
 I don't know how many hours beating it the first time took, but second gameplays are always faster and it still took me 33
3 hours to complete
That's not just it though
 This game is fully voiced, has many CGs, audio, and has been translated
 For its cost you get a lot out of it
 Games like this run $60+ in Japan
 In America, high quality VNs tend to be around this cost
 Hakuoki: Memories of the Shinsengumi, Backstage Pass, Phoenix Wright
But it doesn't have trading cards or achievements
Does that matter
 You have a CG gallery, memory gallery, and diary entries all sitting there to collect
 Good achievements are one you get for hitting points in the story (Dragon Age: Origins does this) or actual gameplay achievements (like for less story oriented games)
 Collecting all the CGs, memories, and diary entries are achievements
 Yeah they're nice to have, but if the lack of them stops you from buying any game (unless you have already played the game) then you probably weren't very interested in the game to begin with
 Having them or not having them has zero impact on the game itself, and to treat the game like it's worse because it doesn't have them doesn't make sense
Finally, I want to address Voxit's review since it's one of the first reviews you'll come across
** Spoilers Beyond This Point **Voxit had a huge issue with the story
 Yes, if you're attentive and enjoy figuring endings out before they happen you'll be able to do so
 Does that make it any less touching
 It did for him
 It didn't for me
 Unlike him I don't believe the necessarly game runs on trying to surprise you, leaving you unimpressed if it doesn't
 If it did it doesn't make sense for the game to be litered with hints about what's going on
 The story tries to warn the player
 Honestly progressively understanding what's going on makes it as a whole creepier for me because I'm aware of how messed up the situation is
 So there's another side to consider
And then there's Voxit's main complaint
 I finished the game twice and I never found Red to be the 'true pairing'
 He states this but at no point in the English translation does it support this
 (I don't know Korean, and thus haven't played the original
) This is assumed
 Due to the personality of the characters and the situation, Red has to come last, but just because he's the game's last route doesn't mean she necessarily ended up with him
The ending is open ended
 Therefore if you like open endings, it's great
 If you don't you're going to have more of a problem with it
From what I got out of the game, I think the 'true ending' is actually when you meet the secret character
 What does this mean for her romantic life for those who read spoilers or already played the game
 Open ended
 Yes all the dolls end up in the same dimension and in love with the Heroine, but she never ultimately chooses one
 Therefore the other endings do matter
 It never denies the existence of any of the relationship, it awknowledges them all
 At the end of the game she regains the memories of all the timelines, therefore she'd most likely be in love with all of them
Maybe she started a harem and dated them all
 Maybe she ultimately did decide on one, or two
 Maybe she dated the secret character instead
Do I think the dolls would have fought for her
 Of course
 The dolls always fight with each other regardless, but do I really think that it's that much of an issue
 Nope
 We see endings where dolls share her between them even in their most messed up states
 At multiple times do they back down to let another doll pursue her, or even help the doll to this end
 To a point they respect the others, even in their fighting, and ultimately they want the MC to be happy
 It's even stated at the end by Tei that it required all of them to fill her heart, and they all understand and agree with this
 So no, I don't think, whichever ending you decide to go with, that it would have been a problem
I think it's of use to point out that the dolls are just that: dolls
 Her dolls
 It's shown that dolls pretty much love their owners unconditionally to the point of madness
 Even when they become human they're still connected to their doll bodies, shown by the fact that if something happens to the dolls the same thing happens to their human bodies
 As for how the Wizard continued to make new dimensions I have no idea
 Lawl
 That's a flaw I'll tip my hat to Voxit
 ** End of Spoilers **I'll leave off with my impression of the game
 Maybe the game is actually more about how the relationships between characters can change people for the better and help all invovled heal
 It's about obsession and scars, how they fester, and how they hurt
 It's about growing up and how people change in theat process
 It about the fight between the private and public self
 And it's about real friendships and the unconditional support they bring

 Ended up with more feels and psychological scarring
 11/10
Posted: 18 December, 2015
Pros: Seeing more of your favorite bird husbandosMore birds to meetWill still make you cry Cons: Less polished than the first gameChoices are either a game over or progression and unless you saved recently, you have to fast-forward for a LONG time I personally still really enjoyed it, even with some complaints
 I definitely believe you should play the first game first
I recommend it, but probably on a sale
Posted: 15 December, 2015
I loved this, but would not recommend unless you've played the first game, and know the material to some extent beforehand
 Though you don't really need to have done the BBL route to play this
 This has a really interesting format, in that playing different sections unlocks more sections and sort of mini-bonus stories
 But there's not as much choice as there was in the first game, and where you do have a choice
 picking the wrong one usually just results in a game over, rather than something interesting
 You'll usually get a bit of funny dialogue for your trouble though

Holiday Star: "
we must not miss the train
 We cross the glowing river
 We follow the obsidian map into the world of shadows
"For the ones who already played Hatoful Boyfriend, enjoyed it through its genuine absurdity and mind-wrecking revelation that takes place during the BBL route, Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star is the collection of some side stories hailing from an alternative universe where BBL route never took place
 The game serves to be both some ridiculous fan service and some fourth wall breaking story interaction
 For the ones who are yet to play the original game: drop this supplement and play Hatoful Boyfriend immediately to avoid spoilers
In the Holiday Star continuation, the shocking yet gruesome BBL route never occurred
 All students of St
 Pigeonations live happily and obliviously, approaching the end of yet another school year
 Here around this time, we observe a series of short side stories from our usual heroes' daily encounters that will enrich both character backgrounds and answer some questions unanswered in the original game
 Aside a handful of irrelevant comical situations Holiday Star also includes one genuine storyline which would foreshadow the events of BBL route and introduce unnerving new characters: The Day the Night Slept
 Even for that story alone, you are in for a treat everybirdie
Gameplay is not that different from the original
 You are Hiyoko Tosaka, the young human girl who attends St
 Pigeonations alongside her bird class mates and teachers who will witness casual - and not so casual - random ongoing in and about the school
 This time, gameplay is fairly straight forward with little to no choice options at all
 As I described before, Holiday Star is more of a supplement to the original rather than a stand-alone game
 It consists of 4 storylines, 6 short chapters and a fairly interesting radio program section where Ryouta will answer fan mails
It's cute and short - aside The Day the Night Sleeps storyline, which is heart and mind-wrecking as expected from any game coming from Hatoful universe
 I sincerely recommend the experience to the fans of the series, and the ones who'd still have some questions within their minds after completing BBL route

If you have played Hatoful Boyfriend and enjoyed it, this is a must for you
It has every bit of the same wit and charm as the original, and delves yet again into a surreal and tragic nightmare world that you would not initially expect was hiding beneath the veneer of silly, charming birds
If Bad Boy's Love ruined you before, this will ruin you yet once again
Be warned:
Once you fly towards the Holiday Star, there is no coming back from the emotional train ride that is waiting for you
I highly recommend purchasing the Collector's Edition
You'll receive the sound track, and though most of it is duplicated from the original Hatoful Boyfriend, there are a few new tracks in there
You'll also receive a high resolution picture library of 36 artwork from within the game, five wallpapers, the rather disturbing Holiday Star dossier, and the King's Storybook, which features a bonus story not included in the game proper
If you do purchase the Collector's Edition, be sure to play all the way through the game before viewing the bonus content as it may spoil some things
If you have never played Hatoful Boyfriend, be sure to play the original to its completion prior to playing this game
You'll need to in order to understand the events here

Another attempted cash grab by Winged Cloud, f*cking pathetic
 I see no end to this spread of cancer as long as weeaboos and idiots like myself keep buying these titles that are simply copy / paste
 They most likely have no intentions of improving their games, they rush these baztard babies out drooling as they think of the money they can make
Protip to the Developers: Move on to new things, not even the 10 year old weeaboos will buy this sh*t forever
 At least go out with some bit of dignity before everyone else finally realize that they've been buying the same game every time, before everyone jumps on the "hate" wagon and start demanding for actual quality
 You need to know when to back out, before this goes too far and you morons start releasing games for every season and for every holiday there is
I think that most rational people can see by now that these games are only giving a bad reputation for the Visual Novel Genre
 Go buy Clannad for fifty bucks, might be five times more expensive but it's also fifty times better than any Sakura game ever
I can only imagine what the future of Winged Cloud will look like:>Sakura Easter>Sakura 9/11>Sakura kill yurself >Sakura suicide school>Sakura pls buy our games>Sakura please let this series die alreadyI mean, we all love waifus, breasts and butts but, just please

I bought this game knowing it would probably be crap, but I at least expected at the very minimum, a cute, probably shallow and lacking any serious depth, but still a decent Christmas Story
This game blew my expectations, it was literally the most uninteresting thing I've ever read
There's a review on here explaining all the reasons why the Sakura series is just being burned into the ground and I whole heartedly agree
There's also no emoticons or wallpapers
And for those of you that continue to rate these crap Sakura titles with a thumbs up for the sole reason being you jerked off to this
You know what else you can jerk off to
Free internet porn
In summary:You have Google, you can look at the 6-some images right there, because this game has nothing else to it
Throw your money at Nekopara instead

This 8th title of the Sakura series from Winged Cloud feature a male protagonist Koji who is living alone in a small apartment after moving to a city to attend university
 With Christmas arriving in a week's time and no family member, friend or sibling to spend the holiday with, Koji decides to go out of his apartment to make an offering at a local shrine and wish for someone to spend the Christmas with
 Afterwards, he will meet a fox spirit Akina who lives around the shrine and has heard his wishes, his middle school friend Itsumi who was handing out fliers for a cafe she is currently working at and Santa Claus's daughter who also goes by the same name of Santa Claus where Koji will help to find and recover her lost candy cane magic wand
 Over the course of this visual novel, Koji can choose to visit the same or a different person each day before eventually spending Christmas Day with one or all of them
The story and plot is written like a romantic comedy with a share of humour and fanservice and has 4 nice happy endings, the background music by REN from the circle 'Bastat tail', artwork by Inma and Badriel and overall presentation are great
 Reading through the storyline and dialogue and unlocking all CGs at gallery will take less than 10 hours
 Highly recommended when at discount or bundle offer for fans of Winged Cloud who might be interested in collecting the titles in the Sakura series and the great artwork in the trading cards, badges, emoticons and profile artwork in this game and for those who are interested in showcasing a Christmas-themed background on Steam profile

boobs 10/10also download the restoration patch for more boobshttp://sunrider-vn
com/sunrider-academy-released/This will make the game 18+
Posted: 13 January, 2015
TL:DRPlay the main Sunrider series first then buy this game
Claim your waifu and show her your Vanguard Cannon
The Steam release is CENSORED but you can easily install the official restoration patch from the Sunrider website to view the girls in all their naked glory the way God intended
Now with the most important part out of the way, on to the other stuff
Made by the same developer that made the excellent Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius, Sunrider Academy takes those memorable characters and transplants them into a standard Japanese style school setting as a dating sim/time management/visual novel game
You play as Kayto Shields, Vice-President of the student council, and are tasked with making sure the three "trouble school clubs" are whipped into shape
At the same time, you must also manage your duties as a school student and keep up with homework, exams, and finding a girlfriend before the end of the year otherwise it's BAD END
First of all, you DO NOT need to play Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius first but I highly recommend you do because one, it's an excellent game, two, it will provide some nice background to the characters and setting, and three, it's FREEEEE
The cast of characters of Sunrider Academy carry the same personalities from the other games from the Sunrider franchise so if you're a fan, you can expect Asaga to be as bubbly as ever and Ava to have the same stern demeanor
Not every character returns however as the devs made it perfectly clear they didn't have the budget for more than 4 main heroines so this is sad news for fans of Claude, Icari, or Kryska
Fortunately, I did encounter brand new characters which I can already tell will be an integral part of the story
The gameplay should be familiar to veterans of dating sims or visual novels
You'll be reading a lot of text and making the occasional decision to branch out the story as per standard with these types of games
The bulk of the gameplay however, is in time management
Kayto has different stats and each one has an effect on the choices you make in-game
For example, having high intelligence will increase your exam scores while having high athleticism will reduce your chances of getting sick
You'll be raising your stats by participating in activities like studying or exercising and these can succeed or fail based on luck and game difficulty
Fortunately, if you don't like the RNG aspect of success/failure then you can lower the game's difficulty all the way down to "waifu-mode" to make it impossible to fail
As mentioned before, you are charged with propping up the three worst performing clubs (kendo, science, swimming) otherwise the club will be disbanded and it's BAD END
You can spend your time recruiting more members, overseeing team practice, or raising morale
Each will have an effect on their performance during competitions which is important for winning prestige
If you can manage to get your clubs up to speed and get lots of first place finishes then you'll win a ton of prestige which is important as this minimum requirement goes up every month
In addition to maintaining the clubs, you also have your own responsibilities as a student
You are assigned homework every week and there are exams every month
You must score above 60% each month otherwise you'll get a BAD END
And of course, the whole point of the game is to secure a girlfriend before the year is over
Flirt, buy gifts, and make the correct decisions to woo the maiden of your choice
It's all a delicate balancing act as you must juggle your time between raising your stats, managing the clubs, and dating the girls
The art is similar in style to the previous Sunrider games but vastly improved
I personally like it very much and the school uniforms actually make sense this time
It was weird seeing military officers wear school uniforms in Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius but now that they're in an actual school it doesn't look out of place
The music is as great as ever
The backing tracks fit the game nicely and when drama hits, you'll know right away because the music changes and really shifts the mood
If you're still not sure whether or not to spend the money on this game, then check out the free demo first
Also, do yourself a favor and play the excellent Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius while you're at it
RELEASE UPDATEI have completed all 4 arcs and, essentially, the entire game
So here are my final thoughts
Sola: Very interesting and original story but uninspired ending
Her ending is actually pretty happy but the way it was resolved just reeks of deus ex machina
Poor Sola
 at least she still kicks @$$ in the main Sunrider series
Chigara: My favorite girl from Sunrider comes with a great story and a great ending
Her arc has a nice blend of charm and sci-fi and is resolved quite well
You will get cavities because of how sweet her ending scene is
Asaga: "The Wild One" has a fun if fairly unoriginal story
At least it is resolved well and Asaga is by far the funniest girl to pursue
I genuinely laughed out a loud a bunch of times playing through her delightful arc
Ava: Wow, I expected her arc to be intense based on her personality and it doesn't disappoint
Definitely the most rewarding ending as the game makes you feel like you work your butt off to achieve it and it shows
Chigara may still be my number one but after playing through Ava's arc, I may have to reevaluate
Each arc takes about 3-5 hours to complete
There is no vast overarching story where you have to complete all the arcs before getting a "real ending"
Each arc stands on its own as its own individual story
Each girl, except for Ava, has 4 h-scenes
Ava only gets 3
Boo
I have two major gripes with the game
First is the writer's overzealous use of romanji
I understand this game caters to fans of anime and Japanese culture but every time I see "mou" instead of "geez" or "pan" instead of "bread" I roll my eyes
There is no need for this type of unnecessary pandering in a game that is 90% text
Second is the dull gameplay
 The game is half visual novel/half time management
The visual novel part is excellent
The time management
 not so much
It's like eating a wonderful steak but being force fed undercooked mashed potatoes in between each bite
Still, I greatly enjoyed my time with Sunrider Academy
Thirty bucks is a bit steep but I feel like my money was well spent
Should you buy it
I would say yes IF you can stomach the monotonous gameplay to get to the juicy story bits
Try before you buy

"Didn't read lol" ReviewLike playing Harvest Moon, but instead of crops and cattle, you're dealing with exams and club tournaments
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Real ReviewThe art is beautiful, the characters, background images, and the soundtracks too
Love the story
 A lot of funny dialogues, sometimes they linked to the original Sunrider game
 There are times when you feel a little sad, and there are also times when you want to facepalm yourself because of the characters behaviour
There are no voice for the characters
 I know there are visual novel games that have voices for their characters, and they are cheaper
It feels kinda boring if you look it from the stat management sim
 It's always the same routines
 Unless there are story dialogue, but it's not that much compared to the time when we need to manage our stats
As we know, steam does not allow sexual content, so the devs make an official content restoration patch to restore the deleted part of the steam version of the game
 In my opinion, even without the patch, this game is already unappropriate to be played by kids
 So don't hesitate to patch it if you buy the game
 You can find the link to the patch in the discussion page
If you only interested on the story, there are some tricks to make this game easier
 I know it's cheating, but if that makes you able to enjoy the game you bought then I think it's not a problem
 Check the community guide for more information
Overall, I enjoy playing this game, regardless of the negative sides this game gives us
 I know the price is quite high, but if you really want this game, don't hesitate to buy it
 If you patience enough, you can wait until the price drops
 Might need some times, though

First and foremost do not let the simple presentation fool you, Sunrider Academy is a wonderful combination of VN, dating sim, and resource management; but it's the excellent writing that makes this game shine
Both the artwork and music are neatly designed and fit the mood of the game well
 Fan service is mild, with romance and WTF moments being the main theme (not graphic sex)
 Each of the four girls you can date (and ultimately marry) have totally unique back stories that are a combination of: sweet, romantic, funny, and at times even dark and serious
 Likewise each girl's personality is unique, making each relationship route wonderful in its own way
 Even the good endings are totally different in overall personality
 Dialogue is text only, but again it is VERY well written; even better than many big budget console games
 Advice: save Asaga for last because while each good ending is a happy one, hers is (in my opinion) the most romantic/cheerful ending
Note: there are many funny inside jokes and easter eggs relating to Sunrider Mask of Arcadius
 Decision making is simple and occasionally funny, and will to some degree affect the girls' opinion of you
 And it ~is~ possible to have more than one path oppen up to you--although you must ultimately choose one
Design wonk: "Stress" attribute accumulates way too fast
 Player solution: turn difficulty to Casual or VN mode, otherwise Kayto will be working part-time jobs just to pay for eroges
 However, purchased buffs eventually solve this problem
Grade: Solid B+/A-I felt a range of emotions while playing Sunrider Academy: occasionally laughing and responding out loud (along with Kayto) to some of the situations/conversations
 This is one that you will feel a little sad that it has to end
 Very good game

The other reviews have already established the things that needed to be said 'yadda yadda play Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius, good game, free, etc etc
' So I won't repeat after them
 I'll be brief about the positive points of Academy: The writing is fun, the characters jolly, the art solid
 Also continued props for providing decensoring patches
Now I don't wanna be a negative ninny but I do feel like I gotta point out some of the negatives aspects of Academy
 The gameplay feels
 unsatisfactory for a dating sim
 Part of a dating sim's fun is raising those stats to reach certain requirements, to reach those "99 str required to win the tournament and conquer her athlete heart" goals
 Academy's stat building however, is purely based on randomness
 even to the point that you randomly lose stats during your many moments of sleep
 Just spend your hard earned credits on raising your luck by 4 points
 You can get unlucky and lose 7 points of luck right after, just by sleeping
 Wanna help Sola win the swimming tournament
 Well, you better pray for some good RNG because it sure as hell isn't going to be coming from your good decision making and planning
On top of that, the feedback you get from your stats is nonexistent
 What does 30 fitness mean
 Is that a lot
 On what scale do I compare this with
 What does the fitness stat even do
 I don't seem to be needing it for anything in particular, aside from a vague tutorial message, telling me that it somehow correlates with stress levels
 But stress suffers from the exact same lack of feedback
 What is too much stress
 20
 30
 50
 There doesn't seem to be a visible cap or any kind of information how bad my stress levels are
 Just a number
Furthermore, the chances of meeting a person, so you can talk to them, is again, based purely on randomness
 And I really feel like the game dropped the ball on the meetings outside of the scripted events
 The scripted events never fail to amuse, but the random chance meetings just have you click a conversation topic button, and the girl will respond negative or positive with a few generic sentences
 You don't get to know anything new about them or get any new interesting dialogue
 Not to mention that the girls are each supposedly interested in certain topics and less so in other ones
 But outside a few obvious ones (Sola liking to talk about religion since she works at a shrine, and Ava liking politics because you learn about this in a scripted event) the game doesn't really provide you with information about what's suppose to be a good conversation topic or not
 So all that is left to you is to trial&error (and if need be, save scum, because it's the only way to get even with the RNG) your way through
28 euro (or your regional equivalent) feels a bit too steep of a price for the rather shallow rng based gameplay that Academy provides
Posted: 3 January, 2016
Okay well to start off, i'm not giving this a bad review because I dislike the game
 It is simply because it is way too stretched out and too long
 Hah
 Get it
 Nvm
 anyways
I'll keep it simple and to the point
 This game is a great visual novel, and the concept of it is great
 This game expects you to make 4 playthroughs with all 4 girls and that's all fine and dandy
 However, after about few hours into the game after talking a lot, events happening, and lots of things to do, you find yourself clickig the exact same things for long period of time without anything actually happening
 That's my whole problem
 The game dies off after first few hours, and since you want to make at least one playthrough, you go long periods of drought without any events happening with the girls except your occasional club tournaments which become very repetative
 But what is more repetative is you doing the same exact things every single day
 Study, lunch, go for a walk, museum, arcade etc
 At first it's a lot to do, but after a while it becomes so repetative that you want to rip your hair out
This game could have been so much more amazing if it wouldn't be so stretched out with so much drought, or at least it was filled with so much things going on like the first few hours
 If that couldn't be done, shortening it would do it much good
 I also think that taking a route where you only have to do a playthrough with one girl is kinda boring
 That's just my take
Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read
 If you want a great visual knowel this is it, and the pictures
 well
 you'll be satisfied
 Be ready for the content drought though after first few hours though
 Happy Adventures
