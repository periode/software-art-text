strategy-Not the hardest but really pleasant difficulty [Normal]", "(Go hard if you would like more of a challenge) -Story rich (Can drag on a bit at the beginning but it's getting really epic and interesting once you are hooked)-It's quite linear but you have time to discover various places and towns (You have your freedoms) -No prior knowledge needed (Trails in the Sky or the other titles - Just light references) -Great and illustre characters and character development-Motivating to deepen the bonds (Similar to Persona) -Almost every character (NPCs included) has his/her own story -A lot to do (amsuing sidequests, minigames, discovering and collecting various stuff)-Average graphics in general-A lot of love put into details, characters and environment -Graphics are still way better

A chance encounter has the teenaged main character take \"Lucy\" from the junkyard, pitting her exuberance against his cynicism and ensuring comedy hijinks as well as drama and tragedy", " While his struggles to integrate Lucy into his daily life play out on one timeline, the story intersperses snippets from the android research laboratory about the man (referred to as \"Doctor\") who pours all of his energy into assembling Lucy and protecting her from government interference, leaving the reader to hypothesize early on about how Lucy ended up at the junkyard", "In terms of visual novel mechanics, Lucy packs few surprises", " The above average amount of choices packed into its three to five hour main story leads to many of them feeling a bit railroad-y, even though there are multiple endings to be conquered", " The visual presentation is crisp and polished, the backgrounds and CGs are of a high quality", " While there is nothing wrong with any one character sprite by itself, at times their visual styles are noticeably different, which can make scenes look incoherent (some more than others)", " The soundtrack is fitting but not particularly memorable", " Korean and Japanese voiceovers are provided", " The lack of multiplatform support (the VN is available for Windows only) is regrettable", " Something that is definitely worth pointing out is the absurd amount of post-game content and alternate endings that bumped my own reading time from just three hours all the way up to five \u2013 I am a quick reader though, and looking at the reviews, playtimes of anywhere between 7 to 10 hours seem within the norm", " The post-game content also provided the story with some much-needed rounding out, so you will most definitely want to keep reading after the credits roll for the first time", "Thematically the VN attempts to cover a lot of ground", " At face value there is the \"cute robot girl\" story, which would have been easy to turn into clich\u00e9d \"fated love\" schlock, but thankfully the story stays very light on the romance elements and delivers its tender budding affection so subtly that you could almost miss it", " Lucy's character itself is less immune to clich\u00e9s, seeing as she is rooted firmly in the \"clumsy, ditzy, caring but naive\" tradition of robot girls, and her characterization is at least consistent and believable even if it's not innovative", " Most of the situational humor falls in line with what you would expect from this part of anime culture, with Lucy being oblivious of her surroundings and the main character having to clean up behind her", "More interestingly, the story also makes a more than solid effort at tackling the philosophical questions that arise when robots become almost indistinguishable from humans", " For example, part of the story's tension is derived from the question of what grants one's identity if memories as well as body parts can be replicated and replaced as needed (the Ship of Theseus is even mentioned by name)", " As a narrative theme, the idea of artificially created humans has a long literary tradition", " VN aficionados will of course tend to notice the many parallels to planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~, both overt and more abstract, but in the broader cultural world the concept dates back at least to the story of Pygmalion and Galatea of Ancient Greece and the golem from Jewish folklore, and has had one of its major spotlight moments in the form of Shelley's Frankenstein, which Lucy's story also reflects in many ways", " Now, like then, the question is posed what it is that supposedly makes us humans more deserving of a self-determined life than the ones we create as our servants", " The VN is not shy about exploring these questions even at the expense of subverting its own characters (such as when the protagonist shows a", "knowledge of Schopenhauer uncharacteristic for a teenager who claims to have no interest in formal education)", "Another topic that Lucy tackles is the question of labor automation", " Androids capable of sophisticated reasoning are pushing humans out of the workforce because electricity is much cheaper than minimum wage", " In the world of the VN, this seems to be just as much of an open question still as it is in ours", " This topic manifests itself very clearly in the character of the protagonist's father, who I suspect is hostile to the point of belligerence towards androids because he identifies so deeply with his work and considers his role as a productive employee the central aspect of his own sense of purpose", "For all its interesting thematic points, there are also aspects of Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- that I had to grapple with, the biggest one being the general unlikability of the main character", " A lot of this can be explained away by his age and familial situation, but with as many external sources of tension as the story possesses, I wish they had relied less on the protagonist's egotism and carelessness as a source of drama, since it tends to strain the immersion", " In terms of minor nitpicks, I didn't care for how the screen showing Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics was used as a scene transition, since clicking through it every time quickly became tedious", "Overall, Lucy is a very well-written story that profits especially from the aforementioned post-game content", " Even though this review is, as always, as free of spoilers as I can manage, I absolutely cannot avoid highlighting the brilliance of the final reveal during the true ending that astonishingly weaves everything together and tempts the reader to start the story over again right away", " It's just one moment out of many, but I appreciate the careful construction of the story leading up to it immensely", "Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- stands on the shoulders of giants and it knows it", " Its themes have been explored in other works before and the VN has references

performing a rush attack just before a power attack)", " The differences aren't dramatic, but if you're attempting to play through the game at low levels of experience, they can be pretty important", " Positioning is also more tactical than ever, since enemies (and playable characters", ") take more damage, when attacked from the sides or back", "While this game is harder than its predecessors, most of the challenge is going to come from early on", " The first half of the game is spent with less than four party-members", " These limitations alongside a lack of primo grinding points make for

stigma that their structure is to the detriment of the player\u2019s ability to interact with the world, and if Pyre is to be commended on one thing it has mastered the illusion of structure by taking inspiration from oral storytelling to let the Readers have total influence by how they tell its epic adventure", "After playing games like Moon Hunters and Stories: Path of Destiny which failed to make a story from your choices, Pyre has managed to create one by taking into consideration all the player\u2019s failures and successes", " However, like these other games, the problems come in the form of a repetition of simplified gameplay, which does manage better than these other games by raising the stakes each time you begin a new cycle", " As much as I want to enjoy Pyre as much as I love Transistor, which is still my favorite by Supergiant, the imbalance amounts of gameplay with the narrative as well as the concessions made to accommodate this storyline ultimately weaken the experience, yet the moments that can be borne from the player\u2019s actions can be hauntingly memorable when it hits home", " Literal Fantasy Soccer Manager RPGOf all the games that come to mind for a comparison to Pyre in the gameplay inside and outside of combat are the Banner Saga games crossed with an ARPG styled Fantasy Soccer manager", " In-between each competition, the Rites, the Reader and his companions travel across story-book popup landscapes with various choose-your-adventure styled vignettes to apply status effects or debuffs as well as allow more character interactions between you and the rest of the characters", " These moments also allow you to train characters, buff your team or forage for supplies to upgrade your equipment", " When engaged in the Rites, they consist of three-on-three battles where the player can choose up to eight companions to mix-and-match their strengths into different scenarios when pitied against other teams with unique match-ups", " Each faction has their own story-arc and relevance to the team you foster, the Nightwings, as you all are competing for the freedom from a land of purgatory consisting of exiles, convicts and unwanted people from the world above", "As someone who enjoyed the previous games because of the variety of playstyles for the Kid in Bastion and for Red in Transistor, the focus on a \u201cRPG sports\u201d game based on team-play was something I did not initially enjoy", " This is why it\u2019s more appropriate to describe it like soccer with various one-on-one battles of offense and defense rather thinking it\u2019s all about dunking basketballs", " You can still play most of the game controlling one or two characters in every round; however, in the later challenges the coordination required to win ever increasing odds will tax players to come up with tactics between two or three characters", " Combined with the \u201cvisual-novel\u201d style of an RPG and the change in narration behind its story, and it\u2019s easy to understand why this game is so polarizing amongst fans", " If, however, you manage to see past its simplistic gameplay elements, which only becomes more difficult the farther you delve into the next tournaments of Rites, then you can begin to appreciate how far Supergiant has come in interweaving the story into a player-driven experience", "Whispers of Rites Told Among Charred AshesLike the name suggests, Pyre is involved with the ceremonious structure of honor to burn the remnants of people lost; however, instead of focusing on death it\u2019s about the path of redemption through adversity to burn away one\u2019s crimes and restore the individual\u2019s glory and rights", " When the Rites are performed, the narration that follows are like the whispers during a mourn spoken upon the charred ash of the purifying flames", "Beyond the poetical implications, this style of narration is used by being a narrative told through the victories and defeats you will create to shape the story not only amongst your companions but with every single NPC you come across that can be given freedom or denied it by you", " Even in the case that you suffer defeat, it\u2019s not the end; it\u2019s rather another moment for the game to create new conflicts and aspire for their resolutions", " The result of such an experience is that the story will be different with every player depending on the choices you make and the failures/victories you accrue", " This is a major shift from Supergiant\u2019s previous games which were entirely linear experiences with some choices made for areas (Bastion) or alternative challenges (Transistor)", " While choices are available in different manners and there are specialized challenges, they\u2019re in small numbers compared to the journey you undergo", " And instead of having one main character that wasn\u2019t the player, Pyre has the player assume the role of a (default: male) Reader that interacts with various major characters", " As you might expect from the title, you are going to have to read a lot due to the amount of characters and variables there are to accommodate with only the Voice as the announcer having audio", " Beyond its technical limitations, the lack of vocal narration is also used for themes of knowledge and freedom as you play one of the only literate characters", " Literacy amongst non-Scribes are against the law; every character grunts, makes noises, and possesses limitations of their abilities and knowledge until you help them become enlightened; characters have reasons behind their narrowed viewpoints that you can attempt to broaden; and the lore constantly questions powers of authority, knowledge and equality and the struggles they create", " Even in the Nightwing\u2019s ultimate Plan, the ultimate goal is to help others by using each races\u2019 abilities to foster growth of knowledge and of true freedom to the world beyond their own", " While the tone and consistency of this theme is weaker than their other titles, the narration behind its subtler moments truly shine when the player is given free-will to exercise these ideas through their own means", "Cats May Have Nine Lives; People Get Bored By OneThis all leads into what is perhaps the greatest issue of Pyre, and that is the story as well as the gameplay becomes repetitive because of how the game is designed", " In its structure, you will have to engage in a series of tournaments not once, not thrice, not five times but seven times to complete the game", " Each tournament becomes quicker than the last, but the extent of which this game repeats itself can become an issue to some who become tired of the gameplay after the first few runs", " While the game becomes more difficult because they add more challenges by having fewer companions to choose from as well as adding new ones, every following tournament becomes a series of battles with a moment before to prepare, and it\u2019s mainly the narrative that will keep you playing", " Encounters can sometimes break the rules with an added difficult spike as well as emphasizing the stat-management system behind the core gameplay as well as added penalties that force you to mix up the gameplay over time", " Pyre does all it can to sustain itself with added challenges and higher odds to overcome, but it will inevitably feel tiresome to players who enjoyed how focused Supergiant\u2019s previous games are as well as how formulaic the last six runs will feel outside of the variables you can influence", " To the game\u2019s credit, the final showdown was perhaps the hardest fight to overcome that the tension of failing could have impacted this fight was perhaps the best moment from the entire experience when I overcame the odds", " None of these complaints should mean I don\u2019t like Pyre; however, I realize that out of all their previous games it\u2019s perhaps the most bloated with extra content that impacts the pacing and the consistency of it", " Like skinning a cat, no matter how many ways there are to achieve the result it all begins to drag after the fifth life"], ["Posted: 2 September",

that day arrives", " As that adventure plays out, the group recieves new members and gets involved in all sorts of whacky shenanigans and hillarious conversations", " Every major character (of which I count 13) is very well-developed and has a large amount of screentime", " Characters that initially seem stereotypical or one-dimensional (such as the idiot friend Masato, the moe blob Kudryavka, and the hardass rules enforcer Kanata) end up revealing far more depth than first impressions would suggest, particularly when you get involved in their individual storylines", " Lastly, one of the big plus points is that regardless of what story path you pursue, the other main cast members remain part of the plot, rather than just disappearing as they tended to do in Clannad and many other VN's", "The storyline for Little Busters is large, with no less than nine different character storylines to play through", " There are a huge number of dialogue choices to make which can decide everything from what route you will pursue, what minor (potentially missable) scenes you will find, or what crazy battles you may end up getting involved with", " It actually gets a little complex, as you will need to play the original six storylines (Komari, Rin 1, Kurugaya, Haruka, Kudryavka, and Mio) before being able to dig into the heavy drama and soul-crushing heartbreak that follows (Rin 2 and Refrain)", " Even after that is done, you still have even more to look for, with the unlocking of the three \"extra\" routes (Saya, Sasami, Kanata) as well as alternate endings for ones you have finished already", " In other words", " this game is massively packed with content, with something in the order of 100+ hours of gameplay to be had", " There's probably plenty of stuff in this game I

released too, and patiently waiting until, finally, the day finally arrived", " At the present moment, I haven't played through the entirety of this release yet, but based on what I have seen so far

disappointing and inferior game to what we could and should be getting at this point", "I am not going to sugarcoat it even as a fan of the series", " Shuffle is old, and has a limited appeal to people, yet they are pulling these blundered moves lets examine things:1) The steam version being non-adult", "While this isn't a huge surprise, it is a little disappointing in an era where there are ways to provide adult content and not step on people's toes (taking examples of Nekopara, Huniepop, etc) where a one step disconnection from steam allows people to get their adult content and still sell an all ages product which allows neither market to be alienated", " It really is getting to a point where there is no acceptable excuse for this and either YumeHeaven or Navel is too lazy to look into these avenues, or does not want to give us the adult content, either one is not something I agree with", "2) Giving \"On the Stage\" instead of \"Essence+\"", "The first issue about adult content is annoying but like in the PS2 era from which On the Stage originated, they gave two new routes to compensate it", " Essence+ is a shuffle release that came later that also added adult content to said routes", " Lets once again not sugar coat things; Shuffle is a game that's 12 years old, Essence+ is 7 years old", " Its not a stretch to believe at the very least if they are going to deny people adult content, to atleast give us Essence+'s level of routes and options", " So why give us every single mediocre nickel and dime version in between", "These companies seem to live in a world where they think people do not research products and are unaware that stuff like Essence+ has existed for many years", " Which is frankly insulting if you think we're that stupid, it should have been the definitive release of shuffle cause its likely the only one steam might ever see", "3) Weird localization choices", "I am not going to go too heavy into this cause its barely a footnote for me,

called, the YumeHeaven scripts make some completely uneccessary and often bizzare changes", " While I can personally survive these changes, its perfectly logical to why some people are very upset", "

possible", " You wouldn't just be buying it for the H scenes, you would be buying it for the proper tension and drama", ":: Functional Issues ::One of the biggest problems with this game is it's

have black borders instead", " So, the resolution options do basically nothing unless you want to use it in windowed mode", " Which is good, but if that's the case, why can't we just stretch the game window to the size we want", " It's not like the border art is real proper art, it's just a texture laid out over the unused portions of the screen", "The one good thing I can say about this release is that it has controller support", " Definite kudos for that, every Visual Novel release should have controller support", " That one good thing does pretty much nothing to cover up the many, many

translation", " It's jarring", " There's no reason to be afraid of honorifics with a game like Shuffle", " The vast majority of the playerbase jumping into this title will know what all the honorifics mean", " Things like miso soup get mentiioned in the game without a proper explanation, so it's just baffling", " The problem is most exemplified in Kareha's route, where Tsubomi calls the main character \"Rin Onii-san\", but the game translates it as \"Handsome\"", " That's definitely wrong", " Even those of us completely unfamiliar with Japanese know that much", " \"Big Bro Rin\" doesn't sound natural in English at all, but it wouldn't be an issue to begin with if honorifics were used", " It's made even more confusing by the fact that at different points in the game both Kareha and Asa are referred to with \"-Senpai\"", " For future translations done by YumeHaven, I hope this will change", " Other than that, the translation is quite nice", " It likes to shy away from Japanese
