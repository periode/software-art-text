 I would however love it if the author of this program contacted me as I would love to speak to him/her about some other features moving forward since I come from a software development background myself
 You will find yourself falling in love with the characters, and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people, and who changes everyone for the better
THE PROS- Enchanting music that sings as you play- A simple yet fun art design that you can't help but fall in love with- Characters whom capture your heart- A shambled town that begins to thrive- Hidden secrets that you can't help but want to keep discovering- Amazing challenges that leave you wanting more- The awe of wandering through an amazingly formed game- Brilliant originality, which is incredibly difficult to find- A storyline that changes your perspective beautifully- Lots of fun, and I mean lots
 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game
 I still love this game
 If you loved Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley
 A single hack/n slash mechanic Citizens - I'd love to see more citizens (even temporary ones during the year) come and go to make the town feel more "alive"Overall, Stardew Valley is a pleasure
 Since it is early access there are a few things I hope can be improved before the game offically comes out, mainly the dialouge/ translation, its a bit off here and there, but overall the art is beautiful and I love the 'intimate' scenes
 It is especially useful to plant your friends' favourite food; they'll love you for that and will definitely return the favour via plorts
 I'm pretty sure both young and old will find a certain joy playing this game and I love it for that
 (Ofcourse, this list is totally personal, and I will still love this game if it keeps up development like this - whether there be different modes or not)
 This is great for my down time and I use my steam account for the entire household and allow younger kids to play it while I am babysitting, or I can just play it on the big TV screen and all the kids love it
I need to see if this game falls apart in the second half of the game, & I won't claim everyone will love it as much as I have so far, but this I think is going to be a top five Collectathon title for me
this game made me love the two most hated fonts in history
 It was designed with newcomers in mind, yet still retains everything veterans love about the franchise
(Go hard if you would like more of a challenge) -Story rich (Can drag on a bit at the beginning but it's getting really epic and interesting once you are hooked)-It's quite linear but you have time to discover various places and towns (You have your freedoms) -No prior knowledge needed (Trails in the Sky or the other titles - Just light references) -Great and illustre characters and character development-Motivating to deepen the bonds (Similar to Persona) -Almost every character (NPCs included) has his/her own story -A lot to do (amsuing sidequests, minigames, discovering and collecting various stuff)-Average graphics in general-A lot of love put into details, characters and environment -Graphics are still way better compared to PS3
there's something that i couldnt describe how unique and how much i love this game
 It's a sort of child-like trust towards an adult that's so innocent that you can't help but love Niko back
 We love pancakes
- I love this game, therefore this review is biased
 You can definitely tell that a lot of care and love was put into this game
 If you love Tower-Defense games, or a game that will give good entertainment or a good laugh, this is for you
 IÆd dare say this game made me actually fell in love with Muxin for the duration of the game, and several days after that, even right now as I type up this review
 Plus, I love Muxin and Muxin only, so the storylines that doesnÆt involve heràyeah
She appeared in front of me,like a godness,She made me know, what is the feeling when you fall in love with a girl
She made me know, if you love a girl,how happy will you feel when you see her smile
Put her hand in your hand,and say"I love you"
>notice the "learn about dogs" skill option>i love dogs in real life so i'm immediately sold>spend the next 30+ weeks doing absolutely nothing besides learning about dogs and playing alone with my toys>other leaders see me as "weak" and "unfit to rule">they demand that i step down from power>i refuse>a civil war breaks out>i quickly lose and wind up becoming a servant for the rest of my lifeeveryone's just upset since i know more about dogs than they do
 Something which caught my attention is that the UI or menu is very beautifully done I love the direction off the VN that it makes the menu and UI looks very realistic which contributes greatly to the overall atmosphere
From his experiences, we question values, what is love and what it is to love
HK -> dp" you'll find a lot to love here
You will fall in love with the playstyles of each and every one of these characters, from Filia, the girl with a fanged monster for hair, to Peacock, the living cartoon character, to Ms
I love it
This game is like real life because women are unsolvable puzzles and they love to laugh at me
 I absolutely love Clannad and cannot recommend it highly enough
 These plotlines are mostly love stories
 We're active and very friendly and love discussing all things Clannad (as well as other games, anime, etc
11th decepber 2016I Hope the English Patch will come out very soon :/ I love the Animations and the Music
 What I got was a short, amazing filled story that I immediately fell in love with
99 , you should get it, this game has already made me laugh, intrigued and fascinated by the story and all the things to discover, I may also be in love with this game
11/10 - would make mom love me again
 I also love the E-MOTES system in Nekopara
STEP 9: Try to rekindle a relationship with a past love interest IRL and fail miserablySTEP 10: Out of frustration, flirt with multiple girls who remind you of the original one
 this game is purrfect if you're looking for simple, fun, and adventure - and if you just so happen to have a love for cat things
That isnÆt to say I didnÆt love the combat in Cat Quest, I just wanted the last boss to actually be a challenge instead of dead in five seconds
 You eat it, you love it, itÆs bad for you chances are, but hey life is short and there is cats
 If you like metroidvania-type games and bullet hells, you will most likely love this game
 It's also pretty spectacular, and if you love the metroidvania/bullet hell genres, you owe it to yourself to buy this game
 I absolutely love this game as a whole mainly reason is that there is full freedom of exploration, you could easily spend your time not following the story and just hunting for hidden treasures or objects
Audio and Visual Elements and FeaturesThey are STUNNING I love the artwork of the CGs they are all extremely detailed
 Soundtracks, the soundtracks are really great they fit into the battle that is happening in your screen it just makes the whole game feel more immersive and ôcoolö like you are really part of the fight, I absolutely love the soundtracks
Definitely a BIG, Yes I definitely recommend you to pick it up if you are a fan off bullet hell and great soundtracks and love treasure hunting with RPG elements
 I also love RPGs, so you can see why I looked at Recettear and liked the look of it
Basically, what I'm getting at is that Recettear is an amazing game, I love it, and you probably will too
The game is a propaganda piece created by the US government to get you to love capitalism
 I've talked to all of them while playing, and some of them don't fully appreciate the artistic masterpiece which is Montaro, they do love it
 I love the soundtrack especially Gentle Jena, one of my favorite songs
 The music and soundtracks are possibly the most satisfying thing you will love about this VN, considering that it is over 10 years old
Amanita Design is one of those developers that I love to death, and in their case it's because all of their games are so unrelentingly joyful
Botanicula is definitely a well-designed game that was created with love and care
 if it doesn't turn out to be your kind of game - or you can only enjoy one gameplay - you will know someone who'll love it
The 1 bad thing about this game is that if you play this for countless hours, you will love the way the game looks and then when you go back too the rebirth series you feel a bit
 I love the new characters
 Seriously go and buy it, itæs really really good game i promise you will fall in love with this little cute gem :)
>Took too long, and best girl fell in love with my best friend
 How will you and your sister adjust to life in a different nation, will you be able to make friends or possibly find love and most importantly will your piloting skills position you and your GEAR at the top of the Cenorobotics program
 I really love it when these sounds are incorporated into the V
 I would love to learn more about GEARs and how they define people's lives
 I would love to keep following these characters and their relationships beyond the beginning stage (but that's a general gripe for too many VNs)
 Apparently in their next game, Crystalline, there is only one love interest for the main character that will be relatively complicated and fleshed-out
I'd love to share some character details, but any relevant information about identities or backgrounds would be downright spoilers
- Good story- Memorable Characters (nameless npcs are even memorable)- Good Characters (I love all characters, even nameless npcs)- Challenging but not impossible - Excelent Platforming + Puzzles- Funny and unique dialouge
So if you like Metroid/Castlevenia you will love this game
 If you're interested/new to the series, love horror/thriller genre or have watched the anime and still feel that it's lacking, pick this up and sate your horror/thriller need
 I'd have done the same for Watanagashi, but my love for Higurashi's quasi-sequel Umineko has flared up and stolen away my attention for the time being
 I love that about it, especially since I have two daughters who are just starting to get into playing "scary" games, and it was absolutely perfect for them
 For the love of video games
I will not get up and leaveThat's right, I'm not that goodI'm just a boring dudeDon't tell me you're obsessed I can't even wipe my @ssWithout Yuri following me aroundI will never come aroundI don't think I love youPlease, you do youBut I'm not the one for you
3: Any girl will fall in love with you if you poke them in the face repeatedly
 In doing so, all girls you've met will forget you existed and you must make them love you again, but they grow to love you even faster, proving this is the land of Sonic
7: Sitting still and doing nothing will still make girls love you, even if you completely ignore them
 All chicks love it when you play hard to get
-Nice Story-Nice System Fight-Nice Waifu-Nice Music5/5 Star For this game I love this game so much
 From the Shoes to the Teddy Bear to even the cross skull (god I love that one), it is a sickening thrill to send in an agent to see if they get killed
Other than that this is a great game, I love the concept and story behind it
I'm in love with the concept
Bought this because I have much love and mad respect for Game Grumps
 It's diverse and cute and I love the fact that you can make a trans dad (even if the CC is godawful compared to character art), BUT the fact that you can now tell that it absolutely was a cash grab destroys it all, and
 I do feel it's important to mention that i love how inclusive this game is, I just really hope the devs continue to add to it and hopefully address some issues
 I'm glad most people are in love with this, but it's just not worth $15 in my eyes
 It's like you guys are obviously just friends until the end of the third date where you suddenly kiss and love each other
Your character also has a personality that can't be changed, which I've found a bit distracting when it came to dating other dads, because I felt there was no chemistry between my character and his love interest even if I really liked the dad I was trying to romance just because my character spoke for me
 To have a characters entire story be 'I secretly like a sport that millions love worldwide' is not really the heartwrenching, romantic plot you expect from a dating sim
 The love I had for this cat, it was immeasurable
Sometimes I fall in love with a girl
I honestly love this game
 The characters deal with problems that are all-too-real and it's easy to love them despite their flaws
