If VR fails after GORN, VR will never succeed
Posted: 10 July
Early Access Review
Been playing this in closed BETA and would like to recommend this game
 GORN is bloody, so if you don't mind violence, get this game because:- The fighting mechanics are very polished and fun to play- There are many unlockables (weapons/champions)- To unlock them you need to do challenges, which are diverse- This combination will keep you entertained for hours even in early accessBe mindful though that you NEED space to play or you will hurt yourself or the things around you
Here's a mixed reality video I made of GORN in closed BETA which shows what you can do in the game:https://www

v=-IsIX4_mk3oCan't wait to see how this game will turn out in its final form
 Would be nice to get a bigger variety of arenas and maybe different people watching you too
 Would be awesome to be able to make your own character eventually, with cosmetics and a skills leveling

Early Access Review
had gorn for 2 days now and heres how those 2 days have gone:Day 1: Booted up the game excited for my first taste of a gladiator type vr experience
 Went through the first few waves of unarmed opponents with little trouble, even grabbing my opponents and ripping their heads from their still living bodies all to please the crowd of omnipotent floating heads around me quoting Gladiator the whole way through
 The night ended with my eyes burning from the profuse sweat i had started producing and I decide even the best gladiators need sleep so i proceeded to get some rest
Day2: After the intense combat of day 1 i felt like i had been hit by a train, but the arena called to me
 I started carving my way through the meat sacks once again, facing harder and harder rounds each time
 Instead of trying to please the crowd, i now have a deep seeded hatred for them and their "king" and i use that hatred and anger to fuel my berserk fighting rampages
 once again i have ended the night drenched in sweat and will likely be unable to move tomorrow
Overall this has to be one of the best vr games in existence
 I have never hated a floating head that doesnt speak/barely speaks as much as i have in this game but that anger just makes it that much better when i rip the head from their "champions" shoulders then throw the remains at them
 If you have any exercise equipment you wont need it anymore
 YOU WILL SWEAT and YOU WILL EXPERIENCE BLOODLUST

Go ahead and try to find something to criticize about this game
 Maybe graphics scalability
 Can you even be offended at that
 The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail
 Don't quote me on that one
 Most systems out there can run this game no problem
 If they are Windows systems
Maybe the friend requirement
 Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience
 The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people
 How many games are like that
Lack of voice chat feature
 The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue
Lack of netcode
 The design of the game makes this irrelevant
 You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game
Frustration
 You can pick up or close the game at any time
 Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health
 It's far less frustrating or "cheap" than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2
 Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort
 In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game
Brevity
 This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place
 Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2
9 * 10^11) variations
 It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation
Cost
 It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket
 I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference
Keep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game
 Even if you're never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example
 After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment
 Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15
 Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation
 If you said yes, it's time to buy
Posted: 9 October, 2015
-I get in a skype call with a friend
-Tell him I need help defusing a bomb
-Friend instantly says: "Lets go
"-We start solving through each module
-We got stuck on a maze
-Finished the maze
-10 seconds left until utter doom
-Randomly cut a red wire
-Bomb defused
-We feel like heros
-My inner Counter-Strike has been released
 10/10 But on a more serious note,
this game is a blast to play with a friend or two, and is quite an adrenaline rush

The Baron Reviews: https://www

v=0vL7q4LHwCwOn paper, this game sounds pretty dull; shoot a variety of guns at targets
 In reality it is one of the best VR experiences out there, and I think that can largely be attributed to the quality control and attention to detail put into the game by its dev
 I don't particularly love guns in real life and I find the idea of owning/shooting gun kind of intimidating, but this has really been enlightening for me as an educational tool
 The level of realism for each gun is so high, that after 20ish years of gaming where the majority of games involve guns and shooting of some kind, I was shocked to find that with an M-16 in my hands I had no clue how to actually fire it
 All the small things; loading the right clip, flicking the safety, racking the slide, fiddling with the sights and attachments
 I absolutely loved it as a learning experience
 Plus, the little things, like I didn't know that after loading and racking a pistol, removing the clip still leaves one bullet in the chamber that can be fired
 It was therefore surprising to me when I accidentally shot my virtual foot off, thinking the gun was safely unloaded
 To me, this is one of those things where even if you are the most liberal, anti-gun person in real life, it's a damn good thing to at least understand how they work from a safety/preparedness point of view
But it's not all educational and serious; In fact, for a game about realistic, lethal weapons, H3VR does an incredible job at not taking itself too seriously
 There's tons of fun to be had with all sorts of varying game modes, from straight up target shooting at a range, to swinging out of the ceiling whilst shooting in a jungle gym type arena, to the terrifyingly intense meat grinder mode
 As well as being able to spawn items to mess around with without limitation, there is also the ability to reset the environment back to its clean, original state
 The variety of guns is large and fantastic, with a huge amount of quality and care in each one
 With one exception, they are all true to their real life counterparts, but that one exception is a fictitious gun, the Cleric's pistol from the film Equilibrium (which was a total dream to get to shoot
)
 There are also some melee weapons to mess around with, as well as throwables and then some straight up silly items
Graphically, the game is so well done
 The guns and textures look amazing and some of the best I've seen in VR
 The audio too is absolutely top marks, with fantastic attention to detail being placed on little things from the crack of the different calibers to the plink of the bullet casings hitting the floor
 Gunfire also takes into consideration environmental reverb, so a rifle shot doesn't sound the same in the gunrange as it does outside
 All these small things do such a good job at making the experience feel realistic
The physics are excellent, with the ability to change how physics work from realistic to semi-realistic, or to not at all
 I love realistic because I love the "feel" of the guns when you toss them on a table, though tossing grenades with realistic physics is a little tricky
 I also absolutely love that the option is given to have no bullet casing cleanup, so you can see all the casings pile up on the floor
 Other than that, interacting with guns can at times be a little niggly, especially with the Touch controllers, but I mostly chalk that other up to just the nature of doing anything with the motion controllers, plus a recent update helped tremendously with Touch calibration
 Because of the mostly standing nature of the game, VR sickness was non-existent for me
 You can move around the areas with a teleport, which works perfectly fine
 I have no complaints about this game at all, but I do have two disappointments, of which sadly the debates on each have been soundly put to rest
 I would have liked to (or the option to) been able to see my hands in game for immersion
 However, due to the understandable technical difficulties in this task and potential bugginess it could cause, it isn't going to happen
 But even more than that I wish so much that H3VR had a Workshop on Steam where modders could create fictitious guns from sci-fi or movies (like the RoboCop gun, Blade Runner, etc, or maybe even crazy things like a Proton Pack
)
 However, due to the complexity of adding guns and their physics, the game wouldn't be able to support the architecture for modders, so it is a sound no on that
 The absence of these two thing are disappointing in the truest sense of the word, but in no way make the game any less incredible
Even though its Early Access, the current game is polished like a full release
 Updates have been consistent and substantial in content, with the dev being active on the forums and engaging with the community
 If you love guns, this is a must play game
 If you don't love guns, this is a must play game

Uh
 can you say "most addicting game on the Vive
"I bought this because of the great reviews
I figured I would play it for an hour and that would be it
I was wrong
This game is so incredibly simple but yet never seems repetative
 even if the waves are exactly the same every time
 it holds it's replay value insanely well
The different guns that you can select on the fly are so much fun and so situationally genious
The shield and tether-style melee weapon are amazing concepts (I never go without a shield
 ever)
 The best things about this game:1) Room scale allows you to dodge incoming fire2) Surround sound allows you to pick up on audio clues for incoming drones3) Controls are perfect and swapping guns is seemless4) Challenging because it seems to scale indefinitely
5) Real time leaderboards make for insane replayability6) This is THE game for parties
I swap in and out with my buddies as we compete for leaderboardsDo yourself a favor and buy a waterproof VRCover
 you will need it on this one

I bought this game before the major updates
 It clearly seemed top notch, albeit simple at the time
 The recent updates have given it enough polish to make it a 'always installed' app
 I don't expect them to make any more large changes to the game, but it is more or less complete
 I'm better at this game when I've recently imbibed brown party-liquor

Even at this early access stage, this is my favorite VR game yet
 Never have I felt total spacial awareness in a game before, to where I was able to defend the left side of my body with a shield without even having to look in that direction

 I can't recommend it enough

Space Pirate Trainer is a really cool VR arcade experience
 You chase high scores, and that is it
 It is regularly getting updates, and is definately fun in short bursts
 It makes me feel like Han Solo, which is enough in my book;)Essentially, you dual wield any combination of guns and shields, and fight waves of flying invaders
 Obviously, skill is involved, and you do get better as you learn little nuances and cues about your environment
Pros:+In a sea of VR shovelware, this is a fun arcade experience that I like showing to people+It doesn't try to be bigger than it is, but what it does - it does well+You will sweat and pantCons:-Once again, this is pure arcade fun, so don't come looking for RPG-esque upgrades or tons and tons of weaponsYeah, even though this was an early VR title, it continues to stand the test of time and hold its own

So far this has to be my most returned to VR game out of the 50+ ive purchased
The physics are spot on and the AI plays as well as you expect
(PLEASE dont nerf world class, I STRIVE to beat it
)
Its a little low on content but so is a normal ping pong table
If you enjoy ping pong, tennis, ect buy this
BTW Devs, just a thought but one of the things ive been doing to increase my enjoyment is to only allow myself to play through the ranks to world class
I start at amateur trying to progress to world class and if I lose I start back at amateur
I cant imagine it could be too hard to impliment something like this as a starter career mode or a playoff ladder
I would LOVE to see a torney mode where you progress to win the championship

Unlikely killer-app and true "eSports"Disclaimer:Played with Oculus Rift + Touch, 2-front-facing camera setupI like table tennis in RL
 If you don't, this game may not be for you
Before buying this game, I tried VR Sports Challenge from the Touch pre-order bonus
 This was fun for 1-2 hours, but never felt like real sports
 My expectation when buying Eleven Table Tennis: just another tech demo with unintuitive controls and assists that make every shot magically hit the target
 But, what a pleasant surprise: The controller is just a paddle
 The buttons have no function
 The only control is to swing your paddle against the ball
 There are no assists
 This is pure physics, the real thing
 To make such a direct, raw control scheme is brave because it requires perfect tracking and perfect physics
 And to my tremendous delight, both are spot-on
 The tracking shows how marvelous the Oculus Touch tracking works (judging from reports of other players, the Vive tracking works equally well)
 The physics can only be credited to the fantastic work of the developers
 Ball and paddle physics are nearly perfect
 All kind of spins work as expected
 If there are differences to the real world, they are subtle enough to only be noticed by very experienced players
As a sport, Table tennis is a perfect fit to the current generation VR headsets
 It requires little room and is played front-facing with minimal movement on the spot
 The paddle has comparable size and weight to the motion controller
 The ball is small and light enough to make the controller haptics feel realistic
 While the player moves his whole body, all movement culminates in the force applied to the paddle and therefore it is adequate to only track the hands
As a result,
this game skips the uncanny valley and goes directly to holodeck
 After finding the right settings (which is a bit troublesome, see below), the game feels just like playing real table tennis
 As someone who likes playing in real life, I can immediately use the play style I already know
 And I notice making the same errors
Single Player modeThe setting is a stylish apartment with the ping pong table in the middle
 In the left hand you see the Oculus Touch model, in the right hand the paddle
 You have no body or arms
 The opponent is shown the same way, plus a (somewhat scary) mask for the head that conveys which way he is looking
 Each game is basically one set (11 points)
 The basic rules are enforced by the game
In Singleplayer mode, you play against a surprisingly good and natural AI of several difficuly levels
 On the higher levels, the AI starts to apply spin and play faster balls
Additionally there are a few Practice Minigames
 For example, in one you must return balls to specific corridors
 This game mode as a lot of potential to turn it into a more useful training tool, but feels quite limited at the moment
Multi Player modeIn Multiplayer mode, you can play against a (Steam) friend or random player
A critical point here is the connection quality, especially the ping
 In most cases, this worked surprisingly well for me
 If the connection is good, there is no noticable difference to the Singleplayer mode
 If it is bad, the ball "jumps" a bit after the opponent hits, making it harder to react
 While the game does everything it can to smooth that out, above a certain lag threshold, the game becomes unplayable
Unfortunately, there is no ranking system yet
 Still, to be able to play table tennis against players from all over the world as if in the same room is magical and tremendously fun
 The game has voice chat activated by default
 Laughing together on funny balls or praising nice shots makes the experience even better (of course not all player use their microphone or speak the same language)
SettingsThe most important setting I had to change was the paddle position
 For Oculus Touch, the default position is unfortunately tilted
 I adjusted it so that when keeping my hand vertically the paddle is also vertically, like a continuation of my hand
 The Rift's nose gap is very useful here to AR-like see your own hand and the paddle at the same time
Also there are some settings related to the paddle
 I imagine it to be like the choice of the physical rubber properties of the paddle
 You can experminent and adjust those to your liking
Wish list for the developersThe raw gameplay is in place and extremly fun
 But I think there is a lot of potential to make this game even better
 If the developers are reading this, here are my top three wishes: Better Match making: Introduce rankings (visible or hidden)
 It is no fun for either side if the gap in play strength is big
 Also check the connection quality and do not match players if it is too bad
 Simplify the settings and provide better default values
 Oculus Touch paddle position is tilted, use the correct rotation as default
 Instead of sliders give some beginner friendly choices for paddles
 Hide the sliders in advanced settings
 Bring the game to Oculus Home to reach more Oculus players (Cross-play with Steam
)
ConclusionTable tennis is a uniquely suited sports for VR
 Eleven Table Tennis provides an incredibly realistic simulation of an olympic sports making it arguably the first true "eSports"
 The Multi Player mode on top of the raw, but near-perfect gameplay provides endless replayability

If you love ping-pong and don't have a ping-pong table but somehow purchased a thousand dollar VR device, this is the game that will satisfy your needs
Posted: 19 June
When folks come over my house and they want to play a VR game, this is the one I load up
Actually, first I load up Vesper Peak, guide them to an edge, sneak up behind them and then PUSH THEM
Once they recover I load this one up
There's something very real about swinging that paddle and hitting a ball that gives you a connection to this game like none other
The perfection around the physics and the polish is very obvious, the fine tuning gives an amazingly real experience
It's a little tough to find multiplayer opponents sometimes, but that doesn't take anything away from the game

I must say, i love this game
 My suggestions to modernize the game: - Multiplayer (The better the ranking system, the more time people will put into it)
- Many different variations on rackets/tables
- Different Locations, maybe even custom locations
- Better ball physics (I believe that this came in the update yesterday) - Spawn ball with upper menu button or touchpad - Training area - MP3 player in game + folder where you can put your music - TV Screen with custom video capability - Body with arms (Could turn out really cool) - Different grip modes (How you hold the controller)Although, i'm really suprised by how good the game is now
 Please keep the updates and new features coming

Last year, I had to choose between the Vive and a Ping Pong table
I chose the Vive
It's the smart decision
And now, it only cost me five dollars to learn that I'm the worst ping pong player on the face of the earth, the solar system, our local star cluster, the Alpha Quadrant, and the galaxy at large
10/10 would suffer soul crushing defeat to the Amateur AI again
Seriously though, it's the most accurate portrayal of ping pong I know of because my scores accurately reflect my skill
Often 11 - Nil
Worked up a sweat, contemplated suicide, and had an overall great time
Don't like the minigames though
The wooden rabbit mask of the AI is enough to give me nightmares, thank you very much

Playable
 The physics take a little getting used to, but I think they are about as good as the best VR games I've played (Pool Nation and Pier Arcade)
 I would agree with anyone that says ping pong physics are a real tough nut to crack
 The resolution is a bit low--I hope the developer gives us a setting to increase resolution scale or whatever
 The music is something you'll probably want to turn off (developers let us play our own mp3's, okay
)
 I say buy it, the price is about right
Update: Wow just a few weeks later and Pong Waves VR has gone from good to great and now one of my favorite games
 Totally playable and I have played many games of PR (Physical Reality) ping pong
 The two handed serve update is great, AI is better
 Physics are predictable and work well as to not get in the way of being immersive
 I think that Pong Waves VR qualifies as a competent simulation in addition to a great and fun game
 Really this game is a steal at the current price and I highly recommend you purchase now

Great physics, feels like I'm actually playing table tennis
Nice AI options for difficulty and it looks like different environments are on the way
 There are some mini games but the meat of the experience is the regular games, which are great
You can feel that little oomf on the touch controller / paddle when you hit the ball, put spin on it 
all that fun stuff
The AI is pretty good so I havnt bothered to try multiplayer yet
I bought at full price and it's worth it completely
If you play on extreme settings prepare to sweat and watch out you don't smash your controllers into something

This game is a very mediocre shooter in its design
- It's extremely linear
 I don't know if I've ever played a more linear game
 With the exception of going down and back out some corridors, it's basically just one big twisty line from beginning to end, and you feel very funneled
 It doesn't even present you with the illusion that you're deciding which way to go
 There's even a point in the plot where the character is complaining about not knowing where he is or where he's going, implying he's just wandering
 But while your character is being supposedly aimless, you continue to follow the one, singular, only path and funnel conveniently directly where you need to go to advance the plot
 And speaking of which--- The plot is very thin, very predictable
 There are no surprises at all
- It doesn't reward exploration
 Correct me if I'm wrong, but if there is any point in the entire game where you can slip off the beaten path, you should never take it
 There's never anything interesting there
- All the enemies are super samey
 There are fast zombies, and slow zombies, and that's it
 The zombies also never do anything particularly clever
 Even in Left 4 Dead, they had behavior which was interesting (leaping over obsticles in interesting ways, smashing through doors) but this game doesn't have any of that
 Once you get the strategy for how to take them down you're pretty much covered and you're not going to squeeze much more entertainment out of the combat
- It's short
 I got through it in about five hours and I'm a slow player
- The cave section is too dark
 The point of having a VR headset is to have a lot of paripheral vision and to feel surrounded, but when you have to play without the ability to see anything except for a super thin beam from a flashlight, you might as well be playing with a mouse and keyboard because you experience the same tunnel vision
And despite all of that, the game is great and you should play it, because VR
 I'm being serious
 The immersion is great, the environments are decent enough to enjoy moving around in them, and they genuinely cared about making the controls comfortable in VR
History won't look kindly on this game
 It won't age well at all
 But if your goal is to play a game which is a full experience, which is not just a clumsy port of a non-VR game, then this is one of your very few options
 I'm excited to see how many of these game elements will persist as VR game design matures, and how many will disappear forever, much like the early-generation idiosynchricies of the past, like Mario 64's camera controls or pressing B to jump or using the keyboard to look around in a shooter
To sum it up, if you're a VR enthusiast, buy this game
Posted: 23 June
Pros:-Large variety of guns-Story campaign (took me 3
6 hrs to beat the campaign)-Me and my wife(who just watched) enjoyed to narration of the campaign-Guns shoot accurately, if you line up the sights you'll get a headshot almost everytime
-Variety of scenery in the game, 3-4 very different areas: desert, cave, industrial, desert towns-Shooting tons of zombies in the faceCons:-Glitchy lights at times-Poppy textures/scenery at times-Constanly getting stuck on stuff when using trackpad locomotion-Short campaign
 3
5 hours on normal difficulty-Lots of things you want to pickup but cantOverall:I have not tried horde mode yet, but the campaign alone is worth at least $20
 I still have some time to put into this title with multiplayer
 I paid $32 and that price seems fair to me

Most of the negative reviews for this game have been over the i7 wall, which has since been removed
 If you're still giving them a negative review for this, because of some misplaced belief that their decision was "unforgivable", then please at least take the time to read this: https://www
reddit
com/r/Vive/comments/5h51dd/the_hard_truth_about_virtual_reality_development/
I bought my Vive months ago, but outside of showing it off to friends and family, I haven't really used it
 Why
 Because most of the content available for it so far has been little more than tech demos or wave-based shooters
 They're fun for a little while, but they get old, fast
Arizona Sunshine is exactly what I want from a true VR game
 It has a goal that you progress towards by moving around in and interacting with the world
 And what a world
 The game's atmosphere and art-style is great, and there have been several moments where I just stop and look around at the scene around me going "Wow"
 To top it off the player narrator is actually funny enough to make you laugh and enjoy listening to
 Combat can be intense, with occasional "challenges" being faced in levels coming in the form of a hord--usually associated with pulling levels or pressing buttons to activate something, an elevator or door, for example
 There is a good variety of weapons scattered throughout the levels to up the fun, everything from different pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, and grenade launchers, to special in-place weapons like sniper rifles or a minigun
 It all adds up to a very satisfying experience
This isn't a tech demo or yet another wave-based shooter showing the promise of what VR could be: it actually delivers on that promise
 Well worth the money

Arizona Sunshine is a story-oriented roomscale shooter for Vive and Rift
In the single-player campaign, which I spent about 5 hours exploring, the player steps into the shoes of the unnamed protagonist in the aftermath of an apparent zombie apocalypse
 Hearing a garbled but recognizably human voice on the radio, he resolves to track it down, along with the safety it implies, through the eponymous Arizona countryside
Despite being a zombie shooter, the atmosphere isn't horror-laden nor filled with jump scares, although having one of the undead stumble up behind you in a pitch-black cave is guaranteed to wake you up a little
 The zombies themselves consist of a diverse handful of base models, apparently randomly customized by movement speed, ranging from aimless stumbling to 28 Days Later, as well as a variety of addons: fungal growth, helmets/hardhats, body armor, and the like
 Playing Arizona Sunshine actually gave me some insight into various zombie movies, in the sense that I found myself in danger of being overwhelmed, on multiple occasions, by a not-that-large group, simply by virtue of having to manage my movement, ammunition levels, reloading, and firing in multiple directions
The environments are well-executed and stylistically cohesive: you might take a hiking trail along the wall of a canyon to travel between two outdoor areas, thread your way between abandoned cars on a highway overpass, or play hide-and-seek with zombies in a deserted railyard
 Although the player is generally "directed" via barriers, dead ends, or impassable terrain, it feels natural overall, and there's little risk of becoming lost
Locomotion occurs via a combination of meatspace movement and teleportation, with instant warping for stairs and ladders
 Each teleport is limited to the distance of a few steps, and the player is (fairly enough, in my opinion) blocked from warping through objects, including movable parts of the environment, like car doors
 Weapons are motion-controlled, as one would expect, and feature realistic aiming using the sights of the various guns
 I felt that the aiming became unreliable quite a bit closer than I would have expected, but that may have been an intentional design choice, or I may just be worse than I think at sighting without the subconscious cues of a real weapon's weight and balance
Many of the items in the game are physically interactive, although not nearly as many as I would expect for a medium where the ability to handle things within the game space is one of the main differentiators from traditional games
 Items that are significant in some way are clearly marked, once the player is close enough, helping to avoid the situation where that one item you need is hidden in plain sight as you search all around it
The game is unique, or nearly so, in that it takes a number of tropes from its traditional FPS predecessors and smoothly extends them into VR: the quickly-encountered locked door whose key just happens to be in the farthest accessible area, the agonizingly slow elevator/door/etc
 that meanwhile attracts all nearby enemies, the vital piece of machinery whose handful of unique missing parts are scattered in opposite directions, the seemingly unconquerable hostile horde that appears just after the player acquires a powerful new weapon
As such, Arizona Sunshine is a great step into the arena of story-focused VR shooters, and a promising glimpse of the potential awaiting us

I really have no idea what the people that leave negative reviews for this game are talking about
Framerate issues
 -
I've never had a single one
It's too hard
 - Practice or something, it's not a hard game
The guns don't shoot straight
 -
Of course they do
They never fix problems
 -
There are hotfixes and updates very regularly
The graphics are bad
 - I have no idea what you were expecting
The multiplayer doesn't work
 - It didn't work great the first week or so, but it's been incredibly easy to connect and play since then
The flashlight isn't held correctly
 - That's the tactical way to hold a flashlight, but if you don't like it, just hold the controller differently
The guns aren't loud enough
- Turn up the volume
The game constantly crashes
- It's never crashed once for me
I haven't seen a single complaint that makes sense to me
In my opinion, this is a great game for VR, and definitely one of the best (and possibly THE best, depending on what you like) VR games out there
I'm sure there will be those of you out there that will tell me that my opinion isn't better than anyone else's, and I agree
I'm simply stating my own opinion and why the negative reviews I've seen don't make sense to me
To me, this is a great game and I highly recommend it to anyone that has VR

OMG OMG OMG
 I played this multiplayer horde mode and 2 player campaign and it was amazing
 Best VR game yet
 Wish horde mode had other scenes though
 Please add more
 maybe one from each level
 This is AAA
******2nd review***Ok so the hubby and I just BEAT the game doing 2 player Co-op
 He was using oculus touch in one room, while I was on the Vive in the other,
and it was amazing
 We couldn't stop playing, just took 5 min breaks between each level
Super fun, I have never spent this much time in VR before
 This gives me so much hope
****3rd review,***as you can see we have put in over 60 hours with this game
 The hubby and I and a few of his friends play horde mode alot after work
 Takes some stress off
 Super fun still
 To be honest this is really the best (Full) VR game out there right now that I have played
 I just can't wait for more games like this one to come out
If you haven't played this game, you HAVE TO GET IT
Posted: 29 May
So then, Arisona Sunshine
I want to be fair and tell you, dear potential customer, the truth
The game is relatively short and extremely linear
 The map at times feels cheap and unpolished, while the last 2 chapters feel especially rushed and unfinished
 There are bugs with light, texture clipping, and AI is dumb
 I still recommend it
 Why
It you can overlook the things at which the game falls short, you will have an experience like no other (so far
)
 The unbelievable immersion, the original solutions to things that shouldn't really work in VR, the dynamic combat in the dead world of Arizona desert gifted me a desire to play it again, on an Apocalyptic difficulty
 It at times feels like a Left 4 Dead on meth, even with bugs and unpolished areas
 It made me want an open-world zombie apocalypse in VR; I will be waiting with a baited breath for DLC (and hopefully some changes to the levels which are substandard)
I would say that the fun I had - and the fun my friends will have when coming over to my place and trying this game out - is worth the 19
99 dollars I've spent on it
 I will once again point out that the game is not without its flaws; yet, the dynamic battles, the beautiful landscapes, the voice acting that made me smile quite a few times and the atmosphere of solitude that slowly transforms into despair makes Arizona Sunshine, you guessed it, shine
Give it a try
P
S
 Oh yes, one more thing
 As a person that admires freedom, I tend to stay away from linear games; this, however, is one of the very few exceptions
Posted: 10 December, 2016
I almost never write reviews, but this game is definitely worth your time
 Best VR game I have played yet and I am hoping there is more to come
 100% buy it now
Edit: Just finished my first complete playthrough, wow
 This is definitely the best game I have played this year, hands down
 (pun not intended)
 10/10 would recommend and hope Vertigo/Jaywalkers puts out some DLC's soon
 Pros:- That last scene, wow
Posted: 7 December, 2016
UpdateLooks like they removed their artificial lock in the game due to the backlash but this shouldn't of happened in the first place
I already got my refund but don't really want to turn around and hand them the $40 (CDN) back
Maybe once a steam sale hits or something, oh well, I vote with my wallet
----------------------------------------------------------------------The developer has LOCKED part of the game for 7th gen i7 owners ONLY and does not list this on the store page anywhere
 I have a i5-2600k that runs the game and the "i7advanced settings" just fine, this CANNOT be allowed to happen to the computer game industry
From the 30 mins that I played the game was quite decent too
 + Nice and bright colours+ Pleasing atmostphre+ your character speaking out loud was a nice touch-------- Only had a few issues -------- Game crashed right after calibration- Some dead zombie parts strobing- Some jaggies/antialisasing issues where the sides and jaggies were white
- Gun felt very small as did your hands- Aiming felt a bit off, shots that felt straight were quite off
Posted: 7 December, 2016
They have now removed the limitation based on processor proving it was a marketing exclusivity deal and not a performance issue
 They haven't apologised for their actions and clearly believe what they did was okay
 Until that changes I will not be supporting this company
**Original Review**This game has artificial limitations
An entire game mode is disabled until March UNLESS you have the latest i7 processors
 The VR market is already fractured thanks to Oculus trying to close off the VR market with their money bags and exclusivity, this is not what we need
Vote with your wallet and do not encourage this peasantry for PC/VR

This game is so realistic compared to other flight simulators
 I played FSX for a while and i'm going to say goodbye to it
 You can't get any better graphics in a flight simulator then x-plane 11
 I didn't installed any other freeware airports and by it's default, it just looks beautiful
 The night lighting of all these highways my god
 I can't say any better
 If you want to have a fully packed flight sim with outstanding graphics, very good default airplanes and "yet" no 200 euro addons, buy this game
Posted: 30 March
Very beautiful game out of the box
 The aircraft look amazing and perform really well
 It is also very easy to make a custom flight quick and easily
 Weather is very nice
 Very polished game at day one
 I am very happy i buy this
Posted: 12 September
Why not early access
I know fanboys will downvote this but I don’t care
 I give a constructive criticism from my point of view while backing my words
I’ve never piloted a plane and never will so I can’t say how realistic it is or not, only how I think it is
 All I can say is that flying in X-plane 11 feels more satisfying than in FSX or FSW
 It feels like I’m really in the air
 Landing a plane smoothly could be a challenge
 The whole flying process feels amazing
 Setting up the plane, setting up the route and following it is rewarding
 Flying over a place you know is awesome, the scenery is very accurate, unlike the new “revolutionary” FSW where I can’t find anything flying over my city
Graphics are the best I’ve seen in a flying sim
 The scenery looks great and if you add ortho4xp and w2xp it becomes the most accurate flying sim
 You literally can find your house, w2xp places correct building types in correct places most of the time
Plane models are pretty nice, but it could be better, inside could use some work
 And the best part – night lighting is outstanding
 Flying at night/sunset over a city is a real treat for the eyes
 No mods needed, it looks stunning out of the box
Default planes are average, most of them are functional and fun to fly, but some are not and GPS doesn’t work
 The ones which work still have some unclickable switches and FMC in 737 lacks some features and is worse than a free modded 737
 Good for beta/early access, but not for a full game
The main reason why I’m giving this a negative review is because it should be an early access game and not sold as a full product
 As an early access game I would give it thumbs up, it shows great potential and is fun
 I’m enjoying it and will enjoy it in the future, but I can’t give developers an excuse to release half finished games
There are too little planes and even those few are not the highest quality
 There’s no Airbus which is a real letdown
 FSX had more content, of course the default planes in FSX are worse because it was released
11 years ago
 If developers include only few planes they could at least make them authentic with fully working systems
There are no missions like in FSX or FSW
 When I think now FSX was ahead of it’s time, even current sims have less features
Performance is not very good
 It’s good while cruising, but fps drops drastically when you need fps the most – during take off and landing
 It could drop to 25fps on a high end systems with graphics not even on max settings
 That’s simply unacceptable
 Performance should be better and there’s no excuse for it
 I already see the fanboys “20-35fps is considered ideal”
 No, 20-35fps is not ideal and nowhere near it
 Yes games with less action can be played on lower fps but it can’t be called ideal
 30fps is the minimum and considered as acceptable framerate
 While this game stays smooth at low fps, it’s still breaks the immersion, things go all floaty and it doesn’t feel real anymore
 I used to play games on 20-30fps for a long time but I never even thought this being ideal
 Developers keep promising things, add things, changing the engine to vulkan, but time passes and nothing happens
 Updates are very slow, there could be no updates for moths
 How are they going to make VR work with this performance
 If I would want promises I would go to vote in the elections
Remember this requires a beast of a PC
 To get an enjoyable experience with nice graphics you need something like 7700k/x1700 overclocked and GTX1070
I know developers are flying enthusiasts and they're trying their best to give us the best flying experience they can and I’m thankful for this, but that’s not an excuse to do a lazy job on other aspects
 Is it so hard to enable steam overlay
 It doesn’t require time and effort, it’s a default steam feature, even non-steam games have the overlay
 You need to download reshade and it enables the overlay and broadcasting, but developers can’t do this simple thing
 I start to think they disabled the overlay intentionally
 Price
 I understand Laminar is a business and it’s their right to decide what the price will be and it’s our right to buy it or not
 But why they increased the price for everyone except USA
 This seems a bit nationalistic to me
 Maybe I wouldn’t write this if developers would’ve bother to answer why did they increased the price after I and other people asked about it in the discussions
 But there was no communication, it’s probably too hard to spend 1 hour/week to check the discussions and answer some questions, make some sticky threads etc
So the price for EU was 55€ and 60$ for US
 One day developers decided to increase the price for EU and all other regions
 EU got 10€ increase, Russia for example got 100% increase, but what about US
 Nope, 0% price increase
 That is not a nice thing to do
Wanna hear a funny thing
 They charge you this price but you’re limited to how many things you can download from their official website
 The other day I was downloading liveries and after downloading 20 of them I was greeted with a message which said “you can only download 20 things per day”
 Seriously
 It’s not a problem of course, you don’t download that many things often, but the whole fact is just stupid
X-plane 11 doesn’t have any flight planning tools
 Yeah sure you can use other apps or websites for this, but why not include everything in the game
 Website like Simbrief uses old airac cycle, you want a newer one
 Get a monthly subscription plan
 Flight school is very limited, there are only few lessons, no airliner lessons
 Again feels half finished
 Would be perfectly ok for an early access
Another very important thing for flight simmers is ATC
 It’s practically non-existent in X-plane 11
 It’s there but it’s absolutely useless and will only confuse you and you’ll never land
 Would be acceptable for early access
What happens when Bethesda releases Fallout or Elder scrolls
 You probably all know the jokes like “modders fix and finish their games”
 So this one feels the same
 They charge a ridiculous price, but to make it authentic you need mods and you also need payware mods
 The upside is X-plane 11 has a good amount of free mods
 Like photo scenery, it’s free and looks better than payware scenery for FSX or P3D
 There are plenty of free airports, so that’s another +1
 But when it comes to planes forget freeware, they suck
 There is Zibo 737 modded, it’s free and it’s really amazing, if you buy this game, download this plane as soon as you can
 But that’s about it
 There are more free planes, but they’re nothing good
There are some good free plugins to enhance the airports and make the clouds look good
 The default clouds are absolutely pathetic
 The environments looks awesome but the clouds are just bad
I’m not interested in multiplayer, but I saw some people complaining about this
 It seems that the game has no multiplayer as stated on the store page
 Well it kinda has but the setup process is very archaic and no one uses it
Things evolve, things change and fight sims should change too, by becoming more casual friendly and more affordable
 Saying “it always was this way, I remember when I was young we done things this way and it’s the best way” is not right
So like I said I enjoy X-plane 11 and I recommend it for those who want an awesome flying experience
 If you’re ready to tinker, spend a lot of time watching youtube, learning, downloading stuff, spend time making things to work, waiting for updates and have a good PC then buy it
 It’s the best flying sim out there
 It is not finished yet and should be in early access state but I like where it’s going and I hope it will get better and better
Pros:Flying feels greatAccurate sceneryLighting is amazingBest out of the box experienceGood amount of free addons/plugnsCons:Feels like betaMisses many featuresNot everything worksPerformance is not goodDisabled basic steam features

Excellent upgrade from X-plane 10
 Just purchased so I do not have a lot of time with it, I did not try the Beta
 My first impressions have been excellent thus far
 Setup and usage is much more intuitive than 10 was
 I especially like the joystick setup now which included a visual representation of my Saitek X52
 Setup was very easy and I was flyimg with the default aircraft in no time
 The 737 and MD80 included aircraft are very well modeled and surprisingly detailed
 Weather has been improved and clouds and visibilty look very realistic
 Flying through clouds now is very impressive
 The user interface is a welcome change and easy and intuitive to use
 Frame rates for me are great, and I am very pleased with the overall look and performance of the sim
 I'm sure there are bugs and issues yet to be found, but I am confident LR will deal with them
 This by far the best flight sim available, and very much worth the upgrade
Posted: 3 October
Listen, this sim is a serious investment
 It's not easy to justify dropping £54
99 / 62 EUR / $72 on a game, but this isn't really a game
 It's a full-on, commercial-grade flight simulator and one that will either make or break your commitment to learning curves
If you do any flying, this sim is the only one worth getting
 It accurately simulates flight dynamics based on real-time flight modelling; it's as realistic as you're going to get
 Paired with the correct hardware and licences, it allows pilots to log hours towards ratings
 So, for the best part of £60, you'll get as close to flying as you can in your home
For someone who doesn't fly, this game presents a significant challenge
 There are some basic tutorials which explain the fundamentals of flying in a Cessna 172 - after that, you're absolutely on your own
 There's a few aircraft to choose from, from small GA planes like the Cessna all the way to four-engine passenger jets from Boeing
 Systems are accurately modelled and interactable - you really can control everything just as you would in the real machine
 So, once you've mastered some simple pootling about in your 172, you can escalate to small jets or 747s and find a whole new level of challenge
 It's the only game where I've had to consult actual reference material outside the game, and when I found myself reading a flight manual in my idle time, I realised I was either very sad and or probably justifying my purchase price
 It's an immersive world, and if you've got the time and the brainspace, it's rewarding too
XP11 is endlessly expansible too; the default install package includes the WHOLE world's terrain and is impressively accurate, but with the help of mainly freeware mods online, you can accurately simulate your hometown if you so wish
 There's a raft of extra aircraft (including some payware which rivals the base game price) which are unbelievably well-concieved - the community go the extra mile here to faithfully recreate their favourite airliners
A small mention has to go to the visuals - it's a stunning engine and some of the 3D cockpits are so immersive it's easy to forget you're sitting in front of a monitor
 Engaging, stimulating and satisfyingly accurate, Laminar Research have continued to impress with XP11 - but it's not a light purchase
 There's a good demo, if you fancy it - and for the love of god, play with some sort of controller, it makes things a lot easier

Spent at least 10 minutes trying to turn on a plane before realizing that the game was paused
Posted: 27 July
It's more realistic than FSX, with better graphics out of the box (albeit mostly auto-gen), a better interface and the all-important 64-bit compatibility
 It just needs a bit more content
 Suggestions:1: Career mode, like start in a cheap plane and ferry people wherever they want to go and eventually upgrade
 Give me an incentive to grind flight hours and visit places I wouldn't normally think of
2: More tutorials
 Teach us more about all the instruments
 Go through taking-off and landing the various planes
 Preferably in interesting locations
3: More missions
4: Steam Workshop support
It has a few bugs at present, which I won't detail here, but nothing game-breaking - I've not had any crashes yet
 Also, I find it inconvenient to have to go to external websites to properly plan flights
 It needs the ability to see the whole world in the map screen, and also have it accessible from the main menu
Posted: 30 March
Finally
 A flight simulator that is actually good enough to replace the ever so old FSX
Pros: - Finally some graphics, the game looks greate out of the box
 On FSX and P3D I had to download over a dozen mods / addons to make it look any good
 - MD-82, what can I say, I am glad to see my fav
 commercial airliner made it into the game - In-Flight functionality is better than ever
 everything seems clean, and well done
Posted: 14 May
From a former FSX pilot (800+ Hrs on FSX)I run the 64bit version of XP11 and i love it
Pro's:- very nice scenery (night time scenery street lighting is very good)- Nice looking and good default aircraft
 ( i was surprised compared to default FSX aircraft)- good flight modeling (feels more realistic then FSX in my opinion)- X-plane
org community, where there is loads of free Stuff created by other users (scenery, plugins, skins, aircraft etc)- XP Plane Maker to create you own aircraft (have not tried it yet, but that you can create your own plane is a cool feature in my opinion)- WED (World editor) where you can create your own airports or upgrade deafult airports
 (i have done 2 airports so far, and i must say if you follow some tutoials you can create very nice airports)- Good functioning flight Replay and Record function
Cons:- most default airports look very basic
 (can be easely fixed for many airports by downloading user created airports)- At this point in time there are not so many payware or freeware aircraft availeble- default ATC is not very good (can be easely fixed with freeware or payware plugins)- no flight planning tool in the game

Early Access Review
I don't think I've ever had more fun in a video game than I had today
 (Given that I'm 49, that's saying something
) The first time I got into a straight up sword battle with a skeleton I grinned like a complete idiot
 I dodged, he dodged
 I'd block his blows, and he'd leap back to avoid mine
 He'd land a wound and I'd yell out of frustration, and every time I landed a strike I found myself taunting this digital mesh with all I had
 I wasn't twiddling controllers here, or mashing on the "X" button; I was fighting a skeleton with a virtual sword, and loving every second of it
The game isn't perfect, of course
 It's too easy to teleport partially into a wall, and there are pacing issues evident even early on, but frankly, that doesn't matter
 After defeating a skeleton archer in a bow battle, I laughed, stood up from behind my cover, and said "If this was World of Warcraft people would never leave
"If you own a Vive, you owe it to yourself to buy this title

Early Access Review
Only 2 levels, with apparently no plans to release any more content
Move it out of Early Access if you're done with it
First level was the best VR experience I've had to date and ALMOST worth the $20 price tag
Second level, an arena wave fighter, was a nice change of pace and a lot of fun, but I was ready for another level like the first
Instead I was presented with a link to exit the game
$20 is steep IMO for what equates to 1 dungeon and a minigame
Hopefully future purchasers will see this review and at least know what they're buying

Early Access Review
I think this may be my first review (just saw I also reviewed Orion Prelude
ha)
There's so many things I want to say about this game
For one, I have been waiting 12 years to play this game
I know, it's only been a twinkle in a developer’s eye for a few months or so, but that doesn't change anything
When I was playing Morrowind, I wanted it to be this game
When I played Diablo 1, I wanted it to be this game
Heck, when I read books
I wanted them to be this game
This game is not Morrowind or Diablo
It's not any of those things
This game is clunky, sloppy, graphically challenged (no offense, I still love them) and downright fantastic
 It has a taste, and truly just a taste, of everything I want in a video game
Realistic sword movements, fun battles, gimmicky enemies, a touch of plot, a sprinkle of character, a hint of leveling, a smidge of puzzles, a dash of environmental interaction and a pinch of looting/customization
This is by all means, a shadow of a good RPG
But it doesn't matter
We've all played these good RPGs, but what we want is to be in one
This is as close as you can get right now
My only negative is that it's tricky to interact with the belt, as in, a giant pain (unless I was doing something wrong) and it's too short
Remember when you senselessly fought things with the Wii-mote
Remember when you bought a Playstation move and for a few hours thought it was awesome until you realized that, meh, not that great
Remember when you wanted to be playing this game
Well, lucky for you, this is that game
Buy it, support it, and get on the Dev's nerves about making it better and better
I love this game

Early Access Review
Just the other day I had a look at this game and thought, "Ugh, looks overpriced and pretty gimmicky - even for a VR game
" I decided to take the plunge, as much for lack of other content as anything
This has been the single best experience I've ever had in gaming - by a wide margin
 Not just VR, everything
Tips to super-enjoying this:1
 Let yourself be immersed
 Try and BE the character you're playing
 I felt giddy with excitement and anticipation by the end of this game because I let myself believe I was there
2
 Move around frequently in your play-space
 Since you teleport a lot in this game you can lose a sense of immersion if you do it too often
 So just make sure you shift around a lot
 Be free
3
 If you do 1
 right, then make sure you fight your enemies like they're going to bludgeon you to death if they actually land a hit
 It'll put the hairs up on the back of your neck
Legit criticisms:1
 AI is pretty crap in this
 Enemies aren't smart and just sit there staring at you even though you're only 2 meters away
2
 AI fights incredibly slowly
 This is probably just the designers deciding to ease people in - but more frantic fights would be amazing
3
 AI doesn't really adapt to your fight style - I'm sure this will be fixed in other games given time
 But basically, enemies should be a bit more clever about blocking and dodging blows that you repeatedly land
4
 Textures could do with a bump in resolution, but honestly, it doesn't matter too much since you get lost in the moment
5
 MOAR CONTENT
 Left me desperate for more
Conclusion:This is the single best entertainment experience I've ever had
 This game is amazing
 It's a cliche, but seriously: this game is a must-have
If you don't have a Vive
 Get a Vive
 Get this game
 No joke

Early Access Review
Simply put, this game is what sold me on VR
Like most, I was extremely skeptical about the very young, very "gimmicky" HTC Vive
Until my cousin slapped a Vive over my eyes, and put me inside Vanishing Realms - - where I was immediately transported to an enormous dungeon of old, wielding but a simple torch as I walked through the first doorway, only to be greeted by a dark, looming evil voice that seemingly came from the walls themselves
Here, you will explore ancient dungeons, collect coins to buy weapons and items that will decide whether or not you live or die, actually physically crawl through trap rooms just to get to the next hallway, fight skeletons that are bigger than you ever could've imagined, and this is all just in the first 20 minutes of gameplay
 Here, you will truly get lost in an unreal atmospheric dungeon crawling experience
 You will never forget it as long as you live, I guarantee that
 There is simply nothing like this game
 It's absolutely amazing
 It's an essential VR experience for everyone who has VR, and everyone who is skeptical or even just trying VR for the first time
 Do not wait
 Buy this immediately

Early Access Review
Excerpt from my review at UploadVR
com:"The game is a joy to play because I’m not relying on controller muscle memory and buttons to translate my actions
 The Vive removes those layers of abstraction
 Which button do I press to gaze at an enemy and block that fireball
 Who cares
 Just look at that archer and raise your shield
 Is there an arrow flying at you
 Physically dodge it or duck behind that stone column for cover
 Need to restore your health
 Pull the potion out of your inventory and drink it
Through these natural actions, and augmented by the haptic feedback of the Vive motion controllers, we’re projecting a tangible sense of agency into the game world in a way that was previously impossible
 And the world responds accordingly
During a particularly heated battle, I was fending off two flanking archers, a healer, and a spellcaster (make that healer a priority kill with your bow & arrow
) who were guarding the coveted Dragon Wand
 I emerged sweaty and out of breath from hiding behind trees, popping out of cover, dodging arrows, and just getting wrapped up in the heat of the moment
 When you start dual-wielding swords and fighting increasingly brawny boss monsters, Vanishing Realms can even turn into a legitimate workout if you get carried away
I can easily say without reservation that Vanishing Realms is a visceral, awe-inspiring VR experience steeped in intuitive, tactile gameplay
 It has left me satisfied but selfishly craving more
 That it was created by a single developer in 8 months is nothing short of extraordinary, and I believe this paves the way for a surge of successful, micro-sized development teams making breakout games for virtual reality

Early Access Review
This game is what I hoped VR would be
 Search dungeon rooms for loot like you're really there; lean over to look inside barrels or behind statues for hidden treasure
 Then use your sword and shield to parry opponents' attacks and then wait to swing while they're off guard, or dart forward to jab a vulnerable spot and leap back before they can hit you
 And when I say dart forward and leap back, I don't mean with buttons on a controller
I have a decent sized playing area, so that's reflected in this review
 I imagine it's still fun standing only but having enough room to dance around in sword fights was a huge plus

I own an oculus and I was skeptical about how this game would function because it says its HTC Vive only
 This game runs beautifuly on the Oculus
 If you hesitated to buy this game because you have an oculus, don't
 It's so good

Early Access Review
I am a DnD fan, I've played some RPGs, so I was excited to give this a try
My first session was about 90 minutes and the only thing that made me pause was I needed a drink
I really didn't want to take off the Vive and get something
So my next session I donned a camelback full of some flavored water and back in I went
I played a couple more hours and had such a good time fighting off monsters, picking coins out of thin air, getting my magic wand and defeating chapter 1
You don't level up, you don't pick your class, break everything, pick up everything you can and keep it
The environments are varied and well done - dwarven caves you can mine for big loot, outdoors by the ocean, into tombs and trapped passageways
Really really well done
 My only criticism right now is the lack of a clear save point, checkpoint or otherwise letting you know that you can stop here and still have your progress later
I got reset a couple times, but still had a good time moving quickly through content I had seen before

Early Access Review
This game is amazing
You get to use bows, shields, swords, two-handed axes, and there's an awesome inventory system to store this stuff
Chapter one was fantastic
There was a really involved map and story that unfolded as you played, and the pacing was excellent
It even got darker as I played (figuratively and literally), which I really liked
I was really looking forward to chapter two, however, but it was not what I expected at all
Where chapter one was like reading a book, chapter two was quite literally "kill these guys really fast" with no story to it at all
There was a small arena on the same small map, and I was teleported back to the same area for every wave
Felt very arcadey and really broke the immersion
I hope that chapter two will be turned into a mini game or something and replaced with something as deep as chapter one
I kinda feel like the developer decided to call it quits after chapter one and reluctantly made chapter two
Regardless, chapter one is what makes this game
Posted: 5 April, 2016
There's nothing like that NO VR Headset attached screen
If you guys want to atleast play the robot repair demo, make a shortcut of vr
exe (I
E: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Lab\RobotRepair\bin\win64), and add -novr to the launch parameter
Launch the shortcut, and when the Valve logo appears press ~, then enter "map vr_aperture_main" into the command console
 To grab things hold Left Shift, Ctrl, and Left Mouse Button at the same time
The robot repair demo is (at least of right now) the closest thing we'll get to Portal 3
 Keep trying to count, Valve

Hands down one of the single best experiences on VR
 and its free
 This game would probably get a 4/10 from me but instead its easily getting an 11/10 and ill tell you why
 Postcards 3/10 - "The exploration demo" you get to throw a stick and a robotic dog will go and get it for you and bring it back
 This was probably my first introduction to VR
 it was quite nice but the overall wow factor just wasnt there and it got old quickly
 This is essentially the same experience you can get from Google Earth VR which is also free I believe and more enjoyable -minus the robodog
 (PS
 you can change destinations by pulling out the "guitar cable" sticking in each destination
 hmm
 i wonder what else it can go in
 hint hint)Human Medical Scan 3/10 This is one of the simpler demos in the collection which is probably one you will only go into one time and never go back into it
 It lets you move a hand held "layer remover" over a human body ro reveal whats underneath
 Not a lot going on and doesnt work the way you think you could make it work from various angles
 kinda pointless but i understand why its there
 Solar System 4/10 A little more entertaining than the medical scanner this is exactly what it says it is
 Its a room with a solar system
 You can walk around and through the sun (which is taller than you are)
 this all and all would not get a 4/10 BUT
 you can remove the planets from their axis and throw them around and into each other
 The physicas in this room is legit
 and for that i spent about 3 times the amount of time in this room as i did the medical scanner so 4/10Secret Shop 5/10 This seems to be the area of the game where they threw in everything else they wanted to put in the game but didnt have time to do or the ability to base an entire demo off of
 So it all got tossed in here
 There is quite the collection of little things to do in here and some secrets to explore
 Xortex 6/10 This is essentially the best take on an arcade game i have seen in a while
 Your controller becomes your vehicle and it moves as fast as you can move your hand
 dodge lazers and enemy missiles to score points
 get hit
 you die
 more fun than the rest of them so far but for some reason this one makes me motion sick
 which is dumb because it doesnt really move
 the whole game is stationay with the only thing moving are the enemies and your hand
 but overall very nice presentation
 Slingshot 7/10 This is a semi "Sperture Science" feeling slingshot where you shoot these "cores" out into a warehouse trying to hit the red barrels
 you hit a barrel the entire tower usually goes up and you get points for everything that falls through the floor
 The thing that makes this great is the launcher itself
 Very fun to mess around with and overall just fun to play
 Robot Repair 9/10 If you are a Portal fan
 get ready to have your mind blown
 then have it reassembled again just so they can blow it again
 This isnt much in terms of a demo
 it honestly feels like an interactive teaser trailer
 and it feels like what a teaser trailer for a game may look like in the future
But this is basically the Atlas robot from Portal 2 has had a malfunction of some sort
 And you are tasked with dismantlying and repairing him
 This is really just a display demo of what something like this would look like which is very detailed and looks just pure amazing
 But the part that really sets it apart from the other demos so far is (Spoiler)
After you try to fix the robot every thing falls through the flor because there really is no actualy fixing the robot
 Its designed to make you fail
 then the side of the wall opens up and GLaDOS pops down in all her glory and is like "Oh
 its YOU" and she leans in real close to you
 i almost peed
 because she is HUGE "in person" and it was an awe inspiring goosebump moment
 aww man
 the pure joy of that scene will live on forever
 The only reason this did not get a 10/10 was because it made me want so much more and it was simply too short
 such a tease
LongBow 11/10 THIS
 made paying 800 for VR worth it
 Out of my 30 hours of play time probably 24 hours of that has been in this demo
 It is basic tower defense game with a bow and arrow
 You shoot at the little stick paper people who are rushing to your tower gate to break it down
 Enemy coming
 shoot em and watch them shatterEnemy coming with a shield
 set your arrow on fire and shoot the shieldEnemy took health off your gate
 shoot some balloons to get some health backEnemies overwhelming you
 shoot the target trap to dump hot pitch on them and listen to them scream
 me and my family played this until we couldnt
 literally
 if you are not an archer by profession you are in for some serious arm pain
 we playes this so lond we almost couldnt lift our arms the next day
 but we had to keep going
 we would see who could make it to the highest round
 there is even a global leaderboad now which makes it even more fun to play by yourself to try and beat others and your own personal best
 This is the game i let people play to experience VR for the first time
 which is kind of a bad thing to do because this is it
 this is the best experience in VR available at the time of this review
 so they have no where to go but down from there i guess
 but man do they have fun
The Lab Lastly there is the lab itself which houses the entrances to all the other games
 im not really going to rate this because there really isnt any objective
 However
 everytime you go into a demo a prop from that demo makes it out on the table in front of you
 The biggest thing here is that once youa re out of the long bow area you now have a longbow sitting on the table here
 And there are hundreds of people you can try to shoot in the ajacent warehouses which is kinda like a game itself
 for the longest time i was sure there was a secret or easter egg here but i cant kill all of the guys
 Some are on forklifts that speed through and make it near impossible to hit and some of them are hard coded onto those forklifts and from what i can tell they cant be killed
 Some of the guys are way in the back standing on top of pallets and im not 100% all of them can be hit with the arrow
 they can however be killed with the remote control space ship you get after doing Xortex
 This is absolutely the best
 you will love it 100% or your money back

Try not to mess up your wizard work station when you arrive inside the castle
 Only the skull and essential items respawn if you blow them off the table
 It's a wizard's sandbox with some nice side scenes
 There was a small hullabaloo regarding the game recording and spying your gameplay style, and I think the analytics option you are presented with at start wasn't always there

Waltz of the Wizard is a fantastic title for the Vive, and amazingly free
There's a surprising amount of depth to the experience and discovering each new spell was a total blast (literally, in one example)
 The room has plenty of items and objects to play with
Definitely recommend this title, this will be my new introductory game for showing people the Vive

Visited the house I grew up in as a child and sat down in the yard
Walked up and down the street I used to ride my bike on in the summer
Even though the resolution becomes pretty awful at that scale it still somehow looked familiar and reminded me of home

my mom recently passed away, i knew on the google car that drove past my house at the time she was still alive she was outside in the front yard
 with the update i am able to walk right up to her

This is the "ULTIMATE" VR experience
 A whole Earth to explore
 Perfect use of scaling as you zoom in and out
 Comfort mode is optional
 Google, Thank you for this experience
 This is a MUST GET
 Once StreetView/Oceans are added in, it will make this product even better
 But as it stands its AMAZING

My Mum is in her 81'st year - bear with me - and she has had a go at one or two "experiences" in VR since I got my Vive last year
 I thought she would love to try this
 Within five minutes she was back at the place she grew up, giggling and squeeling with delight
 Then she went up "Tandle Hill" and suddenly I noticed she wasn't laughing anymore
I asked her if she was ok, and I noticed she was quietly crying and shaking
 "What's the MATTER"
, I asked
"I haven't been here since I was a little girl; this is so wonderful - thank you so much, I never thought I would ever come here ever again"
THAT, my friends, is worth the cost of the Vive itself
Pro's: Become Superman/Supergirl and go where you like; visit your own house; go to that place you always wanted to; sit on cliffs and scare yourself to death; "Leap" from tall buildings; Take off and go into space then land on the other side of the planet; go to that holiday place again (without the traffic jams); play a game of "can I find it again from space without getting lost on the way down"; save your own favourites and jump straight there next time
 Change the time of day or night by dragging the Sun across the sky
 All for FREE 
IN MY OPINION - the best and most enduring VR experience ever, and probably for a long time to come
Cons:Well, not really any, but I would like to see the following features added as this gem is polished:To be able to leave human scale on ALL THE TIME
 I know it is great to feel like Gulliver, walking between the mountains or skyscrapers, but for immersion I'd like to be able to leave my eyes 70mm apart and view the Earth in normal scale (at least have the option)
Ability to reverse the "BRAKE" option so that you are slow by default and you pull the trigger to accellerate; I, personally, want to take it all in, not rush off
I am not bothered about the comfort mode and prefer not to use it, but for those that get motion sickness, an option to change the size of the "tunnel" view to suit
I for one, don't mind that you can't text-search for places to "teleport" to; searching adds to the enjoyment, but I'll expect a lot of people would prefer the option
I know there's mirror mode, which you can modify to show just left/right eye as a circle on the screen, but for your friends to be able to view the experience full screen
 I appreciate this could affect FPS etc, so just the option would be nice
 Graphics settings, perhaps
Oh, I don't know, fly to and around the Moon next maybe
;-DThese are not complaints, just hopes for the future

An absolutely hilarious ~1/2 hour
Highly recommended for everyone
I won't spoil anything by talking about the content, but I do want to mention 2 technicalities:1) It appears to be using the Unity "The Lab" renderer (guessing from the result), so the image quality is fantastic2) It makes really good use of my room space
 That might be a happy accident, or it might actually place geometry based on room boundaries
 The latter would be one of the rare cases (outside of, again, The Lab) I know of that being utilized

I actually had refunded this after getting stuck on the 3rd map
 Stupid me
A reviewer reached out to me and told me I was playing it wrong (like climbey)
 So I bought it again and went back in, looking where I wanted to go instead of swinging my arms
 Hours later I pull off the headset, grinning
This is the best movement/racing/climbing VR game hands down
 Since you don't run on the ground like windlands, people (my wife) do not get the motion sickness in this title
 Because simply pointing and clicking allows you to climb and jump around, your arms don't get as tired as they do in Climbey
 This is the best VR game I've bought in months
Posted: 21 May
Already like it
 Pretty cool and unique game with it's own controls and gameplay style
 Not just climbey clone, as you may think at first

Really a fantastic game
 I had some pains early on because I don't follow instructions well, but despite not being crazy into climbing VR games I think it's one of the best VR games available right now (full stop)
 It doesn't skimp on anything
Video review available here: https://youtu
be/ukeAmPB1HY4Pros:Gameplay is skill-based, easy to pick up, addictive
Great visuals and sounds
Music is really great
Very varied environments
Lots of gameplay
Devs description of the game is very accurate for once
Post-release updates coming, no Early Access - just free content
Motion sickness is low
Cons:Movement style may not be the most natural, but it is intuitive and I think better than just swinging your arms
 (not really a con)
Really struggling to think of cons
 If more VR games were of this quality
 well I'd spend more time in VR
Posted: 18 May
WOW
 What a rush
This game is AMAZINGLY good, like the VR version of Mirror's Edge in many ways
 The way the grabbing system works is a little less realistic but its very intuitive for doing super-fast speed hops from one surface to another
 Speed builds up as you successfully hop multiple times and when coupled with surfaces that can effect the way you move it can allow you to build yourself up and 
 just 
 FLY
The level design is also something to be admired
 Each level has a certain amount of "Geoms" you have to collect which make for cool challenge points requiring you to really observe the level and use the terrain in many fun and interest ways in order to collect them
 There is also a Hidden "geom" in each level which are SO rewarding to find and often very challenging to reach
After about an hour's play I have so far only unlocked about a 3rd of the game so I feel like, so far at least, there is plenty of longevity although as I get better at the game I might end up breezing through it
 However the existence of Hidden geoms and requiring to collect all the geoms in the game will make for a much lengthier experience overall
 Plus, the game is just FUN, like I would come back to any one of these levels just to feel the rush of certain mechanics of each level
 I could easily see myself spending 10 hours plus in this game
 Seriously if you started playing this game and you're thinking "meh" 
 JUST GET TO THE LEVEL WITH THE FREAKING HALF-PIPES

This is an absoulte must-buy for VR (as long as you're not super-sensitive to VR sickness)
I haven't had this much fun with a VR game since I first got the headset over a year ago
No other game lets you fly through the air at these speeds, with just the right amount of control and finesse
It's an amazing VR platformer, with nice visuals, great feeling controls, really chill music, and enough content to warrent the price
Right now, I have about 2 hours in, and I've done about 1/3 of the levels (getting 100% completion in them)
Given that the later levels are likely harder and will take more time, I'd be very suprised if I am done before the 6 hour mark
I'd imagine most people would take a bit longer than that if they are 100% completing every level
I'm also really looking forward to playing this game constantly
There are going to be inevitable comparisons to Climbey
They are very different games
TTT is focused on moving fast, doing huge jumps, and flying through the air
Climbey is more focused on climbing, and you don't ever really get the speeds you get in TTT
The fact that this game has released with a large number of actually designed levels that have secrets, collectibles, time trials, and tons of level features makes this game win over Climbey any day of the week
Yes, Climbey has multiplayer and a level editor, but the core levels that come with it aren't very good, and last only an hour or so
I also don't really want to sift through the thousands of crappy user-created levels to find the best ones
TTT has far more enjoyable content, and feels a lot more polished
I recommend the crap out of this game

This game is just awesome, it starts by being something like climbey (with better graphics), then you quickly realize it's all about fluid movements, gliding on stuff or even flying
 The gameplay is very rich and there is a learning curve, and that makes it feel so good to be able reach some tricky parts
There are a lot of different levels, with slightly different gameplays (as i mentioned in the first paragraph), the game progression is a little old school, you have to get crystals in the level and/or finish the level as fast as possible
This game is definitely worth it, i have almost 7 hours of playtime, as the time i m writting this review, and i m 3/4th done with the campaign, and i plan to get all the crystal and stuff in each level after that 
It is a must buy 
(i got a key thanks to a giveaway on reddit)

This game is amazing, the combination of fluid fast flying gameplay and the great music give you an endorphin rush as you fly high and jump from point to point, once you get to the point where you can just fly through a level without losing momentum or stopping once its truly sublime
People will make comparisons to Climbey which I also love but it isn't the same, Climbey is more tactical and methodical, with an emphasis on multiplayer, this one is more adrenaline filled flowing from point to point
 You will treat the first few challenges slowly, but once
you master the mechanic the level is trying to show you, it just flows and feels really good
You won't regret picking this game up, it goes along Climbey as the best VR platformer, each with their own distinct strengths
 The best thing is the game gets better as you go along, the levels get longer, more inventive, and more exciting
 The adrenaline doesn't wear off after the first few levels, it just keeps flowing as you play
 Game makes me feel mildly high at times when you reach that platforming bliss and the tunes are flowing
Posted: 9 June
Yeah, it's pretty super, and fairly hot
 90% of the exaggerated enthusiasm supplied by the Oculess plebs (when it was only available to them) was more or less well founded
 This is one of those titles, like Space Pirate Trainer, or Pavlov that you will always keep installed because even a 5 minute play session works as a VR warmup and will be fun
 After a long enough play session (just did 20 minutes) my whole perception of time is slightly warped (as though I'm still playing the game), and -- even as I'm typing this, I stop
 and, then
 resume typing
 like I was, playing
 the
 game
 It's essentially a 'that scene from the Matrix with the slow-motion bullets' simulator
 You proceed from scene to scene murdering these poor red men made out of glass
 If you die, you resume to the start of the set of scenes
It seemed a touch more aliased than it should have been, and super-sampling can only help you so much, because of the constant red+blank on white color contrast, but of course it runs well
 I loved the intermission scenes in the little apartment, with all that computer crap everywhere
 The 'campaign' mode will probably be over before you know it, but there are plenty of other modes to enjoy in your subsequent sessions
 Soon they will release an update with a better control scheme and other improvements, and I do
hope they add a few more levels/scenes
 Red man hangs dong for a split second at the end of the latest video for the aforementioned update, check Yootube

v=XdBD_nvZk-wWritten Review:SUPERHOT VR is an incredibly satisfying game that makes you feel awesome
 (With a few serious downsides)The main premise and mechanics from the original SUPERHOT carry over to this game
 Time only moves when you move
 That includes your head and hands
 The levels themselves are brand new
 Which is why the developers have chosen to release this as its own standalone game
POSITIVES:Moving in slow-mo, punching enemies, catching their weapons, shooting their friends, dodging bullets all feels so rewarding
 The way enemies shatter when your fist or bullets hit their face is so gratifying
 It's one of the best shooter experiences I've had in VR, and definitely the best way to play this game
 Every level puts you in a new scenario
 Sometimes you'll be fighting on a roof, then a graveyard, or behind a bar counter
 You'll have access to 3 different guns throughout the game that each play uniquely
 A handgun, Smg and shotgun
 On top of that, using improvised weapons in your environment will come in handy
 All of this does a great job at keeping the game from getting stale
There is a story, and although it isn't anything majorly impressive, it does a good job at giving the game some context and keeping you interested
NEGATIVES:Now onto the problems with the game
 It's just so much fun
 However, I beat the game in only 1 hour
 That is VERY short for the main campaign
 Although I died a few times and had to restart a few levels, maybe I'm just that amazing at the game
 I doubt it
 Luckily, when you beat the game you will unlock a few challenges, but they aren't as substantial as the main game
 You can try to speedrun levels, or turn on an only headshot mode, or a survival mode where you kill as many enemies as possible
 Again, they aren't as fun as the vanilla game, but they will extend that 1 hour playtime a little bit
Another issue I had with the game is everything is picked up using the side grip buttons
 After a while, your fingers will really start to hurt, as the position of those buttons isn't very natural and doesn't lend itself well to being held for extended periods of time
 I understand why they did it like this though
This allows you to hold onto a gun, and free up the trigger button for actual shooting
 After you've shot your 5 bullets, your gun will run out and you will want to throw it at an enemy as fast and easily as possible, which is when you just release the grip buttons and it will go flying
 If they had any other system, I don't think it would work as well
Still, that doesn't change the fact that it can be quite painful after a while, which sucks
One tiny thing to point out is, sometimes while you're waiting for a bullet to pass by you, or waiting for a gun to fall into position, you want to keep your head out of the way while at the same time speeding up time
 So you'll kinda just move your hands around to speed up time
 It's not really an actual problem, but it feels a bit silly at times and might make you feel a little bit less immersed at times
One final problem is the lack of menus
 It can be a bit frustrating when you're playing a challenge and want to restart if you know you aren't going to, for example, get the fastest time in this level
 There's nothing you can do other than wait for an enemy to kill you
 This won't affect you much, but it would still be a welcome addition
VERDICT:Although the game is incredibly short, and has a few other problems, it's just so much damn fun
 And it's simple nature allows for replayability to a certain extent
 Although I would still recommend probably picking it up on sale, unless the short length for the price doesn't bother you
 Overall, great fun

Don't be fooled
 SUPERHOT VR pretends to be a game but in reality it's an sneaky way of getting you to work out
After 3 hours of playing my legs hurt from all of the ducking and dodging, my arms hurt from all of the slicing and throwing things, my heart rate is up, and I'm sweating
 Clever, very clever SUPERHOT team
Posted: 21 June
This is a fun game, but it is absolutley NOT worth $25
 I beat the game in an hour
 That's ridiculous
 If the price lowers to like $10, I'll recomend it
 Until then I cannot
Quick edit: I re-bought the game for $15 through the bundle
 I'm gonna keep it because I want my friends to be able to play it
 I still stand by my opinion that it shouldn't cost $25 normally

This is most definitely one of the coolest VR games out there right now
Pros:- Many many awesome John Woo moments that you will not experience anywhere else, VR and otherwise
- Runs great, looks great
Cons:- Each level has about 5 stages, but if you fail any stage, you have to start the level over
 Not terrible, but frustrating at times
- Throwing never felt great to me
 I found it difficult to properly aim my throws
I beat it in about 90 minutes
 I felt this was a good natural length for the game, but perhaps not great for the price (but certainly reasonable after the "VR tax")
All in all, the pros far out weigh the cons, so GET IT AND GET READY FOR
SUPER
HOT

Didn't put the vive down for 2 hours
 It was intense, awesome, and even better in VR
 I'm not even sure I would reccomend the non-VR version if you can buy this
 The main appeal of it is "you don't get tired as fast"You can move in slow motion, snatch guns out of hands, deflect bullets with ninja stars and throw cleavers at enemies
 It's movement system through little gateways is beautiful and gives you time for a breather
 Combat is diverse and you don't need 90 guns to make it fun
 It can be challenging and feels rewarding when you overcome the campaign
 I wish there was more campaign mode and screwed up story like in the PC version but it's still very fun
Would reccomend in a second to any vive owner and I'm glad it's no longer just an oculus exclusive
 Dissapointed at first I had to buy the game again, but happy that it's this good
 It's worth it for sure
 (Also be warned, lots of punching, many punch)
Posted: 26 May
The storyline is only an hour long and you may have some feeling of BA-ness, but as soon as you do, the game finishes and there's nothing to do
 There's only 5 endless modes (compared to the near 16 in the original) and you can't walk around
 You have to clear an area, then a pyramid will appear and you get to teleport to the next area
 Overall, it breaks the emmersion and all of the enemies will be infront or on your sides
 No backside
 Which breaks the BA-ness from the original SUPERHOT as you avoid bullets from every direction
 The levels feel polished, but they're the exact same rooms and areas from the original one, so you're not missing out on much
 The only real difference is how they're played
Overall, if you have the original SUPERHOT, you will find this quite bad
 If you haven't played SUPERHOT, then you won't dwell on how good the original was
Posted: 28 May
I'm not an angry person
The day I bought this I punched my wall twice and my TV once
Invest in the silicone covers
10/10 would recommend
Posted: 7 August
Great experience with surprising amount of gameplay
Pros:+ Great game mechanics+ Gameplay feels just right+ Lots of modes to play through after the main "story mode" (some of the modes would pass as a work out :D )+ Works great with Oculus Rift + TouchCons:- Menus in some of the modes are a bit buggyOverall a solid 9/10, a must have title for Vive/Rift owners
Posted: 26 May
Waited so long for the Vive release and it all was over after 77 minutes
 Well there is endless mode and hardcore but more levels or a story like in the original would added much more value
 This game is super fun but with this price and content
no
 Still waiting for a "meh" vote because I wont give it a yes or a no
 But sadly in the end it is a no

Review is based on gameplay with G29Gameplay:The graphics are on par with today's racing sims
 The physics are very realistic if you have the settings right
 The DLC is not unobtainable and during a steam sale is well worth it
 Beyond that there is the immense amount of free mods availabe for the game
Wheel Setup:A racing sim ideally played on a racing wheel
 There are infinite settings to dial a wheel in the way you want

Early Access Review
Review Update - Assetto Corsa V
08Short version: I highly recommend bying
AC
 Although right now it is not a finished
game, but still a game in early acces (~beta) and key fetures like MP are not enabled yet
But what you get right now, is well worth the money and one of teh best racing sims out there
 What the heck is Assetto Corsa
AC is the work of a small Italian independent Studio: Kunos Simulazione, in sim racing circles around the world known for Net Kar Pro, held in highest regards due to its driving/physic engine and tyre model
Never heard of it
 -
Just like me
 I was happy with the likes of GT 5/6 and Forza, never cared for what was going on on pc and didn't know what I was missing
 Anyhow, Assetto Corsa is a pc racing simulator that tries not only to appeal to its own core audience of pc sim racers, but is aimed at console players too
Assetto Corsa builds up on the predecessor Net Kar Pro, and if successfu,l will see updates, DLC and additional features for years
Assetto Corsa
- What makes it special
IFUN
- Yes Fun, becausedriving is as much fun in the game as it is in real live
 AC is a simulator which gets and provides exactly that
Unlike a lot of otherr sims AC is very accessible, easy to get into but hard to master
 The Driving Experience in AC: Just take a seat in the 1st car you like and start driving (my 1st love: BMW E30 DTM@Mugello) - Within the first round I had a big smile on my face, never before had I experienced such a great feedback and immersion with a Racing Game
 - with a pad none the less The cars are
alive and responsive, you really feel
weight transfer, the tyres, and every part of the track - imho neither the GT Series, nor the Forza titles or the Sim Bin games I tried on pc
come even close
 AC's driving/physics and tyre model is exquisit and unique in its way of easing you into it and letting you explore its depths
 If you are looking for something in a racing game that is more detailed and refined than what you already know, then Assetto Corsa is without a doubt the right choice for you
 Pad/WheelGreat improvement with Pad support in the latest update, no issues anymire
Though every Sim Racer will tell you, that you have to buy a wheel to enjoy this game that isn't true at all
To this day I'm driving with a pad and have put 100+hours into AC with a XBox360 Controller and had more fun than I ever had with GT 5 or Forza or any other racing game - i
e
 most of the pc simulators sounded like work to me till AC came around
 I don't own a 3 Monitor setup, Racing Seat, wheel etc
 - just a decent pc which allows me to play on high settings
 So you can have fun and lots of it, and the driving experience is still a lot better than GT/Forza
Amount/Quality of contentKunos got their hands on some 1st rate licenses, among them Mercedes (not yet in game), Lotus, BMW and Ferrari and more
 AC focuses on GT2/GT3 cars and open wheelers
like the "almost F1" Lotus Exos S1 and the awesome old "Lauda" Ferrari 
 But more cars are to come, historicals F1, and much more
 Every car is beautifully modelled and whileForza and expecially GT feature hundreds of beautiful cars from all ends of the spectrum,
Kunos is not an industry giant like them and can't ever compete with that amount of original content
 But the car selection is still more than decent, all
the tracks in AC are laser scanned and the variety is great - i
e
the Nurburgring GP track and it feels and plays awesome
But here is the main thing: Assetto Corsa is moddable, that means fans are invited to produce and create tracks, cars, skins, Apps and much more - easy to install and a superb enrichment to AC
 Just take a look at the beautiful skins or useful apps in the community videos - absolutely amazing, the creators deserve much praise
 A big thank you to all the modders and unsung heroes out there
Graphics/Sounds:Very good, but not the very best (upcoming Project Cars) and the performance depends as always mostly on your GPU
I use a Palit Geforce 770 4GB and play it with high settings
 But this game is as you know by now not finished yet and will see a lot of improvements on quality and performace - and some of it has already been done
 A low level pc with onboard grafix won't do, but with a high end system you can easily play on resolutions beyond 1920*1080
Sound is above average and good, but is lacking punch in some cars and will improve with future updates
 For those who can't wait for that, there are of course already some sound mods out there
Conclusion
- Enough of the rambling rave - be part of Early Access
There are a lot of things that are not perfect in AC yet, and some that are even quite frustrating at the moment
 Some issues like setting up and finetuning controllers have been fixed and teh latest update saw the AI behaviour extremely improves
 Almost all the frustrating and unfair behaviour are gone, most races are really great fun now with clean racing
 The new AI is certainly among the best out there: they really race, they do not drive in a straight line behind each other and bore you to death
 They actually give the very immersive impression that they want to beat you, they overtake you and each other, they make mistakes, defend their racing line and so on
 With Update 08 most if not all of the terrible AI behaviour is gone anf there are only minor problems left
I can't stress enough how impressive the work of the small KUnos team really is
 They kept word on every promise they made, gave or announced additional free contet and their updates are coming every 2 weeks - V08 is definitely a hughe step toward a final release version
 Full VersionThe full version of Assetto Corsa game is epected to be released within the next 2-4 months, and the complete content will be available then
 That includes Multiplayer, Career mode and certain cars/tracks etc
 Till then you get updates every 14 days, which include bugfixes, new features or new content
 Until now Kunos stayed true to their word and kept the good things coming
 To me this a must-by for everybody who likes to play racings games on whatever system or plattform
 If you want the full time hard core simulation immersion - AC delivers just that, but if you just want to have fun driving or racing without a hassle, just pic a car, and AC delivers just that too
And while it certainly isn't perfect and unpolished in some areas, it is very stable and relativeley bugfree (2 crashes during 150+ hours of play)
 Of course there is much to be done, bugs to be fixed, Controller, grafic performance optimization, adding features like Multiplayer etc
 - but I really feel by now that Kunos deserves trust
I will update this review when and if essential features are added and the final version is released

If you are using a wheel, this is the best racing game made so far
 The physics feels great

Early Access Review
Maybe the saviour of PC sim racing
Don't get me wrong, there are other sims on the PC that are stunning in their own right, but Assetto Corsa might be the first in a long, long time that may be able to capture the hearts of the true sim racing crowd and the more casual racer/gamer
 And boy does the PC racing scene need a fresh boost like this
Talking of physics for a moment, I am not sure it's as all-conquering as some are saying, but that doesn't take away from the experience - the physics are still pretty darn impressive and right up there with the best on PC and destorys the consoles (as you would expect)
 One of the breakthrough aspects of the cars is how planted and solid they feel under the limit, which means those fresh to real sim racing will find it less frustrating to enjoy and "get it"
 But push any car to its limit and you'll quickly realize there is serious depth here
 I currently prefer AC to any other sim out there when i think of physics, fun factor, potential, and so on
The current car and track list--which is now coming in stages whilst in beta-- is drool worthy
 Ferrari F40, 458, BMW M3 GT2, Spa, Monza, Imola -
it just goes on and on, and all the tracks are laser scanned, too
 Some classics are missing, but with modding support and promises of DLC in the future, I can see many of these such as Sebring, Mid Ohio and Brands Hatch, coming in due course (along with many more tracks and cars)
The key now is to intoduce good community aspects into it's UI, and a multiplayer experience that pushes the boat - not just a bland server list where to be in the know you have to join fragmented leagues in multiple forums all over the world
 It should all be handled in the user interface
Assetto Corsa has the potential to bring a fragmented community together
 It has the graphics, physics and interface to change the face of sim racing on the PC
 Buy it and support Kunos, they seriously deserve it

After playing this game I drove to my friends house and was frustrated when it felt too arcade
Posted: 1 December, 2014
Early Access Review
Posted: 11 May, 2014
Early Access Review
*UPDATED to 
21*For me, one of the best racing sims out there
 definitely recomendable
 I will make a list of pros and cons (list for V0
94) so you can decide for yourself:Pros:-Best driving simulation I've ever tried, the car is so predictable that you can even go sideways playing with a mouse
 Dont get me wrong, you really NEED a wheel to enjoy this game
 Almost every car is easy to drive in your confort zone, try to go above it
to earn some tenths and it will become tricky before you lose the control of the car
-You get a bunch of cars (a bit of everything) and a few laser scanned circuits
 We are talking of the closest to reality models you can get on a game here
 More to come, the Green Hell as dlc in October I think-Mods (with dev tools soon *already released)
 mod apps (displays, corners performance,
),mod sound, mod tracks (one of high quality already, crappy ports too), and mod cars (soon* already released good ones: shelby cobra and gp2)
-Small and friendly dev team
 They ask, you answer, they give (list of wanted cars and traks) and you ask, they answer (if you have some problem)-Game modes: Im just here for the multiplayer but there is a lot of challenges, time atack mode, drift and drag mode too
 *multiplayer is enjoyable already, you have some jump in and drive servers and more serious onesNow the cons:-As early access: everything works in single player, the AI needs a bit of agresivity tuning, now avoids you an doesnt defend its position
 The devs have said to v1
0 there will be 2 sliders for strenth and agresivity
 Multiplayer have some lacks but it was
released this friday so it will be better for sure
- you dont have a massive list of cars like lets say Project Cars-As the time writing, is not possible to have another light source than the Sun, so no night races yet
 You can race from sunrise to sunset with dynamic time and stuff- Not weather yet- Car damage (visual and mechanic) is not implemented yet,
seeing the perfection of the grip simulation I'm sure it will be top-notch tho- *You will find some idiots on the multiplayer from time to time in open servers, but what multiplayer game doesnt have them
 (btw i've only seen one in 150h, the rest is just lack of experience)final thoughts:If you are still reading this, buy it, you wont regret it
Posted: 4 February, 2015
Best racing sim ever
- Fantastic GFX, reflections, smoke etc etc- Cars look amazing- Engine sounds that actually get under your skin- Superb G27 support- Native tripple screen support and track IR- All cars FEEL like actual cars- Great tracks- Well optimised (apart from the smoke ;))- Decent multiplayer track days and eventsI've been playing AC for a while and it has been my go-to game for that racing buzz on the G27
 No other game comes close in terms of making you feel that you are part of the car and giving you that racing buzz
My favorite racer for some time was GTR2, but it was getting a little old and tired in the looks department and it's feel
 I've got a ton of racing games on various platforms and it is safe to say that AC has the best feel hands down of any
Step into the legendary 98T lotus as an example, up the boost, watch the engine strain, hear the tyres screeth and feel your car squirm as the boost comes in and you fight to keep the car facing forwards on the track, whilst meanwhile that beast of an engine sound is giving you a rush
 Limit the boost to save the engine, fly into a corner too hot, try to take someone on the outside and up the boost again trying to outdrag them as you fly past and look to the left screen seeing the engine flashing red and them dropping back in your mirrors - you know you are pushing it hard and the engine won't last like that forever
Honest this game is a credit to the developers, and for anyone who thinks it doesn't have enough cars or tracks, this game is all about quality and not quantity
Now they have added the Yellowbird it is a fantastic addition
 Such a tailhappy fun beast of a car to drive and drift around in
You've got your sporty production cars, tail-happy beasts such as the mighty Cobra, and limited production cars / race cars
 All of the sounds are unique and the charteristics of each car make it a different game with each car you step into
Absolutely spot on, and worth it for anyone who is into their racing sims
It's worth noting that if you want to push the visuals on multi screen setups you do need a fairly hefty system though
 I am running an I7 4770k under water and two GTX 780TI AMP's
 I can max everything out apart from the hi-res mirror reflections and smoke needs to be turned down
 I would imagine for a single screen though that somehting like one 780 would be plenty
Posted: 19 August, 2014
Early Access Review
Let me be as frank, and honest as possible, this game is absolutely amazing, but there is a caveat
So I did not really play racing games/sims and one day I saw Grid Autosport, and it had a really fun look to it so I picked it up and with my XBOX controller, started having fun
The AI is terrible on that game, but in multiplayer with friends its a great time
I enjoyed it so much, I thought, have I missed out on one of the best genres of games
 So I picked up Assetto Corsa, and tried it out
It was fun in third person view with the controller, but as I read through forums, and spoke to others I was missing out
This is a SIMULATOR, a program DESIGNED to mimic real life driving and thus cannot be enjoyed fully with sticks and buttons, and that a wheel, no, a good wheel was going to improve my experience
Well, for my birthday, my wife got me the G27 wheel, and my goodness, this is where this game absolutely excels
There is nothing like it, I truly feel as though I am driving the car (to a point) and I LOVE IT
I tried Grid with the wheel, and its not bad, not bad at all, its the difference between Outrun and getting a day at a real racing track playing AC
There is also modding support, so if I want to drift one night, I have a some drift cars, want to drive F1, those are there, and the amount of tracks and cars provided by the community, are increasing daily
So
to sum it up, if you are looking for a game, this probably isnt for you, but if you are looking to have a real racing experience, this is where its at
Posted: 2 May, 2015
I Recommend this game
Awesome Features like:-No rewind-Stages last for more than 2 mins-You don't need to win to progress the career-Night driving-No more Kenblock-No more "HEY THAT ROCKED, POST THAT FOOTAGE ON YOUTUBE"-Really great physics, graphics and soundsThe best use of early access I have ever seen
 Thank you Codemasters <3

 Buy a decent steering wheel
 Discover a whole new level of respect for crazy men with mad talent driving ludicrously fast cars with no grip while someone yells numbers at them
10/10 - welcome back to rally, Codemasters

DiRT is BACKI have played every single DiRT game from 1 to 3 and Showdown
DiRT is one of my favorite racing series
Here are a few things you should know
Posted: 1 October, 2015
Early Access Review
Since the recent physics update i felt the need to re-write my review
This is quite literally the best racing game ever conceived
 I already held it in extremely high regard pre-0
8 and had taken plenty of time to master the game - And then boom
 A complete overhaul of the aero, tyre and suspension models
 Why
 Because the community said the handling didn't feel quite right
They decided to then cram some equipment into a van and drive all the way to Barcelona from the UK to get some more feedback from the real world RX drivers, to help pinpoint where improvements could be made
If this doesn't show some real dedication to the early access model and prove that they're actively striving to make this the best rally game ever made, i really don't know what could change your mind
DiRT Rally v0
8 has managed to become my favourite all time game - Taking the throne from my childhood SNES classics and there's still more to come
 I honestly can't find words to say how good the feeling of finding a perfect game and having a reliable stream of updates that just improve it further, really is
This deserves a perfect 10/10 and i'm sure by version 1
0 it will be damn close
Posted: 20 December, 2015
because of this game, I bough a ticket for a real life winter rally event
 this game is getting me to go outside
 this game is awesome
Posted: 27 October, 2015
+ No more Ken Block/X-Games/Gymkhana bull****
+ Early access done the right way
+ Lots of respect to rally history
+ Hard, unforgiving, enraging
 Rally as rally must be
+ Gravel handling is a thrill
+ Much better force feedback if compared to previous Codemasters' titles
+ Great, varied car roster
 Each car REALLY has its own behavior
+ Awesome feeling of reward, since learning is slow and gradual
 You'll definitely learn the fundamentals of rallying
+ Truly 3-dimensional stages, faithful to the real ones (comparison videos can be found on Youtube)
+ It's a "sim" and really asks for a wheel, but works great with an analog controller
– Stages get repetitive after some time (150-200 hours), since they are so few
 Rally eventually turns into hotlapping
– Tarmac handling still doesn't feel totally right
– Issues with downforce
 Cars are light and spend too much time on air
 This is a serious problem that must be addressed in their next rally game
– The faster you go, more noticeable are the physics limitations
 Especially in Finland, which sometimes seems to be another planet
– Damage system is OK but could be much better
Some serious cons, but still overwhelmed by the pros
 The most fun racing game of the last decade
 Addictive as crack

Posted: 8 July, 2015
This is my Early Access review after putting some considerable hours into the game, playing various game modes while keeping a close eye on the community, the devs and updates
I would like to point out unequivocally to any existing DiRT fans: this is NOT DiRT 4, or anything close to what most everyone would consider a "DiRT" game/title
 To be honest I'm not even sure why CM used the "DiRT" prefix at all, because there is literally no baring to that name except they are both rally games
There is no "loudness" or "bro yeah" in this game
 No convoluted menu's that take 30 minutes to decipher
 You are not forced to sit through tedious sound-bites of some jumped up prick telling you how to drive
 I'm getting carried away
 The point is this in not DiRT, this is something else
Many people have been calling for CodeMasters to go back to the glory days of rally games (MCrae) for years, and it seems they have not only listened at last, but delivered also
 It's a sim, it's tough, and by gawd does it scare you to death
I should probably give some Pro's 'n' Con's at this point:PROS: It's a Rally Sim
 Make a wrong move and your family will be placing flowers against a remote tree for years to come
 As it should be, it is tough
 Rally driving is the most demanding style of driving in the world, this is too
 Plenty of cars, each with individual sounds, handling and tuning
 They all feel different
 The SOUND
 No game has EVER come close to this
 The sound in this game is mind blowing
 From the individual engine sounds (you MUST hear them) to the gravel hitting your bodywork, to the perfect shifting, to the bad shifting
 EVERYTHING
 Menu's are sleek, to the point and very fast
CONS: Still favors wheels a LOT more over gamepads at present, although you can still compete with one (a gamepad) if determined
 This has been addressed
 Gamepads are now much more configurable
 There is a long standing problem with nVidia MOBILE graphics cards in that you cannot go Fullscreen
 Fixed
 There is a bug that if you do not have a certain amount of GB free space (2-4GB) on your system drive, the game will fail to launch
 TBH though everyone should have that at least
Even as Early Access this is still one of, if not the best racing game i've ever played and I have stated many times that "racing games are too easy, therefore i dislike them"
 With this game I have been well and truely slapped around the face
If you like sims I recommend, if you like rally racing I recommend, if you like a genuine challenge I recommend
If you like easy wins, easy AI, easy life and easy achievements - you lookin' at the wrong game
This is for the determined, for the persistent, for the fighter, for those that "quitting" is a cuss word
To those people i rate it: Highly RecommendedEDIT (Dec 2015): With many additions in terms of tracks and vehicles, FFB improvements, gamepad improvements, UI improvements and much more, I stand by my initial conclusion - this is one of, if not the best rally game ever made
 
Posted: 14 June, 2015
It's the DiRT game we've all been waiting forLet's get the most important detail out of the way immediately
THIS GAME HAS GROUP BYES
 IT HAS THE AUDI QUATTRO
NO THERE IS NO GYMKHANA AND KEN BLOCK IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUNDThat alone is reason enough to buy it
But there's more
 Stages are much longer, 4-10 minutes
Car tuning is much more in depth
 Varied weather of just about every condition
 Difficult tracks
 Great sounding cars
 Great graphics
 The only thing that could be improved is the damage modeling, which is very forgiving even on the hardest difficulty in certain situations
 I've never rolled the car and not been able to drive off
This is one early access game you should buy in to right away
 We've been starving for a proper rally game for years
 This is the best there has been since RBR
UPDATE 3/5/2016The game is out, and it's fantastic
 This is quite simply as good as rally games get

Hmmm
yet another indie horror game based on Asian ghost mythology graces Steam
 So how does this one compare to other recent efforts I've played
Well, right off the bat, I certainly found it more compelling than White Day
a game which I started sooner, but will clearly be finishing later
 (Fear not, a review will eventually surface; just as soon as I find the patience to waste more of my precious life hiding from that pesky janitor
) I'd also say it's much better than Nightfall: Escape, a tad better than Araya, and roughly on a par with The Coma: Cutting Class and the first DreadOut
So let's get this straight: I did like it
 A lot
 But I do have some reservations I'm going to share with you, just so you know what you're getting yourself in for
First up: load screens
 These were interminably long when the game was first released - around TWO MINUTES long
 - but the devs have at least addressed this problem quickly, and we're now down to less than a minute
 It's still an annoyingly long wait between deaths - especially when they're often the result of trial-and-error, and the frequency of saves ain't exactly generous - but at least YGGDRAZIL Group are swift on the customer service front
 (There were also huge optimisation problems on release that have thankfully been resolved, at least at my end; though others do still seem to be having issues)
Now onto some more full-on "design" flaws
 This is definitely one of those games that, while generally fine in the momentum stakes, has more than its fair share of bits where you don't know what it wants you to do next
 Now, there's an art to this

This game looks scary spooky because this game setting in thailand
 Not like the other game in the same genre
 You never see old cabin made from wood plus dogs howling
 And whatever you see in this game it's not a devil like the western horror game
 But this is real thai ghost from thai myth
 I guess you guys never seen anything like this before
 This is why so many people scared this game
About my Experience in this game so far i should said this is good game from Thailand dev
 It made from Unreal Engine 4 and they have done with the graphics for me graphics looks amazing
But actually this game have something to fix it about stuttering between gameplay
 this problem happen because some area in game has been changed in dynamic between you playing
 You will see this mechanic in the other game name "Layer Of Fear" But i didn't found any stuttering like Home Sweet homeI'm enjoy this game so far
 So let me say about verdict of this game
Props+ Story it looks great like you watching Thai horror movie
+ Graphics
+ Ambient is so great like you get in to Thai haunted house by yourself
+ Gameplay you just didn't hide or run but you have to solve the puzzle in sometimes
+ Real thai ghost from legend and myth
Cons- Still too short
 I plant beat time at 6 or 6
30hours But static from the other one said you will beat this game in 4
30 or 5 hours
- Stuttering from loading new area between gameplay
- Not everyone can enjoy after finished the game for the first time
For me this is another great indie horror game like outlast
 If you are horror game fans you should have this game in your library
 Or if you boring western ghost and find something new
 So i invite you too feel some thai ghosts
My score:8
5/10 [With 9
99USD] 7
8/10 [With above 9
99USD]And the last thing i came from thailand
 I hope this review can help you decide to buy or not
Thank you for reading

This game was really unique and had such intense, fun moments
Jumpscares as well as just atmospheric creepy moments keep you on the edge of your seat
I did feel like the constant having to sneak around to avoid stabby face girl got a bit repetetive and annoying like
 "REALLY
 AGAIN
" but led up to a fulfillying final fight with her
I had a lot of fun playing this in four hours but no other review mentioned that this is not a complete game
 as far as i know at least
 it was 4 hours of gameplay for $17 and they leave you on a climax of "TO BE CONTINUED ON EPISODE 2
"Not sure if that means an entire new game like a sequel for another price, or it'll be a free update in the future but there was no mention of this anywhere and left me feeling super dissapointed
If it's going to be continued in future DLC or free updates, I can justify the price tag but for 4 hours of content for $17 it's a little steep if you ask me
i did enjoy it, loved the graphics (although they do suffer from bad fps drops when loading new rooms in - even on the best of pcs) and will love to see whats next in this series
 i can only hope its free content, and if it is this will be worth the price and your time to play
Posted: 27 September
awesome game
 i played it and competed the game in 4 hours 30 mins
 lot of great jump scares, i literally jumped in my chair
I wish there were move scenes from the cabin area, was very spooky
i highly recommend this game, it's a top 5 for horror indie games
 I can't wait for next game from these guys,
Posted: 29 September
Really conflicted on this one
On one hand the first few hours were really enjoyable, great atmosphere, no cookie cutter asset monsters et al
 However after several hours of low frame-rate gameplay and extremely long loading sequences between deaths
 I can't recommend this game in it's current form
 After this game gets a bit more love from the devs in the form of optimization patches I would change my opinion
 Major gripe is the long loading sequence after each death
Edit:Also, for the ppl with no reading comprehension skills: https://imgur
com/a/CdsLn The devs talking about the issues I described
 Not just a problem with ppl's machines lol

First of all I am Thai
I bought this game to support the developer and for the sake of review
 When I started writting this review
 I haven't played through the game myself but spent hours watching casters on Youtube
 Which most of them are western gamers
 Because I really want to see their reaction and it turned out pretty positive
 However it's quite pre-mature to review the game that I haven't played but I am not here to give you guys a full review of the game
 Just try to add somethings to help people understand a bit about this game
Home Sweet Home is by far the best horror game that came from indie developer in Thailand and I hope to see more of this in the future
 The story is great at least to our standard
 On par with good Thai horror movies
 But the voice acting is a bit odd to me considering hearing both Thai and English which for me turned out to be that the English voice acting is better than Thai
 This game scared me and that's the reason why I haven't started playing it yet
 Yeah yeah I know what you think but I will start it soon though
Now it's time to talk about things that gamers from other countries may not understand or think that many things in the game don't make sense like why on earth that there're soda bottles with straw on the top of the closet or table
 Well, that's a form of worship
 As you can see that it usually set right next to a figure
 The figure could be anything that people believe
 One example is a figure of a tiny figure that represent kid
 Some people believe that soul from the kid that dies young could be trapped in these figures and they will protect you, your properties and also give you luck
 In return you have to take care of them like you would take care of any kids
 I know it sounds weird to some of you
So the game is pretty much all about ghosts and urban legends that will give you a glimpse of our culture and believes
 Like Preta is quite an amused name that I've never thought it would be called like this in English
 But Preta is basically a form of life after death
 Once you've done a really terrible things like killing your own parents
 Once you die
 You will become Preta which is a giant creature as tall as a palm tree and have big hands the size of palm tree leaf
 Preta also has a pin hole size mouth so it couldn't eat much or at all
** That small knife is a knife that has been consecrated to combat the ghosts and evils
 For example if one has been possessed by ghosts or evils
 Cut them with the knife will chase away those ghosts and evils
 When I say cut I mean small cut
** Dark magic and methods that use for making an oil called Nam Man Prai
 It made from a dead pregnant woman lymph and combine with coconut oil
 If you use that oil on a person
 That person will crazy in love with whoever use it
 But it comes with price
 If you couldn't control it
 You will lose your mind or die eventually
** If you guys are interested more about this Thai vodoo stuff
 The closest movie I could recommend is Bangkok Huanted
The developer is doing a pretty good job of putting all the small details that make this game much more intense and legit as a Thai horror
 It makes me feel like I'm really in a bad dream that will never ends
Congratulation
 you've just made a great horror game I loved and scared
I hope this will help many of you understand more about Home Sweet Home
 Stay alive and don't play it alone
===================================================================**Review is here
This is my take on the game
 After play through it
 The game left me want for more
 This is clearly an episodic title that will keep you engage for many months to come with more and more episodes
I will get to the point where the game shine
 Home Sweet Home will definitely keeps you on edge for pretty much most of the game
 You will have sometime to rest but not for long
 Story is very intriguing and please make sure you look everywhere in whatever level you are playing cuz you might have missed some clues that would tell you what has happened
Great level design, puzzle and clever boss fight
 Considering the price here at $9
99
 It's quite cheap for the game that will gives you 4 hours to play through and more if you explore for clues
Home Sweet Home will brings you a unique experience in horror genre by introducing you to dark magic, ghosts and beliefs in Thai culture
 Once you get to know Thai horror story you will love it especially if you are a horror fan
(**) when you see this sign it means I just added that to the review
Posted: 2 October
PROs+ horror that more than stupid jumpscare+ sound and music is very horrible + some point, the way to fight or avoid the ghost is very creativeCONs- this's just episode1, u need to buy more for continue
- explore,explore,explore,hide,hide,run,jumscare, then reapeat em all- same sound and music for whole game, very boring- most of point in this game come from thai culture and supernatural belief, foreigner may not understand some point of them - when play until the mid of game, u may bore about explore everything for key item, stealth for hide from ghost that walk like a turtle- many thing nonsense for main character- all character thai voice dub is very unrealistic and rustic
Posted: 8 October
I finished this game in 4 hours - a single run-through, so I might have missed a few things
I'd have to say though
 These guys, this Yggdrazil Group
 They may be new to the scene, but they've done a lot more than what some horror game developers can put out with several games
 Basically, I believe they've achieved nearly the same sensation as White Day, that cult favourite Korean horror game
Here are some good things about the game:- Length is about right for a S$17 (Singapore Dollars) game
 I finished it in 4 hours, and it's probably good for another run if I want to complete everything and find all the secrets
 I'm a little fast, so an average person might finish up in 5 hours, or twice that as a completionist
- Amazing, amazing background in Thai folklore and horror stories
- Awesome environment
 Creepier than when said other horror game developers tossed out a million demons and zombies at you
- It has actual gameplay
 I expected a walking simulator (with very basic puzzles and gameplay)
 With this game, there's a lot of stealth gameplay and puzzles
- And you'd have to use your brain when all you want to do is run and hide and cry like a baby
 It's pretty scary, and this is coming from a film/game/book horror enthusiast and writer
- How does the horror work
 Like a walking simulator, there are things are only look creepy and scary
 But unlike a walking simulator, there's actual danger that you have to avoid
 Now, combine this with the non-dangerous scaring things happening
 You'd start thinking that everything's dangerous
- There's some jumpscares, but not too much - this helps to set the mood
- In terms of story, I find it mysterious enough and yet not overly vacant of the necessary facts
- In terms of the characters, I actually found the antagonists (the ghosts) or interesting than the protagonists sometimes
 This is not a bad thing
- The graphics is very well done
 Very rich and authentic
 Some western developers could learn a thing or two from them
However, there are some problems:- I feel that the voice-acting needs a little improvement
 I played the English version, with English dialogues
 Both of the main characters are too exaggerated in their voice
 Guy's too manly and the girl too girly
 The former has too deep a voice and the latter has too high-pitched a voice
 Would be fine if that's how they are, but it's flaunted like it's the latest fashion
 It's not
- There were two antagonists, three if you count the one that appeared briefly at the end
 Everything else were just benign
 It gets repetitive at a few places
- I feel that the game didn't end quite as gracefully as I'd hoped
 The secondary main character gets dragged off and then
 The end
 :( Please wait for Episode 2
- Now, I don't mind that this is going to be episodic, but it should have been done the way the Telltale games or Little Nightmares done it
 Be upfront about it
 It comes as a shock if it's not done that way
All in all, I give it
 *drumroll* 8/10

Home Sweet Home is a really good Horror game
Home sweet home got tension, jumpscares, stressfull hiding and sneaking, puzzles, great visuals, awesome sounds, its cheap and its long
There will always be different opinions on mechanics and gameplay, but Home Sweet Home does it all really well, we will never get a "perfect" game anyways, cause we are all different
Home Sweet Home is as close to perfect in the horror genre as possible, i really enjoy the game, and its been a while since ive been scared and my adrenaline pumping
 10/10
If you like Horror games, this should be your first pick this year thats for sure
Heres some gameplay

I thought Dreadout would be the game I'd show to people, in order to best provide an example of horror games not based in America that go against the norm
 But lo and behold, this game comes crawling out of the woodwork and provides me a much more enticing example
 While there are a few frustrating elements to this game, it is a horror game first and foremost and it hones that craft remarkably well
The scares in this game (for the most part) always felt organic
 There were very few times where I felt that the tension I felt or the yelp I uttered was triggered by something "cheap", if that makes sense
 This game deserves major credit for how well it creates a terrifying and riveting atmosphere
 The main enemy was pretty freaky (although a bit dumb, thankfully), and even some of the additional enemies were foreboding and were entities that managed to freak me out on multiple occasions
The game looks and sounds very good, especially for a game that flew kind of under the radar
 The atmospheres felt appropriately lived-in when relevant, and the torn-up environments you typically found yourself in were adequately "torn-up-looking"
 And dear god the sounds heard in this game
 remarkable work and constantly kept me on the edge of my seat
My only major gripe with this game was some puzzles that just took way too long and seriously detracted from the pacing of Home Sweet Home
 I will fully admit I am not the best puzzle guy, but it was aggravating and felt unfair nonetheless
 So if you're comfortable with puzzles you may have a much easier time and this point may be null and void for you
TL;DR: Great horror game, awful puzzle game and terrible "ending"
 Come for scares, leave more shaken than you started

I Expect You To Die is an amazing game, except for its duration
 It has everyting you would expect from a polished VR game, from great voice acting and polished graphics to intresting levels and fun game mechanics
 I wish I could give this game a 'Yes' recommendation, but sadly the lack of content forces to to say no
 There are only a few short levels, and at 25 dollars Schell Games is asking too much
 The developer did respond to early critism by adding one additional level in September, but they would need to double the number of levels to make it worth the purchase
If this game drops in price, I will change to a yes
Posted: 25 April
I Expect You To Die has been on the Oculus Rift for a while now, but even though I bought it once there I've been waiting forever for it to come to the Vive so that I could play it more with native control support
 There are a lot of VR escape rooms out there, but even though IEYTD is intended as a seated game it's still my favorite by far
 It takes about 2 to 3 hours to complete it the first time (there are 4 levels), but each mission has a list of hints for bonus objectives you can try to find by playing around with the environments, and there's also a commentary mode unlocked after the end of the game
 It has a silly Bond theme that reminds me of No One Lives Forever, and the opening sequence is one of my favorite moments in VR so far
 You need this game if you're into escape games at all
Posted: 25 April
Really well produced game
 Great atmosphere, sound, narration, etc
However, I beat the game in 74 min, so I guess the game is very short and/or too easy
 I guess I can try to go back and do all the achievements, but to me the game feels over
For me, this is not enough to defend the price of this game
 It would be worth it at a 50-60% discount
Posted: 25 April
although very short, it is very well done, the graphics are great as is the interaction and comedy
 the best room escape ive played in vr
 my only complaint was it was too short but it is aesome that it is a fully finished and polished game unlike so many early access ones that they should never have been released
Posted: 25 October
Awesome game, realy good style and engaging puzzles
 Also the environment is really interactive
 There are achivements and multiple ways to finished the puzzles
BUT I played through this game in two hours and therfore I can not reccomend this game for 20 euros
Posted: 25 April
The Good:- The intro credit sequence is awesome- Nails the spy theme- Missions require a little bit of lateral thinking- Some parts of the missions have multiple solutions- Collectibles that encourage you to replay the missions in different ways- Extensive developer commentary that can be enabled after completing the game- Game does a good job making use of its mechanics and settingThe Bad:- Play time is pretty short (~2 hrs) if you're not trying to collect everything- Most of the puzzles are very easy- When you die you have to redo the entire mission- May cause motion sickness for some due to moving sequences in credits/final mission- Seated experience with "telekinesis" mechanism for interacting with far-away objects (bummer if you prefer room-scale)The Ugly:- One puzzle had some hidden items that were a little too cleverly hidden
 Spent a decent chunk of playtime trying to figure out the solution, only to end up looking for hints online---Overall, the game was a lot of fun to play despite some minor flaws
 I can't wait to watch my friends play it
 I am definitely going to do a second playthrough to listen to all the developer commentary (that alone makes the game worth it to me)
Posted: 27 April
This game is great
 It's the first VR game that gets it right, and probably the first 'must-have' VR game I've encountered
 If you've got the VIVE, get this as well
 Some might think it's short (I spent about 2-3 hours in it), but I wouldn't expect VR games to last for ages either way
Posted: 22 October
Really cool VR game
 A couple of more maps and its worth the price
Posted: 16 June
Excellent escape-the-room style game with production value and polish
 Features four spy-themed missions spread across four various environments
 Lot's of a fun, novel interactions, and satisfying puzzles that aren't too easy or hard
Posted: 28 August
I had a lot of fun with this; it was one of the more clever VR games I've played so far
Pros:+ Very satisfying interactions
 The game makes a very good use of the VR space
+ Can be played sitting down, which is nice if you're feeling tired or lazy+ Puzzles make you feel very cool when you figure them out+ Even after finishing the game, it's fun to go back and collect items or just mess around+ Genuinely funny, a good nod to the less serious Bond films, complete with Bond-esque opening creditsCons: - Very, very short
 There were only 4 levels, which I finished in the span of 3 hours, making it hard to justify the price
- Player scale made me feel like I was floating above my seat
Overall it's a very good game, and I'd love to see some more content added in the future
 Recommended despite the price just because it's so much fun

Early Access Review
Murderous Robots to shoot the arms off of
Check
Shoot from behind cover or go Full-Tank
 Check
Reload action that makes you feel like an action hero
 Check
Feeling of smugness after a particularly well-timed headshot or over-the-shoulder drone hit
 Oh, YES, check
Dual-wield pistols
 Check and check
Bounce back shots with sword that just stays on the legal side of being a lightsabre
Ping
Genuine terror as a broken robot jumps ONTO YOUR FACE

All the above in a VR experience so you're actually DOING it and not not just pushing buttons on a gamepad
All the above polished like a proper game and not just a VR tech demo
My friends grinning like loons after they've had a try, and immediately checking their bank accounts to work out how they can afford a Vive

Early Access Review
Raw Data is a pretty phenominal experience on the Vive
 The production quality is great and the action is intuitive and incredibly fun
 I strongly suggest you play it in a room with high ceilings
 I lunged up with my Katana to destroy a drone flying over my head, and smashed my ceiling light to pieces raining glass down upon me
 While that was very immersive and felt like the drone actually exploded to pieces on top of me, I wouldnt recommend it for others as it took a long time to clean up and pull the shards of glass out of my shoulders
 However yes, I felt likw a total badass for like 5 seconds until what I had done sank in
on me
 Awesome game though
Posted: 14 July, 2016
Early Access Review
The game has been out for about 9 hours and I spent about 8 hours playing it
 Thats after a days work too
 While I'm tempted to leave the review there as a "NUFF SAID" review, I'll go on to say the following
Its probably the most polished action game for the VIVE currently
 The controls are slick, the graphics are sweet and the atmosphere is ceirtainly present in the earlier darker levels
 As an early access title I do not regret buying and would reccomend to anyone who
 likes guns/swords/sci-fi
 likes to burn calories, and likes to soak their vive foam in films of their own sweat regularly
 serious though, if you were thinking about buying a gym membership, just buy this instead, you will have a more interesting engaging experience
 My arms ache, my legs ache and I have no regrets
 The nature of this game lends itself to moderate exhertion to play well, and if you game for long periods you WILL get fit, (more than likely without realising it) as a byproduct of being involved in this dance of death, ducking and dodging, spinning round to take on multiple enemies
 hell after some stages you realise you've wasted over 100 enemies
 But its not just the physical activity that will bring your heartrate up
 some of those robots are downright scary on first encounter
 The game does a good job on atmosphere
This will undoubtebly be one of my favourite VIVE games for a long time to come
 Unlockable skill grind, multiplayer, dual weilding pistols, swords, multiple hero classes
 I'm just a little gutted I have to sleep now, instead of continuing to play this game
10/10 would regret sleeping again

 This makes me feel like the future of gaming is HERE

Having played for a half hour it is clear that this is a much higher caliber than most the Vive games we have seen

Early Access Review
Amazing game
One of the best VR experiences I've had
It's not one of those games with a 1 hour campaign
 Very replayable as well
Supports VRWorks and thus runs very smoothly on my GTX 1070
Able to run "EPIC" settings
Raw Data is pretty much a tower defence game (a genre I love) in first person
The combat is fun and furious
The waves are scary
I have to play it on the lowest skill level at the moment
The game is a challenge and I like that

Early Access Review
Unlike many other VR games in Early Access
 This game is very polished and features interesting mechanics
 Though I just played the tutorials and the first mission as the Cyber Ninja Saija or whatever her name is
 It's extremely fun
 Throwing my katana and waving it infront of me frantically trying to slash some robots
 It is not just a standard wave based shooter
 You can teleport around and each character have different abilities to use
 My first impression is it is well worth the price point
 Will come back to play more and update the review

5 minutes into the first level I realized how out of shape I was

Early Access Review
So I bet a ton of you put off this game for as long as you could because it seems like a great 2 hour ride but not for the price
 I was just like you, I downloaded Gorn, Spell Fighter and more to try to convince myself I could get great experiences like this for a lower price
 First off the game is gorgeous, too gorgeous (you'll need a meaty GPU for this one, I currently run a GTX980)
 Second off it's not just a lazy wave shooter with bright colors, THIS GAME GOT ME BREATHING
 I was exhaling on my shots and between my dashes
 I say dashes because I think this game does a great job of implementing the "teleport" function and didn't break immersion for me too much
 What I liked the most was the friendly player base and how easy it is to hop into someone's game or point at a person with a funny name and ask them to join you
 I skipped all tutorials after the first because I had friends pointing me (literally) in the right direction the whole time
I'm almost mad that I'm willing to say this, but this game is actually worth the asking price, and I was skeptical at first
Posted: 17 October, 2016
Early Access Review
Yes, this is a early access title and I wouldn't normally recommend all users dive right in
 Yes, this is a wave shooter but it is actually a blast to play and it is polished unlike most others
 Do yourself a favor and buy it (especially being on sale right now)
 By far the most fun I've had with the VIve to date
 In it's current state there are two worlds (With 3 levels of difficulty
) out of five that are available to play
 I may be stating the obvious but don't expect an award winning story but everything from the production value to the graphics/sound/controls are right on point and those boss battles
 insane fun
 I can't wait to see what else the developers have in store for us
My number 1 want for this title, co-op
 Please bring it
 (Will update review as updates to the title are released
)(Be sure to check out our group Vive VR - http://steamcommunity
com/groups/HTCVIVEVR) 
Posted: 20 September
Yeah, it's a standing wave shooter, but it's one of the best out there
 The gameplay of the SS games is not too far off from what you have in a standing shooter anyways
 The skill was always in the shooting and prioritizing enemies, and that's still here and in a much bigger way
 Because you're stationary, the game is able to spawn the enemies into the levels in very cool pasterns and orders
 Also, the upgrades/abilities do add a lot to the chaos of the game
 Some of these levels would be impossible without the help of those abilities

Imagine you sitting in a desert
Suddenly there are 200 kamikazi running towards you
By coincidence you also have 2 gatling guns
This makes you feel like YOU are actually playing this game
It physically exhausts you
 It mentally exhausts you
 It makes you feel like Sam
 Seriously
I only stopped playing this because I had to charge my controllers
Serious/10 - Recommended buy
Posted: 25 November, 2016
Early Access Review
I've been playing Serious Sam games since 2001, getting to kill all these characters that I grew up with (33 years old now) in V
R
 is an awesome experience
 Initially I was a bit worried about the lack of content and the fact that it's a front facing only game (no 360 degree movement like Raw Data or Brookhaven Experiment), but honestly I think that is a big part of what keeps bringing me back to the game
 With V
R
 there are sometimes a lot of variables just to get into a game depending on your setup, so I've found the easier the game is to play, the more inclined I am to load it up and play a few rounds
 All you do really is stand in one area while enemies come at you, not much different from what you see in the trailers
except in V
R
 it's obviously a much better experience
 Visually this is one of the best Vive games out there, I would put it in the top 5 easily
 They have gone great work to make things crisp so you can aim at enemies in the distance and be even more horrified when they make it right up in your face
 Right now there are only 2 planets to play, each with 3 or 4 levels
 After you beat a level you go back to your spaceship where you use the money you earned to buy more guns, ammo and health
 If you die, you lose the weapons you bought but you still bring some of the money you earned from the last map
 They are still planning on adding at least 2 more planets
If you're an Onward player and have created a rifle mount, I recommend you try it out with Serious Sam V

 I've been turning people onto this idea for the past couple of weeks, but basically it helps aiming a lot and makes you better at conserving ammo
 Here is a video of my roommate where I was showing him the primary assault rifle, secondary double barrel shotgun

v=0ww9-tIH2Ak You can aim down the rifle sights perfectly and take out enemies from across the map, then use the shotgun for close range
 It's also pretty fun having a minigun/rocket launcher but you can figure out your own combos

Awesome game, and it gets very addicted on Hard/Serious difficulties with Perfect Runs
Already 25h in the game and need 2 more badges and 7 stars to beat it 100%
The Devs are very responsive, they answer within 24 hours, usually within few hours
Bought the bundle, SS:TFE was a blast also (beat it on Hard in 15h), next I will finish SS:TSE
I have like 100 bought VR games on Steam and another 100 on Oculus, but SS games are 1 of my favorites

Seriously fun
 Obnoxious small talk, big guns, loads of enemies, what's not to like
 This game sets itself apart from other stand and shoot games with its fast pace and dozens of enemies on screen at a time
 Levels where you are one a moving platform are great
 Bosses are huge
 Wildly fun and replayable with multiple difficulty levels and weapon options
Not a bad deal for early access, I saved more by getting it in a bundle

It's a wave shooter, like many Vive games, but this feels like exactly the way a wave shooter should
 I was a bit worried at how it would run at first as, even though I have a 980ti, VR is just so incredibly demanding
 However, in typical Croteam fasion, they have managed to pull off an engine which looks great (probably the best looking VR game I've seen so far) and runs so smoothly (even with HUGE amounts of enemies running at you at once) I've also gotten pretty fed up of early access games, with their slow and small updates (if at all) however with a fantastic team like Croteam you just know that will not be the case and I really look forward to the finished product
No bugs for me so farKeep up the good work guys

So far, so great
 Some first level attempts failed on normal, massive amount of enemies and you have to kill quickly
Further for me it is exhausting to keep the arms all the time up
Nevertheless i recommend Serious Sam - lots of weapons, gore and enemies
btw

Really, really enjoyed what I've played so far
 There's a level of polish here that I've been craving in VR since I bought it
 If you've grown tired of wave shooters, I'd still encourage you to give this one a go, as it sets the new gold standard for wave shooters

This would REALLY benefit from custom (handmade) Orbarrangements for songs like OSU has
Posted: 8 May, 2016
First of all:Audioshield is fun, yes
The first time you try it, you will giggle like a little kid, because it just feels great to smash the orbs with the beat in a what feels like a giant stadium
You will probably go through most of the "most popular songs" and will search for good tracks for audioshield ingame on soundcloud
BUT:After the first hype has worn off you will realise some flaws:The game should not be labeled as "finished", when it's clearly not
- friend system not working- therefore "recommend" feature not working- Dethrone feature not working properly-> "send notification to" doesnt let you enter anything, instead it randomly inserts your latest music searches- "my music" not working properly- totally unclear, what the taggable flags and graphs on the right side on the scoreboards are for- track length not shown beforehand when you select a song; could be 2 mins or 10 mins- scores not shown before you end a song; when you try a song you dont know if you might end up alone on the scoreboard- the ingame soundcloud search comes up with ~ 1/10 of what the result on a regular soundcloud search in your browser would beSo, do I reccomend Audioshield
Yes, I do
But if the Dev(s) stays silent, it will feel a lot like a missed opportunity
Right now Audioshield is a fun proof of concept, but NOT a finished game
Posted: 6 April, 2016
It's as awesome as Audiosurf, though this time you are standing IN the world generated by your music
You can punch notes flying at you with various types of shields, with increased difficulty notes will come from more extreme directions and with a much denser pattern of notes
 When the music gets more intense the stream of notes will actually come at you from a higher angle, making you fistpump in the air when the music gets awesome
WARNING: This game is exhaustive, playing too much comes with a risk of stamina increase

This is a drug for my brain, I zen out in a reality that doesn't exist then look and see an hour has gone by, I'm sweating and tired and out of breath
 This is, without a doubt, the number one reason to have a Vive
Posted: 25 November, 2016
As a workout, this game is great
 As a musical experience, if you have any sense of rhythm, it falls flat
 Your body will want to punch orbs on the beat, or on the off-beat, or at least on some logical division of a beat
 Instead the game throws orbs at you in formations that
 sort of correspond to the beat
 But not quite
 I tried a variety of instrumental songs with driving beats, which you'd think would work great, but the sloppy arrangement and randomly fluctuating speed of the orbs made it impossible to find a groove
I'm sympathetic to the technical challenges involved, but good beat detection has been possible for a while (see e
g
 Crypt of the NecroDancer)
 Whatever Audioshield is doing, it only seems to find the beat by accident
 Going by the reviews, plenty of people are okay with this, but I personally find it hard to recommend
Posted: 8 April, 2016
One of the best games available for VR
Posted: 30 June, 2016
This is a really great idea and I wish I could recommend it but I just can't, mainly because I'm a rhythm game junkie
Even the songs that aren't from my library or not on the internet radio that they play off of, the notes just aren't in sync
 If you're a rhythm game junkie like me and you like to have the notes totally in sync then you're not going to enjoy playing the songs with this
 The notes that come to you really just don't make sense, you basically just move your arms to the correct sides that you need to while listening to music in the background
Cool idea, cool graphics and it's not like it's not fun - it can be
 But for someone who is really into rhythm games and needs to be on the beat trying to get good scores
 it's just not worth getting into for me
Posted: 7 June, 2016
If you're on the fence about this game, get it
 The 2d videos don't do it justice at all
 Some songs are more synchronized to the gameplay than others, but even when it's not totally on the mark, it's still super fun
 Try having a friend act as DJ on the PC while you're in VR
That said, it could use a few updates
 The GUI could use a little polish, the local search doesn't often pull up the file results, and we could use some more different shields and maps
Overall, this game is a blast and a workout
 Highly recommended
Tip: You can turn on audio mirroring to hear it on both the headset and PC by going to SteamVR > Settings > Audio > Mirror Audio to Device
Posted: 5 April, 2016
I am terrible at rhythm games and generally dislike playing them
 This game, however, is amazing
 It doesn't take long to get absorbed in playing the game
 When a spectator starts laughing because you are dancing to the music you just think: "whatever I'm in VR and can't see you" and continue on

I'm 39 years old, and have been playing FPS games since the original Wolfenstein
Onward is the next step in the evolution of FPS games
I can't even describe it
Players all seem to care about each other, and they will try to revive, cover you, and show you the ropes
The learning curve is a bit steep at first, but after 3 or 4 rounds, you'll be good to go
Things keep happening in game that I've never experienced in a game
This one round I ran out to revive someone who got shot, and I got all shot up
I was already on my knees trying to revive him when they shot me
I fell over on purpose like I was dead, (basically just laid down on my floor and stopped moving
I was still alive, but playing dead
It totally worked, and they moved on thinking I was dead
There's no kill cams, no display saying if you killed them or not, so he thought he had me
I waited while even my team was saying "he's down
"
haha
Then I started army crawling behind a vehicle so I could give myself a shot
I got two kills because the enemy thought I was dead
 Everyone was laughing hysterically because my acting was so good
Another round I was down on my knees aiming over a rock and someone started shooting at me
I had to actually lay down on my back while tracer rounds were flying overhead
Adrenaline flowing in this game
 DO NOT HESITATE to get this game if you like FPS games

All I've really got to say is, "Holy sh*t"
 I've never experienced a video game as immersive as this
 In fact, I haven't experienced anything as immersive as this
 Let me tell you why
Pros:-The communication is perfect
 The local chat feels natural and using the radio is just how you would in real life
 -The locomotion is wonderful
 No motion sickness and I feel very comfortable moving around the maps
-sounds are just spot on
 The sound of a bullet nearly missing you is enough to make you drop to the ground in real life
 It's VERY VERY loud
-The chestrig and overall interaction is very polished
 Holding the gun, even without a gun mount is simple
 Reloading is realistic and easy
 A lot easier than in H3VR
-The maps looks incredible, and you feel like you're actually "there"
 Its hard to describe and I really see myself losing hundreds of hours into this
 That's a first for a vr game
Cons:-The UI is a bit glitchy and ugly
-The radio can glitch out sometimes
-There is a bit of stutter sometimes based on your network speed
 Not very often, and it doesn't tremendously affect gameplay
All of the cons are very easily over-looked considering it's an early access game
 The biggest con though has to be you'll very likely sh*t your pant and/or hurt yourself diving for cover
 I chose to play this over Battlefield 1
 This is easily my new favorite game of all time
EDIT 8/31/16:I added an experience I had just tonight
 This is an amazing game:There I was, last alive on my team, pinned down in a second story of a building
 I've exhausted all of my ammo
 I tossed a grenade but it was a worthless cause
"Come out with your hands up
" a voice shouts from below
I have no choice
 I shout back, "alright alright, hands are in the air, watch your fire
"I put my hands up and slowly walk outside
 I'm greeted cautously with a gun

there is a major problem with this game but it will only affect people like me
 3 words "cross eye dominant"it means people like me are ether right or left handed but have the opposite eye as the dominant eye and prefer to see from that eye, meaning we have to pick left handed even though we are right handed and vice versa in order to aim properly with all of the weapons
 the thing is that choseing lefthanded means that ALL of the controls and iteams are layed out for, you guessed it, left handed people
 this makes the game incredibly annoying
if the develpers read this can you please find a way to fix this, i injoyed the game and i dont think that people like me should have this massive disadvantage becuse of something we were born with

It's about 95% impossible to get a knife kill and I finally did it
 I shot a guy and he was on the ground and we talked for maybe 2 minutes and he was saying stuff like "guys he is over here
" and "my friends will shoot you if you come near my body
"
"Why don't you come and shoot me in the head" and so I walked up to him looked down at his crippled body, laughed, and said "You know, I never gotten a knife kill before" and he started screaming "NO NO DON'T YOU DARE
 NO JUST SHOOT ME
 DONT YOU DARE KNIFE ME
" and I kneeled down beside him and took out my knife and look at it as he continued to scream
 Then I did an evil laugh and stabbed him in the head

Alright
 So
 For the first few days I was kinda upset I bought this
Posted: 28 June, 2015
First off, I've had iRacing for years now, and I was one of those in the early days of owning it to blow my load on all of the content, so I do know where I am coming from here
I vote no, the price is NOT justified, it's actually a WORSE physics experience than Assetto Corsa for a start, but lets give a full list of the reasons why I would NOT recommend this game
1
 The Physics : Whilst they are more realistic than most of the games people are used to this can barely be called simulation, whilst things have improved and continue to improve, the game lacks fundamental tire model elements that would define this title as a simulation
 Fundamentally the iRacing engine is based off the Nascar Racing 2003 game engine, which in turn was based off the Grand Prix Legends engine of 1997
 So in a nut shell this core engine is almost 20 years old
 The company themselves and most definitely the players and community like to believe the simulation models tire wear which it doesn't, all it models is that an overheated tyre is a slippy tire so basically one or two sideways moments in a lap, requires potentially 5 corners afterwards on knife-edge oversteer to let the tires cool down again [exactly the same game engine tyre properties that were there on GPL] - which in real life just isn't the case and if you're used to real life racing physics and simulation you will be fighting the car on corner entry as braking and turning on iRacing seems to overwhelm the game engine and generally send you into a low speed spin, again something that wouldn't happen in real life
 Despite these short-falls they are more interested in variable weather conditions than fixing the core issues of the game engine
2
 The Price : Under no circumstance is the price of this title acceptable
 Not only does it require monthly subscription but also the purchase of tracks and cars
 Enjoy racing the skip barber on the North American circuits
 Well next time they release a new track you can be it will be on the skip schedule almost forcing you to buy it
 You don't 'purchase what you want/can' you end up being forced to make purchases whilst being given the impression it was the customers choice
 300$ plus change for all of the content
 For a game
 You'd expect such a price for a high end commercial simulator, but it's not, it's a nigh on 20year old game essentially and for this, it's a joke
The tracks are the service's most acclaimed piece, but realistically they botch their laser scans, the Monza oval for instance is in no way in a scanable condition, so they have essentially just created a track on the fly, not to mention the 'tech tracks'
 Lets not forget, iRacing aren't the only ones who laser scan tracks now, do Assetto Corsa charge extortionate amounts because they laser scan their tracks
 And IMO do a better job of it
 You can get just the same enjoyment at a tenth of the price with Assetto Corsa, or even rFactor 2 if you find a private LEAGUE to race in, rather than just trying to join some public server full of wreckers and then complain about the community of that game
 Anyone who tries justify the price I garentee has most, if not ALL of the content and feels that natural urge to protect their investment [I mean nobody wants to feel like an idiot for spending 300$ on a video game do they
] which brings me on to point 3 
3
 The cult : After spending so much money on iRacing for all of the necessary content people in the community then have this natural defense mechanism on their 'investment' and will defend iRacing on all levels unjustly, refusing to listen to logical critique and hyperpraising things such as the tracks [one of the things they love to do is pretend that iRacing models tire wear, which it definitely does not]
tl;dr you pay 300$+ to get the less overall enjoyment with substandard physics than you would in a private rFactor 2 or Assetto Corsa league with
 Do not confuse immersion with simulation guys
 Shiney tracks and a decent public service still do not justify the price
Posted: 19 July
I cringe everytime I think about how much money I spent on iRenting
 Over $600 and I still don't own a thing
 That much money and I rent less than a third of all the cars and tracks available
 Their business model is a ripoff
 Unless you subcribe every month, you have access to nothing
 Even though I spent over $600, I can't play unless I subscribe
 I can't even do hot laps with the cars and tracks I paid for
 Hopefully their archaic business model with fade away with newer titles released on the market
 As they lose subscribers they'll increase their price (which they already have) and the people with more money than sense will keep them in business
 Honestly, if I can't play with the stuff I paid for, I'd like my money back
Posted: 10 June
if you are considering getting this game first of all you need to ask yourself - how much disposable income do you have, because games such as Assetto Corsa, Project Cars and rFactor 2 are technically better value for money
 but this game has something that those games lack, a genuine online career mode
for example in Assetto Corsa you can drive a modern Ferrari F1 car (if you get the Red Pack DLC) straight away online, even if you are very new to it and cause an accident because there is no penalty
 in iRacing you have to earn the right to race an F1 car online, there are multiple career paths, whether you are into oval racing (Nascar/IndyCar), Circuit racing (Touring cars, open wheel cars, endurance cars) and even recently Dirt Oval racing of various classes (with Rally Cross coming later in the year)
 is this 'game' punishing
 yes, is it expensive
 depending on your tastes, very
 is it worth it
 i have to say yes
 it isnt perfect, but i love it, and i recommend you give it a chance
Posted: 17 January, 2015
Honestly the only real competitive racing sim out there
 It has it's downsides, like being too expensive, but you really get what you pay for
If you just want to hotlap some cars and try stuff out, play with your friends on the weekend, there are better options
But if you want to truly compete and feel like you are progressing your career as a "virtual race car driver" this is the one and only game you could play
Posted: 8 August, 2015
Best online driving by far but once you realize you can only do 1 track/race without starting on your first of many many many many purchases that you need to buy to progress in any way shape or form,
basically the game costs about £1000 to buy all the content,
you can't earn it you can't progress to it you must buy,
From a game that charges a monthly fee
,
it is the biggest con i have ever seen
Please don't bother with this
We should never encourage blatant extortion
The people behind this game are the most greediest individuals the world has ever seen and should never be encouraged,
also the fact they don't make it clear that your monthly fee will only let you do 1 track that they pick at a time
Is nothing short of criminal
Fact is they know its a con that's why its not made clear when you first subscribe that your goanna have to pay pay pay to do anything worthwhile,
total con
shame on you for taking advantage
Posted: 22 January, 2015
Motorsport isn't for everyone, when i was younger i only liked fast cars because i thought they were sexy
Now after years of watching various Motorsport series' and Sim Racing along the way my perspective has changed
 iRacing requires a change of perspective, you cannot come in as a fan of race cars and expect excitment
You have to be a fan- no, a follower of Motorsport
 Someone who holds that passion at heart for Great racing
 The more you love Motorsport the better iRacing will fit into your life and becomes a Hobby that trandsend general gaming in terms of long term enjoyment
In the beginning for me the buisness model was very odd, after buying stuff like rFactor, Race07-Evo etc then playing those over time it was the weirdest thing to pop up and i was one of the decenters
 "WTF is this- etc" Then after a few months things became shockingly clear, rFactor, Race07 etc weren't updated
 iRacing was
Simply as that my mind changed as i realized they were in it for the long haul, every season iRacers get an update, Big or small it either adds content after months of development or more functionality with tweaks etc
 Every $ i've spent in iRacing has been worth it, over the years we got pieces of content bit by bit and with so much more to come the list is getting bigger
 To look at iRacing now with fresh eyes the money added up must be daunting, for me i waited impatiently for months and years in some cases for a Track/ Car to the point that the $12 i payed for them over the course of months was nothing
 Anyway
 iRacing at its core is a Motorsport Simulator, so excitment comes in spikes just like watching F1 these days
The first few laps are crazy and exciting then things settle down a bit with some sparatic fighting with a decent climax at the end
When you are the one in the car this dynamic is the same but there is an added challenge, getting er done
You're responsable for the outcome of your race, if you make a mistake you suffer the consiquences, if you're slow it's up to you to learn more and improve
Everything is up to and on you
As a result overall it's a fantastic challenge, to start from the very bottom and make your way up that ladder, from fighting scrubs to meeting people on your level then above
 Over time iRacing becomes less and less of a gaming dynamic and more of a forum for personal improvement
Either way in the end as a fan of motorsport, facing the same challenge as the drivers i watch on track has added a fantastic dynamic to my life
 To watch F1 then run a race with 35 people from all over the world at the very top is superb
Challenging, Exciting and Fulfilling

"Internet racing is a fun, easy, and inexpensive way for race fans, simracers and gamers alike to enjoy the thrill of the racetrack " - This is iRacings description of their game
I'm going to break it down
 Fun: YES
 The level of courtesy and professionalism of drivers in this community is unparalelled
It makes for very fun, competitive, and thrilling racing
Even in the Rookie leagues, the number of drivers that care about the safety rating system is absolutely untouchable by any internet racing community
AC is good, but not this good
Inexpensive: ABSOLUTELY NOT
Talk about a money pit
It's not only a monthly/yearly subscription, it's also a LITERAL F*CKTON OF DLC
Once you have ascended from the Rookie ranks in this game, the cost increases dramatically
As of yesterday, the total for all content in Rookie Class and Class D is $580
61 (including a $193
54 multi-purchase discount)
Class A, B, and C continue to add to the DLC money pit, but I'm going to skip the calculation
Granted, there are a few cars and a few tracks that come with the subscription
However, the price of each track or car is between $12 and $15
For instance, the 2007 version of Daytona Intl Speedway is included with subscription, but the 2011(
) version is not
 Nurbergring Nordschleife and the Grand Prix Strecke are separate $15 purchases
But remember, it's only $99
99/yr, which is more than some racing sims without subscription fees and all DLC combined
For that amount of money, they better have something better than the terribly clunky and slow web UI they currently implement (Read: it launches sessions from a website and it's terrible sometimes)
The fact it's based on a game from 2003, which has been continuously modified, doesn't justify the cost of building models and the level of physics/particles
 Also, if you want to race against your friends - for fun - you need to rent server time from them, or just hope you get matched in the same race
Absolutely no fun for those who want to race with friends
Easy:
No
Just no
Winning is not easy
Driving is not easy
Proper car setup (not done in Rookie class) is not easy
The tracks and drivers are challenging
VERY challenging
With that challenge comes reward, if you do well
Race fan, Sim racer, and Gamer alike:
I don't recommend playing this game with anything but a proper racing wheel
Not for the gamer who just wants to create spectacular crashes
This game is for the serious racers and the community reflects that
If you're into just watching, they have a youtube channel that broadcasts the races, and they could really use some of those sale profits to increase production quality there
It sounds like 12-15 y/o kids trying to sound like overly professional and dry race announcers - except one is in the studio and the other is voice chatting over skype
You watch the races from the same cameras and jerkyness that comes from the instant replay cameras that you get in game (like a single person is just operating it to watch the race)
They desparately need someone who has worked in broadcast to help ramp up the production value
Words cannot describe how terribly boring and unprofessional these really are
Overall:
2/5
The community and safety rating system are the only things holding this game together, imho
Besides them just now (March 2016) updating to DX11, the cost of DLC, terrible web interface/sever load, being based on a game from 2003, bad broadcast production quality, inablity to race with friends, and subscription costs are enough for me to hate the game
I got a yearly subscription on sale for $30-something, will not buy any DLC due to cost, and own a racing wheel
The only reason I ever come back is to race with people who aren't starting wrecks like bored children
Edit: Added costs
 Emphasized sh*tty server load/webUI
 Added comments on (not) playing with friends
Lowered overall score
I also recently purchased an HTC Vive - it seems that iRacing has completely removed their VR support (even oculus), so that is yet another deal breaker for me
Technically no racing sim supports the Vive, but that's not to say I don't have some of them working
Edit 2: They've finally re-enabled VR support
For Oculus
There are many trying to get it work on the Vive with ReVive injector, to no avail
For those wondering: Assetto Corsa (with ReVive), Live for Speed (native), and Project Cars (native) are all working with the Vive at this point
All are much cheaper ways to race
Edit 3: (late) Now with Vive support
Looks great, is very optimized, and is even fun
Still, after forgetting to cancel my subscription, I'm currently trying to justify the $99 I just spent -- I just can't
Posted: 15 January, 2015
So, it's not often I'm wrong, but I have to admit how wrong I was
After giving the game another 5 or so hours under the tutelage of a veteran player who showed me the ropes, its quite honestly a marvel of a game
 Thats not to say there arent some issues, as there are, like a dated graphics engine, in game purchases for expanding tracks and drivable vehicles as well as having a limited pool of cars to drive
 But all in all, an excellent Simulation that doesn't pretend to be anything its not
 You just have to give it some time and love and it will give back
50 hours in: Had a number of issues purchasing iRacing content through Steam
 iRacing support very helpful
 Steam support completely lackluster
 Been running the Global Challenge series in the Cadillac
 Looking at working back through the Skip Barber series and on up to the Star Mazda series
 Also, to get the most from this game, you "have" to use a steering wheel and pedals
 Controllers just dont cut it
Original review included for posterity, "Pretty average game
 Confusing web interface that keeps asking for steam approval
 Waste of $39
"
Posted: 10 March
iRacing is undoubtably a decent sim, but it is a cash cow for the developers
 I believe that the monthly subscription cost is overpriced
 Not only that,
then you have to pay for subsequent cars and tracks as well which for me kills it stone dead
 Buy this sim only if you've got money to burn
 There are plenty of other sims out there, all with equally decent aspects that don't rip you off, so go for one of those instead

After a very long wait iRacing is finally on Steam and im very happy especially them giving out keys to existing members
This game is subscription based which I don't mind by having a subscription it shows that the members are serious about sim racing I normally do my subscription for one year when they have there subscription's on special
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=400282537Content - you do start out with some cars and tracks i personally can't remember what you start with its been so long but iRacing has uploaded some pictures on the store page of what you get, is the content expensive yes it can be if you buy all the content like me, but if you buy only what you like it's not so bad, but keep in mind all tracks are laser scanned so from every bump right up to every building is modeled into iRacings tracks, this also goes for the cars they take hundreds and thousands of photos video and sounds to bring cars too life
I have been a member for over two years and easily have over 1000 hours of driving time plus I own every piece of iracing content all cars all tracks and this includes tech tracks
I won't sugar coat it this game takes a very high level of driving skill and great deal of time to master it's not easy especially someone who is coming from an arcade game this game is pure simulation
I used to use iRacing for practice when I had my real race car and iRacing was good place to practice, Now I no longer race in real life I still play iRacing its great challenge with a great large community
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=400288772I personally recommend using a wheel and pedal set to play iRacing but you can use it with keyboard or game pad etc I personally find it near impossible with keyboard and you can achieve good results with game pad with practice
The racing is as close to real life as possible and some times your lucky enough to brush door panels with real famous race car drives, there is a full licence structure and also system to report deliberate rammers if you find one, in two years of play I have had three rammers
You can personalise your cars to make them who you are and using Trading paints you can upload custom paint jobs for example maybe upload replica of your favorite race car or create your own in Gimp or photoshop or use pre made ones on Trading paints or use there in house paint system possibilities are endless
Car setups are highly detailed and represent their real life counter parts this takes time and practice to learn sometimes the smallest adjustment can have great change, but if your unsure about setups when starting in rookie you can visit the forum and grab a pre made setup from a fellow raceror use iRacing pre made setups
or race in fixed setup race's
I recommend this game only if your into full simulation racing but I think iRacing should offer one month free so people can try before they buyhttp://steamcommunity

I have never gotten into this franchise but my wife asked if this was available for Vr a few weeks ago
 I just saw it pop up on the Vive Subreddit (great community there btw) and purchased it to suprise her
 So far
she hasn't had a turn
 Obviously
I had to test it first
 It was much more fun playing than I ever thought it would have been
 Not sure if it has to do with VR but I had a blast
 Then I discovered the Arcade mode
thats even better
 I hear that the devs are going to put additional features, some new to the franchise for VR and that might add some additional value for the veterns
 It runs great as well (using gtx 970)
 Be carefull though, I just broke my first wrist strap on my ceiling fan
 Edited because I before E except after C
thanks phxrockerUpdate 8/4/2016: They just released a Survival mode and it so much fun
 It is pretty hard as well
 This is very different from any other version of Fruit Ninja and these little Helecopter baskets with a mounted cannon shoot fruit at you
 Eventually, if you survive, more and more show up
 The fun is when the bombs start shooting at you as well
 Those you have to duck and dodge
 Really fun and so worth the price

100% as advertised
You put your headset on, slash fruit, and fun comes out
And depending on how hard you slash your fruit, sometimes sweat comes out too
Sometimes you break your monitor
Whatever
You don't need it anymore anyway
You can't slash fruit on it

Full Review: http://uploadvr
com/fruit-ninja-vr-htc-vive-early-access-review/Summary:While Fruit Ninja VR is incredibly addicting, easy to jump into for newcomers, and tons of fun to play in its own right, it does feel a bit shallow in its current state
 You can expect it to grow significantly over time considering it already has a strong foundation
 Halfbrick Studios have proven that Fruit Ninja VR is the prime example of how to take a simple concept and adapt it to the uniquely immersive medium of virtual reality
Pros:- Incredibly addicting- Fun, varied game modes- New mechanics like stabbing- Bright and colorful visualsCons:- Feels a bit shallow on content- Sometimes the physics feel offFinal Score: 8/10 - GREATNote: UploadVR uses multiple Steam accounts across multiple editors and locations
 Hours logged do not necessarily reflect all time spent in the game

Fifteen credits is murder
 Murder
 Hear me out, peanut gallery
 It was fun
 It was colorful
 It looked good
 It has item drops and achievements
 Wooo
 Yet
 it's too simple and shallow a product to be worth the price
 10 bucks would be alright, but it seems your charging the extra 5 because of name recognition, and trying to farm impulse buys
 Also, we only get one (standing) environment
 What
 Nice dojo and all, but just one environment
 There are differant modes, but its all really the same
 You stand, and you hit incoming projectiles, bfd
 There are games where you are, like, a goalie blocking soccer balls, and it's essentially the same thing
 At this point in the review, I feel compelled to state that there is a free and fun 'Fruit Slicer' clone of this on itch

 That one has multiple levels

Fruit Ninja in VR
Remember Fruit Ninja Kinect
 It was difficult to see where your cuts go on a 2D screen
 Besides, you are only cutting fruits on a 2D plane
Fruit Ninja VR is another interesting take in the series
 This is the closest thing to cutting fruits for real
Both controllers are swords, but you can use one and leave the other on the floor or on a table
 It feels more badass to wield a sword two handed
I wish they add all the modes in FN Kinect to FN VR

I really like this game and I have barely scratched the surface
 I was told that aiming with the guns was bad, so I almost didn't buy it
Its true the aiming is bad, because your character is an ULTRA NOOB
Get a few levels, upgrade your weapons and get some accuracy implants, and the aiming is good
Its bad at first intentionally :D
9/10 so far I will update my opinion once I've played it longer
ALSO, I giant thank you for allowing us to just move via the touch pad
I don't mine teleport as an option, as sometimes it is fun to use in combat, but there are way too many games that wont let you move forward with the touchpad
 bravo it works well in this game

Dead Effect 2 and the Doom 3 VR conversion are perfect examples that when implemented and converted well, excellent VR games do NOT need to be built from the ground up
 This game is an actual full game and not a crappy escape the room or wave shooter that plages the VR landscape
 To all the
devs out there, follow this games example
Posted: 8 June
Early Access Review
A must buy for fans of Doom 3bfg in fact a must buy for those who want an FPS with a story, great graphics (VR wise), plenty of guns, touchpad movement, missions and a proper game in VR
So game runs great on a 1080gtx on high settings with bloom on low, looks great in VR
 There are
plenty of
variety
of enemies and weapons with a upgrade RPG type inventory system
 The missions vary and there are puzzles to work out to gst some missions finished
The NPCs are well done and I spend quite a while having firefights with soldiers so it's not all zombies you are against
 Obviously the soldiers are
smarter and it
can be quite a battle
So after playing for a little while have to say it's been
one of the best experiences I have had so far in VR
 It's just so much fun and I would say a must buy for all those who want FPS in VR
Nice work just what I have been waiting for
Edit: 10-6-17Now 4 hours in and it just get's better, for me it's a top 5 VR game and the most addictive one I have come across yet
 If you're on the fence about this game, don't be it's well worth the price

 *FULL and COMPLETE FREE ROAM GAME, with top notch graphics

 EVERY movement mode available, 3
 VERY detailed LOOT systems (think boarderlands) and 4
a AAA titles worth of content and length
 options for compfort and customization is insane
you can even move and resize the freaken grab zones on your avatar so you always grab the right weapon when you need it no matter what freakishly gangly or gargantuon shape you happen to have been spewed forth from your mother after her booze and barbiturate binges 9 months previosly

The second best VR campaign I've played next to Arizona sunshine
 I was really sceptical on this one because it looks kind of generic but the level of motion control interaction in the game really takes this to the next level
 I really wish more games would include options like dead effect 2 because one of my favorite things to do in vr is reload
 They make it an option to manually reload or if you have a harder time with FPS, or just dont like the tedium you can turn on automatic reloading
 It also allows you to slide and teleport without going into settings
 It's the only time I've used the two styles of locomotion side by side and it felt so natural
 This game probably isn't for everybody, but it has some great RPG elements and the VR implementation is amazing
Posted: 16 August
Early Access Review
This is one of the best VR games I've played so far
 It's a genuinely full length game, not a 2 hour tech demo or garbage indie game like so many others
 The story is your standard FPS storyline, nothing terribly exciting there but it works
 It is not purely a zombie shooter despite what the screenshots may suggest, it's a straight sci-fi shooter that just happens to contain some genetically engineered zombies in addition to more normal enemies
 There are plenty of options for controls and all seem to work well
 It has true free move, free move with fixed rotation, teleporting and some other options I didn't try
 All the weapons are intuitive to use and play well
 Additionally, the early access issues with grenades have been fixed, they behave exactly as you'd expect now
 And the weapon variety is impressive
 It has sniper rifles, machine guns, swords, axes, grenade launchers, bows, throwing stars and so much more
 All of them are viable
Overall, I think this is a must have VR shooter
 It is a true full length game, plays well and looks good
 There aren't too many options in VR that meet all three criteria
 Oh, and it is definately not a wave shooter or a cover based shooter like some of the other reviews claim
 You can certainly take cover and wait for all the enemies in the area to come to you, but one can do that in any shooter

Early Access Review
Truly an impressive Action RPG Survival First Person Shooter, personally I think its even better than Doom 3 BFG Edition in VR thanks to the lovely graphics, the RPG elements and the huge variety of weapons - and of course the story line
 I made a first gameplay video of the first 30 minutes into the game, that hopefully can help you make up your own mind:https://www
youtube
com/watch
v=aYwm6FAAmfMGraphics and the environments are just amazing, detailed and the built-in SuperSampling (in game options) really makes the game sharp in VR as well
 There are loads of graphics options/settings you can customize for your PC and your needs, and you can really crank it up to max
 I could play it without any problems on Extreme quality on my GTX 1080 Ti, but while recording (the above video) some gameplay I had to lower some of the settings due to my capture software being quite demanding (OBS)
The locomotion in the game is great, you can have both free movement with touchpad on your left Vive controller, and at the same time you can teleport with your right Vive controller touchpad - just perfect when you prefer free locomotion- but need to teleport away fast as possible in the middle of the intense action
Sound effects are stunning as well as the music in the background, really top notch and it gives me a triple AAA-feeling
The story mode is quite immersive and interesting, and fully narrative throughout every chapter
 Good voice acting and the characters are very detailed graphic-wise
I really look forward to see multiplayer getting added into this VR release, and Im so happy that another great game has got native VR support
 This game is a blast, and if you enjoyed Doom 3 BFG in VR, you will deinitely love Dead Effect 2 VR even more
Note: I bought the game by myself on june 9, right after watching the trailer and the screenshots, as it looked so promising
 So I did not get it for free if you wonder
 My feedback above is based on my personal first experience playing Dead Effect 2 VR on HTC Vive
CheersSweViver

I can't recommend this game highly enough
 I have a rift CV1
 One of the few VR games I've tried that I would probably enjoy almost as much even if it wasn't in VR (ie its a good GAME, not just 'experience')
 The addition (in a recent patch) of full locomotion is key
 I wouldn't be raving about this game nearly as much with teleport-only movement
This game reminds me of a cross between Doom 3 and classic Doom combined with a little Deus-Ex style augmentation and abilities
 The duel-grip-aim assault rfles are awesome and it really makes you feel like you're in the action
 Drawing and releasing the bow+arrows is slick and satisfying (though sadly there's no gravity drop as far as I can tell)
 Killing zombies and various other monsters is gruesome and satisfying as well
 If you don't want a bloody game, don't get this one
 On the other hand if you (like me) enjoy more mature games you'll definitely appreciate all the gory details
There's a lot of gameplay packed in this as well, unlike most VR games
 I'm only a few missions into the campaign, but in addition to the story mode, there are wave modes, 'generic missions', and some other options
 Theres plenty of loot upgrades and such that is pretty nice, IMO
 The game also has coop and PvP modes in multiplayer
 TLDR; Its a gory, action filled bargain at $20
Posted: 9 June
Early Access Review
Excellent VR FPS in the style of Doom 3 BFG with story elements
 It has a lot of content: missions, weapons, perks, skills, etc
 So you really get something for your money
Locomotion with moving on the trackpad works fine too
 Of course you can chose to teleport if you get motion sick
Game has very good graphics since it is a "port" from the normal Dead Effect 2 which already looks pretty nice
 So brace yourself for some very hardware hungry graphics
 I hope developers can still do something when it comes to performance since I do not get constant, stable framerates with even shadows off and other options on medium
 Weapon handling overall is good
 Might get improved a bit to give you more the feeling that you just shoot an assault rifle
 I think about having a better force feedback of the controller
 Also I would prefer that the weapon even reloads when the magazine is still not fully empty
 I know it is not realistic, but I am so used to this since my FPS young ages
 ;DNothing more to say
 This game came as a big surprise
 I own the normal version, but did actually not play it a lot
 And since developers give you a 75% if you are owner of the normal version I only paid 4,5 EUR for this VR game
 Much respect for this
 This is really cheap, especially in comparison to so many other games
I would say for now after testing it for 1 hour that this game is within the top 15 VR games and absolut must-have for Vive or Oculus owners
 Finally a real VR game
 We deserved it
Thank you developers
 Good job
 Let's iron it out and give us multiplayer and this game will become one of the best VR games of this generation

Sairento VR is definitely one of the best games available for VR and one of those that you can keep returning to
The movement system is probaly the best I've ever seen in a VR game
 The game uses teleport jumps that give you an awesome feeling because flying through the air, activating slow motion
and shooting or slicing everything with motion controls is a hell lot of fun
The game is also very violent and bloody so if you like that this is a game for you (you can also turn blood off)
At the moment there's no kind of campaign (planned for the future)
 Instead there are five different maps that you can play in different modes like survival, wave assault,
 However the different modes don't have any relevance if you'd ask me because in the end it's all about just killing enemys
 That's why I would like to see some objective-based game modes as well
There are different types of weapons like melee, pistols, rifles and shotguns available
 You can improve those with relics that you get by playing
The game is in development at a small team but the updates keep coming and it seems like they're listening to community feedback as well
Sairento VR is definitely worth the current price tag of 22,99€ so if you own an HMD do not hesistate to purchase it

If Warframe and Raw Data had a baby and moved to Tokyo set in the future, that is Sairento VR in a nutshell
 • The most responsive swordplay I have seen in the VR game, the sword hitbox is great• There are many upgrades for your character, the sense of progression is excellent• Beautiful cyberpunk setting and art style that immerses the player into the virtual world• The movement is extremely versatile, allowing you to change direction in a mid air jumpFeatures I would like to see added to Sairento• Co-op - This would make it a direct competitor with Raw Data if a co-op mode was well implemented into the game• Versus mode - The swordplay is excellent and it would warrant a versus or PvP mode especially with the levelling system• More difficulty - The enemy AI needs to have flanking maneuvers and a cover mechanism added• More environments - The Dojo hub is excellent, I would love to see more missions environments set in this virtual worldOverall, it is a worthy addition to the Steam store and with more content, it could become a strong contender for Raw Data in the coming months

Early Access Review
Pros: -Super fun bullet-time hack-n'-slash-n-shoot gameplay
-Music is really cool
 That combined with the setting gives a cyber-punk
almost deus-ex vibe that I dig
-They really nailed jumping
 Double jumping, wall-running, and hopping off walls for a triple jump is incredible (now if I could just stop bonking my head on the ceiling
)-LOOT
 Thank you for actually putting a carrot at the end of the stick
 So many VR games leave out any sort of reason to keep playing beyond "high score" and that just doesn't spike my dopamine levels
-I can charge up two katanas with spirit energy and make them shoot out in a red X after jumping behind an enemy and saying "
Nothing personal, kid
"Cons:-Like never before, I feel like I don't have enough playspace and the wire on my headset feels restrictive
Posted: 26 December, 2016
Early Access Review
You reach max level pretty quickly - the max level is 20, and you gain about a level per mission
 I'm kind of not happy that level 20 doesn't mean max stats, because it doesn't seem like there's any good reason to put in a level cap at all, except to limit replayability
The game is very easy - even on the harder difficulties
 If you're looking for a challenge, look elsewhere
 EDIT: I've made a mistake here - I didn't realise the game had an overall difficulty setting, which I think I set to NORMAL on the very first time I played it
 After setting this to HARD or MASTER, the game becomes satisfyingly tricky
 The "difficulty" I was talking about earlier is the challenge level of the missions, which has a rating out of 10 - not the game difficulty
 EDIT Sep 2017: This game has come a long, long way since this review, and the game's difficulty has been completely fixed
 Expect a solid challenge which encourages ample use of bullet time "acceleration"
The reason you pick up this game is for the rule of cool
 For the fun of jumping and firing your guns in bullet time, for taking double swords and slicing and dicing
 I have to hope that later on in development, the swords require a bit of a swing before they kill - you can just teleport into bad guys with your sword out and they'll likely drop, and if they don't, a little bit of a wave will finish them off
 For this reason, you can actually add a bit of challenge by using guns instead of the sword
 I regularly used a gun in my right hand and a sword in the left to reflect any wayward bullets, which felt fantastic
Reflecting bullets using the sword is kind of cool and requires a bit of a knack to do it
 You'll almost never be reflecting every single bullet

Out of almost 200 VR games this is easily my top VR game
 No other game in VR makes you feel so badass
 The movement is so fun the combat so satisfying there is really nothing else out like it
 The relic system is great as it allows you to change up your playstyle in many ways
 I got a infinite ammo relic for my Uzi and combine that with bullet time omn headshot kill is such a great combo
 The developers have been marvelous constantly taking feedback and adding to the game
The campaign mode isn't in yet so now you most just do the couple set maps with basic objectives like kill all enemies or defeat all waves and such
 The relic system is sort of similar to Diablos gem system you get relics you can slot to weapons and your armor that increase a whole variety of things and the rarer relics even add new abilities
 They also recently added a skill tree to even further customize your playstyle
Really looking forward to seeing what else the team brings with each new update

It's like Warframe meets The Specialists mod of yore meets Ghost in the Shell meets Shinobi meets Equilibrium meets The Matrix meets your wall as you flail about with a katana against a horde of flying geisha robots and cyber-ashigaru
Want to kill everything around you with a well-timed gun kata
 You can do that
Want to really ruin some cyberdays with a shotgun in one hand and a lightsaber in the other
 You can do that
Want to be the future Miyamoto Musashi, dual-wielding katanas and hacking legs off hapless bystanders while sliding between them
 YOU CAN DO THAT
Seriously, there are two VR games I've played that, until playing them, I didn't realize were the games I've wanted since I was a kid
 Star Trek Bridge Crew is one, and Sairento VR is the other
 I really can't describe how good this game feels, and I can't wait for more content to be added
There are some cons, though:- It can be kind of wonky aiming straight up with firearms; I've been killed by inappropriate reloads a few times
- Enemies (namely the newest enemy type added with the most-recent (as of writing) update) can sometimes spawn in the level geometry, meaning you have to restart the mission
 Only happened once, but it was annoying
Considerations:~ This is Early Access, so there aren't as many maps as there will be when the game is fully released
 Same with enemy types
 What is in the game, right now, is great, and I'm looking forward to seeing what happens with the direction of the game going forward
Seriously worth picking up, in my opinion
Posted: 4 September
Early Access Review
I am really enjoying Sairento VR
 Perhaps it doesn't have the nicest graphics around, but they are not bad either
 The gameplay and replayability are where this game shines
One of its main features is its mobility
 You have 3 basic ways: Teleport short distances on ground, walk in regular locomotion, or perform double and triple long jumps
 The markers for these movement kinds are brilliant: Not only they show the destination, but also the trajectory (crucial for jumping) and what will happen once you reach your target (bounce in a direction, wallrunning, etc
)
 And they do that clean and efficiently
In spite of having many movement options, I haven't felt sick, though it's true that I have been playing with VR for a while
There are many different kinds of weapons and styles: You might want to dual wield swords, or two hard-hitting pistols, or maybe two fast paced SMGs
 You can also mix them between themselves or add throwing weapons, bows, rifles or shotguns to spice things up
 The objective of the game is basically eliminate all targets in a closed area in short matches/rounds that last for 5-10 minutes
 The pace is high, as you are constantly moving to avoid being overwhelmed and killing frenetically
 The action is intense, but it is alleviated with the introduction of bullet time, which is also one of the main features of the game
 It is very satisfying jumping over a group of enemies, enable bullet time, and rain death among them
There are different maps to do so, and some of them have interesting features
 My favourite is a highly vertical one with 5-6 stories high, where you are constantly fighting up or making crazy jumps down
 Others however are more generic, and some even have a bit worse graphics than the rest
The difficulty is highly customizable: You can choose before each map how much health & damage the enemies will have and the amount that will apear
 You can also add up to 6-8 random mutators to the map (enemies shoot more bullets, move faster, prevalence of a certain type of enemy, slow health regen, and things like that)
 These mutators also makes the map to provide more and better loot
And loot is also one of the things that keep you going on
 Enemies will drop random loot, and the maps will have chests
 These loots provide bonus to your weapons or to the different kind of armors you have (gloves, chest, helmet
)
Also you gain experience and levels, which give you skill points that can be spent in several skill trees similar to the ones used in Mass Effect games
 They provide bonus to certain kind of weapons, enhance movements, senses, health
The game is updated quite often, solving bugs, adding new combat styles or creating new enemies
The game has also its flaws: There are bugs (some enemies shoot ocasionally through walls, others get stuck in the environment, sometimes you get trapped in a loop of standing/crouching and have to move/teleport to remove it), lack of polish of certain maps, AI is a bit dumb, etc
 Some of these problems are more apparent than others
 It is an Early Access game afterall, and as such is still in development so everyone should be aware of that
 Even with all its shortcomings and flaws due to the game still being developed, Sairento VR is highly enjoyable and replayable at this stage, and I don't hesitate to recommend it to everyone who enjoys good shooters
 It is the game I still come back every day to play a couple of rounds, and has that "Just one more round
 and another
 and another
" feeling
 It's a game with a really nice present if you want to play now, and shows even greater promise if you want to invest in it
Update 11/9/17: I am really glad to see how fast the developers are releasing patches and fixes (content as well)
 They are really active and responsive

I was showing Tilt Brush to a friend and his son, he's maybe 8yo
 His son sits on the floor and pulls his knees up, and makes these sweeping arcs overhead
 I can see his POV from my monitor but have no idea what he's painting, everything is mostly white
 He stops, crawls forward a few feet then stands up to look back at his painting
 It's an igloo
 His very first time using VR and trying Tilt Brush, the kid immediately understood he could build 3D inhabitable objects
 Then he crawled back inside

Did Paint 3D Gaben, lots of fun
Posted: 7 April, 2016
Last July, I went to the first stop of the HTC Vive Live truck tour in San Diego
I expected to try out a virtual reality headset and either be unimpressed or think it was kind of cool
Then they loaded up Tilt Brush as my second demo and I could paint and actually see depth as I painted in three dimensions
This was a huge deal to me as I can't see 3D in movies or in those magic frame pictures that require you to be able to see 3D to appreciate
I drew some flowers that day and signed a letter E for the first initial of my name
Six months later I got to draw a purple monster that started out as a hut and ended up looking like a Pac-Man ghost in front of Skillman and Hackett at the Steam VR Developer Showcase
It was a pivotal moment in my life where I could thank the creators personally for one of the most remarkable art applications available on the market
Despite the sappy emotional story, I encourage everyone at any age to pick up the Vive controllers and create something in Tilt Brush
I can't wait to see what fellow Vive owners and their friends come up with now that it is commercially available

When I bought the game it looked like a normal pc game with support for VR on the steam store page, but it acctualy is a VR ONLY game
 If you don't have VR you cant play the game
 I myself dont have a VR device, so i had to refund the game
 I wish they would make it more easier to see if its a VR only game etc in the future on steam
 Anyways cant really review the game so this is more of an warning to others who dont have VR who want to play this game
edit: They updated store page with a tiny "vr only" in the description
Posted: 7 April, 2016
EDIT:
For those of you pointing out that I only have an hour of gameplay - I have completed 2/4 of the jobs offered, so roughly half of the scripted gameplay
Oh, Job Simulator
I wish I could enjoy you
I can see the appeal, don't get me wrong, but as an avid gamer it just doesn't really do anything for me - even viewing it purely as an experience, I couldn't get into it
I appreciate the humor, the attention to detail, the heart, but
it just doesn't hold my attention, even compared to other experiences
If it were $5, even $10, I could see myself recommending it as an "intro to VR" type experience
 I think the real issue is that the world doesn't respond to your decisions whatsoever
The game comes down to "here's a simple task, now do whatever you want to do, and the game will move onto another task
"
From what I can tell, the game plays out the same no matter what you do
 Let's say it asks you to make a sandwich and you make it out of uncooked bacon, an apple and a CD-Rom and then serve it up
 the game moves onto the next task
Whoopie, CD-Rom sandwich and no one cares
Hilarious the first few times, especially with some friends in the room, but after the fifteenth time, it just gets stale
TL;DR:
Good for intro VR, great writing, but your (often funny) decisions are meaningless and the world is unresponsive to them
 It's probably not worth the price
That's my two cents

Recent college grad, this is the closest thing I have to a job right now
 10/10 pls make a social life simulator next
Posted: 8 April, 2016
+ Lives up to the "simulator" name+ Excellent couch party game+ VR never felt broken / unpolished+ Great attention to detail- Really want more than 4 jobsOverall this a fantastic showcase for VR
 When I start letting people come over to play, I'll be using this
 I'm normally not interested in physics based sandboxes, but this is more than that
 It's really a cartoony simulator, in the vain of farming or truck driving, where you're doing menial tasks
 It's awesome
Posted: 21 February
Good game and very fun for the two hours i played but only problem is, it is definetly not worth your 30 bucks
 Game has maybe a couple hours of content and only 4 jobs
 As soon as i complained about not having enough content on the forums the devs wrongfully banned me
 I have asked them for an explanation to my ban and they just ignored it
 I refunded it and am only going to buy it if it goes on sale for an actually reasonable price and when the devs start to act like proffesionals and can handle a negative review

An absolutely hilarious and necessary VR game
 Great for exploring and trying new things for the experienced VR player, and overwhelmingly awesome and easy to play for the first-timer
 Everyone who plays VR at my house plays this one over and over
 It's one of the truly great VR games on the market right now
I highly recommend this game, and I always will recommend this game
 Buy it
 You won't be let down, I promise
Highlights: Despite the YouTube community loving the office worker job, my favorites were convenience store clerk and gourmet chef
 That being said, office worker and auto mechanic are an absolute blast to play as well
Posted: 23 August
This game came with my VR goggles, and you're probably already pretty aware of what it is, which is why they are charging about 10 dollars more than what you should pay for it
 For a while it had a huge performance hug (since fixed), and I'm always wondered what it was exactly
 I guess you would call it a basic sandbox game, or whatever, and it tells you what to do
 It's got a nice variety of environments, and is very professionally done
 It's job simulator, and I didn't really pay for it, so I will pretend it's 19
99, and rate it up
 The primary motivator in your purchase of this will be if you have to demo to children
 They wont break your controllers when playing it
 Kids love this game, and won't bother you much when playing it
 To that effect, if you don't demo to kids (good idea) and you don't have Rick and Morty, buy that instead

This game is a great example of the heavy interaction with world objects that is possible with VR
 It is fun for a very short time before becoming boring
 I think it's WAY too expensive for what it is
 It would be 100% worth it at $10 and probably still a good buy at $15, but paying $30 for this is ridiculous
 Wait for it to go on sale or find a friend that has it to try it out before shelling out so much cash
EDIT: In case anyone is wondering, I played all four jobs
 I finished the office and convienience store jobs, but was bored of the auto mechanic and chef jobs before completing them
 I stand by my review and my opinion of not recommending the game
 No replayability
 My only regret is not requesting a refund in time
Posted: 1 June, 2016
My kids (ahem, and me) play this all the time
 More jobs please
Posted: 18 May, 2016
The year is 2050
 You are a human simulating the most boring jobs of the 21st century in a museum based on the warped history of your robot overlords
The inaccuracies between reality and the job simulator are often satirical or just silly (like having to change headlight fluid as a mechanic
) The humor and polish are very reminiscent of a Valve game
 While it may not blow you away, it is extremely accessible and is a suprisingly fun social game
Pros:Very well polished
Comes with four complete jobs: Office Worker, Gourmet Chef, Store Clerk, and Auto Mechanic
Dialog with robot customers and coworkers is often comical
Gags and pop culture references EVERYWHERE
Given that there is no locomotion they make excellent use of the space your are given
 Example: When you're a chef you can flip a switch to replace your sink with a blender or a microwave
Kid Friendly
Fantasic demo game for people new to VR
Consistent 90fps, one of the most stable VR games I've played
 Especially considering how nice it looks
As I said earlier a suprisingly good social game
 When you have one person playing and have some people on the couch something magical happens
 Observers heckle/shout out commands, laughing at the goofy interactions of the player - it's a good time all around
Neutral:By it's nature all tasks are extremely simple
I can imagine you'd run into issues if you had a smaller than average play space, but that's not the games fault
Cons:Once you've played through each of the jobs there is little replayability
 Unless you count laughing at other people playing it
Feels like an extended demo rather than a full game, however, even at $30 I'd probably recommend it
 (If HTC were to discontinue it being bundled with the Vive in the future
) While $30 is steep for the time it takes to beat, I'd say it's roughly on par with the rest of the VR catalog, as generally most games are overpriced
 Which again, makes sense given the relatively small playerbase

I only just found out about this game when it released
 Saw a few videos and had to get it
I'm a musician, and instructor
 Have been playin music for most my life and this game kicked my butt
 There's parts of each level that groove and feel "right" while a lot of the rest of the level doesn't seem to fit with the tempo/time signature, (each level number represents it's time signature)
 It frustrated me a LOT
 I felt like the devs put in those groove sections to make it seem like a rhythm game but most the filler was just an out of time mess
I was wrong
The more you learn about the mechanics, which are actually fairly complex for one button and stick, the more you'll apreciate how finely tuned this game is
 So, a lot of the patterns don't exactly groove like typical rhythm games, but once you start feeling how all the more advanced scoring mechanics work together, you'll start feeling the music in really interesting ways
It's hard to explain, haha
Yes
 your thumbs will get sore playing this, like
 seriously
 But man
 when you nail sections and feel how it all fits together there's no comparison to how awesome it makes you feel
There's PLENTY of replay that can be had in this, plus the music will stick with you and make you want to play more just to hear it again
It's worth the price
Posted: 23 June
So far I've completed 2 levels and got at least three angry boners
 I can't remember the last time a game would make me this angry without actually making me want to ragequit
 Weirdly enough, this is also the first game that I'd actually rather play in VR
 And on drugs
Good game, 10/10
Posted: 26 June
I feel like this game was made for me
 PROS-Feels good to play (responsive, never feel cheated out of a life)-High and stable FPS (nice on 144hz monitors)-Intuitive
 There's no real walkthrough or in game guide, but it's easy to catch on to (almost) everything-Wide skill range
 This game isn't as hard as some of the noobies that left negative reviews might convince you to believe
 With a controller and a little bit of time and practice you can beat the game in less than a week, AND there is a high skill ceiling if you want to go for all S rank, AND a much higher skill ceiling if you want to improve your score on the leaderboards (and of course the much more unforgiving newgame+)-Visuals
 The atmosphere is just amazing, fast, and scary just like I never knew I wanted it to be
-Sound
 The sound is 70% of everything good in this game
 I cannot give the sound guy enough props
 It gets the adrenaline pumping while keeping you on beat and letting you know the beat to come
 Brilliant
CONS-I wish there were more levels, or at least user made levels
 I beat the game twice in <20hrs (1st playthrough + S rank) and even left the game open for a few hours
 There's still newgame+, but they're all linear levels
 Good for practicing, but it does kill the replayability a bit
-Lack of an in-game guide
 This isn't a deal-breaker for me, but trying to figure out how to stay in the air during turns to hit those high arches consistently was a bit difficult without a guide
 Everything else was mostly covered at points in the early levels
 Note: There is a PDF guide if you right click the game
 I found it after I beat it the second time
OVERALL: 9
5/10Should you get it
Yeah

I'd say Thumper is
a "reaction time" and "call and response" rhythm game
 As you gain more familiarity with the way to respond to patterns the game becomes more rhythmic, but it strays from what some may be used to playing since sounds and cues don't always fall on a note or traditional rhythm timings of the music
 More often than not a rhytmic pattern is felt advancing somewhere outside the music
 I was tripped up at first learning to play because I was trying to match the music timings to the rhythm pattern very directly and that's not how this works
 So why am I rambling about all this
 Because everything becomes a lot more fun once you grasp the concept of reaction time rhythms and syncopation
 Thumper is challenging, but in the good kind of way
 I love this game, it seeps into every dark corner of your mind and makes it really hard to put down
 At first I was weary of the 20 dollar price, but that was easily forgotten the more I played and realized Thumper
is an experience as much of a challenge
 It's a very high quality and addicting
game

The kind of game that makes you sit up in your chair
 Then sit up further
 Then lean forward and put your game face on right after it's done pretending to be casual

This is one of the most intense [non-osu] rhythm games I've played since Rhythm Heaven (EDIT: I haven't played any BEMANI games, so take that part with a grain of salt if you have played them
 Regardless, this game does have its intensity)
 It's got simple controls, but it ramps up the difficulty very quickly
 And holy crap, it is really fun
 The music is nice, but if it wasn't for the level design, it would sound a bit samey to some
 I still like it
Some may find the price point a little high (especially with 9 levels; though you'll be dying a lot), but if you're a nerd for polish and rhythm games (like me) or if you love competing for the best score, then it's worth the full price
 If you're not sure if you want to commit $20 to an intense rhythm action game, then I'd definitely say that you should wait for a sale
 Also hey, it has native DS4 support, but most of you shouldn't care

VIVE USER BEWARE
SUPER PSYCHEDELIC ENDUCING POWERS AT WORK
My dream has just come true, no mushroom required

I've never played a rhythm game like this before
Every other rhythm game I've played has tried to create a sort of "flying" sensation
 A generally lighthearted tone is created, and these games often try to replicate a really good night at a rave
 This isn't a bad thing, but Thumper showed me something very different
This game is brutal, visceral, hellish
Posted: 27 June
Thumper is evil
 It gets to you in a way that I dont think any other game has managed to
 It builds this constant progressive dread that seems to never end up to a never reaching climax
 And it does that just by asking you to hit a button when a blue square reaches you, slide on some walls and fly over some obstacles
I wouldnt go as far to call Thumper a horror game as in its not trying to scare you like Resident Evil or Outlast would, but its a compelling candidate for existential horror, the kind of horror Lovecraft was so enamoured with
 And it manages to accomplish this just by the abstraction of its aestethic and its incredible sound design and
industrial techno soundtrack
In Thumper you are in control of a silver beetle stuck on a track on its journey to the beyond
 The game clearly establishes very early on that this is serious business just by the tone of the music playing and it gives you a very brief tutorial before sending you on your way, without much care if you will survive or not
 Very quickly you will be struggling to press the button on time with the blue notes that pass by you and the music simply wont let up
But up until this point, the only punishment you seem to get out of missing these notes is a reduced score
 No big deal
Then, real danger starts to show up
 You will have to turn the beettle in time with the turns of the road, and hold down the button when some barriers show up alongside the track
 You fail to do this, you lose the beetle's armor
 You fail to do this twice, you are dead
The great thing about Thumper is that the control scheme is very minimal and easy to understand, so the game takes that opportunity and throws you the most violent sequences of notes and obstacles to deal with, leaving you in a constant state of (positive) stress
 Sometimes it seems impossible, but the game always gives visual and sound indications of what the next obstacle is, so you soon learn how to deal with it and its immensely satisfying to get an S-Rank on a segment
The game also has bosses that truly test your skill up to that point and really stand as a barrier to those who arent ready for the next level
 The final boss does what great final bosses do: test your skills to the max while also providing a new challenge to overcome not seen in the whole game up to that point
Its an amazing and thrilling experience with some of the best surrealist visuals and music to complement it
 It leaves you in a state of trance where you stop seeing the notes and just start guessing and predicting where they will be by sound alone, and thats the best compliment I can give to a Rhythm game

Early Access Review
+ bows work extremely well+ multiplayer is easy to jump into, and is extremely fun+ varied enemy types+ items with different abilities for some customization+ you defeinitely feel more skilled after some play- sountrack should be a bit more varied - instead of 90' turn slices, a 45' or free turn with the control stick should be implementedthis game is super promising and i am absolutely delighted i purchased it
Posted: 21 December, 2016
Early Access Review
Considering how many hours I got out of the demo this was a day one purchase
 Highly recommended, though your arms will ache
 End up playing shirtless since it really is a work out and this does have the side effect of my wife coming up to grab me and bite me
She tells me she likes to watch me play and now wants me to take up archery
 Highly recommended

Early Access Review
Playing via use of Oculus Touch and 2 sensors
It took me a a while to get the optimal set-up with only the two sensors
 This game is designed for full 360 tracking and requires a lot of turning to aim at different angles
 So keep that in mind as you may need to devote some time to tweaking your sensor placement - but it's worth it
The experience is solid and very satisfying to play
 I was initially overwhelmed with the single player as it's very challenging (especially when starting out)
 I soon took the plunge into multiplayer and thats now my go-to game mode
 It's a LOT of fun
Player interaction is somewhat limited, however you'd be surprised just how effective simple gestures can be, high-fiving and fist-bumping my fellow archer after a successful wave defense was oddly ssatisfying - and cute
Downsides:I am having some tracking issues still, so if you're using a Rift then
a 3+ sensor set-up is really what you want, for the best experience in this game
 [EDIT] - Dev has since implimented a 'quick turn' mechanic to help address the tracking issues and allow players of all set-ups to enjoy the game
 Full marks to the Dev, updates are frequent and player suggestions & feedback is considered

Early Access Review
IMHO this is the best bow and arrow game for the Vive with a very active and responsive developer
 The free alpha was better than most paid games for months and I'm glad it finally hit Early Access
 Bow mechanics are fantastic, the gameplay with adjusting difficulty level, multiple types of enemies, various power ups, items to collect are all top notch
 Graphics are very good with artists from some of the well known AAA studios providing the art work
 Great for both solo and co-op
 I can't recommend this one enough
Posted: 20 December, 2016
Early Access Review
If you own a Vive, this is the defining game imo
 It's great to be part of the evolution of this game and be able to compensate the dev for all the hard work he's put into what has been up until a free game
You're defending a series of gates along a canyon
 If your team is good enough you can push forward and take more gates
 Fail and you're driven back and have to defend
 There's a good variety of enemies, all that time playing Quivr isn't wasted because the bow dynamics are still excellent and you need to mix it up against airborne and some very fast ground based attackers
Unlike a lot of games you're not going to feel overwhelmed if you're in there as part of a multiplayer team too
Cons: Wear and tear on the trigger from furiously nocking arrows
Too much time playing this when i should be doing stuff in the real world
Posted: 21 December, 2016
Early Access Review
This is my favorite game on the vive
The bow mechanics are spot on and it's such a great feeling to aim an arrow and hit something far away
The co-op multiplayer adds a lot of strategy into the game(if you want to survive)
The developer has taken this game so far from his initial tech demo and is constantly listening to the community feedback
I can't wait to see where they take this game
 Looking forward to some epic archery battles on a giant

My favorite VR game hands down
Great bow mechanics, well thought out game play with a vibrant multi-player experience make this game an almost daily enjoyment for me
This game gets better every month with a dedicated developer releasing updates almost every week
It has been really fun watching the game development process unfold

Early Access Review
I want more gear
I want more levels
i want more bosses
i want more skills
I want all these things because the game is already amazing
When i can dump 8 hours into a full roomscale game and still feel like i want so much more of it
 Being a big fan of rpg's and playing diablo II and wow for years i wanted a vr game with loot, spells, bosses, dungueons progresison
 this has that and the developer updates almost daily it is incredible
Buy this game
If you, like me, check out the negative reviews before you purchase, make sure to see just how many updates have been released since there has been a bad review
 at this time there has been well over 20 updates since the last negative review

Early Access Review
I am obsessed with this game
 I own a bow but don't shoot that often
 The slight vibration in the controllers makes it feel like I'm actually drawing the bow
 You can feel the tension in the bow and feel when you have drawn the bow far enough for your shot 
Slightly twisting either of your hands changes how your arrow flies
 To move you shoot an arrow through a blue check point
 It can be a little off setting but there's a clear direction your pov will be
 I have only played a couple days and haven't had much multi-player voice chat but so far my experience has been fluid whether or not I could hear other players
 There's bow and arrow games out there for sure
 I love the multi-player action
 If I want to defend the wall, hold mid, or snipe it's all an option
 Grabbing arrows from your quiver can be a little derpy
 I'm just opening boosts and gear upgrades
 Overall if you want to play a bow and arrow shooter I definitely reccomend it
Posted: 21 December, 2016
Early Access Review
Great fun, lovely inventive graphics and slick gameplay
 intuitive movement and a really nice interface too
 The other thing that I noticed, which really surprised me, is how good the bow mechanics and draw are (having spent many years on archery ranges)
 The bow "feel" is very similar to my American Flatbow which sadly doesn't get anywhere near enough use these days
 Hat off to the developer
 Given that this is still in Early Access, it's very polished and thoroughly entertaining
Posted: 17 October
Copy and paste from what I wrote on reddit:First off, I never played the pancake version (as the developer jokingly put it) of the game but my first hour was incredible fun
 The game is super beautiful (maybe the best looking VR game I played yet, even compared to Robo Recall or Lone Echo), the atmosphere is fantastic (and VR adds a lot to the titles immersion) and the first few puzzles were fun and engaging
What blew me away though was the option menu of all things, because it is one that is truly worthy of a PC AAA title instead of a PC VR AAA title
 Nothing comes close to how polished it feels (except the scroll bars); no Steam VR indie title and no Oculus Studio release
 There is an auto detect functionality for the performance stuff, individual presets for GPU performance, VRAM and CPU performance as well as a few dozen options in each category with everything from Ambient Occlusion, the number of internal sound channels, multiple shadow implementations, the ability to switch sound API and so forth
 And of course the game supports MSAA (up to 8) as well as allows to set render scale in game
Posted: 17 October
I'm a big fan of The Talos Principle, and since this is a direct VR adaptation of that game the reviews for the gameplay in the flat version speak for themselves
I will say if you're going in blind, TP a Portal-esque maze puzzler
 You go around giant worlds solving puzzles as a sentient lab rat, but Talos Principle has a much more philosophical bent
 You're the subject of a kind of Turing Test, and are never quite sure if what you see and hear is true, or if it's part of the test
 Especially interesting are the interactions with Milton on the library terminals, who may be a simple library program, a complicated AI, or a researcher messing with your mind
 The more I played, the more I realized I was solving puzzles just to get access to more terminals to continue the conversation
 I found it to be an extremely well written, emotionally evolving story with a beautifully designed, fun to play puzzle game thrown in as a bonus
The puzzles are fun without being punishing, and though you can die from sentry turrets and roaming mines, there are very few gotcha moments, and checkpoints are never very far behind
 There is a small bit of jumping puzzle action toward the end (which I'm not a fan of) along with some timed events but those are few and far between
 For the majority of the game, Talos is a very peaceful, relaxing game experience
 The beautiful open air environments and soundtrack give the game a very zen garden feel
From the VR side of things, the developers did as good of a job converting Talos Principle to VR as Serious Sam
 The best thing I can say is that you'd never know it wasn't made for VR
 It has 100%
motion control and roomscale support
 It also supports seated and standing if you don't feel like walking around, and full gamepad support if that's your thing
And locomotion
 Play as you like with "classic" FPS style movement on the trackpad or teleport, and steer with headlook or controller aim
 Adjust your walking/running speed, teleport speed, with comfort options to curtail motion sickness
 Plenty of options to control the game how you like
The virtual worlds are lovely and have a real sense of place, and the 3D audio is good enough to let you know where enemies and obstacles are just by listening
 Again, TP feels like it was made for VR
If you like puzzles, philosophical sci-fi and are hungry for an AAA quality VR game with substance and playtime beyond a few hours, Talos Principle will make you very happy
Posted: 17 October
Product received for free
This adaption from the original is absolutely perfect
 The puzzles go from being extremely simple progressively to being quite challenging
 The landscapes and graphics in general are simply breathtaking in VR
 The movement style is extremely configurable so you can dial it in just like you want it
 Yet again, Croteam has also provided a dedicated method for those who like to use mixed reality
 This game is simply a must have for those of you who enjoy puzzle based VR games set around breathtaking scenery

This is a masterful VR conversion of an already beautiful game
This world was already a pleasure to lose yourself in, and is even moreso in VR
The atmosphere, story, and general experience of the game world lend themselves perfectly to VR
The developers have crossed every 't' and dotted every 'i' to ensure that the gameplay experience in VR is a very smooth one--on day one of launch, no less--from the numerous locomotion options to the adaptation of various game mechanics into VR
They're also very active in the discussion boards here and on the Vive subreddit, working to make sure the user's needs are met
Other developers take note: this is how a VR game--conversion or not--is done right
Looks great and runs buttery smooth on my GTX1070 with the Vive
I had played the heck out of the "flat" version of the game, and being able to actually go "into" this world in VR was worth every penny
But this would also be great to pick up and experience for the first time in VR, if you never played the original
Recommendation: Buy it
You won't be disappointed
Posted: 19 October
Playing The Talos Principle in VR is like hacking your own consciousness
Yes, you have brain and you also have two hands that let you interact with this strange anachronic world
And you will learn it has great plans for you
You'll go for an introspective journey that'll help you unfold your Metaphisical intelligence
The puzzles are incredibily clever and often requires you to think out of the box you were comfortable within
 But beware with that increasing awereness of your brain, this game could make you smarter 
 You could also find yourself have a stop just to contemplate the shadows of the upper clouds sliding on thoses beautifull sceneries or be impressed by the gigantic size of this tower
 Magical moments of VR
The lifetime of the game is pretty larger than what we were used to up to now in VR and the VR version also includes Road to Gahenna DLC wich is awsome too
Plus Croteam stood up against FB/Oculus attempt to corrupt them with $$
 They refused to fall into the wall garden strategy trap
 So we, as users, could reward this attitude
 Buying their game could be considered an ethical purchase if you care about standing for freedom of choise in this merciless world
That's a fair price in regards to what a good VR portage it is, and VR definitly unleash the beauty of this existential work of art

If you never played Talos Principle this is the first AAA vr game that you can spend 30-40+ hours in
 Everyone knows how great of a game The Talos Principle is it got fantastic reviews across the board
 so ill review the VR aspect of it
Posted: 17 October
An excellent VR Version and direct adaptation of the original 3d game
Now in VR, you can adjust your movement to your liking
Graphics are amazing in VR with the right Hardware
Low end systems should not have an issue

No review will ever do justice when it comes to any VR or non-VR titles developed by Croteam
 The awesomeness is so insanely high that mere words aren't enough
 These guys have 'Serious' passion and dedication for what they do, and you can feel it simply by looking at the quintillion of options they give you in Talos Principle VR and the three other Serious Sam VR titles, allowing you to customize the experience according to your own preference
 Read the reviews written by others to find out more about the awesomeness of this masterpiece
 But for my review, I'll end it by telling Croteam to just SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
 You can never go wrong by buying it for $40, $60 or $100 even
 It's priceless
 End of discussion

Vive: With my 1080 Ti and i7 3770k, I have to put it on 100% in-game SS (already at 2
0 Steam VR SS) and all medium graphics settings to avoid obvious judder
 Openvr advanced settings says I'm at about 20% reprojection with these settings, but it looks fine
 At settings any higher, I considered it unplayable due to the judder
 Someone else told me there are anti-aliasing settings that help when turned off, but I didn't see those
 I'll look for them next time
I'm using classic locomotion, medium speed, no comfort, touch to move, and head oriented movement
 If you use hand oriented movement, you have to keep your controller level, and I want to play it with my hand/controller hanging comfortably
It's identical to the flat PC game, which is good
 The environments remind me of Serious Sam (for obvious reasons), and I can't help but like the chain gun sound when you grab a laser tripod thing
 I found the puzzles easier in VR because I think VR made it easier to do spatial reasoning
 It was more fun too
 I remember getting stuck in the flat version and not trying again

Talos Principle was already one of my favorite games of all time, so I did not hesitate to fork out the additional cash to be able to experience it within my HTC Vive
And not only did it not disappoint
This reimagining of TP for VR has far surpassed my expectations
TL;DR - Its AMAZING
BUY IT NOW
For anyone who hasn't played this game before, I would compare it (as many have) to Portal
 Similar to Portal, this will challenge you mentally, without ever being too difficult
The progression of difficultly is linear and within reason, allowing the player to adequately adapt to tackle most challenges
Additionally, it does not require that you solve all the puzzles in a given sequence, allowing you to throw in the towel on a puzzle for a while, and come back to it later with a fresh set of eyes
 The gameplay is fantastic
Additionally, the game is absolutely beautiful
There seems to be zero sacrifice in graphic quality
The environments and general atmosphere is stunning (and even better when you are standing inside of it)
 Among the best graphics seen on the Vive so far
Unlike Portal, the story in Talos does take on a more serious tone
It is extremely thought provoking and pulls together themes of technology, metaphysics, existentialism, and religion
Croteam has truly outdone themselves
 This port is amazing
 There was clearly a lot of attention to detail when porting the controls and overall experience
 Small things (like being able to aim a jamming device as you drop it, or the upgraded VR controls which allow you to freely arrange sigils to unlock doors) makes the VR controls feel even more natural than playing the original game on the flat screen
My opinion
this is hands down the BEST game available in VR right now

Resident Evil 7 is the fantastic entry in the legendary franchise that's been around for the past 21 years
 To be more specific, Resident Evil 7 is the franchise's return to its survival horror roots, but rather than sticking to the typical third person view, it's first person
 Though this isn't the first time this was done in the overall franchise, it is the first and successful attempt with a main franchise entry
 Despite being an old school Resident Evil fan, I must say the use of FPV was a brilliant move by the game's creators due to the fact that it leads to better immersion and an overall heightened sense of fear when playing through the game
 In Resident Evil 7 you mainly play as Ethan Winters, an average joe looking for his missing wife in a derelict Louisiana mansion
 In searching for his wife, Ethan stumbles upon a family of murderous psychopaths and other ghastly monstrosities that he never would've expected to deal with
 In attempting to escape in one piece, he discovers what caused this hellish situation to come about
 What's great about Resident Evil 7 is that it doesn't shy away from showcasing its gruesomeness, everything is intensely graphic and up close right from the start
 Resident Evil 7 is a highly detailed game, just about everything you see is lifelike, interactive, and in general well done
 To be more specific, for a short period of time you are granted the use of an axe and swinging it against certain objects will lead to it being momentarily stuck
 Another instance that showcases great attention to detail is during the numerous fierce moments of combat encountered in the game
 It's not surprising at all to shoot at an enemy and see blood/guts fly around, but seeing these fluids/matter splatter onto your weapon/arm and stay there for a brief period of time, that was truly eye opening
 Even something as simple as the main character resting his hands on a wall/pillar near him during gameplay reveals the attention to detail found in this game
 It may be a silly thing to bring up, but I also love the fact that despite the FPV you are able to see so much of Ethan
 It isn't always noticeable, but there are moments in the game where you can see Ethan's feet, legs, and torso
 I bring this up because it's a pet peeve of mine to play an FPS that doesn't show anything at all as you're walking or standing, it's limiting and robs you of total immersion
 I'm not totally sure, but if I had to guess as to why this was done, it was for the benefit of PSVR users
 Besides that, the extra body parts that are seen can be used to convey body language that isn't always utilized in an FPV game
There were many moments in this game where dim or even no lighting was used to manipulate the player's emotions
 As you play through this game you eventually reach a point where you're ready for anything, especially when walking through a dark area
 I found myself in many situations where I'd walk slowly anticipating an enemy to strike, but nothing happened at all
 I guess you can say that the fear/expectation of something was just as frightening if not more frightening than the actual enemy encounters
 It was when I least expected it that enemies would strike and it was a great way for the creators of this game to keep you in a constant state of discomfort/fear
 Resident Evil 7 didn't just stick to jump scares to frighten the player, it was done in very calculated ways
 For example, it was a normal occurrence in this game to be overwhelmed by enemies and you'd have to run away to be able to safely reload your weapon, but this wasn't always possible
 In one instance I was confidently running towards an open door because I knew I'd encounter no enemies, having already been through there, but as I approached the door an enemy jumped out of nowhere
 Despite being initially frightened by the sudden appearance of this enemy, I later realized that this brief interaction was well done
 In its game design Resident Evil 7 has numerous features from the classic Resident Evil games that series veterans will immediately notice
 Initially, the areas in Resident Evil 7 feel really distant from one another, but as you advance through the game, shortcuts will reveal just how overlapping these areas are
 Another throwback Resident Evil feature is the use of item boxes and having to juggle what you carry or even having to waste bullets just to make space
 Despite being an overall hassle, the inclusion of the item box/item juggling is certain to bring back fond memories
 Despite having immensely enjoyed Resident Evil 7, I wouldn't say it's a perfect game
 I've previously mentioned that this game is well done, but that's not 100% true
 It's nice that there are numerous puzzles in this game, but a few of them are lazily used more than once and they're generally not that challenging
 Resident Evil veterans will easily go through these puzzles, the series has offered more of a challenge in the past
 Besides that, there are also moments of stagnation in this game
 Though this could also be said of the highly praised Resident Evil 1, the main house feels a bit empty for long stretches of time and during these moments you are mainly hunting for items from room to room
 I was eventually bored of this and wanted something to happen
 I really enjoyed the combat in Resident Evil 7 and it offered a great deal of variety with the weapons that were offered
 From the game's beginning you'll mainly use a handgun plus a knife, but as the game progresses you'll eventually get to use a magnum, a flamethrower,
a shotgun, a grenade launcher, remote bombs, and a machine gun
 The weapons variety is a good asset in this game because it offers different playstyles so if for some reason you dislike one weapon, you can always rely on another
For the most part, the combat/boss battles in Resident Evil 7 are neither easy nor hard, but challenging in an entertaining way
 You generally know what to do when it comes to defeating one of the few bosses in this game, but that doesn't prevent you from dying
 You can easily expect to die once or twice per boss battles until you learn their patterns/weaknesses, it's not that big of a deal
 This is mostly attributed to having to be very precise with your aiming in hectic situations
 The enemies in Resident Evil 7 were designed in such a way that being shot in specific parts of the body will lead to certain reactions
 As a result, you'll mainly want to dish out as many headshots as possible, but it isn't always doable
 Maybe it's because I played this game with an Xbox 360 controller, but this was highly noticeable with one of the many handguns used in this game
 The recoil was a hassle to deal with at times because after every shot you had to readjust your aim to maximize the damage you dealt
Though the combat was fun, at times it also got to be a bit repetitive
 The main enemies in this game are visually well designed and there are three variants, but at one point it got old fighting the same looking enemies over and over again
 At the same time, I feel as if the main humanoid enemy wasn't too original, I was constantly reminded of previously used enemies from other Resident Evil games
 At least with the classic Resident Evil games the zombie models offered a decent amount of variety and there was much more to deal with as you progressed through the game
Overall, I truly enjoyed Resident 7
 The story was good and it goes beyond what it initially appears to be, but towards the end it felt hastily thrown together and a bit disjointed
 It was a great entry in a series that has lost its way over the years and I appreciated that
 It wasn't a perfect game, but what it offered was highly entertaining
 I give Resident Evil 7 a 4
75/5 and I highly recommend it

My god
 Capcom did it
 They saved the franchise
 I'm honestly shocked
 When the first teaser dropped I thought for sure this would just be a P
T
 copy which I was sort of okay with
 Turns out I was wrong
 This is a classic Resident Evil game
 Like, RE1 classic
 Complete with puzzle solving, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, and tense stressful boss encounters
 The game brings back the storage box system even
 I can't stress enough how amazing this game is as a long time RE fan
 If you're one too, do yourself a favor and pull the trigger on this one
 Best game since RE4
 May even be better
Posted: 31 May
PROS:-Good balance between dangerous areas to move through and safe areas where you can focus on other goals-This is especially important for me because I'm terrible at getting around enemies (I can't play Outlast) but games with almost no real danger can get boring quickly
 This game is PERFECT
 -Good story
 Good pacing
 Made me want to figure out what the hell's going on
-Nothing repetitive-The illusion of choice
 Cruel reality
-The first horror game I ever bought was Amnesia; The Dark Descent and ever since I've been waiting for something to match it
 This might actually be better
 CONS: -I honestly don't know
 -You can't jump

Resident Evil 7 didn't lie about it "returning to the roots"
 The aura of the original Resident Evil is everywhere in this game, plus it doesn't shine away from the classic fans pondering with reenactment of some memorable moments from the first game
First of all - this is a game
 Not a walking simulator, as some people thought it would be
 It's 100% a game and the gameplay is wonderful
 Gunplay is very satisfying
 Resources are incredibly limited (played on the Madhouse right away) and enemies are fast and can catch up to you even if you are running
 Since this is a "classic" RE - killing is optional unless it's a boss
 You can run and dodge past everything
 Even on the Madhouse
 On the other hand - you can try and kill everything in sight as well, as long as you are precise with your shots and utilize the knife when needed (once again, just like the classics)
 The knife
 Oh the knife
 Because of how limited the ammo is - I spent a lot of time dodging the enemies and stabbing them with the knife
 Unlike classics, here it's actually useful while still being vastly inferior to the guns (hello 4-6 with overpowered melee)
 What I also liked is the "dodging"
 No, there's no dodge mechanic a la RE3
 It's all done by moving and crouching (also there's a block)
 But attacks of the enemies are telegraphed perfectly, so you can always dodge out of their way if you pay attention and it feels really good to dodge a devastating attack not by pressing a promt that appears on the screen or performing an I-frames move, but by doing it yourself with the controls that are used constantly outside of combat as well
 Also fantastic bosses, but I'll keep quiet about them
I really-really enjoyed gameplay in this game
Design wise this game shines as well
 As this is a classic RE - a lot of backtracking is to be expected, but it's implemented so perfectly that you don't even feel like it's a backtracking
 There's constantly something new in the old locations
 They change their looks
 Enemies appear / disappear
 With newfound keys you can get a whole different perspective at navigating trough the locations
If to talk about aesthetics - enemies are very frightening and disgusting
 I jumped at several occasions from the combination of their looks and how they move
 Graphical fidelity is also outstanding, but all female characters gave me uncanny valley feeling
 Male characters looked great, so I don't know why is that
The "scare" factor
 This game is frightening, but not all the time
 The "horror" genre it delivers constantly shifts in tone
 It can be at times atmospheric and fill you with dread
 Or it can turn into a b style slasher movie with lots of gore and other disgusting factors like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre from which the game obviously took a lot of inspiration for some scenes and designs
 The game also often tries to light itself up with ridiculous factor
 There are several scenes that should be scary, but they are purposfully presented in such way that you start laughing and having fun
 Also some of the enemies are blatanly playing with you for their own amusement
 Shock factor is done really great here
But when the game wants to be dark - it delivers
 Some performances by the actors and associated scenes forced me to take a short break
 I'm still not entirely "happy" that I watched the "Happy Birthday" videotape
About tapes - before the release I thought that they would be a big deal and I also heard that we would be able to do some things in the tapes that would change the present, but there's no such thing
 There's very little amount of tapes (four) and all but one are completely optional
 They give some insight on the characters and past events
 Some of them would make more sense after the ending, but they are not as big of a deal as I was led to believe
 Just if the tapes were a factor for anyone out there
 They are neat little things, but the emphasis is on "little"
Story is great and nicely ties everything together
 It also rewards those who paid close attention, because a lot of stuff can be figured out with deduction and memory
 Since none of the Resident Evil games ever had any sort of good story - I would go as far as saying this is the best RE game story-wise
 They were all B-movies before, and this one is true to that, but still tries to be something more, which it manages to pull off
Performance
 The game is wonderfully optimized
 My rig is - GTX 780, i7-3770, 12 GB of RAM
 I use a normal HDD and played in 1080p with all settings being at max except for Shadows (they were at High, while the max is Very High)
 I also used SSAO instead of HBAO+ and Shadow Cache was turned off
 Resolution scale 1
0
The biggest hit out of those three settings is the Shadow Cache
 Whlist turning it on the game dipped from 60FPS to ~30
 With Shadow Cache off, but other two settings at max I was able to maintain constant 60 fps until I got out of the "prologue", where there started to be drops at some room transitions to 50 fps (but it quickly got back to 60 after the "loading" was done)
 It wasn't too bad, but I got tired from it quickly and turned the above mentioned two settings down as well, and was able to maintain a stable 60 fps for the duration of the game
Now for the biggest turn off and probably the only "big" minus of this game - playtime
I clocked in a bit over thirteen hours for my first playtrough
 But
 This is Steam playtime
 I was playing on the Madhouse difficulty and died a lot
 The screen at the end of the game showed me the total of nine hours and twenty two minutes
 That's 43 restarts and almost four hours of lost progress
 I explored a fair bit
 I know I still missed stuff
 I got 25 out of 33 coins
 Half of the bobble-heads and left several chests unopened because I didn't find enough lock-picks
 I did, however, read all notes in the game
 I would say my exploration total was pretty good and I've seen most of what the game can offer
 There is, however, a decision late in the game which I presume changes the second to last chapter drastically
Or not
 Now that I've cleared it - it doesn't change squat
 Three cutscenes are different
 One additional fight, but the chapter itself is the same
 I honestly expected more
If you are the type who plays games on easy
 Doesn't explore for the items, read the documents and generally just rushes trough the game - I would say that the first playtrough for someone like that it would take around five or six hours for the first playtrough
 So, there you have it
 The biggest minus of this game
 Playtime for the first timers can be anywhere in range from 5 to 15 hours, depending on the difficulty and ability of the one who plays
Just a quick word about Madhouse - they give you enough tapes
 I felt like it was a perfect balance of saves, just like the first Resident Evil
 There are autosaves though
 They are rare
 I think I noticed about seven of them troughout the entire game, and they are placed
 weirdly
 Like there's only two before the boss fights, while with others you have to rely on your own saves
 One of them was incredibly strange because it happened at the transition from one of the save rooms (I'm glad I didn't use the tape right away and opened the door first
)
 So yeah
 I don't think they take away from the challenge factor, because of how weridly they are spread out
 And they are at fixed places
 Because when I noticed an auto save at one moment I loaded up a previous save and went doing some hard side-stuff, that would have required me to save manually after anyway
P
S
It was a fantastic experience and I'm glad that I have bought this game
 I wish it was longer, but what there is is incredible
 I seriously doubt that the upcoming free DLC or Season Pass would have much playtime
 Oh well, I already bought the Deluxe and will just wait and see
Posted: 24 January
No guy saying "Resident Evil 7" when you hit "New Game" is the downside to this game
Posted: 23 January
Despite the shift to first person this definitely feels like a classic Resident Evil game
 The puzzles and the pacing of the combat in this game fit right along side the early RE games
 It's a strange but very pleasant surprise to see my favorite series changing with the times yet still retaining its spooky identity

If you ever recieve an email from your wife who has been missing for the last three years, don't answer it
But do buy Resident Evil 7
Posted: 1 May, 2016
I bought this game yesterday, I genuinely enjoy horror genre games, the Clive Barker games, Doom, Resident Evil, whatever
 Left4Dead was probably my last really passionate survival game(s) I spent way to much time playing
 I am a 40 year old gamer and really don't get rattled by much
 Let me just say, I was NOT prepared for how immersive this game was in VR
 My very first play session lasted about a min, I got overwhelmed with Zombies and I actually said NOPE and took the headset off
 I had to actually mentally prepare myself to go back into this game
 I am having a BLAST, despite it being somewhat difficult for me at my current skill level
 (can't seem to survive past that first real corner on the normal difficulty level, I really don't care, this game makes you want to keep playing
 Highly recommended
Posted: 29 May, 2016
This game is a perfect example of VR does not translate well to 2D trailers
 I almost gave this one a miss until someone posted an impassioned review of how much fun they had
 Picked up Hordz and it is now one of my favorites
 When demoing the Vive I usually bust out Hordz and so far all have excitedly enjoyed it
 When ever I have people back over, Hordz always get a request for a return visit
 It really is good fun
 I'm still working at getting good enough to make it all the way through on hard
Posted: 30 April, 2016
This game shows potential but a few issues stop me coming back for more
1
 The play space moves, it's slow, so not terrible, but it's not great for more than 15mins play
 Especially when looking in a different direction than the velocity is heading
 FLoating disc under the player doesn't help also, it rotates with in your lower periphery
2
 Audio is not spacialised, it gives no clues as to which direction zombies are in and how far away
 The audio in general feels pretty weak
3
 Weapon feels like it needs a 20 degree tilt to match how you would comfortably hold a vive controller and match other shooting games
4
 Switching weapons is pretty awkward, grabing from over the shoulder would feel much nicer
 Just because the controller has buttons doesn't mean you need to use them
 5
 Hit effects need some work, the animation and particle effects don't seem to fire on every hit
 Makes weapons feel less real
Posted: 6 May, 2016
This game wins my first ever Steam Review
 I just felt I should take a minute to show this title some love
 I received my Vive on Monday, 5/2/16 and spent a little time checking out the bundled software and The Lab, since it was free
 From the moment I put on the headset I have been completely blown away by the VR experience
 This stuff is really cool
 So after a few hours of time, spread out over a few days, checking out the free stuff I had, I decide to buy my first game
 Out of the games on my wishlist I decided to go with HordeZ, on nothing more than wondering what it would be like to shoot some zombies on the Vive
 I truly wasn't prepared for the experience I was about to have
Posted: 16 May, 2016
This is perhaps the most fun game available for purchase today on ANY system
-Room scale VR is incredible
 Game slowly moves you through the area on a floating pad, but you can still move around as much as you want in the size of the room you've dedicated to room scale VR, allowing you to physically dodge and run from zombies
-Graphics/sound are fantastic-You can either use guns/grenades and use a magnet gun to "suck" in ammo boxes as they fall around you, or (my favorite) you can just equip two katana swords to ninja your way through the area
-$15
99 is an absolute steal
 I would have paid $50 for this game
The only possible improvement the developers could make is adding gamepad support so when the Virtuix Omni treadmill launches later this year, we can move about in the play area as far as we want to without worrying about hitting walls
A+

Im writing this review after only 13min of playing this game and I can say that this game is scary as hell for me
 I even punched corner of my tv with vive controller
Posted: 25 June, 2016
I passed this game up for several days because I thought the screenshots just didn't look good
 Like other reviews have said, the screenshots just don't do this game any justice
 I kept coming back to the store page and then finally I decided to buy it because of the reviews
 It's absolutely worth it, it's by far the best of the VR zombie games and the only one that delivers a full game experience imo
 The levels are varied and the weapons are fun to use, it's also a very scary experience
 I had to quit out of the game the first couple times I tried it, you eventually get used to the zombies running up to you but it still makes me jump pretty frequently
 I don't review many games but I was so on the fence about this one before I tried it like I'm sure many others are, so let me add to what everyone else says and just ignore the screenshots
 If you want a house of the dead/left 4 dead type of game then this is it and it's a lot of fun
Posted: 14 May
The in game experience feels good, very responsive
 A key to playing at the higher difficulties is to make sure you are always picking up the drops
 I had a lot of fun already and will continue to do so for many more hours
Cons- Sound is not optimized so you don't know which direction new waves are coming from just by sound
 That's it, I love this game
Posted: 25 August, 2016
I don't have a lot of time in it, but what I've played so far, pretty fantastic
 Ask my wife if it's immersive
 She decided this was the first game she would play in VR
 Within a minute of the game starting, she ran to the wall, started screaming, and then started crying
 That, my friends, is VR done right
Posted: 7 May, 2016
The trailers dont do this thing justice
 Despite some short comings, this game offers an arcadey Time Crisis meets Killing Floor experience
 There isnt a ton of depth, but its a zombie shooter, lack of depth isnt a deal breaker
It had good atmosphere, a nice selection of options (some newly added ones, so its great to see the dev's are listening and working on it), from difficulty selection to anti-locomotion (I didnt have any issue with default mode myself)
 Its easy to pick up and play
 Bizarrely, after the initial scary vibe, its almost relaxing to play
 **I have only played it on normal tho, Im sure things get plenty hectic on the 3 higher settings
An addition of a shotgun and some further tweaks and this would go from good to great
UPDATE:Well, they have been adding to and improving the game since I made my review, so I want to thank the devs for being so active and listening to the players
 There is now a shotgun
 And more options and maps have been added
 Ive also played a bit on higher difficulties and its not a relaxing experience (still fun of course
)
 So its gone from good to great
 Can we go to awesome
 :p I believe a boss is in the works and if multiplayer gets improved options, I think the answer is yes :)

Early Access Review
I was pleasantly surprised by Eternity Warriors
 https://youtu
be/nJ2BRzRwE40I thought I was going to be put off by the lack of locomotion option but I think they managed to do it well
 The combination of gameplay pacing and mechanics have you twisting, turning and moving in room scale quick enough that you somewhat lose track of the wanting to run over and throttle that damn archer
 sorry
 Got away from me for a second
The game is pretty
 That's definitely something its got going for it
 The audio was pretty well done as well
There were a tone of achievements for achievement seekers
 Pretty much everything I did resulted in some form of achievement
 They may even want to scale that back IMO
 It seemed a bit too easy to 'achieve' some of them
If I were to gripe about anything it would be the lack of an explaination that each weapon set has it's own set of missions
 It wasn't overly obvious at first
 I eventually figured it out but a bit more upfront and in your face would be nice
On that same vein, the 'different' levels for the different weapons/classes were just different spawns on the same map you just played
 If we're going to say these are entirely different levels then I would like to see the devs go all in and actually make different levels for them
Obviously the lack of locomotion is going to be a big hit to this game
 At this point, a year and a half post consumer vr launch, most of us expect the ability to walk around in some way, shape or form
 There's probably going to be a lot of backlash from this design decision
Again, I think the frantic pacing of the gameplay and the fun of the Warrior class makes up for it but that's just my opinion
 The gunner class was another story
 It wasn't nearly as fun and being able to bob and weave behind cover would have been a bit more interesting I think
 All in all, I like what these guys are going for
 Good visuals, audio, menu system and combat mechanics but most of all, it was fun
 I just wish they didn't have the locomotion black eye
 Still, it will get a thumbs up

Early Access Review
Oh, wow
 I can't believe this is a first day early access game
The game it self feels pretty solid already, so far i haven't experience any bug yet
It have immersive graphic and very fun game play, all three classes are really good and unic in different ways
Unlockable trophies will appear in figurine form on your shelf, and you can pick them up for a better look
Sword and bow are very exercising to play, and guns are kinda in a more relaxing way
Any ways, it is a game that worth to buy even just now for me
I haven't try out multiplayer yet, I will buy it as a gift for my brother so we can try it together
Good work guys
 Thank you for making such a great game, and I can't wait to see more stuff from it
in the future

I have played through every class so far and I was supprised by the amount of effort that put for unique to each class
 If you have the warrior class mobs and bosses will yield different attack styles than when you are using a projectile class
 The graphics are good and very well optimised
 The balance is just right that will keep the game competitive and make you think about when you want to use your health potions depending on what you have to go up against next
For an early access game I have found no bugs so far and it is as polished as most complete games out there, you can't go wrong with it for the price
 A definite game to have in your library for showing off your VR HMD to friends that want instant action

I love this game
It's fun
I think the graphics are beautifully done
It's a solid fun experience - for a short wave based shooter of the type
The way the developers have slightly changed the nature of the waves based upon weapon choice by players is very well done
Nice one
It's not a full fledged RPG but it doesn't pretend to be one
It is what it is and what it is is a fun experience
Good job

Early Access Review
This game really surprised me
I did not think i would enjoy it
Another wave shooter and a no locomotion wave shooter at that
And the first few waves seemed to confirm my misgivings
But oh my, how the difficulty ramped up and how the variety of enemies increased
It seems the gates of hell have opened and every manner of demon has descended upon you
You're getting attacks from all angles and you're dodging, blocking, melee-ing, and shooting seemingly one after the other, non-stop action
And that's normal difficulty after just a few waves
And you feel like a boss after surving that unholy onslaught
Then you're faced with the last boss of the wave
And you get wrecked
You think of restarting but you're sweating all over
Damn that was fun
Gonna have to try that again tomorrow
Maybe I'll try the guns tomorrow instead of the bow and arrrow
That sword and board seems like an arm injury waiting to happen so I'll save that for last
You go back to the main menu and see all the trophies you have yet to earn
Not sure I can do that, but it'll be fun trying
Rating 8/10 one of the best wave shooters no doubt and the 3 classes all play differently

Bought this for the sexy demon lady
 Stayed in for the nerve wrecking, anxiety striking mayhem
 The game's design is for a lack of a better word- spectacular, with the attention to sound being the one thing that stood out to me
 Whether it be teleporting enemies or enemies charging at you- you can hear them and know when and where they will be coming from- which while awesome also grips you with fear as you turn to face them
 The weapons feel good (except the bow and arrow) and generally reward accuracy
 For the price, Eternity Warriors is an artistic and gameplay masterpiece that I highly recommend anyone with a VR enabled device give a go at; the enemies design forces you to actually stratergize whether to kill them or not; and compared to many other VR first person shooters, the game actually has many mechanically unique enemies with different looks and attack sets
 10/10 would recommend sexy demon lady20/10 would recommend for gameplay

Quick first impression from a DCS world A10C fanIf 0 was arcade and 10 was full blown flight sim this would come in somewhere around 6
5 in terms of systems which is a nice balance between fun and realism
The devs obviously know a fair bit about aircraft operations, there is no quick start
 Battery power, APU needs to be fired up first, HUD turned on ect but then no 15 mins wait for NAV system to finish aligning or more complex systems that would take along time to learnThe flight modeling for fast forward flight feels fine and is not too challenging
 VTOL is hard, I mean really hard to get the hang of
This means many will love the challenge while some will find it very fustrating (maybe there is an auto hover function but I have not found it yet)
Personally I love the fact that I suck at it, it means I have to put some time into learning to fly the dam thingThe controls are well though out the grip button is used to lock hand to collective and/or stick is a very good idea
I honestly think I would be flying alot better with my HOTAS but the trade off is I can use the systems with my hand without having to find my controller and let go of my HOTASI recommend this game but for some it will be not hardcore enough, for others it will be frustrating if you have zero experience at this type of game perhapes
The scenery is by far the weakest part of this game and I would very much like to see it improved over time
It's deffently worth checking out if you have any intrest in flying thoughWill it replace DCS:world
Not a chance but I really don't think that's the aim, its fast and fun
 can't really argue with that

If you like DCS World and want something more VR friendly, buy this game
If you want to like DCS world but cannot force yourself to enjoy reading the 700 page manuals, buy this game
If you have a background in flight simulators and want to try it in VR, buy this game
This game bridges the gap between simulator and arcade games
 There are semi-complex systems and procedures, but they are learned in less than 10 minutes
 They are simple to learn, but hard to master
 Active development means new features and systems are on the way, and the devs are active on their discord servers to answer questions
HOWEVER this game has some drawbacks, being in early access
 At the time of writing some of the tutorials are unfinished, but the creator has youtube videos to fill the gap until the interactive ones are complete
 All the voice acting is done by one person, and is in general kind of lame
 I believe that this will change in the future at some point in development
There is a "story mode" campaign, which connects (at time of writing) 5+ missions in a narrative, there is also a freefly mode that lets you fly with no enemies, static targets for weapons practice, or a full on hostile island with large battles occuring
I fully reccomend this game

Ultrawings did a decent job emulating the stick with hand controllers, but VTOL VR is simply incredibile: you can configure your (virtual) seat and the stick position, placing the VR wand over your knee so it acts and bends like a physical stick
 The thrust lever as well, it's super intuititve and precise
 The whole cockpit is the better example of interactive panel I ever seen in VR, there are plenty of controls but all of them user friendly and readable
I feel guilty because I was following VTOL from some time, but was skeptical: landscape looks blurry and lack details, the airplane is not appealing, the virtual cockpit looks weird to manage just by hands
 I had a chance to try it and was so wrong about everything

Early Access Review
This is really very cool
Flight sims are the primary reason I bought a Rift
As a result, seeing new flight sims developed for VR makes the experience that much better
I did a free flight around the area
 The flight controls are extremely intuitve
I was about to find the tanker and refuel
I was then able to make a vertical landing as well as an arrestor cable landing to test functionality
All in all, the VTOL feels like a cross between an A-10 and a Ka-50 in DCS
I say Ka-50 as there is no counter-torque required
The flight controls are complicated, yet forgiving with SAS enabled
My only gripe is the less than precise rudder inputs
If the developer adds support for rudder pedals, it would make control inputs that much better
 I am really looking forward to watching this game develop

I have played most of the flight sims in VR and this is one of the best
 Highly recommended if you are looking for an immersive flight combat experience
 Pros:
- Interactive cockpit
 The thing I dislike most about flight sims in VR is having to keybind everything to your HOTAS somehow
- This game was designed for VR, unlike most other flight sims it requires a much less powerful graphics cards to render at 90 fps
- Systems are not too difficult to learn, but also not too easy
 hovering takes a while to get used to, but otherwise there would be no challenge
 The developer has found a good balance betwee realism and fun
Cons:
-
Joy stick does not seem to respond as I would expect it to, especially with yaw
 I have a HOTAS that I would love to be able to use the movements feel much more precise and I can feel where my controls are without having to look at them, whereas with the controllers I sometimes find that my hands are in a different location in respect to my controls than I thought
 Overall, this game is a blast
 I feel like an actual pilot when playing, and at the same time I am watching my skills grow as I am becoming more intune with the aircraft controls and more knowledgable about the aircraft systems
 Games like this are the reason I have been excited for VR, I have been waiting for a game like this for years
 I can't wait to see it grow and add on more features
 Hopefully many more features will be released, including multiplayer

This is a great game in early development
 I have been waiting since the Vive was released for a VR F16/Helicopter fighter game as when this game came out I jumped on it
 The game puts you in a cockpit of a warplane and you have buttons, alot of buttons
 You use your Vive wands throughout the whole game to control your hands in the cockpit with the ability to press buttons, flip switches, and even grab a virtual flight stick and throttle freely
 The in game tutorials help you learn how to fly but it will take lots of practice to master
 Its one of my top 5 games on the Vive and its one of those games that you just cant explain or describe how amazing it is until you try it

Wow
 Just Wow
 I have not been this floored trying a VR game in a while
 This is the flight sim
 The HUD is amazing
 I think the interaction depth and modularity is unmatched in VR
The only downside is the tutorials are not finished
 The very basics are covered and you are left to fend for yourself to figure out the rest of the functionality
Amazing game
 A must have for anyone remotely intrested in sims

Early Access Review
I've been wanting to review this since I bought it, but figured I'd give it a few more hours of my time before coming to a final verdict
Short and sweet, this game has its flaws, but is well worth the seemingly absurd price
 I'd pay more for it if it costed more, but I'm glad it doesn't
 I've spent more money on much less entertainment
VTOL VR has a good balance of arcade and sim
 As others mentioned, the flight model is simple enough for inexperienced players to pick up on without a lot of time investment, and complex enough for veteran flight sim players to feel comfortable in
 There are definitely some areas that could use improvement, but overall, for the state it's in right now, considering it came out less than a month ago, it is excellent
It has some performance issues
 I'm running a 7700K at 4
2 with a 1080, and most of the missions that start you on the carrier (quick flight on hostile island, and campaign mission 4 in particular) generate some heavy frame drops, almost to a sickening point
 Utilizing the spectator cam makes this much, much worse as I've found out tonight
 Definitely going to need some major optimization down the roadWith performance issues aside, this game is a blast, and probably the most fun I've had in VR since early Sairento and H3VR
 The fact that it also puts you in the seat of a fighter aircraft is pretty sweet, too
 Since you don't move, it's playable in my small room, where I can't play room-scale games; I typically have to move my entire setup downstairs into my living room to do that
There is a plethora of weaponry to choose from, and each one has its own uses and downsides
 The weapons systems seem very realistic, from what little I know of air combat systems, and are a blast to use when you figure out how they work
 Using CCIP/CCRP with bombs is awesome, and head-tracking air-to-air missile locks on jets screaming over your cockpit is simply exhilarating
 The developer is consistently pumping out new tutorials on weapon systems usage and most of it is pretty intuitive
 The cockpit UI is simplified enough that you don't have to worry about 90% of the stuff a real pilot would, and you can just get right to the action (well, once you've figured out how to engage the APU, start the engines, unlock the brakes, swivel your engines, release the catapault hook, set the flaps

Early Access Review
It's still an early access game, but somehow the experience of flying and fighting feels complete, even though the game itself is not finished yet
Controlling the aircraft with tracked controllers instead of joystick or HOTAS systems feels natural and is very well designed
 The flght physics and aircraft systems are hardcore enough to call this game a simulator, yet they are very simple to learn, especially with some experience from other flight sims
I've played most of flight simulators available today, and this one of my favourite flight sim games, highly recommended
 VR adds a lot to the immersion, but that's not the main selling point, the game is very good on it's own

I'm still shaking and my Vive is sweaty
I thought I'd do okay at this - I have good balance and I'm not afraid of heights
 I was feeling a little gutsy so I grabbed the longest, narrowest plank in my garage
 I walked it a few times IRL -
no problem
 But when I fired up Richie's Plank Experience
 oh boy
Que a solid ten minutes of me with one foot in the elevator and one on the plank whispering to myself "it's not real, it's not real
" When I got brave enough to step halfway out, I panicked
 I hit the home button in a cheap attempt to escape - but to my horror, the menu was transparent, and I could still see myself standing on the plank
 There was no way out of this
 I closed the menu and had to shimmy back into the elevator, my heart beating out of my chest
 Trembling, defeated, I hit the elevator button and did a little skywriting first, to get myself used to the idea of flying (and falling)
The firefighting is definitely the best part of this game
 I had a blast and felt like a superhero zooming around the city
 I can't wait to see this expanded and to have more goals (and ways to lose)
And yes, I finally did make it across that plank - but when I got a little too confident and tried to execute a graceful turn, I plummeted to my death
 RIP

Absolutely loving this
Already close to 30min & had to break to do some real work
 ;)Graphics:
Quite nice - beautiful city, rendered nicely
Atmospheric - from objects in environment (birds, heli, cars) it makes the env feel quite *alive*
Will post a few ideas/recommendations in the forums for devSound:
Fits the theme/setting - admittedly I was playing w/o headphones (just listening to monitor) but will test again laterFun:
LOTS
 Might cure someone with acrophobia
or just frighten them away from VR for good (in a good way)
Definitely recommend, for added immersion, setting up a *plank*, although even w/o I'd imagine still a fun experience (particularly as the plank is only part of the fun)Gameplay/Replayability:
Enjoyed walking the plank (had a plank setup, elevated) - going near top of 1st for my "1st time in VR" demos
BEYOND the plank - spent even more time doing the rocket-based fire fighting & really got a kick out of this (hence my comment that even w/o plank setup there's more to do & enjoy)
Seriously this might be the best "flying super hero" core mechanics we've yet to be able to experience in VR
 (plank walking aside
)General:
I've been quite impressed, following this just for a while now, with devs communications in forums & discussions about roadmap/status/etc
 With EA games, this is important for me, as I've voted-with-dollars before on EA titles that didn't have much communication from devs/community involvement/engagement & those were the ones who seemed to drift away immediately
 Much more confident with the communication & engagement we've got a lasting commitment to the full release, as well as something that's already well worth the time & money
Price:
For just barely more than "a high end coffee" out, where I live, this is a bargain as is
 I've frequently spent more-for-less on other VR titles
 And the uniqueness of this type of VR experience, perhaps more-so for those who setup a "plank" of sorts (imagine create ways besides lumber this can be done - heck, lrg carboard box folded over few times might just do it)
For anyone interested in a unique VR experience, that can also incorporate a "real world prop" for added realmism, and/or enjoys a fun "flying game" mechanic - I'd recommend the purchase
Looking forward to following this as it develops
TL;DR - bargain price, very unique experience (both plank & flight gameplay), more polished than many EA VR titles, active dev who engages community

I have been waiting for this ever since I heard about the Beta a little while ago
The game has 3 modes
 First is the Plank walk, where you go to the top of a skyscraper via elevator ,Then walk onto the plank, jump off and die, ect
 Basic but fun
Second is the Sky Writer mode, one hand holds a paint shooting rocket, the other allows you to pick different colors
 You fly around and sky write
 Also basic, but fun
 I made some neat stuff with it
The main reason I was waiting for this, was the flying mode
 You are given two rockets (The right hand can switch a rocket for a fire hose that you use to put out fires around the city
)Fast Iron Man style flying was so much fun, I put out a few fires, then played chicken with cars, flew up the sides of buildings, ect
I love what I played so far, and can't wait to see whats added to it
 Fingers crossed for some spiderman style swinging, cars that I can pick up and throw around, and some super villain fights
assuming it ever goes that route
It was worth the money to me

This is the go-to "game" for anyone I am introducing to VR
The best part is that the developer keeps adding to the experience and improving on graphics and effects
They keep up with the holidays and seasons so the experience stays fresh for veteran VR owners as well
Two solid thumbs up
Devs, keep up the great work
VR users, buy this experience you won't be sorry

This is absolutely, hands-down, THE BEST VR experience I ever had
 At times this game had my heart racing or just laughing hysterically
 It's just great
 It doesn't seem like there's much game here but looks are deceiving
 Basically, you take an elevator up to different floors
 The main attraction is a high floor that opens to a plank hanging out into the air
 Walking it feels so frightening
 If you go the extra mile and actually use a real plank to walk on, the immersion will have your heart racing and in cold sweats
 And if you fall off the plank
 Let's just say I'm going to rule out jumping from a building as a form of suicide if I ever become despondent
There are other floors that you can mess around with
 A really fun one has you putting out fires
with a jet
 This mode lets you fly around the city using a rocket jet in one hand and a fire hose in the other
 Crazy, right
 But it works
 You can fly anywhere you want and it just feels so cool
 You can land on tall buildings, look down, fly away, land on a car, fly straight up, and let yourself fall to your death
 It
 Never
 Gets
 Old
 Until you start feeling sick
 I'm still a little dizzy writing this review
 It's not terrible, but this game is best enjoyed in short bursts

WARNING: Flight Sticks don't work with this game
 Don't get one for this
 M+KB recommended
Everspace reminds me of those space shooters of old, but throws several other things in the mix
 You are required to jump through sectors until you reach a wormhole, leading you to a new zone
 A hostile reptile race patrols those sectors and seems to follow you with a powerful fleet
 You get a set amount of time to explore a sector before their arrival is announced and you need to leg it
 Do you have enough fuel to make the jump without taking damage
 Did you find enough ressources to enable further travels
 Or have you been sleeping and suddenly find yourself unable to get away
 It's not the end of the world
 You accumulate credits during missions, which can be spent AFTER you die
 On abilities which make your future runs easier
 Another clone of you enters a ship and starts his voyage anew, strenghtened by your wise choices in talents
The secors are procedurally generated and require you to search them to get enough ressources for repairs and upgrades to your ship
 This has to be done each time from point zero, although you can select a starting loadout for your ships, once you have found some components
 You can also find blueprints to weapons and more, which will let you craft those items during future runs
TL;DR: A mix of Elite and FTL, with permadeath, procedurally generated maps and progression beyond death
 You can actually only learn new abilities AFTER you die
Posted: 20 September
Beautiful game
 Easy to learn
 Arcade not sim
If you are looking for a space flight/combat sim, this is not it
If you are looking for a casual action shooter set in a space fighter theme, then this is for you
I ended up refunding the game
 I bought it under the wrong understanding
 Bad youtube suggestion
 But I do not want to not recommend the game and lower it's score
 It is what it is
 So, I will leave a YES as a recommendation
It is just not the game I was looking for
Posted: 12 October
It's basically Edge of Tomorrow: The Videogame
 Get to stage 2, die, upgrade ship, get to stage 3 die, upgrade ship, get to stage 4 die
 Looks gorgeous and exploration is rewarded
 Combat is fun but more variety on enemies would be nice
 Also reminds me of Colony Wars if anyone is that old

An indie rogue-like that feels like a mixture of FTL with Freespace-ish 6DOF space combat
 Beautiful visuals, good optimization, satisfing ship customization & crafting, survival elements, fun space battles
 It's awesome
Some Tips:- Always lock your target to see where you have to lead your fire
- Never stop moving while in a fight
 Try to 'strafe' and use the afterburner every now and then while changing directions
- The Energy Injector is a cheap & really powerful consumable
 It's like a 'potion' that maxes your energy instantly
 You can outrun anything with it and the afterburner as you can have 4 at a time, and you can even craft extras mid battle
 It also allows you to lay down continuous fire in long encounters
- Do not fight the battles you cannot win
 Just run away if you are outnumbered badly
- Mines and missiles can devastate enemies
 Use them
- Hide behind asteroids to avoid taking damage in a solar flare (large sun storm)
- In electric storms your shield will be damaged constantly, but your energy will fill up
 Some zones are entirely covered in such a storm
 This will not hurt your ship's hull
- All hazards like solar flares and electric storms also damage the enemy ships
- Different weapons have different ranges
 Some close quarter weapons need you to be at 1000m or even less, but some are effective from 4000m away
- Switch weapons to fight efficiently
 Pulse Laser has high shield damage, but low hull damage
 Gatling has high hull damage, but low shield damage
 Beam laser is mediocre in both
 Different projectiles are useful in different situations
- Use everything
 :) A fight is very different when you activate devices like the Time Extender and Weapon Overdrive, while taking consumables like the Energy Injector and the Shield Booster, when compared to just shooting your Primary Weapons and that's it
Posted: 31 May
Pros:-Butt-clenching combat, extremely fast and responsive movement allows for high skill cap evasive maneuvering and using the enviroment to your advantage
-Death doesn't feel bad because you'll spend your earned credits that run on talents/passives, improving your capabilities in all future runs
-Player skill, i
e aiming and evading fire are crucial to your success, really pushes you to your limits when you hit low health
-Looks great, minus perhaps the cockpit and retical UI
Cons:-Some soundtracks don't fit at all, feels like there are too many genres, but some soundtracks do fit great
Conclusion:I don't see any reason why this game shouldn't be at 90% steam rating, so here's my thumbs up
Posted: 15 August
QUICK OVERVIEWEverspace is a sci-fi arcade roguelite
 It's designed to be played with mouse/keyboard, and it works beautifully
 The game combines the progression of FTL, the controls of Freelancer/Descent, and the upgrades of Rogue: Legacy
 I'm not a fan of VR or Joystick controls; while Everspace has these options available, the game excels without them
Everspace IS NOT:Space simulationOpen worldEconomic traderSandboxEXTENDED OVERVIEWI've followed Everspace since it's initial Kickstarter campaign back in 2015, because I was on-board the idea of a roguelike shooter in space
 As a huge fan of both FTL and Freelancer, the thought of combining the two was a dream come true
 This is what the developers set out to do, borrowing components from both games (progression from FTL, controls from Freelancer)
 Add a dash of the permanent progression like that of Rogue: Legacy, and you get Everspace
It also helps the team comes over having last worked on the Galaxy on Fire Series, which are some highly successful mobile games with a similar feel
SCI-FI ARCADE ROGUELITEEverspace has you running through a part of the Beltegrades (the cluster formation the game takes place in) over and over again every successive run
 You don't pick up where you left off, but rather start from scratch every time
 Each run is different from the previous run: you'll find new points of interest, new gear, and new challenges ahead
 All the loot in the game is randomized (though you can narrow down what you find by searching in key locations), and the crafting system gets pretty ridiculous once you unlock it all
Speaking of unlockables, every successive run allows you to utilize any unlocks you've found in previous runs
 This includes pure aesthetics like ship colors, extensive crafting options through collecting blueprints, and entire-run modifiers known as enhancements that can change core elements of the game
 Credits that are earned through a run are spent on permanent upgrades to the pilot, or to one of the three current ships available in the hangar (though you have to buy the other two ships with in-game Credits before you can start upgrading them)
If you're in the game just for story alone, you won't be disappointed
 It might seem basic at first, but the further you progress, you unveil more about your past
 When it all comes together, the game becomes pretty psychological as well
 OR, you can just play the game to shoot baddies in space
 Can't go wrong, either way
THIS GAME IS HARD
 Some call the game "Dark Souls in Space," and rightfully so
 Furthermore, the tutorial goes by fast
 Little pop-ups try to help the player along the way, but once they also vanish permanently after being closed
 The game's systems are simple in nature but can get pretty deep; I highly recommend watching other players tackle the game to see it's full capabilities
 I've showcased high level play of Everspace on my Youtube Channel here
SUMMARYChallenging arcade space shooter with roguelike elements
 There's a bit of a learning curve for new players; highly recommend finding video or a guide on someone who knows what they're doing
 This game is immensely rewarding if you love the repetition of run after run after run, trying to succeed ever further than your last

Early Access Review
Everspace is only the 5th game that I have supported on early access – with the rest being Into the Stars, Darkest Dungeon, Offworld Trading Company and Rimworld
 I have done it because I was more than aware what will they be and what they will represent
 As such, I can tell you that I have high hopes about this game, as it already has an extremely strong base, and it performs beautifully
 All it needs now is some more content
But first thing’s first: What is Everspace
Well, if you don't like to read, or want to see how the game looks like then watch - but be aware that I am quite sick at the time of the recording, so my voice sounds weird: https://www
youtube
com/watch
v=l9RtNUbJUkM(Doing the new vid is postponed due to the new job I started which eats roughly 11 hours a day of my game time
 So yeah - real life reasons
)Everspace is a fly-and-die, 40% Faster than Light, 20% Freelancer, 10% Into the Stars and 30% inovation
 It takes the core FTL rogue-like idea of travelling between sectors in order to achieve a certain goal (which we don’t know yet as the story has not been fully implemented) and builds up on it by adding mining and sector saturation (from Into the Stars, meaning the longer you stay in the same spot the worse it gets, so you can’t mine and loot forever), trading and basic missions (so far), very much like Freelancer, and the rest is innovation – unlike any of those 3 games, here you have upgrades that persist, and more importantly, the ability to craft ammunition, and even systems and weapons for your ship once you discover the necessary blueprints
As such, there is a visible and sensible progression that makes you keep going back to the game
So, what’s GOOD as of version 0
13
1
 Perfectly optimized graphics, easily holding 60 fps on 1080p at all times
 I play on a fancy laptop with a 970M 3GB Vcard and I never saw something below 56 frames
 I had no stuttering, everything moved fluidly and I was enjoying myself thoroughly
2
 Very responsive and snappy controls, even on keyboard and mouse, the way I usually like to play
 The only times I ever mishit a key was when I was in panic mode - which is already saying something
3
 The space is beautiful and very diverse and a pleasure to fly and explore it
4
 The musical score is very pleasant and does not try to impose itself on you – which is something I really enjoy in intense space battle games where I need to focus on my survival and not on the booming hard rock
5
 You have a level of control – rather than shoving out to us another rogue-like with permadeath and “you suck bro” mechanics, here you get credits, which you can spend on passive upgrades to the ship after you die (and you will, a lot)
 Then, during the mission, you will obtain weapons, equipment, and various resources that you can use to craft ammunition, weapons, and system for your ship with the blueprints you will find in your travels
 And if that wasn’t enough, there are upgradable weapons and pieces of equipment with the upgrade blueprints you find
 Want a shield-busting
Gatling Gun
 You can have it
 Want a 3 km range Beam
 Yep
 There are so many combinations for you to test and obliterate your opponents in many satisfying ways
6
 I would venture to say that the game is pretty bug-free, as the worst I encountered so far was a scrap element inside an inaccessible part of a derelict, but once I got close I still got it
 So
And now, to take a look at the BAD
1
 You need to accept the fact that you will die a LOT in this game
 In the 5 hours that I played the game for prior to the review, I died 14 times, which is roughly 1 death every 20 minutes
 If you don’t like such games, where your death means a better start for the next run, you should stay away from this game
2
 I would say that you need at least 2 hours in order to set yourself a decent ship and a number of useful blueprints for you to craft
 While this will mean that regardless of the loot in your future play-throughs you will always have a secondary option, it takes some time to get there, and it might be a certain turn-off to some players
 3
 Since every map is randomly generated, even if you’re in a low-risk sector, you may find yourself between multiple enemies (for example 3 Outlaws and 3 Orrak), which usually spells your doom
 And it doesn’t get helped by the fact that from sector 4 and ahead, the enemies get way tougher…4
 Credits do not roll over - if you don't spend as much of your cash as possible on upgrades on the new pilot after the last one died, you will LOSE them flat out
 The game DOES warn you about it, but if you are the fast clicker type (I myself am one every now and then), you will skip the warning and be left without a possible good upgrade
 Not fun
Things to consider: so far, according to the developer, there will be no planet exploration and no in-game economy
 Whether there will be more elaborate missions, we will need to wait and see – as most of the missions right now are simple, like rescue a fleet/vessel under attack or deliver cargo to a neighboring system
 Also, just like FTL, there is no going back – the only way for you is ahead, until you reach the final goal
 While there are always 3 challenges for you to keep you occupied, the game does need to add some more meat on its bones
 But that is coming :)EA Conclusion:For me, the game has enough about itself to merit a purchase at this stage
 The battles are intense, the crafting systems are meaningful and you can feel yourself progressing and improving as you keep on playing the game
 Unlike FTL, I never felt like I had a “zero progress” run, which is something I really like about Everspace
 I don’t mind dying in a game – I am all good if it’s for something
 I remain very hopeful that this game will do well – as I said, I don’t pledge money on early access if I don’t have enough reasons to believe that it is going to make it

Early Access Review
It has been a while since I played a proper space game and it is refreshing that they are still being made
 I have been following this game for a while and I can now say that it was worth paying attention to
 If you enjoy a Rogue, Darkstar One type of game with gorgeous graphics, intense and skillbased battles and on top of that, rock solid performance - then this game is for you
You start off with a ship and some basic equipment, you have to hack, scan, fight, craft and loot items and credits to upgrade your ship on the path trough the levels and sectors
 The further you travel, the tougher it gets
 You only have one life so choose your moves carefully, this mean that if your ship gets destroyed, you die and have to start over
 Don't let that scare you though, it makes the game a lot more intense, and the credits you have accumulated on the previous run can be used to buy perks which will help you on future travels
I am impressed with what I have seen so far and I can easily recommend it to other people who are into these type of games
 Looking forward to see where the devs will take it

Early Access Review
I honestly didn't expect a lot when I saw the game costs only 9,99€ (currently 5,99€ in sale) and got suprised by how good it actually is and how much it has to offer for this price tag
Currently there is a tutorial and three maps to play on
 You have to fight multiple waves and a boss at the end
 At the end of every wave you can purchase new ammo, guns or unlock skills
 A lot of guns need a higher level to unlock so you need a bit of time to unlock them all
The game has some great features like the possibility to hit zombies with the stock of your gun
 Also melee weapons will do more damage the harder you hit the zombies with your motion controller
When you manage to get some consecutive critical hits the game will be in slow motion for a while which is really satisfying as there is a lot of blood and splatter
 I also have to mention the loud and powerful gun sounds
ZomDay looks quite good (for a VR game) and also runs really smooth with 1
5x supersampling on high end hardware even when there's a lot of blood and splatter on the screen
The only things I can complain about is that there is only teleport movement at the moment which also makes it quite easy to beat bosses
 Also you can't manually reload guns which I always loved in other VR games
All in all ZomDay is a satisfying wave shooter with quite a good amount of progression and content for the price
I can recommend it to all HMD owners who like games like Killing Floor or COD Zombies

Very early review update as more time played
 But for the reduced price this game is at the moment, it's a must buy
 Yes it's Zombies and yes it has waves but it also has a loot system, co-op play, perks, upgrade of weapons and intense fun gameplay
 It is teleport but have not
checked options for other movement options but will do

Best Zombie VR Wave Shooter yet
 You can clearly see that developers made a game that they would love to play themselves
 It feels overall polished with good graphics, nice gameply and an extensive exp mechanic
For now there is only teleportation
 But I would say it fits the gameplay fine
 Maybe one day they might add Onward locomotion
 But even without it is great fun
 Price is also very fair
 I feels finished and has this kind of Resident Evil 6 MP atmosphere
 If you like this you will love the game
I would say a MUST-HAVE in your VR library

Early Access Review
I think this could be my first review for a game, i think it deservers it, the price you can't knock really, it at least half of what it should be
 The game itself is very challenging and imo one of the best VR games on the market, it has* great intense action* fantastic options menu ( one of the best ive seen ) you can
change so
much
* has all the setups you
could need for pretty much any VR configuration* it has a tonne of weapons* and a very active and great set of developers that are constantly updating the gameI think give it another 6 months this could become a masterpiece, at the moment i think it just lacks bigger maps but in saying that the smaller more compact arena maps are by no means a bad thing
 I think it would be totally fantastic to see a single player campaign mode but given the amount of work that would require i totally wouldnt expect it nore would i be disapointed
A great VR game if you have VR buy it
 its on par with robo recall if not better especially if you prefer the zombie scene

Holy S**T
This game is hardcore action
Its just a neverending violence addiction to kill waves of zombies with rage like gameplayWorth way more than the current price ($9
99)+Realistic guns+Zombie Massacre+Blood and Gore+Lvl Up System - Unlock firearms and Perks as you advance+Nicely done GFX+Hulking Bosses await at the end round-Only 3 levels as of now but more content to be revealed soon
-Melee combat is difficult (for example using the axe is going to get you killed quick)+Combat with Guns is so satisifying and effective though
(Massacre Unlimited)And YES the STEAM version now has English--Highly Recommended--OVERALL

For an early develpment game this thing is awesome
Needs more achievements
 As a note to the developers, it doesn't display my 1000K donation achievement in the library
Most likely a glitch
This game is very addictive
There's loot to collect
 Upgrades to attain, And kittens to trip up zombies
That's original
Can't wait to see what the final product will be be
Well worth the investment
 Going for my 3rd map in God Mode cause daddy needs his super happy funtime shotgun :)

It's essentially a chinese version of Killing Floor 2 in VR
 I love it
 The game runs perfectly on an Oculus Rift(the hands are awkwardly aligned, but the guns and melee weapons are perfectly fine as-is)
 If you run the game in Windows 7 compatibility mode, you can avoid the spawning in the ground glitch that occurs on Oculus

A MUST BUY
Fast action
this is how Serious Sam should be in VR
full teleporting using the thumbpad
I had a blast with various weapons, my favorite is the chainsaw
in addition to blasting enemies there is a little Indiana Jones style action
you will not regret playing this game
Posted: 20 December, 2016
Early Access Review
This is pretty much the best game in VR right now, and that's not a slight against the best ones that are out there
 Serious Sam is pure fun
 It's in early access, which means the cutscenes and dialogue and the like are missing, but the game experience
itself, at least as far as I've gotten, is complete
Imagine the action of wave shooter like Space Pirate Trainer that you can play with teleport locomotion like Arizona Sunshine or trackpad locomotion like Onward, played on gigantic, free-roaming multi-level maps in grand temples and outdoor vistas like you find in Solus Project
 Find secret doors and compartments
 Look for hidden loot and power-ips
 Mix it all together with enemies that range in size from giant toads to skyscrapers all trying to kill you from every direction
 Throw in duel-weilded rocket launchers, tommy guns, double barred shotties, pulse rifles, chainsaws and giant black powder cannon, mix it all up and start shooting
 Throw in multiplayer co-op, just for the hell of it
 That's Serious Sam
 And the whole thing is now in VR
Doom 3 showed how a classic FPS could be converted into VR
 Serious Sam FE VR shows what can be done with a little professional TLC thrown on top
 Even in Early Access it's got all the features built in, mainly because it's the same great game Croteam perfected so long ago, brought up to modern standards
Except now it's in VR, and you can freely aim your rocket launcher at the gargantuan scorpion monster in front of you while sweeping your tommy gun behind your back to take care of those pesky suicide bombers trying to flank you
 Sam, it's great to have you back
Posted: 20 December, 2016
Early Access Review
This is the classic game, with professional and intelligent VR enhancements
It's hardcore
 It's excellent
 It's not for everyone
Pro tip: If you aren't at risk for VR sickness, turn on the touchpad motion controls, and find the control to change strafing to be head position based, not "hand position based"
 you will be circle strafing like an old pro, with the VR fun of aiming much improved, original weapons, dealing with enemies that have been adapted to VR (that is, they are in smaller numbers and have new mechanics like shooting down certain incoming projectiles, and much more), and, well, etc
It's completely excellent
 If you are Serious enough, get the settings right, and revel in the amazing hardcore experience
 If this kind of game is your kind of game, it's 11/10, because it's the best at being exactly what it is

Go play this
 It's very very good
 This is how you make a great VR FPS
Offer people choice of movement, and dont compromise
Loads of old games will make GREAT vr experiences, and this one is among the best I've played on the Vive so far (Quake was also fantastic btw)
 It reminds me of playing Half-Life 2 on the original Oculus DK1 in fact
One of the best VR experiences I've had
Wish I could do it again, with motion controls just like this

I paid 800+ dollars for a headset so I could get motion sickness and use two guns at once in Serious Sam

I just played this for the first time, and couldn't put it down for over an hour
I only stopped because it's late ;)Love the ability to set movement options
I don't get motion sickness, so really appreciate being able to use the trackpad on my HTC Vive controller to move
Honestly moving and strafing with the trackpad, and aiming with my hands made me feel like I was in my 20's and playing Doom for the first time
This game makes an old man feel like a teenager :)

Visually impressive, nostalgically entertaining
 Turns out, shooting 2 rocket launchers at once is a cool thing to do
 This game may have saved VR for me
Posted: 22 July
This game is essentially the HD version of "First Encounter" but with VR - and this review will only focus on the things that seperates those two versions
I played it on an Oculus Rift CV1 with Touch controllers
 The VR implementation is really well done
 The devs understood that there is no silver bullet locomotion method that'll satisfy everybody, and implemented a bunch of options
 There's both blink teleportation and traditional stick locomotion
 There's also smooth or snap turning
 I went full oldschool with smooth rotation and analouge stick movement
 There are even 3 options for "forward": Head direction, hand direction and room orientation
Emulating my old mouse/keyboard playstyle with these controls was a bit iffy at first, but once I got the hang of it, it was second nature again
One of the biggest differences in gameplay vs the flat version is that you can dual wield ANY weapon
 This means the devs had to re-balance the damage model somewhat, making the weapons feel a bit weaker
 Still feels awesome having a minigun in each hand mowing down hordes of enemies :)I don't know if the scaling has changed from the flat version or if it's just VR making you perceive it differently, but one thing is for sure: Everything is so impressively gigantic
 From the building structures to the big enemies
 It really adds an epic element to it all
Of course I would've loved improved assets for the VR version, as the 3d models and textures don't hold up very well compared to other 2017 VR titles, but it's tolerable
Having some new custom animations for chainsaw kills would've been awesome
 Instead you get the same old animation regardless of which angle you slice 'em
 This made the chainsaws feel so unsatisfying to use that I abandoned them completely within 10 minutes
The only bugs I experienced was during the last boss fight which still hasn't been fixed with the latest patch
 Since the devs felt that jump pads would be too intense in VR, they changed the mechanics of activating the big laser gun, and they messed something up, so that the rings are sometimes unreachable, or simply not working
 I finally managed to cirumvent the bugs and kill the boss, but the achievement didn't unlock
 Despite the mess they made with the last fight, imo Croteam succeded in bringing FE to VR
 Even though there are some discounts when you own certain other SS titles, I find the price a bit steep
 Still, there aren't many VR fps shooters out there that can scratch the same old school itch like this title
70%

Absolutely bonkers
 It's always been so, but I still can't believe my eyes after the graphical revamp they did in May
 The game is incredibly beautiful, fluid like crazy (I got this weird feeling of having more than 60 FPS, on a 60Hz monitor) and thrilling as hell
 In the first environment, you will discover how technical and precise you have to be in order to try and do the best times/rankings
 In the last ones, you can't care about that: the tracks are so hard, yet actually possible to do with training, making them incredibly fun
 Oh and by the way, the music is beautiful
I deem the amount of different ships and all the liveries/colors to be absolutely enough
 The cash needed to buy them is collected fairly rapidly, you won't have the feeling to go on an endless grind
 Just do the career mode, even rush it, you'll have all the money you need
As for the DLC: buy it
 Driving the track in Class IV is the most breathtaking experience I have ever had in a driving game, and god know I played many
 As for the music, the choice to make it instrumental-only is well done: it makes for epic races
So, yeah, absolute thumbs up, this game deserves far more success than it's got as of right now

Easily the best racing game I've ever played, and here's why:Pros+ Fast
 REALLY fast
+ Amazing tracks
+ Coolest racing vehicles I have seen in recent times
+ Literally the best music currently in video games
 Period
+ Arcade feel is sculpted to perfection
+ Clean and polished with amazing optimization
 No issues
 Nothing left out
 Finished game that works well
+ DLC is actually good DLC
+ Challenging races keep you occupied for hours
Marry F Zero and Hydro Thunder and you get this wonderful piece of art

Absolute blast
 Best Wipeout successor
 However a shame that I don't have a 360 or ds4 controller
 I tried it on m/kb and my Steam Controller but this game MUST be played on a classic controller with 2 analog sticks, it's crucial to get the most control out of it for pitching and strafing which you will need to do
 A lot
Posted: 12 June
-Pros-- This game is beautiful
- This game is fast paced, sometimes it's even hard to see what you're doing or what's going on XD 
- This game provides a decent challenge that will keep you coming back for more
- Plenty of tracks to choose from, they also are themed to a specific planet and are VERY well designed
- Split screen local multiplayer, but only limited to 2 players
- Online works rather well, there's no lag between other players that's immediately noticeable
-Neither-- Your ship handles like it dances on ice, I know that the developers are trying to make the physics more realistic in that a hover ship isn't going to grab the ground very well
 This is in the "Neither" category because it is both a con and a pro
 It sucks to have to constantly fight your ship to keep it on the track, but it's also realistic and provides a real challenge
 This is here just to INFORM others that your ship feels like it's on ice constantly
-Cons-- This game will make you rage if you aren't a calm person
 Some of these tracks are specifically designed to throw you off the track just to kill you
 Got a tight turn coming up
 Yeah lets just get rid of the guarding rail so that you fling off and die just to remind you that you haven't memorized this track yet
 Now this isn't true for EVERY track, but there are some in this game that have turns that are there just to upset you is you aren't paying attention or have yet to play that track
- Not a lot of ships to choose from, there are four tiers of each though
 This honeslty isn't a huge gripe as you'll probably be able to find one that you like, but there is a desire to be able to choose from more ships
*** There really isn't any penaltly for slamming into the walls / guard railing on turns
 If you try to drive / fly cleanly on a track, you will get a worse time than those that are slamming into the wall going 1200+ kmh
 You can learn how to drift, but you have to know how to drift each turn for each track and have it memorized which takes a very long time and a lot of practice (Isn't very friendly for noobs or casual players)
 There should be either more of a health penalty for hitting walls instead of just taking "Some" health away or there should be a much greating speed penalty for hitting walls
 ***- The controls aren't very self explanatory to those that haven't played these types of games before
 You will learn them eventually, but it might make you frustrated at first

Man, when I saw the word Redout the first thing that come to my mind was Wipeout, then I saw the trailer
 Ten minutes next, I was playing it, and I loved it

Now THIS is Podracing
Posted: 14 January
I deleted my original review and put a few more hours into the game to see if some of my original crits could me remedied through practice
 After a few more hours into it I can safely say my problems aren't me not knowing the tracks well enough or the car I chose, it's the game
 Pros- Art direction is good with a really polished look
 - The better track designs are well designed*- The music works
 Some cuts are good others are totally forgettable but it could be worse so this is a "pro
" - Good sense of speedCons- AI is absolutely terrible
 At first I thought i didn't know the tracks well enough to compete and hit the walls too many times to catch up
 But after spending some time in the Pure Time Trails and getting in the top ten in the leaderboards in a couple or tracks and the top 50 in others, I saw first hand that racing against the computer is broken
 If you lose first place during a race or last man standing, forget about it
 You simply can't catch up
 I tried different loadouts in the car, different tactics during the race
 No go
 I absolutely could not catch any car ahead of me after I lost first, second or third place
- No racing game is good when it favors hitting the walls instead of tactical driving to get the best times, which is exactly what RedOut does
 That's exactly how I broke into the top ten on the leaderboards
 I was trying to race with precision initially, breaking and taking turns trying not to hit the walls
 The game actually punishes you for this as you have to break the car down so much to the extent that you simply can't compete
 The cars simply drift too much for it to matter and you almost have to come to a dead stop at times
 The times posted trying to achieve perfect laps will never be very high and in some cases you simply can't get the gold medal for events
 Once I started hitting walls I noticed that I maintained more speed going into turns as opposed to breaking into a clean turn and boosting afterward
 Totally backwards and not how a racing game should play unless it's something like Twisted Metal
- The cars drift a bit too much making them a chore to control
 Even with mag/grip upgrades my car would drift too much even when turn early AND strafing
 It's not as bad as Formula Fusion where the controls are so bad you'll be lucky to finish a race let alone win it
 But for this to be a WipeOut/F-Zero clone, how do you screw up the controls even early in the game
RedOut is trying very hard to be a F-Zero with WipeOut art direction
 But anyone that's played WipeOut and/or F-Zero and gotten good at them knows the controls are very tight
 RedOut's controls simply aren't that good
 To ask the gamer to navigate rollercoaster tracks at high speed with cars that drift too much even after upgraded, AI that cheats to the extent that you can't catch them
and hitting the walls is a way to win is just sad
 What's worse is that with some practice I was able to compensate for the floatiness of the cars
 But the suspect AI and sloppy wall hitting tactics ultimately killed it for me
 I regret this purchase as I was looking for something on Steam that could compare to WipeOut or F-Zero
 RedOut isn't it
 Don't let the pretty graphics fool you
 You'd be better off emulating
WipeOut Pulse or F-Zero GX
 Both are better games
 RedOut is a bad imitation in a very pretty wig

Product received for free
Anti-Gravity Racing is BackAnti-Gravity (AG) racing has been a niche racing subtype that was once made popular by the legendary F-Zero, WipeOut, Rollcage, and POD series
 Dominated by kart racers and racing sims, AG racing is making a comeback in full force with Redout
 Known for its combat racing and high-octane, high-speed aesthetic, Redout’s take on the nostalgic genre will appease many fans waiting for such a release, while welcoming all those that may be new to the racing subgenre
 Also, VR support is optional, and a photosensitivity warning is presented upon launch, so take care
GameplayCareerCareer is the traditional career-style progression system where you win to earn experience, level up and purchase upgrades
 You first start by choosing one of six sponsoring teams and a ship
 Beginning with a Class I ship, a slew of various races and race types are presented for you to undertake
 These races each have certain goals, and how well you perform dictates the resulting experience and money awarded
 Contracts are interspersed throughout the campaign which task you to fulfill certain objectives for a particular reward
 Overall, there will end up being 75+ events to race with 23 (excluding the starting) ships to purchase
 If you happen to only be interested in single-player modes, there is definitely a sufficient amount of content to keep you busy
Quick RaceThere are 10 different race types you can setup, including Time Attack, Speed, Survival, Instagib, Race, Pure Race, Arena Race, Last Man Standing, Score, and Boss
 The major differences between these modes lie within the restrictions regarding health, damage, powerups, speed, enemy performance, and time
 Speed, for instance, provides additional turbos encouraging you to stay above a target speed in order to get bonus time reductions whereas Last Man Standing eliminates the pilot in the last position every lap
 There is a mode to highlight every style and preference of play, ranging from solo handling performance to group defense performance
OnlineAuto-join, manually search, or host a race with 12 pilot multiplayer support
 All Quick Race options/game types are available for selection
 Local coop/split-screen doesn't seem to be supported yet
Ship CompositionEach ship has 6 different stats to take into consideration when selecting a starting racer, including: acceleration, max speed, grip, structure, energy pool and recharge speed
 Other than the physical and mechanical properties altering handling behavior, two important characteristics of each ship that must be maintained in-race are the health and energy meters
 Grinding the sidewalls and track floors will reduce health while utilizing turbo and powerups will reduce energy
 Keeping a harmonic balance between the two meters will ensure the highest turbo speeds and survival
Careful utilization and mastery of the powerups will help you take over any competitor
 Some of the unique items at your disposal include additional turbo, shields, self-repair drones, energy disablers/drainers, slipstream enhancers, and more
 Also, these powerups are not in-race pickups
 They are equip-able modifications that either passively affect the ship, or must be actively utilized in-race
 These powerups can also be upgraded even further, and only two powerups may be equipped at any time (one active, one passive)
Ship HandlingRedout's handling is best described as floaty (in a good way)
 This doesn't mean that it's unresponsive, insensitive, or overcompensated
 Just that there is a realistic sense of feedback and control; realistic as in something expected of a futuristic anti-gravity racing ship
 As mentioned by the developers above, the handling was based upon physics derived from quad-copter controllers and real magnetic forces
Advanced handling features include strafing (which is completely different from drifting by the way), pitching, and turbo boosts
 Strafing is extremely important to keep your over-zealous self from bumping into every wall while pitching helps prevent blackouts, redouts and nose/tail grinding when a track decides to go loopy
 An important feature that the developers wanted to incorporate is the fact that there should always be a way to confront a corner without braking
 It may take precise steering, strafing, and boosting, but must definitely be possible
 I found the complexity of a successful no-brake turn in Redout much greater than a kart racer’s turn (drift/handbrake), but much simpler than a rally racer’s hairpin turn (Scandinavian flick technique)
 Video Gameplayhttps://www
youtube
com/watch
v=JTFGOEnuZko PresentationArt DesignRedout employs a very futuristic aesthetic & diverse world - 20 tracks are available for racing, taken place around 4 locations (Cairo, Alaska, Abruzzo, and Volcano) that must be unlocked in Career mode before free use
 The 4 locations each have a unique biome: desert, arctic, jungle, and lava respectively, and Redout’s variation of these biomes ensure that each track feels very different
 Another important aspect regarding Redout’s art design has to deal with its sense of speed
 The game utilizes heavy vibrations, passing landscapes, high-speed collisions, and extraneous sounds to improve immersion and create a high octane, adrenaline rushing experience
Screen Resolution & Full-Screen SettingsCurrently, there is no method to change your screen resolution or windowed/full-screen settings in-game
 In fact, you can't even tell what resolution/full-screen setting the game has set you up at
 This ended up giving other players issues with external software/GPU technology (FreeSync, VSR, etc
)
 Fortunately, for now, an unofficial guide has been created to inform users how to manually edit an 
ini file to alter these settings (Guide Here) with successful results
VerdictThere is an unfortunate lack of tributes to the racing legends that were once popular near the turn of the century, especially on Steam
 Becoming more and more niche by the year, Redout breathes life into the dying combat racing genre
 Furthermore, it lives up to the pent up expectations that many AG fans, including myself, have longed to express
 This makes it extremely easy for me to recommend Redout to all of the AG and realistic combat racing junkies out there
 Setting aside a Millennial's nostalgia for a moment, I want to address Redout's mainstream appeal
 I'm sure that there will be a large portion of gamers that are not too familiar with AG racing, and wonder if Redout will be worth it
 The only thing I can say to this group, is that Redout is one of the most unique racing experiences on the market, especially one that is released recently – I can’t stress that enough
 If you're only familiar with this decade's kart racing games, or racing sims/rally racers, just understand that AG racing has a different feeling and difficulty to it
 When I first played F-Zero GX and Star Wars Episode I: Racer back in the day, I couldn't believe how sensitive the vehicles were and how difficult it was to survive and succeed
 I'm sure many newcomers will feel the same way at first, but as eye-opening as F-Zero GX was to me, I believe Redout could be the same to you (in a good way)
 I welcome any and all newcomers to the AG racing genre with Redout
 Its relatively simplistic controls and combat system, along with adaptive AI, makes this AG racer very friendly to beginners

Great game
 Just some suggestions
Wish for more content like quest, or daily challenges where you can earn more gold and rewards
 More maps, monsters and items
Or maybe skill sets where we can choose to build, like ice skills to slow or freee enemies
 Player can either play fire or ice or even hybrid
Imagine If we can grab the thrown axes landed on the wooden pillars and throw it back at them, that would be very cool
 Or shoot the incoming axe with our arrow

Early Access Review
Update: Many people are trying to say this game ripped off QuiVR, however development of this game started BEFORE the QuiVR demo was released for SteamVR, and the only thing that makes the game similar is the use of a bow, and having Orcs as an enemy (which is canon for fantasy anyways)
 I personally like this game more than QuiVR and dodging incoming attacks is not a part of QuiVR, however both games are great - there doesn't have to be just one archery fantasy game
 Also, it seems a tad unfair to me that half of these reviews are from players with 5-8 minutes or less played
Original review:I don't often write reviews but I felt compelled to write one tonight after playing this game because I'm glad to support it
This game is a pure bow game, with excellent pullback mechanics
 The bow responds well, aims well, and just feels nice
 Less like Holopoint and more like the tower defense from The Lab (both great games)
It's also worth mentioning it can be a bit of a workout when you have to start dodging axes, luckily it didn't take me too long to learn and somehow I squeezed out the number three spot on the leaderboards (for now) haha
If you're on the fence, pick it up, it's easily as fun as Holopoint and right now on this sale it's almost just a third of the price
 You won't be disappointed
I did not receive this game for free, it was just a random pickup when searching for games via the "release date" option on the steam store

Pros:-Very nice quick bow work, good draw, aim and fire
-Good graphics
-Cheap
Cons:-Very little gameplay elements, just one tower system to sit in and shoot (one map)
-No rounds, just increasingly large waves (i
e
 no real goals, just see how long you last)
-Bad guys shoot you through each other, from the other end of the map, and with perfect accuracy
-You die in one hit
-No idea of how to teleport, had to figure that out
-No tutorial
-No warning about when you are about to be dragoned to death (just sudden fire if you didn't see it coming due to watching guys behind you)
All in all, promising, but needs structure, a tutorial and more maps/goals

I should note I accidentally left the game running over night and so my hours are inflated but I have still played for hours now
This game is so fun
 I like the auto arrow spawn
 This is just a peek at wha seems like a great genre in room scale VR
 Lets combo it with sword mechanics eventually with an area to teleport to for melee and the experience will be even better
 So stoked to see where this goes

Didn't have high expectations for this game originally but it is an awsome bow game
 The level design is on point and the price for the game is more then fair
 Take my word for it though, never try to play single player, this is a multiplayer game and it will be far more enjoyable with people there to help you

Really good co-op game
 This should be a direction of VR content - let people play together and help each other fight mobs
 Game used to occasionally loose connection, but this appears to be fixed now
 Well done guys
 Get a story , a bit of levelling , but even without it is a good game

I love this game
It's basically the same as Quiver -- Defend a town gate- shoot orcs and stuff with arrows
- multiplayer, and single playerThe differences are -- Nicer looking bad guys (none of the neon blue that annoys me so much in Quiver)- The some of the ordinary bad guys fight back, not just the bosses
- Bad guys follow more varied pathways to the gate
This game progresses faster than Quiver, and for some reason I get more of a workout
 And for me, thats a good thing
 Yes its a wave shooter with no story - but its still fun

Elven Assassin started out good, but the newly update bow mechanics added in early February 2017 makes it a worthy rival of Quivr
While I love both games, I feel what Elven Assassin does better is truly make you feel like your lfe is in danger
 The orcs fling axes at you that you must evade
 The THUNK after they whiz past you really seems like it could remove
your head
The level design is more closed in which means enemies progress quicker than in Quivr and in greater numbers which speeds up the game play
 Couple that with having to duck and dodge axes, be prepared to break a sweat

Great game, but to the developers - is it possible that you could add in an always-on mic option
 It would make it much easier for playing with friends
 Thanks
Edit - The developers have added in an open mic option - Thanks devs

Awesome and underestimated in some parts very polished game 
 The game principle is simple and not exclusively and I do like QuiVR, too, but it got to be emphazized :- high WAF (wife accecpting factor)-very immersive close-to-enemy experience with grunting orcs, flying dragons and more waving - extremely precise phisically based dragon-got-hit and (not only) falls to ground animations which are not repetetive- Supersamling per advanced settings open VR without problerms (so far no in-game graph slider) - with my i6700K 980ti I reach 1
5- additional scene in multiplayer mode is also accescible if there is no other player; this can also be played with rain added and includes heavy middleage wheapons- Axes thrown at you and you must duck or step aside or do a quick estimation whether the axe would miss anyway/thrown at an obstacle ; all this with 3 D spatial audio of the rotating axe approaching 
 very intense- some moments of rest inbetween the waves because playing may become exhausting with some workout side effectDear developers, thank you a lot for this fine piece of work 
 Maybe, sooner or later,
you could consider letting potential customers know of the beauty of the night level by providing a good video at the shopsiteFor me 9/10 - the final point would come after some (randomy chosen 
) animation variety for the orcs

This isn't such a bad start for an early access game
It looks pretty good, though a bit cramped even for a sub, and lacking in AI crew
However, it still needs work to match the current standards in sub sims:1
 Periscope should show relative bearing, not just magnetic bearing
2
 We need binoculars
Modt night attacks were conducted from the conning tower using binoculars
3
The sub needs a proper plotting table, to be able to mark the course of any moving objects
4
We need a deck gun
Many merchantmen were sunk by gunnery from submarines
5
Torpedoes weren't instant kill weapons unless a warship's magazine blew up
It took time to sink a ship, sometimes hours
The way these ships sink is too arcadey
6
 We need decoys and to be able to launch oil and debris to throw off persistent escorts
7
 Pattern running torpedoes and sound-seeking torpedos, as well as sstraight-running steam and electric torpedoes
8
 Torpedo depth settings and magnetic influence detonators so we have the choice of direct impact or a detonation beneath the keel

Disclaimer - Beta tester
Main things that I like
 - There's a rare incentive to NOT die in games
 In IronWolf VR, drowning is quite a visceral experience, especially when the water slowly creeps up from your knees, waist, chest, and then you're on your tip toes trying to keep your head above water
 This makes me actively try very hard to avoid dying
 - Multi-player makes the experience truly better than playing solo
 Shouting bearings of targets, depths while trying to avoid depth charges actually makes it a viable 2-3 player game
 This is really giving me a good idea of what I'm expecting from StarTrek Bridge Crew (assuming that each role has active roles)
- I'm bored of wave based shooters, and it's a huge relief to flip switches and turn dials and plan my tactics, rather than trying to aim a pistol/rifle/bow+arrow at monsters

As a massive fan of naval games, I've always loved co-operative ship combat games where you work with buddies to command a vessel
 THIS NAILS IT PERFECTLY
If you want an honest bit of just simple gameplay, have a watch: https://youtu

 Its the best bit of money my buddy and I have spent on VR in a long time

I never really liked submarine games that much, but this game definitivly changed my mind
 At singleplayer it's an ok game, but it really shines when you're 3-4 players
 It's a team game with several stations that one can man and communication is the key
 Some of the stations are periscope with target lock, sonar, torpedos, depth, speed and bearing etc
 It may sound complicated, but it only takes one game to learn, but becoming good at it can take more
 This game is not only fun, it's also terror
 When that destroyer detects you and you can see it coming closer and closer on the radar, eventually getting on top of you and dropping explosives, I like to think I felt some of the terror people on a submarine must have felt
 The silence when you're trying to hide from it, the fear when you hear it dropping explosive barrels on you and the terror when they explode and water is flooding into your submarine
Game consists of 6 missions and 3 difficulties in early access
 I have yet to encounter any bugs, and for a early access title it seems very polished
I've bought my fair share of VR games and to be honest there's only a few VR games I really liked and felt was worth the money
 There's no doubt that this is one of them
 It can only get better from here: Great job devs

Having experience with training in real diesel boats, this is a very close simulation
 Congratulations 
One aspect I think needs to be improved/added is a ballast pump
 Diesel boats dont just use air and flooding
A great improvement would be to add thermoclines
 Subs try to find the best depth where the differenec in salinity and temperature is locacted to hide under it when they are being searched by active sonar
 Finally, you could add ESM (electromagnetic search to get an early warning when airplanes or helicopters are searching for you or to located enemy ships emitting
 Please make it noticeable when teh periscope is up or downI really like the game, congrats and keep making it as close to reality as possible

First of all I would like to say that IronWolf VR is a great and intresting vr game
Pros--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<Finally a game where you can control a sumbarine/vehicle that is Good and not slopy><It can be alot of fun playing with a friend on local/online multiplayer><Beautifuly built submarine that has alot of details that most vr games lack>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<Can get boring after you finish all the missions><Needs more of a campain>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ideas--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<An ability to (drive sail watever) to a island to give upgrades to you submarine,and example is when you start playing you start in a sumbarine that is the size of a low budget escape pod until you upgrade it to make your submarine the size of a contry
><Make a gamemode were you have to destroy other ships in the water but also make it so you can get out of you submarine with oxgen tanks and a oxgen mask for diving, and search for materials that you can sell (on land) to upgrade your sumbarine and buy oxgen and repair kits><A campain>Whats your guys thoughts

Many years ago as a young lad I used to sit on a Saturday afternoon and watch the war movie they showed on TV
 It was the highlight of my week and my favourite ones were the naval battles and especially the sub movies
 This led to playing games like silent hunter be my favourite when I got my first real computer in the 90s
Anyway enough of my reminiscing and back to the game at hand
 While limited missions, early access like most other VR games
 This is a fantastic game and what VR is about
 Great use of roomscale, great looking graphics and a lot of fun
 I have not played the co-op part yet but actually enjoying single player enough not to worry about it
 The missions are simple atm but shows what could be
 You actually feel fear when you see a destroyer start to hunt you and as you dive deep anxiety grips waiting for the sound of depth chargers being released
 As they explode and your sub starts to flood you see the water rising and feel the hopelessness as there is nothing you can do
Anyway waiting for more content and if it comes could be the best game on the vive
 It's just so suited to VR
 There is much needed like binoculars in the tower and a deck gun not just anti aircraft would be good
 Sneaking into ports and access to other areas of the sub
 Just Don't fart while playing the smell just seems to hang around for ages

Holy moly
 This was great
 I don't want to say it is better than Audioshield, it is just a little bit different
 First the bad: I encountered a bug where some videos would slow down, and the sound was distorted
 You could also see the timer went slower, so
 memory leak perhaps
 Other videos worked great
Audioshield vs Soundboxing:If you like Audioshield, you will enjoy this game as well
 In the latest update, Audioshield discontinued Soundcloud support and implemented Youtube instead
 Audioshield also has an automatic beat detection feature for unplayed songs, where Soundboxing is manual
 The good thing about Soundboxing, is that you can create a completely new "beat map" if you don't like the existing one
Intensity intensifies:Audioshield has a nice feature where you can choose difficulty, and you can also find mods online to replace the existing difficulty settings
In Soundboxing you need to kind of figure out the difficulty level yourself
 If you see a song that is 3:20 minutes, but it has 600+ beats / punches, then you know it will be intense
 So that gives you an idea of how difficult the song is
 If no one has played that song before, then (some will say unfortunately) you need to make your own beat map
 You need to stand and punch at the beats however you see fit
MissingIn the future, I would like to see the following: Favorites Genre selection Region based high scores 
Posted: 24 October, 2016
FULL VIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu
be/BcL3zqN7Z2gPROS:Extremely accessible and easy to jump right into
 Anyone who has played VR will instantly start having fun the moment they try the game without a tutorial
 Songs are all player created, which results in notes being synced up with the rhythm much better than Audioshield
 Creating songs is easy and requires no outside editor
 Simply playing a song freeform will result in the songs notes being created from your punches
CONS:Very low skill ceiling, if you have ANY experience with rhythm games you will have no trouble acing even the hardest songs with only a tiny bit of practice
User created songs can be dull or outright bad if the author of the song doesn’t have rhythm or try to improvise dance moves
Reliance on YouTube for songs makes it difficult-impossible for those in countries that block YouTube videos (Germany) or people without consistent internet to play
 SUMMARY:	Soundboxing, in essence, is a hybrid of precision rhythm games like DDR, and dancing rhythm games like Dance Central
 While you are still hitting a sequence of notes, you also feel like you are naturally dancing to the beat; more so than any other rhythm game I’ve played
 Anyone can easily jump in and have a good time because at its base the game is insanely fun
 That being said the game does lack a skill ceiling as even the hardest songs in the game are easily playable to anyone with any skill in rhythm games
 While it’s not the most depth filled rhythm game, it definitely shines as a cheap, fun party game that easily belongs in everyone’s Vive repertoire

Soundboxing is not just a game, its a workout
Playing Soundboxing will get very exhausting especially for your arms and it will definetly make you very sweaty
 The fact that you wear an HMD while getting physically active obviously makes that even worse
 After longer play sessions (30+ min) you might want to take off the HMD because it's getting a bit uncomfortable
The name already says what makes it so special compared to other VR music games
 The harder you punch the orbs with the motion controllers, the more points you will get
You can search for any song on youtube and create your own challenge for it or try to beat challenges that other players have created
The good thing about that is that you can make an accurate beat syncronization that really let's you feel your music how you like it while other automatic algorithms from games like Audiosurf, Audioshield and many more might fail to capture that feeling
If there is no challenge for a song you need to create your own because Soundboxing has no automatic algorithm
Each challenge has its own high score board
 You will get an ingame message when someone beat your highscore
 You can add challenges to your favourites and also you can create your own playlists now
While playing you can see a big screen where the music video is playing and you can select between a variety of beautiful background enviroments which creates a great atmosphere
The haptic feedback of the controllers also does a great job and supports the feeling of getting into the beat quite well
Sometimes I had some issues with the ingame pointer and a few crashes but apart from that there's nothing to complain about
Soundboxing is a great workout game with a high replay value and its absolutely worth the price of 7,99€

There should be many of these on VR, This game is perfect for me to burn thr extra Kcals after a gym session, its a good challange, the idea is simple
 Link you tube to them game, watch videos and throw punches but it works really well
 what id love to see to make me push my self more a Lcal burner that tells you how much you burned off and keeps a log of it on your profile , that would be awsome
the game is worth the money

THE killer Vive app is right here
This is amazing & everything just works
This is THE Vive app Ive been waiting for since the Vive launch
Instantly my #1 with a rocket
You can play any Youtube track you like, and if someone hasn't beatmapped it, you just create it as you play it
Its that easy
Soundboxing automatically uploads your beatmap to its servers and boom
 its there for everyone to try
Im literally blown away at how incredibly fun and easy this is to play with
It even records your body movement as you punch out your beatmaps
I played my track back and the little dude was moving exactly like me - because it is me
This is truly amazing

Let me start by saying that I'm having a lot of fun with this game
It feels great to punch synched up orbs while force and the combo multiplier matter for the score
Getting updates on who played your beat maps and who pushed you from the first place is motivating, as well as having a website tracking the leaderboards and available songs
The ability to record your own beat maps is actually quite challenging, since you want to have a lot of diversity and not only punch orbs at the same height in a different rythm
 You can also search for popular songs, either sorted by times played or maked as favourites
But of course the game isn't perfect
 - No ability to rate the difficulty of a beat map- Cannot fix a mistake you made when recording a beat map- Not all beat maps are created equal, it depends a lot on who created itEven with those missing features the game is quite fun and recording can be really exhasting if you try and be creative
 I have high hopes for this game, not only is it a great foundation to build upon but the developer interacts and listens to the community
A side note for fellow germans: Since YouTube is used, a lot of modern music is blocked by GEMA
What I would like to see adjusted:- The ability to restart from a certain point in my recording and stop with the click of a button- A grid like view to see more songs at once- Hide the constantly visible menu with the menu button
- Make the plane you have to hit when recording more visible, since its quite easy to loose track of it

 This game will work you out
What I love and found out toward the latter half of my first day owning this is you can take about any songyou can think of and create your own mix
 The bottom line is after an hour of play I'm walloped (in a good exercise kind of way) and had a blast doing it
 I plan to make this a regular habit

I loved the demo of Bullet Sorrow and was looking forward to the release
 And so far, I wasn't disappointed
 In fact, I was blown away from the game
 At some point after the first level - which is basically the demo plus a boss fight - I thought that it might get repetitive
 And then I encountered a stationary 50 cal with unlimited ammo which I had to grab with both hands and fire away at masses of enemies

Ok
 I had to turn off my Vive immediatly after Stage 1 to do a review
 I was simply blown away
Not only was the discounted price at launch perfectly priced but the developer had a great FREE preview demo before Early Access
 Great JOB
Every other developer should take notice on this strategy
 Let your demo shape your development through feedback and a good price of your game to win sales
Now my review
 The menu system is very basic and intro tutorial was fine
After that, your straight into the game
The action is fast
 The controls are dead on and the feedback and hit detection was perfect
 Not only did I feel like a badass in an action movie but I felt like I never wanted this game to end
 The bullet time was perfect
 I wish there was a indicator of health on your right hand, like a watch showing your health
The action is like living a classic "Call of Duty" (the good ones) firefight
There will be bullets all over the place and when you land a headshot, it feels great
The first boss you meet, is EPIC
I can't wait to see what else this adds to this game before completion to final product
Support the developer and get this game now for your Vive Collection
A+ Masterpiece
Oh yeah,
I can see a BULLET SORROW 2 in the future
Keep in the great work
 I will send more feedback in the forums

Game still stutters even with no supersampling on a 980Ti at specific scenes (most notably level 2)
 Will buy again when this game is more optimized
AI is pretty dumb and is obviously scripted to go at specific spots
 No mechanisms to prevent the player on using exploit (doesn't prevent you from going inside objects, walls, etc so you can cheese easily your way)

Great shooting/action game
 The feeling of constant progress makes it a fresh breeze among all the wave shooters
 Make no mistake though, it's kinda another wave shooter, but still you move forward almost instantly and in same map
 The bullettime works great and at some points in the game you feel like a real action hero with blazing guns and shells dropping all around you
 Weapons handle great, but I miss having to reload manually instead of just pushing a button
IMPORTANT:Movement system is teleporting, and to me that was minus
 One of the maybe biggest drawbacks is that it's running poorly on my machine
 My specs are i7 6700k, 980ti, 16gb ram, SSD so I meet the recommended specs
 If I turn of reprojection there's some serious lag issues, and it doesn't manage 90fps at all
 Because I meet the recommended specs, but it doesn't perform at 90 fps, I can not recommend it
 Also the AI level of the enemies could definitivly been better, but gets the job done
 No difficulty selection either
 It's early access, so there's bound to be some features that could use improvement or are missing
 All in all still a solid foundation with few bugs

I really like this game, it reminds me of Time Crisis but obviously much better
 The first level is just the demo with a boss fight and it runs great, but level two gives me serious frame rate issues, to the point where turning my head gives me a headache

 Love the game, can't wait for that patch

https://youtu
be/YUNyFi1gI9kA game to potentially scratch that Time Crisis VR itch
I've heard people asking for a Time Crisis VR game and this really felt similar
 Bullet Sorrow VR is a cover based arcade shooter with a voice acted story
 It's somewhere between wave shooter and free roaming VR FPS but thoroughly enjoyable
You advance through a larger level section by section bound to a small play area
 You can teleport around in this play area with a stamina meter on your left hand
 Each section will have waves of enemies spawn and attack
 Once each wave is defeated you move to the next section
I think the game would have been better served with a bit more free form locomotion
 I don't really understand the decision to restrict movement
 It ends up feeling like several mini wave shooter levels in one giant level
There are several different weapons you can pick up along the way that are purely temporary
 You toss them aside when you run out of ammo
 This can be disorienting at times especially with the rifle or shotgun
 Some weapons have different angle orientation
 You may be sniping head shots with the uzi, pop back to the pistol and you're now shooting 4 feed over enemy heads
Graphics didn't look too bad for a VR title
 There will be people that complain about the aliasing
 I've mentioned before that I don't think VR is in a state where that's a realistic expectation but I won't jump on that soapbox today
 To my, the graphics were reasonable for something trying to be more on the realistic side of things
That being said
 I did feel like the sights were a bit difficult to aim down
 The pistol model wasn't designed with VR graphic limitations in mind
As you can tell by the huge black bars, the game is an unreal title
 I wish devs would focus on the Mirror window as it makes for a poor viewing experience in the current state
The game has 3 difficulty levels across 3 decently sized missions
 I would expect 1-2+ hours play time depending on skill level/difficulty chosen
The gameplay itself was quite a bit of fun
 Rereading what I have said thus far I may seem like I didn't enjoy the game
 There are some issues and rough edges but I had quite a bit of fun with the core game and am interested in finding out the rest of the story
In the end Bullet Sorrow VR gets a thumbs up as a pretty decent cover based shooter

Hands down one of my fave games on the Vive, sadly limited in only having 3 levels - but each is of a decent length and for the average player will take a chunk of replayability time to get through them on Normal difficulty
I wish it was a longer game and had more enemy variety - but even saying that I still think this is one of my best purchases
Its essentially VR Time Crisis - in every positive way imaginable :)
If you loved Time Crisis 2 in the arcades as much as I did, this will be sooooo your type of game ^^

Pure arcade fun
 I love dual-wielding pistols in vr and this game nails it
 Imagine Time Crisis in vr with bullet time and bosses
 The shotgun reload action is simply one of the most satisfying things you can experience in gaming
 Honestly, try to resist quoting Arnie whilst using that pump-action in slo-mo, not possible
 This feels a lot more like a full game as opposed to the 'wave' shooters
 If I had one gripe it's that I would personally prefer locomotion to teleporting, but the movement is very smooth
 Oh and that voice kind of creeps me out, 'I will guide you'
 I just don't trust it, or completely understand it to be honest
Very easy to pick up and play, scratches that 'arcade shooter' itch
Devs are responsive and PVP is on the way too

I started off loading the game and loading time took a while
After the screen came on at default graphics settings, it looks really good
I was surprised to find myself at a cantena
I was able to hear people logging in and logging out and chatting and forming groups for game
I accidently hit a pad and was teleported to a location where a session has started
Immediatly was in a group (it felt like a group though we didnt need to be in a group and this is very interesting
)
and just following a path to where we were shooting stuff
Feels really good
One of our teammates died but we pressed on
After I reached the end of the level, i logged off and I can really say I love this game
The cantena area has spots to where you can upgrade your armor, another spot to where you can upgrade your weapons
as you progress, you find money in areas of the game for the character upgrades
This Game is Most excellent

If Destiny was rethought as a Virtual Reality game, I think this is the direction that it would go
While it doesn't have a solid story and it goes have some bugs (it is early access after all); the main purpose of this game is to co-op beat levels with friends or random strangers with the goal of getting money which is used to upgrade your gear which also increases your level
 Also the graphics, even on the default setting, are really good looking
Pump it up to the max and you have a slick looking game
I can honestly say, even with the limited amount of time I have played it so far, that this is a special game
 Every group of people I played with for the missions were a blast and there were many times we were laughing, cheering and complimenting each other on "Nice shot
"s as we scrambled to survive the insectoid onslaught
There is plenty of gear ranging from your appearance, your weapons, your shields, your bonus weapon and the upgrades range from attachments to your existing weapon to new weapons
 I can only assume more gear will be added as time goes on
 The levels are pretty straight forward from what I have played and are complex enough to vary your tactics while working together to beat it
You will see money canisters hidden throughout the level that will increase your total awarded funds at the end
I have not tried the multiplayer yet but I am guessing it is as great a time fighting fellow players as it is to work with them
All in all, especially for an early access game, this is absolutely worth having in your VR collection
Its games like this that evolve the VR experience and I can't wait to see where they take it from here

Awesome game
 Cant Stop playing, had small problem and The devs got right on it and fixed it
 I love the locomotion and really enjoy being able to switch between teleport and running
 I was never a fan of teleporting but it works in this game and I wouldn't want it any other way
 For a game that's still early access and is this addicting I'm sure with time it can only get better
 Can't wait to see more weapons, more maps and more enemies and maybe even boss battles
 Pvp works great too although not many people have been playing
I'm sure it will get better as more people finish leveling up and are looking for Something different to do
Keep up the good work devs and thanks again for the quick resolution to my problem

There are a lot of weapons & upgrades to unlock in this game which gives you something to achieve
The co op is awesome, or you can go it alone
It automatically lets other players join the "bounty" or mission you are on
There is PvP as well but I haven't dabbled with that yet
It is in early access right now and I did notice two bugs
First, the enemies for me where stuttering when moving or laggy when they get close
I thought this was a framerate issue, but it wasn't
Second, there is a bit of lag when shooting your guns sometimes

Early Access Review
Gunheart boasts a well designed core loop that keeps you coming back for more
While the guns could use some 'juice' to make them more fun to use, the mechanics themselves are solid
 PVP is a little underwhelming, it suffers from some serious balance issues with movement and weapon damage
 The PVE and co-op is what's really enjoyable, hosting an unlock and upgrade system that gives you the incentive to keep coming back
This game will only get better as time goes on, but what we have now is extremely memorable
Posted: 3 August
Early Access Review
There's something here
In Raw Data, which is another great game I've seen Gunheart compared to, you can clearly see the compromises they had to make to make it work in VR, like level design and movement
 Gunheart feels more like a traditional shooter in respect to movement and maps
 The way you move through the level, taking cover where needed and actually going taking the fight to the enemies instead of waiting for them works very well
Right now, just after the EA release, there's still a few bugs and judging by what I've seen so far the content needs to be fleshed out some more before the full release
 Looking beyond that it has a high production value feel to it and the visuals are amazing
 Too many games put you into environments that fail to convey a sense of scale
 Gunheart really looks like you're on the surface of a planet that goes beyond the horizon and doesn't stop existing a few meters beyond your chaperone bounds

Early Access Review
This is great
 Great graphics, great gameplay
 The co-op play feels extremely natural, the maps are well situated to make location and other player locations really important, and the ability to really support each other really encourages communication and strategy
 I was very hesitant to drop $35 on something that just dropped into Early Access but I am extremely pleased
Suggestions for devs:1
 The guns and explosion sound effects are not quite satisfying
 Give them a bit more oomph
 Also, the barrels - make them so if you shoot them once, they start to leak (and will explode), but if you shoot them a second or third time, they explode now
2
 The enemies are extremely well modeled and animated
 BUT they are not quite satisfying to kill
 I'm going to compare this to Halo since you're filling that hole in my heart (for co-op FPS gameplay)
 Remember the little guys that squealed in terror when you arrived, referring to you as a demon, etc
 How satisfying it was to headshot them, or run up behind them and melee them
 Remember the hyperaggressive warrior caste that bellowed as they charged at you
 How satisfying it was when you finally nailed them with a shotgun, for all their dodging
 They had just enough personality in them to make them satisfying enemies to kill
 These insect creatures need a little more anthropomorphizing in their body language and sounds
 Raise them from pests that have to be exterminated to adversaries that I really really want to make dead

Running on a 1080GTX
It is butter smooth 99% of the time
 Game is exactly as described in the trailers
 Guns are fun to use, maps are enjoyable to play, community is very helpful and considerate
 Dev responds to posts in the threads
 Very good experience, well worth putting in your VR collection

October 2017 update: 
Wow, Wow, Wow, Wow, words just can NOT justify the experience
It's a brand new game
completely revamped
 I am really amazed at what devs can do with their talents
If you own vr headset this is a must try
June 2017 review:
If you liked Vanishing Realms, you will love this game
actually I find Karnage to be better than Vanishing in every aspect from its beautiful cavern environments to the enemies AI and not to mention the
boss fights which gets my blood pumping
this game is really fun
wait until you start the third stage
I was just staring at the outside environment in awe and didnt even notice the enemy approaching
you might encounter bugs but remember this is an early access and the devs need all our inputs to polish the game
I loved this game
its a must buy for all adventure lovers
Posted: 24 April
Early Access Review
It hurts
 It really does
 Played Vanishing Realms, absolutely loved it
 Then Karnage was announced, and I got really hyped for it
 It unfortunately looks like they spent more time on their trailer than on the combat
Combat
 Check
Awesome Environment
 Check
RPG
 Nope
 Nothing to collect, nothing to buy, nothing to upgrade, and no skills whatsoever, cause you know, an RPG has none of those
Story
 CheckMultiplayer
 NOPE
 Not today, at least
 Props to Nordic Trolls though, the game looks beautiful
 You'll probably spend a bit of time staring at the environment
 Can't complain about that at all
 But that's about it
The game which clearly displays multiplayer doesn't actually have multiplayer
 Why that trailer then
 Good question
I'm going to leave locomotion as it is, because it's not as bad as some reviews make it
However, the combat is a big disappointment
 If you're looking for a RPG with a good combat system, then this is not it at all
 If you're looking for a VR Hack & Slash, then this is the game for you, because it's literally, all you're gonna do
 Unless you decide that you want to be an Archer, then in that case, you're most likely going to be pulling that bow string
 a lot
 Moreover, there's no UI
 But that's fair, you can do without
 However, there is nothing to tell you what your health is
 No symbol, no light, no number
 Nothing
The AI is also a huge problem
 They look like the AI from Age of Empires 2, where the enemies sit there, waiting for you to get close or to hit them unless there is a trigger that forces them towards you
 Not a terribly smart AI
 But when you do get into combat, oh boy
 The damage that the enemies inflict in close combat is sometimes dealt before the animation is played
"How did I die
""Yes
"Furthermore, the music choice is difficult to understand
 You start off the game with epic, adventure-esque music, and end the game with part dubstep, part orchestral music
 If you want immersion, stick with one style, preferably one that fits your theme
 Lastly, the game is NOT meant to be played alone
 The final boss is extremely hard for what the game is
since Wizards and extremely fast goblins spawn as well as the boss 
 In the end, you need a team, which is unfortunately advertised but not implemented
Ultimately, it's up to you if you want to buy the game
 Yes it's pretty, but the mechanics are awful
 It's playable, but you can just hold up your shield and flail your sword around
 That is how basic the combat is
 If you want to listen to people with 0
3 hours of gameplay, then go for it
 But this game is not market ready
 It is plain and simple, with nothing truly exciting
PS: the little sparks on the swords in the trailer don't actually happen
 The swords just go through each other

v=NTyAdnQqbIwWritten Review:Karnage Chronicles is a beautiful looking adventure game set in a cool Trine-esque fantasy universe
At the moment, you have 2 classes to choose from
The first is the warrior
 You are given a shield, longsword and crossbow
As the archer, you have a longbow, and dual daggers
Both differ enough to make them feel unique in their own rights
 Although with both you have close and long range weaponry, they both specialize in different categories
At the moment, combat feels a little bit janky and too difficult
 I'm all for difficulty, but it feels too frustrating after a certain point
 The devs have said that the speed at which you slash/stab an enemy reflects the amount of damage you inflict, which is definitely a neat feature
 It stops you from wiggling your sword in an enemy like you do in other VR games
 However, it isn't as clear as it could be, when I can or am blocking attacks from opponents when I'm in a melee fight
 The sound and visual cues aren't obvious enough in my opinion, and the game doesn't seem to have any sort of countering mechanism
 It would be cool to see some sort of staggering when you block an enemy's attack
Long-range combat needs a slight buff I think
 Both bows feel like they shoot too low
 So you need to aim much higher than you would expect
 When I got to the first boss, bows also felt a bit powerless
Although, there are some nice details about the combat, like how arrows can stick into you shield or body
 You then have the option to cut them off using your sword, or pull them out with your bare hands
 I don't believe the arrows pose any further threat once they're inside you, other than maybe blocking your vision, but it feels very cool and immersive to pull them out after a hard battle
That's the main negative with the game
 The combat just needs some more work
 And that's what it's in Early Access for
At the moment I can't see a strong reason to go exploring other than finding some scrolls that play an audio-reading of lore
 It's cool that it's there for people who are into story, but if you are looking for loot, upgrades or health potions, you won't find any of it
 The devs have said they plan to add more RPG elements like that though, which is something I'm looking forward to very much
 I think it will add a lot to the game and keep the pacing from getting stale as it does here
 Since there's no loot to grab, you're just going from enemy to enemy and fighting
 And since the combat isn't amazing, it can get old
I should also mention there's no indicator for your health
 And you don't seem to heal over time or through the use of any items
 So after 1 minute of no combat, you might walk into a room, get shot by one arrow and die
 The game looks absolutely beautiful though
 There is so much attention to detail in the environment and models
 The enemies look so cool, and your weapons and outfits look great
One other neat detail is the ability to get rid of arrows
 If an arrow impales your body or shield, you can cut them in half with you sword or pull them out with your hands
 It's a really nice detail that helps immerse you in the world
Although the ability for free locomotion movement exists, I think it's not very natural feeling
 You need to hold the grip button while then choosing the direction on the trackpad
 It puts your hand in an awkward position, and also moves too fast for comfort for me
 I'm sure some VR veterans won't get motion sick from it, but I prefer to stick to the teleport method
Overall, even though the game has a lot of flaws, it's quite a nice experience
 Looking at the world is great, and you really do feel immersed
 Once the devs start ironing out some of these combat problems, maybe lowering the difficulty and giving you a feeling of progression through loot or XP, I think the game will really shape up to be something special
 Recommended, but probably not for full price or only when the game updates a bit
UPDATE:The combat is much less frustrating now
 It has been made a tad easier, so you can get through the game at a better pace
 It's still quite challenging, but much less tedious
A loot system has also been implemented
 You're rewarded for checking nooks and crannies, and
destroying random objects in the world, as they may hide treasures in them
 At the moment, this doesn't seem to do much other than increase your score
 I'd like some sort of shop or upgrade system where we can spend this money, because I found myself not bothering to collect it after I realised it was a bit pointless, but perhaps it will still interest players who enjoy getting highscores

v=5At63Ln6KaE&t=1sOk I loved this game before as you can see from my last review
I felt like this game was in not only competeing for the top position in the VR RPG catagory but as over all VR game as well
after this update, it is clearly my favorite
It's huge
I have spent almost 2
5 hours playing the mountain map and I still haven't gone down a path or two or fought the boss from the original release
the NPC's that have been added are great
there is a shop now with weapons and accerssories and potions, and spiders,
 big effing spiders,
 those spider caves man,
 you can hear them scurrying around you from every direction and it's #creepyAF 
There truley is no other VR RPG that can compete with Karnage right now
It wins in Graphics, sound, gameplay and any other catagory you can come up with
amazing such a small indie team has put together such a fantastic title
Thank you Nordic Trolls
Can't wait for MORE

v=4_jhXVD1ElAI remember back in the early 80's, sitting in my make shift space ship I made with boxes, blankets, a 9 inch black and white tv as my veiw screen and atari 2600, Playing Vangaurd and preteding I was really in my own space ship
Games like this one make this old man feel like that again
Karnage Chronicles totally immerses you in this fantasy world and lets you pretend
This is what VR is all about
After playing Vanishing Realms I didn't know if anyone was going to nail this whole thing down again
Then Mage's Tale came along and I was feeling much better about things
The Highly touted and hyped Soul Keeper was soon coming and I just couldn't wait to start another VR RPG adventure and then after it did,
 well I think we all know how that one turned out,
 at least for now
From the minute I entered into the menu screen of Karnage Chronicles I knew I was in for a treat
Fanciful, colorful graphics that seemed to dance with life, immersive directional sound,
 absolutley stellar voice acting,
 seriously if you are looking for a good RPG dungeon crawler this is an absolute must for you library
Graphically this game is just great
They have taken the more cartoonish route, with amazing lighting effects all of varying colors
the particle effects and water effects are just great
I would place it between the simple graphics of Vanishing Realms and the much more fleshed out detailed graphics of The Mage's Tale
I just loved them
I know some people prefer the more realistic look of Skyrim and the like but when I'm pretending I don't mind being a more cartoonish character
The Sword and sheild look great and have a great feel to them
The enemy models are wonderful and have some really nice smooth animations to them, the environments really pull you into this world, everything from the deep caves and caverns to the large outside areas with the waves and clouds really making you feel like you are there
I really cannot find one thing I do not like about the graphics in this game
The sound is top notch
The ambient sounds surrond you and give you a sense of depth to the environments, the sounds that your weapons make as they either hit an enemy, an enemy's sheild or weapon, the rocks around you,
your sheild, plants are all very satisfying
The ambient music is also just great
The songs just fit the levels you are in and are long enough they don't seem repetative and are not over powering at all drowning out the rest of the game play
The only voice you run across is a narrator that gives you some back story about where you are when you come across certain cansiters and I just love his voice so much
In VR sound is every bit as important as graphics and these guys just nailed it
One of the things I loved so much about Vanishing Realms, and was missing so much in The Mage's Tale was Sword play
Well man does this game have it
As I said before the weapons feel great in your hand, they have great haptics so you can feel them striking objects and not just enemies but rocks, and the ground and other weapons you have in your hand
I squealed with joy in the tutorial when then gave me two glowing jade looking daggers and I smacked them together and they sparks and let out a good twang sound
In this game you currently have the option of being a warrior or an archer and I believe a mage is in the works
(the thought of multiplayer with one of each on the team makes me all tingley) each character has a melee and a range weapon
I played as the warrior
sword play feels so great
the enemies AI respond well to your actions, doing a great job of countering your attaks
It seems that the damage you do depends on where and how you hit the enemies which is so cool
I noticed for instance that when I fought the wolves, I could certainly hurt them just hacking away at their heads (yes hacking,
 no waggle in the wind here
) but if I waited till they jumped up at me and swung and sliced across their throats it about killed them in one hit
feels so satisfying
The ranged weapon for a warrior is a little one handed crossbow that you have to wind up with your free hand and it feels just great
It does take some getting used to aiming though
Fighting the archer enemies is pretty cool as well since they don't always shoot the same way and number of arrows
once you think it's pretty easy to dodge them they shoot a lot faster or three arrows at once
Oh and the arrows
they stick in your sheild and you can cut them off with your sword, or if they stick in you you can grab them and pull them out of your chest
its the little touches like that that just make this game shine
The boss battles
holy cow
they are so fun and will totaly give you a workout
This last boss I'm fighting,
 which I'm afraid might be the last one for this current build, is just so fun
My shoulder feels like it's going to fall off today
 haha
Puzzle wise there isn't really much to this game
I think I ran across 2 puzzles in the 2
5 hours I've played this game and they were super obvious So this def isn't a game for people that are looking for deep puzzles
That is something I would like to see more of
Puzzles and maybe longer dungeons
the dungeons are beautiful but they are also very short and you get through them way too quick
As of writing this I have 2
5 hours in and think I might be at the end of chapter one
I guess depending on how many chapters they are planning on doing that is a good amount of time, but I love this game so much I feel like I want more
Also that is assuming that the first 3
portals are all that this build has
So in closing this game is great
Graphics, sound, game play, it just knocks it out of the park
Only things I would like to see is more puzzles with higher difficulty,
more variations of enemies, and longer dungeous
but these are all things that are great and I just want more of
also I have not played as an archer yet, and there are other difficulties I believe so
you will totally get your 24 dollars worth out of this title and really,
 please support these guys because we really want to see more of this game

Early Access Review
The best hack n slash adventure experience I had in VR until now
 Defeated the game in about 2 hours
WARNING BEFORE YOU BUY ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE EXPECTING TO GET AN RPG EXPERIENCE OUT OF THIS GAME :AT THIS POINT, I WOULDN'T CALL THIS GAME AN RPG
 YOU WON'T FIND ITEMS, INVENTORY, SKILLS, QUESTS, ETC ETC AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT ON AN RPG GAME
 FOR ME, THIS GAME IS AN ACTION ADVENTURE GAME
 PROS :+ It's a NON wave shooter/slasher
 It has stages where you have to walk from the starting point to the end+ Challenging Boss fights
 Actualy the boss fight is kinda hard even in the easy level, and you need different strategy for each fight, which is a good thing for me+ Pretty visual
 Just look at the screenshot on the store page
+ Enemy AI is quite good
 They will try to go arround you to get you, so watch your back
+ It has story+ Great atmosphere+ Sword fighting mechanics is quite good
 You can parry using your sword and shield
CONS :- Too short for now
 It's still in EA stage, so let's just wait for any updates
 - Mage class not presented
 Only warrior and archer- I was looking for two handed weapon like longsword with no shield
 But nowhere to be found
 More weapon choice in the next update maybe

Early Access Review
I wanna start this review off by saying, thank you to the developers for being active on communicating with the community
 In this day and age in the VR games community, communication is absolutely critical
 Now on to my actual review, the obvious direct competitor to this title is vanishing realms
 We vr rpg fans pretty much collectively agree that, its the best rpg game to date
 This is a simple fact that cannot be contested
 However, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Karnage chronicles has significantly more potential than every other rpg game to date
 What I'm basing this off of, is the obvious things like Co-op gameplay, and loot drops, but the key difference is the eventual scale of the game
 The devs seem to understand what the community really wants is long narratives, giant worlds (or atleast many different zones) to explore, and we want to get immersed in a world that doesn't end in 2 hours
 So if we continue to support this title, I have faith that this will become one of the go-to rpg games for many years to come, not unlike zelda a link to the past but with the added benefits of up to 4 player co-op
 So while at the moment it's unpolished, buggy, crashes often, and lacks the features it requires and promises, I have faith that the devs will deliver on this one
 Don't let us down devs

Early Access Review
Overview:LOVE IT
Pros:This game is an example of a well-done Early Access title
It is well done, even in it's current state
 The level design is simplistic, but well done
 Despite being mostly linear, it doesn't feel underwhelming in it's delivery
 I think it is a fine example of a taste of what future VR RPGs will deliver to us
I very much look forward to continued content, including levels, mobs, classes, and items
Would recommend this title to anyone with a desire to play VR RPGs
Con:Price is a bit hefty for the level of content
 However, that being said, I do look forward to future additions to make this game feel like a $24
99 title - and I am confident it will be delivered
Side Note:I think we should all expect more from VR titles than we currently do
 We ought not become complacent and feel that a VR experience is limited to 4-6 hours gameplay, and should some with a $50-$60 price tag
 This is a game that could potentially break this mold and offer us more content than we are used to, more replayability potential, and a merited $25 price tag

Early Access Review
This game is off to a great start and it is getting better with every release
 My kids and I had a great time with Vanishing Realms
but it was over pretty quickly and left us wanting more
I heard about this game from a friend when it was first released
The very first version looked amazing but there was still a lot of gameplay work to be done
Played it again today with my son on "easy" difficulty and it is now amazing
We had a great time exploring all the new stuff, collecting treasures, upgrading items and fighting the first couple boss monsters
They have even added a few small mysteries to solve on the way
With the excellent additions brought in with the first couple updates I can't wait to see how this game grows and evolves
it is already definitely something I would recommend to anyone who likes that dungeon crawler feel
We didn't want to stop playing today to go to an amusement park on a sunny day
This game is turning into something fantastic
Highly recommended

This is one of the best-looking VR games so far, truly amazing graphics and atmosphere
 If you ever played Vanishing Realms - then you probably will love this fantasy Dungeon Crawler RPG
 Read my first-look thoughts below, or watch my first 25-minute gameplay of Karnage Chronicles on HTC Vive
Gameplay Video:https://www
youtube
com/watch
v=_Teb9Ay59ZgMy first-look thoughts:The first thing that hit me when I started the game, was how beautiful it is
 The graphics are extremely polished, so detailed and this VR title is crispy sharp even though its an Unreal Engine game - I did not even use any super sampling
The vivid and colorful dungeon-atmosphere adds a lot to the VR immersion, as well as the background music and sound effects
 The gameplay itself is simple, but entertaining
 I have only played the first 20-25 minutes in the 1st of 3 different locations available in this early release, but so far I could not find many RPG-elements, XP's etc
 The first level is all about exploring the deep dungeon, learning the weapons, fighting different creatures and making your way to the boss
You can play as a Warrior or an Archer, both having different weapons
 The Warrior has a crossbow and sword and shield melee weapon, while the Archer has regular archery bow and 2 big knifes as melee weapons
 I have so far only been playing with the Archer, so Im not sure how much different the gameplay is playing as a Warrior
Im not yet ready to make a full review, as I want to play more and get further in the game before I give you my overall impression, but so far I can sum this up shortly:Graphics:As I said before: Really stunning graphics and environments - definately one of the most impressive I have seen in a VR game (and I play VR games daily)Sounds/Music:Powerful and atmospheric music in the background really makes a good job here, and adds a lot to the immersion
 The sound effects are great, and the voice-over in tutorial and in-game are impressive - it almost feels like a voice from a LOTR-movie :) Movement/locomotion:The game uses free teleportation as locomotion, and I admit that it works really well - surprisingly well actually
 Im a big fan of free touchpad movement just like in Onward and other VR games, and I really hope the devs will add free locomotion to Karnage Chronicles soon, but honestly - I can not complain on the teleportation as it works flawlessly in this game
 There is no stamina on teleportation, so you can teleport as much as you want and as fast as you want
 It may sound "too easy" but its not, and its really helpful while fighting the bosses
Weapon handling:The weapons feels surprisingly solid as well
 I have so far only tried the bow and knifes while playing as an Archer, and the bow feels very responsive, easy to aim and the aiming is also accurate as expected
 Battles with the knifes gets quite intensive, and you can both slice and stab the creatures from any direction, which feels quite realistic
Performance:I had no problems what so ever playing this game on my i7 4790K, 16GB RAM and GTX 1080 Ti, at least while only playing and without capturing the gameplay
 While playing and doing the video capture (link above) with OBS Studio (with green screen chroma etc) at the same time, I felt that the asynchronus reprojection kicked in a lot, as I got frame drops
 Bare in mind that this is not the game's fault, but more of a OBS issue that really sucks performance of my PC
 If you just play the game without recording you gameplay, you should get steady 90fps without problems
 Im not sure how this game runs on slower GPUs but I wouldnt be surprised if its fully playable on a GTX 970 or 980 for example
 It feels like a polished and well-optimized Unreal engine game
Difficulty:Well, this is maybe the only part of the game that Im not fully satisfied with, and I really hope the devs will change this
 Firstly, I could not find any difficulty-level selection
 When playing the first 10-15 minutes it was quite challenging, not too easy and not too difficult - a perfect balance actually
 So far so good
 But as soon as I ended up on the first boss, the frustration just hit me and it killed all the joy
 I think the first boss was waay to difficult, and you need to fight a big guy+ lots of flying mosquitos around you
 Maybe its just me, but I tried to kill the boss almost 20 times but ended up dead every time
 Or maybe I have missed something
 Some trick to kill him
 Some hidden weapon maybe
 Well, I dont know
 If you want a real challenge, then this is probably perfect for you, because this game IS a real challenge ;)
By the way - the game has a great tutorial built-in, on how to move, handle the weapons etc
 And all that with a nice voice over that helps you through it - I just love that
Value:For the price tag, its worth every penny I would say
 This is one of the best (or maybe the best) VR dungeon crawler out there, and if you are looking for a Vanishing Realms-like game, this is definately it
 This first Early Access release contains 2-4 hours of gameplay including 3 different locations (according to the developers), and there are plans to add loads of more content that will give is 10+ hours of game time in future, so Im sure we will get loads of fun for the money
 I can admit that I got a free pre-release copy of the game 1 day ahead of release, but I can tell you that I would buy this game anyway - it great content for the bucks, and so far we are not spoiled with games like this in VR, so Im sure you will find good value in this VR title
 All in all
 Karnage Chronicles is solid, entertaining, beautiful and immersive
 As of today, you won't find a better dungeon crawler out there, try it and you will love it

Early Access Review
UPDATE
With the latest hotfix all the crash issues is fixed, and the game runs really smooth for me
 It's so nice to see how fast the devs are working at making the game even better
 Only 3 weeks since release and already 3 very good patches
 I'm very happy with this
I like this game
 It's fast paced and keeps me on my toes
 I've been following it for a while, wanting to wait a few patches before buying, and the latest patch bringing loot and gear did it for me
 The new weapons are really awesome
 For an Early Access game I find it polished and very promising
 Sure, it crashes now and then, has a few bugs (but not many actually), but considering this is an Alpha version it is really high quality compared to a lot of other Early Access games I have tried
 This is a game I can see turn into something truly amazing, and the devs are very active on the discussion boards as well
Keep up the good work, Trolls

I love this game
 Everyone who comes over to try VR for the first time definitely gets a few levels on this game
 The quality of this game for the price, and given it's indie status is impressive beyond belief
 I'd love to see more developer activity, because as much as I am currently happy with the amount of content in the game, I'd be thrilled for some more new content
 Be that a new "VR Duo" game, like Pizza Duo or Sushi Duo for example, are games I would absolutely love to see
 Even if Pizza and Sushi was just paid DLC for Diner Duo, that would make me more than happy
 I'd love to have a Pizza Parlor or Sushi Shop Duo
 Diner Duo is just so much fun and I think those ideas would be absolutely worth investing in
 VR The Diner Duo is a great VR game, and a necessary VR experience in my opinion
 If you don't have it yet, buy it immediately, on sale or not
 It's worth much more
 Highly recommend this game

What a gem
The levels start off fairly easy, which let's you get comfortable with the mechanics, but it quickly gets chaotic in the kitchen
My GF and I had a blast with this game (level 20 so far)
 You'll quickly find out if you have good communication skills with your other half
 "I said TWO #10's and a single with ketchup
", she yells from across the diner
"That's what I made, right
wait
ahhh crap, I forgot the cucumber
 And what does that guy near the window want
", he queries
"Oh @#$%, I didn't see him come in
""Two #10's and a single with ketchup at the pass
 Ding
 Ding
 Ding
", he snickers
A fun game solo for sure but this shines in local multiplayer
 Thankfully the dishes are virtual in this one guys
;)Simple intuitive controls, perfect artstyle for this type of game (similar to job sim), challenging levels, endless mode for highscore chasers and a wicked catchy soundtrack
 Plus the scale and height of the kitchen is fully adjustable for all sizes
Get it

The co-op is where this really shines
 Really fun and has so much room for growth
 Most VR games get stale quickly
 Even with the early state this is in right now, it is still more entertaining than many others
 It doesn't do much (yet), but what it does, it does well, and it is fun while doing it
 So many cool things that can be done and would make it even better, one of the few VR games I am looking forward to seeing more content released
My wishlist:1
 Money: Being fast shouldn't just get you points, I want tips that I can use to fund things
 2
 Unlockables: Can I buy that soda machine
 Or upgrade it
 Maybe buy a deep fryer and make fries or onion rings, to then make more money
 Maybe buy a larger grill to cook more at a time
 Maybe buy a new restraunt that looks different
 Decorations for my restraunt
3
 More players: This one may be hard, and may not be possible
 The formula now is good now with two players, and adding more may disrupt that
 This would require more things for non-VR players to do though
 Unless perhaps you bought a larger restraunt, but that may end up putting more strain on the chef in the end
4
 More locations: Maybe a higher level that is a nice, expensive restraunt
 Or maybe a single player level that is a noodle stand
 Maybe a food truck
 So many possibilities to add a new spin to gameplay
5
 Food quality: Maybe buy your ingredients for each day/week
 Better ingredients means happier customers
 But also quality in cooking
 Maybe there is an optimal time to remove food from the grill, rather than just raw/cooked/burned, which could correlate to tips
6
 Food cost: What about that burger you have to throw away
 That stuff isn't free, that is lost income
 Same with those "free" pies, they cost somebody something
(The only thing I could criticize is that burgers cook then burn just a little too fast, but maybe that is just the chef in me
 I want to put the patties on the grill first, then prepare plates and buns, but by then they are burned
 Might slow down the gameplay, but could allow for preparing more meals at once and being able to deal with more customers more easily)

Love the game so far
 The art style is nice, controls are good
 Game play is fast
 Great work guys
Games like this could be akey point in VR games
 Even add different products to serve, like in Cook, Serve, Delicious
I have not yet tried the multiple player

Wonderful fun game, played with the wife for 2 hours then let the kids give it a go
 the height and scale adjustability are an awesome addition

This game is great

This game had a very similar vibe as the Gourmet Chef Sim in Job Simulator
 But that soon changed as the levels got harder and harder
 This game is intense and a lot of fun
 Not only by yourself but you can also have a second player on the Computer serve the customers, yell out the orders to the user in the Vive Headset and work as a team, take on the massive amount of orders AND PLEASE ALL THE CUSTOMERS
 I really enjoyed it and was surprised about how many times I keep jumping back in to test my skills
 Although you only cook Burgers
 the meals become more complex and it's so much fun
Here is my Let's Play on the game
 See if you'll like it, before you buy it - I think the price is fair

Pretty fun game so far
 Not too easy, not too hard
 Lots of progression and missions to do
 You earn money from doing the tasks and buy new planes and airports
 If you get motion sickness there are comfort options
 I turned all comfort options off and flew in simulation mode
 I got a little disoriented flying like this, first time in a while this has happened to me in VR
 Very fun flight sim with unique controls, the Vive motion controls do everything from flipping switches in the cockpit to grabbing the stick and operating the aircraft
 There are different things to do, I haven't tried all of them yet
 You fly through objectives to start, later on trying to land in tight spots and take pictures of different landmarks
 Holding the iPad while flying can be a little disorienting but I'm sure I'll get used to it
 The flight mechanics seem realistic enough and it does take a little learning to get a hang of flying the first ultralite aircraft
 The music and sound effects are fun, although sometimes its hard to push in the starter button long enough to start the engine
Would be nice to see a bit more life on the islands/ocean/air and some graphics options as well as a supersampling option in game
 Not all audio prompts are for the Vive controller but controls are basic and can be found beside the laptop
 If you want a flight sim/pilot wings style game this is it
Overall 8/10
Posted: 20 July
The most absolutely beautiful VR flight simulator on steam there is
 There are several more, but they both require all sorts of delirious input devices, but Ultrawings is the least expensive, and only needs the classic Vive controllers
 10/10 would recommend
Posted: 20 July
So far this delivers
How fun , the controls are easy and the physics do not punnish you too much
 Just finished my first job ,, 20 min of flying and just a lil wonkey
I usually get sick as soon as things start to move
 I get sick when in the passenger seat in a car,, I dont fly in real planes well
Forget boats on the ocean ,, blarp
 So just a little
tilty after 20 min is amazing for me
 I Think it is because it
moves like you expect it to ,, omg i want peddle rudders
 I recomend this very much
to anyone who likes to fly prop aircraft ( it IS slow moving ultralights) This is the game that is gunna make me push for my vr legs
 (will update after finishing the jobs just so happy with this i thought i would rave a bit while i took a break)
Posted: 20 July
I routinely play "study" sims and have flown many C172s -- this was enough to scratch that aviation itch
 Great atmosphere, fairly intuitive controls, good visuals
 One of the most rewarding and elements is the landing challenges
 Coming up to the target and looking down to your wheels as you watch them contact with the ground is super satisfying
 I feel like the landing challenge itself could be expanded with the use of a bush aircraft, like a Piper Cub with oversized wheels landing on tricky uneven terrain
PROS:-Flights dynamics feel realistic-Flipping switches on startup is fun-Progression with fun home-bases-Great sense of soaring-Easy to learn, challenging to masterCONS:-Rocket glider controls are confusing
 I push the rocket button to take off, but never know when or why it's going to fire again despite trying to cut fuel and glide
 Rocket also wont start after a "retry mission" selection
-Need to hold down trigger to maintain control of flight-stick
 Needs to be able to toggle or trim
If you like flying you'll like this game, I promise
Posted: 23 July
I love the flight physics of Ultrawings
 I love the feeling of speed, the feeling of height
 This is the best flying experience for the HTC Vive
 Made with lots of love for details

Solid Game
 I have gotten in loads of gameplay which justifies the big price tag
 Has a nice polished look despite being fairly simple
 Also I can fly planes now
 It does have a steep learning curve if you play in simulator mode but it is very worth it
 I just unlocked the sport plane and am having fun trying to tame it
 I flew between some buildings which felt super cool
 Every plane has its charms though and I still fly the first one even though it is the "beginner" plane
Posted: 22 July
Quite a relaxing VR flight game able to employ the use of motion controllers
Simple yet fun controls makes the game shine and immersive
The game would be perfect if offer more content like a bigger map and more larger aircrafts
Posted: 31 July
It's basically Pilot Wings VR and it's a hoot
 A must have for any flying fan
Posted: 20 July
It's very good so far
 As a fan of Aerofly FS 2 : Flight Simulator which I play with a flightstick it's impressive how well this works just grabbing onto and using the vitrual flight stick
 Definitely on the sim side of handling, not arcade
 The area seems a bit small but don't know if I've done enough yet to reveal anything further there might be
 It feels right and that's key in something like this
 I'm glad I bought it, maybe you will be too

THIS
 Finally, this
 We have this
 I doesn't seem like Valve is working on CS:GO:VR but this is very close to the real thing
 This is high quality VR deathmatch with players
 Also bomb defusal mode like Counter-Strike
 Rendering is crisp and performant, and everything sounds nice and realistic
 The weapons are great, and the gun-play is outrageously fun with perfect VR integration
 You will get good at this game, and feel so blood thirsty in the best VR murder simulator there is
 Also, you can teamkill in this game
 Thank you very much
 Team killing is very important to me
I love climbing to the top of the Rust map and shooting down from above
 In Datacenter, I try to akimbo with a shotgun and a pistol
 I can't reload the shotgun unless I holster the pistol so it's kind of hard, but it's really fun and gangster to start with a single blast of buckshot and then spam some scrow with a glock -- if I can surprise him and he's not with a friend
 When not screwing around, I guess I prefer the AK to the M4, just because it you have to manually load a chamber into the round which is more fun than just the touchpad action on the M4
 You get infiniite magazines so you don't have to worry about this if you can remember to keep a round chambered from last time
 I think they should only give you finite magazines, and let you scavenge, or more likely, die before expending them all -- but with less spam made by all
You might be out of luck if you don't handle touchpad movement well
 Take Dramamine(r), I guess
 It has teleportation option, but you will get housed in deathmatch, and/or will have to be a bit more of a prone camper rather than running around
 The hit detection might screw you if you are too close to your enemy, I hope they improve it
 The lobby room is still weird, and you don't see (you only) hear the other players when you queuing up
 The stock maps are few but now fully furnished
 Luckily everybody is rushing to make their best Dust2 or CoD badly-scaled map facsimile because this game has workshop support - woooo
 This is the best way to spend $9
99 if you have a VR headset
 Back when there was a demo, it had full hand/arm models
 It looked fairly decent, but they wisely removed them
 Also, there was a kid trying to get oriented, on my team, and he was squawking up a storm
 I executed the child by teamkill
 I'm sorry, I know that's really bad etiquette what with the personal nature of VR and all that, so I will never do that again
 BUY THIS

5/10Now I bet you're asking: "How does this compare to Onward
"That's the wrong question
 That would be like comparing Arma to Battlefield
 Both are great games, but for different reasons
Pavlov is tactical first person shooter game for VR
 Much like Onward, the gunplay is very realistic (aside from damage)
 In fact, I'd say the guns handle BETTER than they do in Onward
 However, gameplay is much more like CS:GO
 Pros:-The guns handle so well
 The recoil feels legitimate and accurate
 (take my word for it, I shoot a lot in real life, they compare pretty well aside from the weight and 'actual' recoil from the real deal)
-The graphics are clear and sharp
 The game runs incredibly well (aside from a small glitch that'll desribe more in detail later on)
 The menus are clean and intuitive and everything feels rather polished
-Communication is excellent
 The radio works very nicely (again, I honestly prefer this radio than the one in Onward)
 There is also vacinity communication
-Fun gamemodes
 Team deathmatch is fast paced, fun and still tactical, while Search in Destroy is just as tactical as CS:GO, but with the realism and immersion of Onward
 It's fast, rewarding, and you never get bored
-Price
 I was not expecting that price
 This game could easily sell for $15USD and I'd still enjoy every penny
 This is definitely the best valued shooter on the market
Cons:-There isn't enough time at the start of a match to really plan things out
 I'd like it if there was a 10-15 second timer at the start of Search and Destroy rounds
-The buy menu should be a little bit more obvious
 I've heard the same question, "how do we buy" about 100 times
 -There's a bug that causes me to see my Vive home
 It seems completely random and I can only fix it by bringing up the menu again
 When it happens, I'm completely blind for a few moments
 It really draws me out of the experience
 Suggestions:-A map of some sort
 Perhaps something we can bring up, or even a hud on our wrists
 -More maps
 Some that area
bit more open and some that are close quarters
 I'd like to really take advantage of that sniper
 ;)-More guns
 I'm sure alot of these suggestions are already in the works
 I'll add to this review if I come up with anything else
Conclusion:This is one of my favorite Vive games
 No, it's not a replacement for Onward, nor is it really a major competetor
 It's a different game all together
 If you want slow, tactical gameplay, then play Onward
 However, if you need your quick fix, then jump on here and play TDM
 Better yet, if you want fast paced, tactical, and always in the action gameplay, try out the Search and Destroy mode
 The devs are active and great, and this game has some true potential
 For that price, there's no reason you should hesitate to pick up this amazing game

Played a set with a friend in the 2 player mode by swapping the headset between us
Reminded me of real minigolf, but it's so much better
For instance:-I can stand on air, it's terrifying and feels so wrong, but I can do it-When my ball flies into the pond I'm not out $10 on hole 2 because I can't putt for crap
-I can make my ball shoot out of cannonsUnfortunately it's still close enough to reality
 It still takes ten putts to get it in the hole once you're right next to it because you keep hitting it just to the side of the hole
Posted: 1 April
Great atmosphere and a very enjoyable experience, especially if you play with a friend who has another vive
 You can play on one vive but you'll have to switch the headset a lot
 If the developer is reading this, I suggest in addition to asking the number of players, have an option to play XX amount of holes before switching, i
e
 switch every 3 holes and player 1 plays holes 1-3 and then player 2 plays 1-3
 Or 5 or 9 or whatever
 I think this would make local multiplayer less tiresome
Create your own miniput levels, so now I can prove my 12 year old self right when I had said I'd be able to make the best miniput holes
You can play other people's creations which are up/down voted by the community and make your own custom courses with them
Par 42 hole
 Yup it's there
 Cannons, fans, bumpers
 Different club lengths appear to have different speeds so you can choose the one you like best to get the best feel
Sometimes there are physics issues where you hit it in a way you didn't expect but these don't detract much
 Graphics are beautiful and simple, very relaxing
Pro-tip: Disable the music in the settings
 You will thank me
Another suggestion for the developer: Maybe have a zoom function in the editor to allow you to work with bigger pieces, unless it's there and I'm blind
 Sometimes it's hard to work with when they're small
 We have a minimum 2x2 meter space, let's use it
EDIT: There is a zoom function, labelled 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x on the left side, I just didn't see it
 Though it would be useful to be able to drag your entire creation, but I'm not sure how to do this
 I built mine accidentally into the edge of my playspace
Posted: 11 June, 2016
UPDATE: The new course editor is fantastic
Creating courses is actually fun, and showcases the strength of motion controllers as tools for creation
It also eliminates the shortage of holes
The workshop support has been integrated throughout the game and mkaes this an easy recommend
Played a full round of 18 holes with my friend online
Probably one of the best experiences I've had with the vive so far
Pros:
- The physics and atmosphere are great
- Fantastic as a social multiplayer game
- Course editor completes the gameCons:
- The physics can be wonky at times
Posted: 12 May, 2016
Cloudlands is a game where all you really have to ask yourself is whether or not you like minigolf
 The motion controls are pretty much perfect, and this is probably the closest you can get to actual minigolf without leaving your room
 The courses are another matter entirely; some of them are pretty standard, like the usual 3 or 4 par traditional courses you'd see on a real mingolf course, but some of them are enormous sprawling 40+ par courses filled with ball cannons
 rotating obstacles, half-pipe curves, and more that are really fun to play with a friend
 It has both online and local multiplayer, with the local play involving each player playing the course and then passing the headset to the next player
 It may not be the most exciting game on the Vive, but if you've got friends who are up for some minigolf you can get a pretty good time out of this
Posted: 19 April
A relaxing zen like miniature golf experience
The game uses one touch controller for the putter and is based on physics, some skill, and dumb luck of course
It comes with 18 holes but there are alot of user made holes thatre pretty good and accessible through the game
I like to play a random nine in the games standard course for now
I think this game is worth it, for the good VR mini golf experience and the workshop support
Posted: 6 April, 2016
Cloudlands: VR Minigolf is a game that I bought excited about a multiplayer game that you just pass the HMD to the next person
 That is not in the game yet but will be coming with a future update
 I still enjoyed the game although I don’t really have the patience for it and some of the holes are frustrating
 Pros:After hitting the ball you can press the trigger button and instantly warp to your balls current location
 This is perfect and necessary for a game like this
 Controls felt good, after a couple test swings I felt like I knew exactly how hard I need to hit it
 The haptics on the controller were spot on as well
 Good course design
 I personally like the simple wholes like you would find at an actual minigolf place but if you are a fan of wacky and difficult this game will cater to you as well
 Graphics are well done
 Cons:Frustrating at times, I played hole that had a Par of 42
 It was fun for maybe the first 5 or 6 hits then it was just annoying and I was swinging like a madman trying to finish it
 It may be I don’t have the patience for it, I am sure some people will love it
No spectator mode: If you have people that are trying to watch your game on the TV/Monitor it will only show what the person playing is looking at so it ends up being really shakey and not enjoyable to watch
 I am not sure how they could fix this maybe incorporate a 3rd person spectator mode
TLDR:The game is fun don’t get me wrong
 I recommend it on a sale, but personally I only like about half of the holes
 The simple ones are a lot of fun but holes that are just crazy and have par 42 were not enjoyable and made me lose my patience
 There is not a whole lot of content as of writing this review but I hope with future updates and free DLC more content and courses are added
 I think if the Devs made the courses more like 3D Ultra Minigolf it would be fantastic, I think it would be cool to have multiplayer where you could use powerups and such it would make it an insane party game

Posted: 20 April, 2016
Early Access Review
A flagship Vive experience that really takes advantage of the Vive's strengths
 Tracked motion controls make it like you live inside Garry's Mod instead of just playing around with stuff
 It's not just what you can build that's cool, but that the objects and tools feel so good
 It's an even better physics game creation kit than a contraption builder
 There's plenty of immediate fun from a collection of built-in scenes like shooting gallery and ping-pong (instant favorites for me), and many others which are all editable
 Plus you can share your levels or contraptions and download others using Steam Workshop
 Actual multiplayer is planned but not available yet though
 There's so much content already that the only way you won't get your money's worth is if you somehow just don't like physically interacting with things or building things
Shooting RangeI started off in the shooting range and took out targets using the crossbow and pistol and shurikens
 I tried and failed to shoot an arrow straight up and land it on myself, but I got pretty close a few times
 Once I realized I could shoot the platter with the pistol I spent 20 minutes just doing that
 Throw it up, shoot it down range, shoot it repeatedly on the same side to spin it faster and faster, warp to chase it down or spawn something new
 Even with just the no-frills pistol it's really fun to practice shooting using different techniques
Ping-pong / table tennis This was the best surprise and made me care enough to write this review
 The ball and stroke mechanics are amazing and could easily be the core of a dedicated game
 Whatever they did I hope they never change it
I'm not a tournament-level table tennis player by any means, but have trained with some serious people and have a table and ball machine in real life - and I was blown away at how realistic the shot-making is in modbox
 At first I had no expectations and batted the ball around, which worked well, so I decided to try hitting some realistic shots, which took some getting used to
 It's not like the wii where you're instantly good at everything from being a gamer
 I tweaked the included ping-pong level's ball machine to send slightly deeper and faster shots from farther away to make it easier
 Then I spent 45 straight minutes hitting every kind of shot I could think of against the dummy
 I was able to use a deep shakehand grip comfortably with the Vive controller and hit topspin, backspin, pushes, drives, sidespin, drop shots, and even fade loops from forehand or backhand
 Hook loops didn't work as well as I'd hoped, but I'm not that great at them anyway so it's probably me
 By the end I could reliably bounce a shot off the dummy and follow it up to the open court
 I was sweating from driving with my legs and moving but it was a ton of fun

My youngest son equates VR with Modbox, which he likes as much if not more than Minecraft
 His discovery of building cars and trains, from scratch and that work, has unlocked a whole new level of his imagination
If I let him I'm pretty sure he would spend an entire week inside this experience
 My sole complaint is that time evaporates when building in Modbox and listening to a custom playlist
 There's just something remarkable that happens when you start crafting machines and contraptions
If you enjoy creating "things" and random experiments, you'll enjoy this title

Early Access Review
This game was the absolute perfect playground to really get into VR for me
Having multiple maps and gamemodes right out of the box felt like having a bunch of multiple tastes of everything that VR could be, and it didn't leave me wanting at all
But, then it occured to me that this was only the beginning of what this game was, and could be
I played around with the creation tool (very minimally, I'm serious when I say I just played around) and immediately felt the scope of what these developers were trying to create
It is an infinite box full of goodies
For the price tag, anybody trying to get into their Vive should immediately pick this game up
There are very few great games for VR, and just buying this one game alone will add an assortment to your collection, and that assortment will continue to grow over time as the developers AND community add onto it
Lets talk about what content actually exists in here though
There were a few demo modes that just shows off some toys you can play with demonstrating the engine and what can be created with this tool
But, many are entire game modes that you'll enjoy the most
My favorite was the wave shooter where you use a bow as your main weapon
Shooting the bow was a fun experience in itself, but god I literally built up a sweat dodging enemy fire
I tried pulling moves like Neo, seeing how far I could bend backwards to dodge a shot
On the same vein, I enjoyed the tower defense mode, also defending against waves
I love wave shooters in general, so playing it in VR is just a blast
I've only played a hand full of the modes, but there are 3-4 pages full of modes you can experience
There is a lot of content there to play already, and that was only what the devs had created, I haven't even touched community stuff yet
But, what inspired me the most to write this review was what I saw just today
The developers update vlog on their Youtube channel
These guys are dedicated to continuing to not only add onto the functionality, and game modes, but they also created and continue to update development tools to make it easier for others to add scripts/models and modify the game
They are working, and succeeding, at making this game an endless space for development, and that excites me to keep checking in to see what is next, both from the developers and my fellow players
Lastly, I mentioned it before, but once again the price tag is great
Too many developers are overcharging for their games since it's a niche market, and sadly it only scares consumers away
But, these are the kind of guys that clearly love what they're doing more than it just being a cash out
If you have an HTC Vive, buy this game
For how much product there is in this game already, and for a price tag just a little more than eating at Chic-fil-a, there is honestly no excuse for it to not be in your library

why i love Modbox: i have always loved game development and went to college for game design even
 I want to make VR games out of my ideas and designs
 Until a HIGHLY polished version of Unity 3d Editor becomes available, NOTHING comes close to prototyping out game ideas in the way that Modbox does
 I would highly recommend Modbox to any aspiring game developer as well as the game design amateur enthusiast
 The Dev's communicate very well with the community and updates are regularly rolled out
 Easily the coolest way to express video game creativity using your vive and then playing in those creations ONLINE WITH OTHER PEOPLE (your friends can download your mini games for free to play them online with you

This has grown to be my favorite game in VR
 Through the developer's hard work they have created a game to enjoy hours of fun

Good game
 As an ice fisherman myself, I can say that it is exactly what it says it is
 Ice Fishing
 I think the graphics are OK for what it is, the gameplay is good, and I'm enjoying my time with it so far
One downside is that there is no tutorial (at least that I noticed)
 Meaning, if you don't know ice fishing already, you could be lost
 Some simple instructions would go a long way
 A couple of tips for starters: You need to run out on the lake, pick a spot, drill a hole with your auger, BAIT your hook/jig (there are grubbs that go on the hook or you won't catch anything)
 You can vary your depth using your mouse wheel (where I live, slightly off the bottom is where you fish, but other depths can work)
 There is a strainer next to the hole to keep ice out of the hole (click on it, I think I caught more fish when the hole was clear)
 Watch the end of the pole, when you get a hit, hit the F button on your keyboard or use the reel icon on the screen to pull up the line
 Lastly, there is a bait shop near where you started for bait, etc
 and when the time is running down, get back to that area to have your score count
 Not exactly "review" material, but I hope this is some help to you
All in all, a good ice fishing game that I'd recommend to a friend
 I haven't tried the multiplayer yet

First off, its not bass or ocean fishing, its important to keep that in mind when playing it
 Ice fishing is not fast paced or about the fights, its about the right lure in the right location
Graphics could be better but honestly they are better then alot of other $12 games out there
 Animation motions are smooth and did not experience any clipping issues
Multi-player is a fun idea, seeing others running around digging holes and jumping spot to spot on the ice
The sounds in the game are accurate and good
Did not seem to be drawing anything from my second video card but the game ran very smooth with no crashes or hang-ups
I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fishing, we dont have enough fishing games out there to pick from and to the collectors of group multiplayer games

In this game you play as a fugitive who got sent to Antarctica to die
Fish for your life as you have a family to feed every day
This game allows you to disapoint your family each and every night as you bring home countless 
05kg fish for them to feast on

Is it the most realistic ice fishing game
 Definitely not
 Is it fun
 Absolutely
 Especially when played with friends over voice chat
The devs have assuredly played Pro Pilkki before, since there are quite a lot of similarities in the game mechanics and that is not a bad thing
 For years Pro Pilkki has been the best ice fishing game out there and it's really a time for it to have some competition
 Does Ice Lakes provide the competition
 I'd like to think so
 It has it's ups and downs but over time this game could take the spot as #1 ice fishing game, assuming the devs will provide updates and fixes to it
Ice Lakes is still fresh out of the oven and that can be seen, especially on the multiplayer front
 Hosting a game / being able to join a friends game can be quite a pain in the buttocks
 Setting a password or lowering the max players value don't seem to have an affect
 But once you get going, it's really fun and I'm
optimistic that these small problems will be fixed in coming updates
If you are expecting realism, then you might be a bit disappointed
 The fish weights and amount of fish you are able to catch can seem quite absurd at times
 1
2kg ruffe
 that's something I'd like to see IRL ;) If you are up for some arcade ice fishing, then this game is definitely something to try out
5/5, will recommend

Got this from a Humble Bundle, and it seems pretty solid for what it is
 It could definitely use a playable tutorial, though; the existing "tutorial" is more of a glossary
Posted: 24 June
So many people complaining about not being able to catch fish
10 minutes in after trying and failing I discovered a tutorial
Instantly 4 catches
Actually does have a good realistic fishing feel, 0/10 without tutorial10/10 after reading tutorialRead up and learn to fish (F key is your best friend)

finally a fishing game that actually has single player tournements and tells you whos caught the biggest fish with records along with this and carp simulator are the best fishing games on steam fishing lovers will adore this relaxing game

I really like this ice fishing game a lot of fun ,great graphics too,it's almost like you really are out there on the ice
i recommend this game for fishing lovers

I'm prefacing this review with a disclaimer: I do not normally play fishing games
 I also do not own any VR devices
Ice Lakes is a very chill fishing game with a simple concept: drill a hole, wiggle some lure/bait, get fish
 It's one of those games where the goal is simple, but the way to reach that goal is like an endless pursuit of trial and error based on lure, rod, drill, and bait types
 It is an easy game to lose a few hours in just testing new gear and saving up for even better gear
 The tournaments make this whole process a lot easier than some other fishing games I've read reviews of (where grinding for gear could take DAYS of playtime) because even if you don't come in first in every round, you'll still get a decent amount for participation
 This game's tutorial/in game encyclopedia is a MUST READ if you plan to spend more time in the game
 The basics are pretty easy to figure out in game, but more advanced fishing require it (especially species-specific fishing)
 Overall this game is pretty good
 I ended up turning the music off because it's repetitive and dull, but the gameplay and graphics are decent for a fishing game
 Most funI've had staring at a hole in the ice

Early Access Review
As a person who did boxing as a hobby in college, I am very happy with this game and defintiely recommend it (especially because it is not a wave shooter like the rest of the VR games out there)
 I can block, bob and weave, counter punch when the computer throws punches (uppercuts, cross, hooks), so it's a great alternative to shadowboxing because you can practice defense at the same time
 The blocking stamina mechanic is a good compromise so people dont cheese the system
 However, since it is an early access game it is low on content (only one practice opponent and one real opponent), but I am sure the developer will add more soon since he has been very receptive to feedback and quick with his updates since his demo
 The core mechanics are very solid and it is definitely worth the current price
EDIT: Adding a gameplay video of myself to give people an idea of what to expect

I've had about 5 years of combat sport experience
 Full disclosure, it was MMA so that experience is more aligned with Muay Thai / American Kickboxing styles than classic boxing
 While there are certainly differences between the styles, the 'feeling' of hitting someone in the face and emotions range felt during a match are probably pretty close
 That being said I couldn't be happier to have something like this available
 VR really opened the door to this level of immersion for sure, but all credit should go to the developer behind this
 It's truly remarkable what he's accomplished
 Getting the pacing and feeling of some of the nuances of the sport and actual act of fighting someone without actually having boxed himself is worth the price of admission alone
 For perspective, I tried Knockout League and had to shut it off after the first fight for one simple reason; It committed the same sin virtually every other VR or motion controlled fighting game has before it
 It did'nt take the user seriously, watered down physics that have more to do with a rhythm game or timing game on guardrails than a fight
 Is ToTF perfect, the only thing missing is the concussion and black eyes
 Of course not, but IMO it's leaps beyond anything else mechanically and "experience" wise
 I know that is a word that gets thrown around a lot, but it's well earned for this title
 For
example, even the 1st opponent takes me back to exactly what it was like to lightly spar with a training partner
 Not too hard, not too slow, focusing on technique and movement
 Pairing the current experience with a super responsive Dev, frequent updates that are almost always a love letter to the (active) community on the forums and you have a winner worth 3x the asking price
 Personally, I can't wait to see where this game goes as we are treated to frequent and meaningful updates
Additional context, or to address some potential purchaser preconceptions:If you are looking into this as something to TEACH you to fight, I'll say this
 It's not an instructional
 HOWEVER
 If you use some common sense, watch some instructional videos or books on the subject, you can ABSOLUTELY drill and refine technique and precision
 This is valuable in a way that goes beyond pad or bag work as you can gauge actual distance and get used to 'picking apart' a defense
 With the addition of the round system, it can also teach you good pacing
 Just like real life, conserving your energy is a huge part of fight strategy
 When I was actively training, I was unfortunate enough to be one of those people that felt bad for hitting someone too hard that I trained with
 It's more common than you think, and with a game like this it allows you to get the 'feel' of things like (distance) timing and even evasion down without taking or doing any actual damage - except maybe to furniture or TVs if you don't strap in
 The big exceptions to what isn't going to build good real world habits are some intermediate level footwork stuff like cut and gate steps based on AI tracking and/or play area limitations
 You can still make these movements of course, but you don't get the same angles you would IRL if you really make someone miss
 The only other thing this game doesn't do is actually hit you back

Early Access Review
For those concerned with "yet another early access VR title"
 you are right to be
In other words, as advertised, this game is presently low on options with only 1 full opponent (not counting the training partner and the practice dummy manager)
There is a lot of work ahead for the dev
 However, let's also look at it from the POV of what we have
- A serious fun arcadish boxing game
check- A way decent level of presence
Check (I swear when he gets right in my face, I HAVE to back off
)- A workout and a half in trying to down the opponent
 Check
- A dev that has already shown an ability to listen and quickly apply some upgrades to key areas
Check
- Ugly Joe ugly enough
With the update, checkmate
Serious fun, superior to the initial demo in every way and well worth purchasing
Some tweaks still needed to the sound department (I want to hear the opponent grunt when I land some decent shots
) and the aformentioned need for other opponents but superior boxing game is attainable here when we look at the initial effort
Highly recommended

Early Access Review
THIS GAME IS GOING TO GIVE ME A SIX PACK
Errmmagerrrd, this game got me sweating
 I tried it when it first released and maybe there just wasn't content released yet, because I only remember fighting the trainer
 At the time, I thought meh
 Glad I came back to it, especially the day after a big content patch
I used to compete at a very high level in wrestling, and this game inspired the same feeling of dread where your arms are burning with lactic acid and all you want is a second to rest, but your opponent keeps coming at you and you have no choice but to fight
 Between rounds I would return to my corner and gasp for air, praying that the minute timer would slow down
As I write this I am pouring with sweat
 The first fighter got me huffing and puffing, but the second fighter made dig deep into my soul and muster every ounce of grit I had to win
 Took me several attempts, too
Not only did it require a tremendous amount of physicality, but you quickly learn that it's not just about throwing punches fast and hard
 You will figure this out right away when you find yourself unconscious
 Soon I was bobbing and weaving, throwing combos, body body head, head body uppercut, and soon it was my opponent that was hitting the mat
 I'm on the third opponent now and have realized that it's going to take a serious amount of skill and endurance to beat
 I have my punch force on the highest setting, so I might be challenging myself more than necessary, but I love a trial, and boy does this game bring it
10/10 my new favorite VR game
 So glad I gave it a second chance
Especially with pool party season coming up

Great potential
 Next release needs to have better physics
 90% of hits in to the opponent don't register, but still fun great short game
 can't wait for future expansions
 would be great to get the round timing's in, score cards, and more opponents

Absolutely brilliant game
 It is by far the most nuanced boxing simulator in the world (not that there are that many)
I've been playing this game for the past few months and it just keeps getting better and better
It's so rare to have a developer consistently exceed expectations with every update
 I wish there were a way to support the developer beyond the one time purchase of the game, but I think it wouldn't matter much to him anyway
 This game is clearly a labor of love

Early Access Review
I feel the need to post a review on this game, mostly for anyone who has "too high" of expectations
 Is this game perfect
 No
 Is it impressive
 Yes
 Is it worth $10
 Duh
 Hell, I'd happily pay $15, and reluctantly pay $20 for this
 And I'm so freaking cheap it isn't funny
Come into this game knowing there's only like 5 fighters (I think
 There may be more, I haven't even beat everyone yet)
 Don't expect there to be more
 I'm not the developer, so who knows, there may be
 What does matter is the fact that every fighter actually has a different feel
 There could have just as easily been dozens of fighters with very slight differences, which is much lazier than what was done here and would appease anyone complaining about lack of content, but this developer decided on a quality product
The punch force
 Not perfect, but damn if it isn't still impressive that you can punch air and the game calculates something plausible, and it works pretty well
 Improvements here would be awesome, but unreasonable to expect
There are flaws of course
 For starters, one of the first things I noticed is the fact that you don't really have a "stance"
 That said, these flaws are less "the developer doesn't care" and more "these are the limitations with our current VR tech/dev budget/man hours", and they are absolutely within reason and do not kill the experience
Don't go into this game thinking it's going to be a fun punching thing (like Punch-Out
)
 Don't go in and expect this game to deliver the perfect fighting experience, THE definitive fighting experience for years to come (though it probably actually fits that description as of now)
 Go in expecting a fight simulation and a GREAT workout (seriously, my first time with this game beat my arms harder than actually punching a 100 lb bag repeatedly
 This will EASILY not only replace, but kick the everloving s**t of of shadow boxing in your routine
 At least, until you can honestly do 3x3 minutes rounds going all out with a minute break in between by yourself)
 This is a small game made by one dude or a small indie team or something, and it is impressive
 Anyone who buys this game for $10 and decides that they haven't got their money's worth either came in with the wrong expectations or is just dumb
 On top of that, the dev is very active still
 I posted a suggestion on the forums at around midnight around here and got a reply within 5 minutes
tl;dr, Worth it
 I'm excited to see where this game goes in it's early access state, but would still be happy if the dev came out tomorrow like "Ok, it's done
" and released it as is

Ignore the bad reviews
This game is brilliant
 I just loaded it up during my lunch break and I'm covered in sweat
The developers really nailed it when they allowed the user to adjust the glove positionning
 The game progresses perfectly and it's very intuitive to learn
 The immersion is really intense
I never boxed a day in my life "other than Wii boxing" and I just jumped into it feeling like I was really in the ring
To add some stress
 they added some gruesome monsters to box against
 The Zombie is super stressfull as he gets closer and closer to take a bite
 ProsExcellent work out even if that's not your intention
Feels very natural after setting up the glove positionning
 Nice Grafx and audioNice variety of opponents
Cons/suggestions;You will soak your VR headset with sweatNo online play yet Would be nice to have arms Would be great to include some iconic boxers like Mike Tyson or Mohammad Ali to get a sense of scale ;)Bought for $10
99CAD and I feel it's definitely worth it
