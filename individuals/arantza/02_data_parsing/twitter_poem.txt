Am I ok?
I fell in love 47 times today
Am I enough?
Not that I loved serenity less but I loved torturing myself more
Why are we here?
If a romantic obsession a day keeps the meaningless nature of existence away
What's the point?
Nobody is coming to rescue me 
Do you miss me?
You have to rescue me from myself
Is death imminent?
Love can't save you
Am I ok yet?
I regret everything
