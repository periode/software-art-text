And html
I have a button 'import database'.When i clicks the button the loader should be shown until the loading complete.But my problem is the  loader image disappear suddenly after displays for a second.How can i solve this??
ANSWERS:
Learn the code from this chat - you can download it and experiment with it. But if you are beginner you will have to learn some things first because this is no hello world task. Good luck. 

You can loop through the other elements and close them first in your "show" function

and, in datatable...


QUESTION:
This question already has an answer here:
I am reading a .txt file which has a chat between two people. This text file is being modified in real-time as these two people are interacting in real time. I am reading this text file and trying to show the chat on a web-based application, I am able to read the text file once but when it is getting modified I am not able to show modified chat. I have HTML page and parsing of chat is done in PHP and script is in JS.
Thank you!
ANSWERS:
I too got same problem.

Add the above code to script and set the specific column with Date values with { "sType": "date-uk" } and others as null, see below:

Put all the json response on a key which is data here then at front end define that the server response is in JSON by dataType and then there is no need to parse data by JSON.parse()

ANSWERS:
It's a trade-off between the two options of which one meets the actual needs of the system with acceptable drawbacks.

For example, in PHP (with MySQL), I use the following:

I have shown show/hide using style property . You can do with your class too.


$('[data-response^=op]').attr("style","display:none");
$("#select-box").on("change",function(){
  if($(this).val() !="" && $(this).val()<=3 ){
    $('[data-response^=op]').attr("style","display:none");
    var selector = "op"+$(this).val();
    $(document).find("[data-response='"+selector+"']").attr("style","display:block;");
    $("#other-questions").attr("style","display:block");
  }else{
   $("#other-questions").attr("style","display:none");
  }

QUESTION:
I'm using the aws-sdk for NodeJS to interact with a DynamoDB table. This is my first look at DynamoDB.
When using a call like getItem() or updateItem(), the data structure includes types, like this:
Is there any way to pass and receive these objects without the types..? So...
Or, any helper functions already written that will convert objects to and from this format..?
So I could convert to it when populating call params, and convert from it when receiving data.
Trying to avoid accessing my data like:
I know I could write something myself, just wondering if anyone knows of functions/options already available that would do this. I couldn't find any.
ANSWERS:
I was using span with in td like 03/21/2017, by doing this, datatable treated this as string and sorting did not work.

Also remember to load the http://momentjs.com/

QUESTION:
I am using a Jquery plugin called datatables
Its fantastic, however I cannot get the dates to sort correctly according to the dd/mm/yyyy format.
I have looked at their support formats but none of these fixes seem to work.
Can anybody here help me please?
ANSWERS:
You can loop through the other elements and close them first in your "show" function

CSS

Therefore, you may display the date in any format you want; just have your server return the sorting criteria based only upon the sortColumnName.

Is it possible to make based on this actual one div at a time, that is to say both of the two events onclick can't open , but if one is open and the other one is clicked the first automatically close.

ANSWERS:
$(document).ready(function() {

Found this: https://github.com/kayomarz/dynamodb-data-types

Note however that users can still change hidden inputs if they want to.  This is not a secure measure, but can be an effective one if "security" isn't a concern here.
