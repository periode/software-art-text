												Wow
Apparently the game was released by accident and just happened to come across my queue this morning
So I took a chance and tried it out, not realizing just how "new" it was
The concept is great
You are assisting the grim reaper and you have to kill as many people as possible
Each level has three specific targets that are harder to kill and must be lured or tricked in order to get them to come out
The challenge comes from two areas
First, some traps are one time or limited use
So if you don't have people lined up just right, or have every single person in the same area that this trap can hit, then you can't get a perfect score (by killing everyone)
The second challenge comes in the form of angels
The more you kill, the more angels show up
If they see you messing with anything, you loose a heart
Loose all three, and you restart the level
The absolute best part of the game is simply watching things play out and learning how the levels work
I've just played through the entire game in the past 4 hours, but that's not necessarily a bad thing
I'm already going over all the possibilities in my head as to how I can kill some of the little people who got away
The game reminds me quite a bit of The haunting: Starring Poltergeist in that there is so much fun in manipulating objects to see what happens
Level variety is amazing! Museums with ancient artifacts, temples with hidden totems, giant monsters that can be found and unleashed, a missile factory full of spies (and potential accidents)
So many cool things to find
Knowing it's early access at the time I'm reviewing this, I am hoping there is some polishing up in the future
Currently, the biggest issue with the game is simply learning when to use certain objects
Using one at the wrong time can completely blow your chance at killing a certain person
An Undo button that takes back your last action or two would be *very* useful
Some levels also seem to have very few traps for the number of people walking around
The first level for example seems to be incredibly difficult in that most of the traps are one time use
Mind you, this is coming from the perspective of someone who would like to earn S ranking on each level
(Edit: Update below)Another complaint would be the long cut scenes that appear to be un-skippable
This is an easy fix, but it is very annoying to mess up, restart, and have to sit through the whole set-up process again
This game is a lot of fun and definitely worth the money
It is one of my favorite games I've stumbled on this year
Now, I'm going back and try to kill a certain "supreme leader" who has evaded me
This is a must buy if you enjoy puzzle games, exploration, and a sense of humor
Update:So I've gone back and sunk another 4 hours into the game and managed to get perfects on 4 of the 6 levels
You really get to experience the strategy elements when you are trying to get every single person, which adds depth to the game
The first level, which I had complained has very few traps for the number of people simply requires making sure you are using the right trap on the right person
This requires observing their patterns
One person might cross the path of 5 different traps, however another person may only pass one trap
So if you use that trap on the wrong person, you will find it impossible to kill the second person
My advice to those looking for S-rankings is to kill as many people as possible with the repeatable traps first before you start using the one-time usage traps
I sincerely hope there is DLC or a second game in the future
I want more!

												Hahaha! This is awesome!Ok, you could find something morally wrong with killing innocent people by dropping air-conditioners on them or dropping them into man-holes but you're death in this game, so it's expected from you
Nice little puzzles and a lot of amusing ways to end the lives of the little people on the screen
Obviously not for kids!

												I love everything about this game
Except for the fact that the the green arc in front of the Angel Police seems to have no actual bearing on whether they can see you or not
 I've breezed right through it and not been caught; conversely, I've been dinking around murdering people across the entire zone from them and gotten hammered
 A++ though definitely the most adorable game about murdering as many people as possible

												Minus its translation kefluffles and some tiny bugs, Death Coming is a great budget title that runs with its premise and turns it into some joyous and silly rather than grotesque
If you're fond of puzzles blended with absurd replayability, this is definitely up your alley
Be wary however, this is still in Early Access even if it counts as a full release because of a mistake the dev team made when fixing some bugs in a recent version of the game
Even with it being in EA, Death Coming is a nice game to play casually between other games

												I absolutely love this game
It hits that intersection of challenging and fun, the art, animation, and music are charming, the puzzles are creative, there's some philosophy in there to give it a little depth, and a healthy dose of irreverence for fun and flavour
I was surprised at the amount of replayability as well
It takes a few tries to perfect your score, but the game is so charming and fun, and the death traps so varied, that I don't find it too frustrating (just frustrating enough to keep me coming back)
At the current price the game is about the perfect length to feel like a good deal, and I'm really impressed with it for being in early access, but I'm already hoping for an expansion or sequel
Great job, devs! Two minor suggestions


One, if I could skip the opening cutscenes for each level after I've watched them once, that would really streamline the experience
Two, there are a couple of scenes where the HUD covers dialogue bubbles

Review copy provided by developerAs a species we have an understandable fascination with death, and in particular the idea that it might not be a simple cessation of biological function
Most cultures have their version of the Grim Reaper, a being embodying death itself who culls the living according to his own esoteric agenda
That agenda is yours to execute in Death Coming, engineering accident after accident to remove targeted individuals from the mortal world
And while it might not be the first or most polished game to tread that path, it's a fantastic mix of clever and cute
You're dead (sorry for your loss), but instead of drifting off to the great beyond you get recruited by a business-minded reaper to assist him in claiming souls
While you can't do any reaping yourself, you're free to set off Final Destination-style death traps to expunge the life of your targets
Kill enough people in one area and you get to move on to the next, but killing people also brings down the attentions of death-averse angels
And if you kill enough of the right people, you might just learn something new about your own demise
The six levels of Death Coming are presented in lovely isometric pixel art, full of colorful signage, bustling shops, humming machinery, and adorable punching-bag-looking people
It's these precious souls you need to kill, and it's always by clicking on hazardous elements of the level like precarious flowerpots or loose boards or manhole covers to activate the trap
One click highlights a trap and gives a small description of it, while a second click sets it off
All it takes to end someone is a click at the right time, but traps range wildly in complexity
Dropping an A/C unit on someone is hardly a challenge, but in later levels you might be spilling oil in a particular spot, then waiting for it to rain to spread the oil, then triggering a spark to ignite it just as someone walks by at the right moment (or wrong moment for them)
It's important to note that very little of what happens in Death Coming is mundane
The second level, for example, takes place in a nuclear warhead factory run by a masked dictator
You're supposed to kill all the employees but you can kill spies to help complete the warhead, or kill the dictator's secret mistress by getting her to sleep with his assistant, or kill his groupies by letting him spy on them changing and then dropping a rack of crates on them as they flee
The situations you can engineer only get more insane from there, like turning a museum curator into a werewolf or helping a damsel kill mercenaries and free the Kong knock-off from a nearby ship
The best kills are weird and funny and completely unpredictable, making their discovery a highlight of the game
The obscure nature of these situations also works against them, though
Many of the traps available can only be used once, and it won't always be obvious what they do before you trigger them
Falling traps helpfully highlight their killzones for you but more random or multi-phase murders are left up to guesswork
In the museum I spent several minutes working out how one setpiece worked, only for it to kill no one because its range was so small
The hit detection can also be terribly finicky, as I've missed more than one simple manhole kill that looked to be dead-on
Later levels also introduce weather effects which can activate new traps, but also lock off access to earlier ones which makes learning how everything works that much more important
What this all means is that the real puzzle isn't finding ways to kill people, it's finding the specific sequence of ways to kill the most people
You have quotas to meet to reach the next level but even the lowest one is easy to miss if you flub a few key traps
That means you have to play the whole level over, including the unskippable intros which get pretty long by the final level
Oh, and there's also the angels who start patrolling as the body count rises and stop you if they see you fooling with something
It's a three-strikes policy and while they're not too hard to avoid, they can leave you waiting far longer than necessary for a timing-based trap
I don't necessarily have a problem with this sort of trial-and-error gameplay but it's not quite the free-form murder simulator I was hoping it would be
Completing the game should be simple enough but I don't see myself ever going for perfects on any of the levels
If you're the kind of person that feels like mastering the art of reaping though, you'll have plenty to keep you busy here
Levels are vast and contain dozens upon dozens of ways to end lives
It'll take around three hours to simply beat all the levels, and then far longer to work out all the special kills and strategies for clearing each locale out
It's also worth mentioning that the developers are still very active in addressing issues like flawed designs and rough translations since the game was mistakenly released as normal instead of Early Access, and they're treating it as such
Honestly, despite the little frustrations I really enjoyed spending time in such a charming, zany, detailed world, depriving its inhabitants of life
Fans of off-beat puzzlers or adorable mayhem should definitely check it out
Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them at https://goldplatedgames

												Clever idea, well made sprites- charming and silly all at once, and this is a game where the goal is to kill everybody!This is an Early Access build, but I love this so much I had to write a positive review for it ASAP!This is wildly fun, the levels play out like puzzles, and there's little stories in each level as well
You cannot directly touch people, and certain things require you to perform other tasks to use
For instance, you can knock over a telephone pole, cool right?You can break a fire hydrant, IN FRONT of that pole, and then knock it down creating a huge electric spalsh zone that kills far more people
There are some very complex puzzles here, trying to kill everyone is quite a task! it isn't required to kill EVERY person, there's a score, and a leaderboard as well for every level
It's really fun to see what you can affect, and the resulting effects from your interactions are pretty inventive at times
You may need to think out of the box if you want the higher scores!( when this is a full release, and if anythign dramatic changes - I'll update the review, until then; consider this my definitive review! )

								What a hidden gem this game is! The grim reaper killing concept juxtaposed with the cheerful music and cutesy reactions is right up my street			
Posted: 8 November
												Now, this is certainly a walk on the lighter side of death


So far, it's amusing, though those angels are


in dire need of adjustment or clarification, or both
Released from Early Access by mistake, I'd say this is one of the better mistakes from the storefront
:PThere's a lot of tweaking to do, though


and there's something of a mild shortage of ways to die, far as I can tell - not all traps reset themselves, which can be a problem if you miss the crowd

												This game is smart and hillarious
I was hooked instantly
The puzzles are clever, and the translation might feel off, it is not beyond the ability to comprehend how the game works
Sometimes you see and death and go "awww" at just how adorable it all is
This dev team did a great job

								Puzzle Pirates is a fantastic game I can't recommend highly enough
I've been playing since 2006, and have spent thousands of hours on the game
Puzzle Pirates is a puzzle-based MMORPG, where puzzles form the key part of the gameplay
The game revolves around these puzzles
Players team up to sail ships, which can then fight other players ships or AI ships
Some players perform one puzzle to make the ship move faster; other players perform a puzzle to reduce the damage taken on the ship; other players perform a puzzle to remove water from the ship, and so on
Overall, there's 20+ puzzles in the game, all of which have a different function in the game
Puzzle Pirates: Dark Seas is a new ocean (server), where more focus goes on PvP than in previous oceans
There are two factions: Light (Defiant Armada) vs
Dark (Shadow Fleet)
These two factions are perpetually at war; if ships from opposing factions meet in battle, the battle will be sinking, with the defeated losing their ship permanently
The developers are still fleshing out the PvP elements of the new ocean; there's still work to be done in this aspect, and it's one of their priorities for Early Access
Also, while the game is Early Access, you're definitely getting a full game here
The game has been around for around 15+ years
There are new aspects to the new ocean, and changes are coming, which is why it's EA, but this is not an unfinished game
This is a game players have been playing and enjoying for years
Some pros and cons for the game:+Puzzles: There are over 20 puzzles for this game
I've been playing for over 10 years, and haven't gotten bored of them yet
Some are better than others, and everyone has their personal opinions, but almost everyone has puzzles they enjoy playing over and over
There are 3 types of puzzles: Piracy (puzzles that help a ship function), Crafting (puzzles that produce labor for the economy, more detail in a minute), and Parlor (Poker, Hearts, Spades, and two custom games, Drinking and Treasure Drop)
The puzzles are still fun after years, and there's a real sense of progression as you get better at the puzzles
The better you perform at a puzzle, the more you contribute to the ship, or the higher quality labor you provide
The puzzles provide a very skill-intensive factor to the game
+Community: Puzzle Pirates has the best community of any game I've ever played
Pirates join a crew, and crews join a flag, which participate in end game content and larger events (blockades, the end game content of Puzzle Pirates)
I've met more friendly people here than in any other game
I have friends who no longer play who I still keep in touch with, and I keep meeting new people
I guarantee that if you play this game, you'll be able to meet a lot of cool people extremely easily
People love to help out new players and teach them the game
+Economy: The economy is entirely player-driven
Players buy basic goods, turn these goods into intermediate goods using player labor, turn these intermediate goods into final goods using player labor, and then sell these goods to other pirates
All labor to produce goods must be provided by players through crafting puzzles
Supply and demand has real affects on the market
It's also easy to own your own stall to create goods and to make money this way
There are players who focus on making money this way rather than sailing on ships, and it's a very feasible way to play the game
There are many more positive aspects to them the game that I enjoy, but the above three are what I believe what makes Puzzle Pirates special and unique
If someone were to ask why they should play this game, I'd give the above reasons
A couple of cons below:-Dubloons: There are two kinds of currency in Puzzle Pirates: Pieces of Eight (PoE) and Dubloons
PoE is the main currency, generated by pillages at sea, and used to buy goods from bots and from other players
Dubloons are the micro transaction currency
Most final products (ships, cosmetic items such as clothes and furniture) require a dubloon cost in addition to the PoE cost
Dubloons are only available through purchase with real money, and then can be sold in game for PoE
There's two ways to get Dubs: purchase them yourself, or buy them on the market for PoE
It adds to the cost of being a free-to-play player, but by no means is the game pay to play or pay to win; it's very possible to play and experience all of the content of the game without paying any money
But it's a definite downside new players should be aware of
-Graphics: I personally like the graphics, but that's maybe just because I'm used to them! However, the graphics definitely aren't top notch
It doesn't affect the game play, but it's definitely a problem for players expecting amazing graphics
-Playerbase: Back in its heyday, Puzzle Pirates had thousands and thousands of players each day (no clue on the exact number, but I'm sure it was over 5000 daily)
Now, there's maybe 1000 players, if that
It's still very possible to play the game and have a lot of fun, but the playerbase is definitely down
Part of the hopes for this new beta is that the playerbase will grow to previous heights
Overall, Puzzle Pirates is an absolutely amazing game that I think everyone should at least try out
It's an incredibly unique MMORPG that many people have fantastic experiences with, and I'm glad that I randomly stumbled upon this game over 10 years ago

								Puzzle Pirates is a great game that has lasted through the ages
With many mini-games to keep you busy, you'll find yourself asking where the hours went
Go on a ship and steal some treasure from some brigands and barbarians, or even other players! And if fighting on the open ocean doesn't appeal to you, then open your own shoppe! With Dark Seas and Early Release, we will see changes to the old Puzzle Pirates game that many enjoyed
So whether you are new or old, come give YPP:DS a chance! Can't wait to see you there

Early Access Review
								I loved the original puzzle pirates, and this was no different
It is the same game, just reskinned
Overall the game is great, but you must beware of spending real money on the game
I logged my 55 hours in a months time
I feel that any game that makes me spend so much time deserves my money, so I spent $20 (US) on a package ingame
Things were going great
Joined a great crew, bought a few ships
Then I started wagering, that is when things went bad
They have an automatic detection method for spending real money in game
Story: I wagered my 2 ships in a swordfight
Won the swordfight
Guy wanted a rematch, so i thought, if i lose then i will still break even
Won another swordfight against him
He was mad a left
Literally minutes later I was banned
The reason: RMT (Real money trading)
I have never spent real money to third parties, I litterally had just spent $20 on the games microcurrency
Why would I buy their currency then go out and risk it all for a few extra PoE (standard currency)
It litterally makes no sense
It gets a thumbs down from me due to the fact that support sends a bogus email telling you to tell them where you bought the currency from or you will be banned forever (again i never purchased anything, so what can i say back?)DO NOT SPEND MONEY IN THE GAME
Automatic rule enforcement with no way to dispute puts it at risk
Thanks for stealing $20 from me

								I've been a long time Puzzle Pirates player and had a blast playing on the older oceans years ago
Coming back to Dark Seas has been a welcoming experience
With a steadily increasing ocean population, wait times for pillages have been an all time low
This game is virtually timeless, as its easy-on-the-eyes graphics allow for hours and hours of puzzling and community fun
It really is, in my opinion, the ultimate cooperative mmo out there
 It's gameplay is truly unique
Every aspect of the game that you take part in truly matters, whether it is repairing battle damage on your ship, loading the cannons, navigating dangerous Kraken nests


it's all up to you, the players, to work together as a team
Highly recommended, however, I do feel that there is a slight learning curve for the newest players

								Love this game! I've been playing for over a decade and I keep coming back to it
It's great for anyone who enjoy games with an emphasis on community-involvement and/or lots of different, interesting puzzles
The game's system is set up in a way that's unlike any other games I've played, in terms of player flags owning and operating the islands that make up the world, the mechanics for pillages, and the numerous sea monster hunts
It's more fun that it appears at first glance!

												Title: This confused me for a while
I interpreted it in a manner similar to "George of the Jungle", and spent a good space of time believing that the protagonist was named Mark
Somewhere, deep in my heart, I still believe his name is Mark
As such, I will be referring to the protagonist as Mark for the duration of this review, and afterwards as well
Graphics: It's like playing a cartoon which is kind of cool
I watched Samurai Jack one time, and he was pretty neat
I like to consider Mark as like his cousin on his mother's husband's side or something
The graphics contain many cool features such as ninjas, lights, and enemies
Some people consider the characters to be two-dimensional, but I think that they're just drawn that way so we shouldn't make fun of them
Everything is nice and fluid, it's like the characters are made of water or maybe filled with *blood
Sound: The characters have voices and they use them to say things like"HURGH" or "BLARGLREGARGLEBLARGH" when you stab themGameplay: Gameplay is very stealth-centric, meaning it may be difficult to notice at first
Once you manage to spot it, however, you'll be hooked
And so will the guards
There are lots of great ways to sneak around, like kill the guards, or hide from the guards, or scare the guards so much that they shoot their friends and kill them for you #Teamwork2014 #JustGuardThings #Livin'ItYou get gadgets and they're usefulYou can think in this game, and I've grown to appreciate how thinking stops time so you can decide where you want to throw things like darts and smoke bombs
I find it very distracting how much the game is based on distraction and getting guards to squander their attention on arbitrary things in the environment like the noise mine you threw behind them
Story: Mark bears the mark of the ninja, which gives him extra abilities
One of those abilities is the ability to take Revengeance upon the bad guys by killing them and stuff
Another ability is to go insane and kill your friends, which would be sad, but I guess they'd stop being your friends when they saw you trying to kill them so then you wouldn't be killing your friends it would just be a mob of angry dead not-friend ninjas which is entirely morally justifiable by comparison
Title: 1Sounds: a lotGraphics: Probably more than ten, I wasn't really counting when I played it so I dont know the exact number of graphical assets involvedStory: 2 if you have the DLC thing, 3 if you count the two different endings based on your final choice
---------------------------Total: pretty good game, almost bought again but realized that would be pointless*This has, in multiple instances of gameplay, been confirmed true

												Mark of the Ninja is a mix between 2D platform and stealth killing, in wich you can always clearly see what's happening around you, making it easy to plan your moves
Controls are greatly responsive and you have a good variety of ways to complete the interesting and diversified levels, in wich you can find optional stuff and complete secondary objectives; this and a New Game+ option make it easily replayable
Graphics are very clear, and overall style is enjoyable
Story felt uninteresting to me, but with solid mechanics like the ones this game has I can deal with it
			
Posted: 2 November, 2014
												Mark of the Ninja is an aesthetically pleasing, 2-D, stealth-based, side-scrolling platformer


a
k
a
a masterpiece
For those of you who want a brief overview without looking at it in the steam store, think of it as combining the best qualities of Thief, Dishonored, and Assassin's Creed and giving it all to you in a different, albeit wonderful, 2-D perspective
To give you a sense of the story itself, you play as a ninja (no way, right?) who accepts the "First Mark," a tattoo which imbues mystical powers to the one who accepts it upon their body
While this seems like a fantastic benefit, accepting the mark means sacrificing yourself in the future because the ink is said to drive people to insanity (e
g
, hallucinations)
Your purpose-without spoilers-is to avenge your clan that was recently attacked by an evil arms corporation by utilizing your newly-acquired powers
As the story progresses, you receive more marks, more abilities, and more means to uncover the irreconcilable truth about your role, your clan itself, and those of power who essentially mean to save and/or destroy it
Now if this hasn't already got you hooked or clicking off of my review to go buy it, then please allow me to further elaborate the feel of the gameplay
Mark of the Ninja does not care precisely how you play the game


to a certain extent
Yes, the stealth aspect is a given
This is not simply because this is the major theme/tag for the game itself (who knew?), but also because while you can dish out hits, you can't take many more hits than other enemies in the game
This is exceedingly true if you try to go in "weapons blazing" (expect to be punished and killed relentlessly if you do this)
Despite this sometimes perceived "limitation" by some players, there are multiple routes and means of accomplishing each level through various stealth-based tactics
You can choose to be cruel, fast, and terrorizing, or merciful, meticulous, and tactful--or even a mix of these depending on the situation/your mood at any given moment! That's one of the most glorious aspects of the game: Freedom of choice to accomplish objectives
Combine this with the gorgeous settings for each level, and the 2-D game does not feel at all linear or dimensionally flat
Finally, there are a couple of minor details I'd like to state that may or may not apply to other players (skip this if you like): 1) I admit that I played this game on steam with an Xbox 360 controller and not with the keyboard and mouse
I recommend doing so for the sake of the ease of controls
However, you may have your own preferences and be able to get used to keyboard/mouse controls faster in comparison to me
2) At some points my computer lagged terribly due to how many various processes were going on in the game with the visual effects (e
g
, when there was a raging sandstorm in one level)
The creators even comment upon this minor flaw if you turn on the in-game commentary within the game itself (which I also recommend because it reveals some really awesome facets of the making of the game!)
3) Mark of the Ninja is a highly addictive game with major replay value
It took me 14 hours to complete it the first time through, and I intend on replaying it once again on new game+ mode in the future
Hopefully, all of the aforementioned reasons will sway you to spend some money in steam to purchase a game that has certainly left its "mark" on me
Please don't think me insane for adamantly urging you to acquire this game instead of letting it sneak past some gamers unnoticed
I recommend picking it up immediately, but if you want to wait until it goes on sale in the steam store that's fine too
I doubt it will let you down regardless :) In short, Mark of the Ninja gets a well-deserved 10/10 (ninja) stars in my book, and I'd like to thank Klei Entertainment for allowing me to play through this utterly amazing story

												A superb 2D platform stealth game
Lots of fun and great value for money
One of those games that caught me by suprise and opened my eyes to the world of 2D stealth games, Mark of the Ninja is a fairly simple idea
You are a 'ninja' that is granted special powers and a terrible curse, and you must fulfill your deadly mission
How? Will stealth, cunning and an array of cool powers and fun gadgets

because nobody has
And why havent they? BECAUSE HES ACTUALLY A NINJA
In popular culture, ninjas have turned into something that they historically never were to pander to the masses
They are portrayed (in games, movies, cartoons, and all popular media) as super invincible Rambos who come in and lethally destroy hundreds of people who should on all accounts kill them immediately
theyre given super human strength, agility, reflexes, to the point of being rediculous, because people like to watch that
It makes them appeal to the audiences who want to watch them do exactly that
The problem is that is NOT what ninjas did
In fact, you couldnt make them do anything that was MORE against the souce material
The biggest point to this that makes it kind of insulting is that they are making these changes to ninjas to make them more badass, when ninjas were already badass to begin with, and didnt need any help
The art of the ninja was the art of nonexistence
They were shadows
Whispers
They were sent on missions that noone else could be sent on
They would sneak through places undetected to gather information, or yes, sometimes to assassinate people
They were very skilled at killing people, but did so ONLY at the absolute last resort, to prevent themselves from being discovered
They kept their identities secret
They covered their faces
They tried their hardest to NOT EXIST
The fact that everyone knows ryu hayabusa and strider (even in their oen worlds) and that characters like them run around in the open massacreing hundreds of people and not caring who knows means that they are NOT ninjas
not even that they are bad ninjas
they arent ninjas at all
This game lets you play as a REAL ninja, and is one of the only examples of a game Ie seen that actually lets you do that
You cant fight the gaurds, or at least its VERY difficult to beat them in combat, even one on one
Why? I thoght you were a ninja? You are, but they have GUNS
Just because youre a ninja doesnt give you the ability to easily defeat a trained soldier with a loaded gun in fair combat
But you can very easily defeat them if you sneak up on them
thats what a ninja would do if he had to kill
the game also gives you extra points for hiding bodies, which is again, what a ninja would do
The game gives you MORE points if you can go through the level without killing people or being detected
The goals a ninja would have
The game is very fun
and it points out that you can have  REAL ninja, as opposed to a hollywood ninja, and still be badass
arguably even more badass
Give the game a try

												Before the chit-chat, let me say something upfront: Mark of the Ninja is an exceptional stealth-action game, that will change your way of thinking about Indie titles if you had ambiguous feelings before
It isn't simply a great game, but also has character, story, depth and uniqueness
Our hero is an unnamed ninja of the Hisomu clan
Just after getting tattooed with an ink from a special flower that will make him have extraordinary power his clan is attacked by soldiers and his mentor is taken hostage
After freeing him, the journey begins
Yes, it's revenge time
It's not the most well cooked stories out there and the ending lacks a real punch, but from an indie title of this kind it's very ambitious
After sending our hero on his mission it is explained to him that the ink under his skin not only will make him stronger but after some time it'll drive him mad
Before that could happen he sworn to commit suicide
But, the mission first
As we progress through the levels our hero will learn (we unlock) new abilities that help us deal with enemy soldiers
With the increasing number of light sources, lasers, detectors and enemies the game gets more and more challenging, but never too difficult to frustrate the player
With common sense and orientation you can always find the right path to clear the room or pass by the enemies undetected
And exactly this is the biggest fun source of the game
There isn't a definite way to finish a level or even to solve a room
You have a wast array of items you can choose from and you can use any environmental object to be successful
You rarely HAVE to kill a guard to reach the next room, there's always a second option
The game tracks your progress all the time
Finishing a level without being detected or doing all the side tasks in a level will earn you more points to spend on special abilities and more effective distraction/attack items
When you feel the game is beginning to get somewhat repetitive it always throws you something new to play with, to make the fun lasting
You can even change your outfit after some time
And this isn't a pointless dress change you see in many games
With the new suit you get new abilities, but you're reduced with other ones
It is really awesomely balanced, where everybody can find the clothes that fit the player's style
With exceptional game design comes exceptional art design
The game isn't the most beautiful you've ever seen nor packs the most polygons, but it's art and it's unique
On the audio side the lighting strikes and dog sniffles are great
The OST consists of well composed pieces that support the ninja-feel and stealth nature of the game
After finishing the game you can start again on New Game + mode which is essentially a hard mode and it's really challenging where your viewing angles are reduced and the enemies are more aware
Mark of the Ninja executes and delivers on every part you can imagine
It's a definitive standard for indie titles
If you like stealth games, play it
If you like 2D action games, play it
If you like platformers, play it
If you want to have fun, definitely play this piece! And, well


ninjas and stuff

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Mark of the Ninja Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: 2D; Stealth; Platformer; Action; Ninja  My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 10-20 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWMark of the Ninja is an instant indie classic
 It is very easy to digest and has an alluring simplicity to it; but at the same time it boasts exciting gameplay and a very refined atmosphere
 Elements of 2D platforming, stealth, and action combine to create a distinguished and enjoyable identity for the game
If you generally appreciate this style of game, then you should consider checking out Mark of the Ninja
The core gameplay is relatively simple and easy to dive right into
 The controls are mostly comfortable and intuitive, and the design style allows each person to tailor their play to their preferences
 Each mission allows for a little improvisation at times, as there are often different routes you can take to reach your goals
And as you unlock new items and abilities, you can experiment with new approaches to keep the game fresh
   There isn't much per way of the story, but there is enough information offered to give you a basic purpose to your actions
But even though the story elements are minimal, the game has an outstanding atmosphere
 The art style is very pleasing, especially the hand-painted backdrops
And the lighting effects are exquisite, particularly due to the importance of staying in the shadows
Add in the fitting weather effects and the soundscape and you are left with a truly pleasurable and captivating atmosphere
Mark of the Ninja also was designed to be challenging without being overly difficult
I personally felt that it was perfectly balanced to not be too easy and not be too hard, dwelling within that perfect “Goldilocks-zone” that allows the game to appeal to a vast majority of gamers
And since most people won’t be able to just breeze right through it unchallenged, it can take over a dozen hours to complete— even though it isn’t necessarily a long game
On top of that, there is also a NewGame+ mode to add some replay value for those who would be interested
In summary, I posit that grabbing Mark of the Ninja is an easy choice for any true fan of the genre
And due to the high quality of the game design, I also would suggest that more casual fans of the genre give it some strong consideration as well

												I'm long time due with a review about Mark of the Ninja, as it's gameplay and way of presentation captivated me from it's first level
Gameplay-wise the game is an stealth game - but unlike games like Thief series, here you can dispatch your enemies in various ways - if you want to
You can arm yourself with incredible variety of tools - you can change your skin/cloth, resulting in a different combat style that can alter your health, pool of distraction or offense items, and sometimes introducing unique traits to that combat style
I mentioned items - you can use sound crackers to throw and distract your enemies, flares to make them dizzy or blind, a good old cardboard box to hide in plain view, or some bombs, plus some extra
In addition, all items have upgrades, for example smoke bomb blocks laser path and vision, but the upgraded one chokes and stuns enemies unlucky enough to be caught inside the cloud
If you're into more offensive gameplay, you can use darts that will incite terror in your poor victim, who will see enemies in every corner, very likely killing his guard-mates
Or you can use flesh-devouring bugs to make a body disappear or kill someone in a noisy fashion *yikes*, or a spike trap


Besides the straight "kill the poor sod who's targeted" effect offensive weapons are very likely will plant fear in other enemies who see their friends perish, so these simple tools actually have much more strategic usage as it would seem
Or who need tools? You're a ninja! You can get upgrades that improves your hand-to-hand skills by giving takedown abilities, various ways to catch your enemies off-guard by attacking from above, below, or behind close doors, or you can learn how to float a while after a jump!The best thing in all of these upgrades that there is no skill tree, no various classes - you unlock whatever you want if you have enough points for them
Said points can be acquired by completing levels with 1-2-3 medals - this require you to get enough points for the three tiers
And now after mentioning points, back to the gameplay
Getting points is actually really easy, and easy to count on
You can get points for killing an enemy, hiding the body, distracting them in various ways, passing them unnoticed, panicking them, etc, etc
The game is made in a way that it can be completed in a non-lethal fashion (though as story requires you to kill the target, he and his guard in chief are killed in both gameplay styles) and you can still easily get enough point on a level to get all 2 medals
The game plays wonderfully
Movement is responsive and easy to get used to, the game features a focus mode that's not breaking the game's immersion while let you aim carefully with your tools / re-think your strategy
All the weapons are very easy to use, their indicators are clear, while the whole system absolutely lacks the feel of spoonfeeding
Basically the game features a system that makes really easy to use your gadgets but doesn't really limits you how and when to use them - for good or bad, depending on your choices and the ability of aim that pesky smoke bomb :)I wanted to point out another feature in the game: New Game Plus
You can keep everything you have from the first gameplay, and the game reasonably makes the game more difficult
Guns will kill in one shot, enemies' cone of sight will be invisible, there won't be visual feedback about how far some noises can be heard, and you too will get a cone of sigh: anything above, below or behind you will be heavily blurred
I was tremendously happy to see such change in the game, because the game's difficulty scales not by the number of the enemies, but making the game technically harder, requiring more attention (Which shouldn't be hard after completing it beforehand)The game's visual presentation can be seen as plain at a first glance because of the lot of dark areas, but it's really accurate and original
Various styled levels are presented across the game, from the modern city with it's stark edges, catacombs with darkness and decayed, uneven surfaces to the ruins of an old city where most things just want to fall apart, resulting in various traps unique to that few level
  Between the levels the cutscenes use cartoon-like style, which really fits the overall design, and it's really well done - features tell-tale facial expressions while masking parts of the story
Obviously, there's a lot of work in writing the game's story and make the story, design, style, gameplay elements to fit together
And as a last thing, still part of the graphical feats I'd like to mention one of the game's cutscene (no spoilers) I've found uploaded here: and the game's final level as both are gems of the art-like presentation in games - I'm sure I'll remember the closing level of the game in decades, it was so strong and influential, uncovering some things from the story while letting others in darkness
Feel free to look it up, but I won't link it here, being an obvious spoiler
At the end, if I'd need to rephrase all these things in a sentence of two, it would be pretty hard, as there's so much great things to say about the game, while I haven't found any negatives
The game perfectly mixes the elements of platformer and stealth games supported by a great variety of tools and moves to enhance the gameplay, while staying similarly outstanding level design, storytelling and art style
Huge bonus point for alternate non-lethal ways, and letting the player experience and discover parts of the levels and the story, the forced focus from cutscenes could have destroy the player's pace, and spoil the feeling of true discovery or enlightenment
One of the best and most rewarding games I've been playing - I honestly recommend it to anyone who likes platform based and stealth(y) games

												I had no idea what I was getting into with this game
From what I'd heard you just sit at a border checkpoint and decide if people are allowed to enter the country or not
And that's exactly what I got, but Papers, Please is so much more than that
It's not just a job simulation, it's a story of moral choices and corrupt government
It's not just about a border guard, it's about a man who struggles to provide for his family, who must work for the smallest of wages to make some of the toughest choices
You sit in your little checkpoint booth
A man comes up and hands you his passport
You skim over the information and stamp a big green "APPROVED" for him
He thanks you and starts to walk away, but before he does he says, "my wife is right behind me, please be nice to her
" Sure enough, up steps a nice young woman
There's her passport
You look down and see an expiration date of last month
"This document is expired" you say
She stares at you, eyes wide and pleading: "Please, if I go back to my country they will kill me
Please let me in
" What do you do? Do you risk losing your paycheck and therefore leave yourself unable to buy medicine for your sick son? Or do you abandon all morality and turn the woman away?Papers, Please is not an easy game, nor is it free of consequences
Not only does it become insanely difficult to reivew piles of papers and make sure every little details is accrate and correct, but every choice you make determines who you are and the path you take
Will you work tirelessly for the glory of Arstotzka, or will you join the Order and be a part of the uprising against the tyrannical, corrupt government?			
Posted: 10 June
												In theory papers please should not be a fun game
 It is literally a simulation of performing a monotonous, tedious and thankless job
 But the game is definitely a good game
So what makes the game fun?I have concluded that the game survives almost completely upon atmosphere
  There is a tragic realism to horrible job you have in this third world nation
 You live in so much poverty with the risk of illness or starvation being a very real threat
 It gives you many moral dilemmas and will test your principles in ways games do not normally expect you to
 You are paid so little that you find yourself accepting bribes to let terrorists, smugglers, etc
into Arstotzka
 And you will accept the bribes, because often it is the difference between eating and not
 Yet at the same time the game is humorous
  The customers make it so and some have very humorous personalities
 You will get to know your favorite customers and favorite scenes
 The world is so overblown with propaganda, corruption, etc
that the grim world becomes humorous (to those not in it)
 Finally, the world reacts to the player
 You’d be amazed how big of an impact deciding who to let into the nation can have on the nation
 You let an assassin into the nation a high ranking official may die and the government will respond with harder boarder policies
 It is generally simple things, but these really complete the atmosphere
The game play itself is a point and click adventure
Were you will face a number of customers which you must either let in or find the error in their paperwork
 It is all done on a timer forcing you to be quick
 It almost becomes stressful
The graphics look like they belong on an Atari and yet somehow seem appropriate
 You are matching blurry faces to other blurry faces
In conclusion I recommend this game
It is fun and addictive
Glory to Arstotzka

												Papers, Please has no right to be as fun as it is
Papers, Please has no right to be as poignant as it is
Papers, Please has no right to be possibly the best PC game of 2013 I've played
Papers, Please is all of these things
The gameplay of Papers, Please is more or less a tedium simulator
It's Paperwork: The Game
And yet, you know that you need to process as many of these poor people as you can so that your family won't starve
You know that the old lady who you just denied will probably never see her son again; you know the young man you just let through has less than glorious ambitions in your city
Will you support the rebels? Will you toe the party line? Will you let the young lady through, even though her passport is clearly fake, because her fiance was just before her and bribed you to do so? The choice in this game is staggering, and the simplicity of the game itself allows for complete assimilation of your mind into the mind of your character
You feel bad when your child gets sick, but you know that food is sometimes more important than heat
Papers, Please is a work of video game brilliance - a work of art
I give it seven out of seven stars

 East Grestin, 1982Here comes that weird guy again
The one in the red sweater and with the crooked smile always plastered on his face
It's the third time already, this month
I look at him through the glass as he waves at me in an oddly familiar way that makes me feel a little bit awkward
«Old friend, hello! I am back again! This time everything set!»
His voice is loud and cheerful, and I just can't help but wonder what the heck is wrong with him
There's nothing to be so happy about in this rotten place, you old geezer
«Papers, please» I simply say, ignoring his greetings
He grins while handing me his brand new passport
I chuckle
Definitely better than the last one, at least this one is not pre-approved
«So this time you're from Obristan, I see, Mr


Jorji Costava? Is this even your real name?»
His grin grows even wider and he starts laughing again
«You a funny guy
I didn't like Cobrastan that much anymore
Obristan sure is a better country»
He speaks with a tick foreign accent that makes me wonder where he is really from
«Cobrastan isn't even a real country, in the first place» I point out matter-of-factly
«Where's your entry ticket?»
His smile fades a little
«Arstotzka so great, we don't need an entry ticket!»
«This is the same thing you said last time about passports
I'm sorry, an entry ticket is required»
I hand his passport back
«Wow, you run very strict border here»
He puts his paper back in the pocket of his trousers, shrugging
«That is good
Do job right
I look for entry thing and come back»
Before leaving the booth, he stares intensely at me
«You a good guy, but I have business in Arstotzka
I see you soon»
He waves me goodbye and then disappears in the crowd, with that big careless smile on his face
                                                                                           *I keep staring at the ceiling of my bedroom
In the end, it seems I can't really sleep at all tonight
I can hear my wife coughing weakly beside me
The doctor said it's just a cold, but she's getting worse day after day
I'm slightly worried
Our son is sleeping in the next room, the only one lit by the sun in the morning
He is turning 7 next week
I'd really want to buy him a special present for his birthday
We are currently living in a small apartment provided by the Ministry of Admission, here in East Grestin
The rooms are small and the heather doesn't work half the time
On top of that, our neighbours are awfully nosy
Living here is not that great, but there's really nothing I can do about it
                                                                                           *A week has passed since Jorji Costava last showed up
Maybe he is having a hard time finding a fake entry permit
Maybe he just gave up
Quite unlikely
The siren's ringing, another day of work is starting
A tall figure silently enters the booth
He's wearing a green hood and his face is hidden behind a grey mask
I'm about to call the security, but he gently slides a paper note under the window and stares at me
«There's no much time, be quick please»
His voice sounds young- he's probably younger than me- and unusually relaxed
My hands are shaking and I don't even know why
There's an odd symbol drawn on top of the card, a star-shaped one
I slowly open the note and start reading
I can feel the masked guy's staring gaze on me
  ARSTOTZKA IS GREAT COUNTRY POISONED BY CORRUPT LEADERSWAR HAS MADE GOV'T GREEDY AND PARANOID - YOU HAVE SEEN FOR YOURSELFHELP US FREE ARSTOTZKA FROM ITS SHACKLES+ THE ORDER OF THE EZIC STAR  I'm in a cold sweat
I look up at the masked guy, I'm at a loss for words
«Our agents are ready», he helds out his hand, eyeing the card
«Starting tomorrow
Let them pass»
In Papers, Please you play as an immigration inspector working for the Ministry of Admission of Arstotzka in East Grestin
Your job is to check on people trying to enter Arstotzka and decide who can pass through the border and who has to be denied or even arrested
Most of the time, your decisions will lead to a different ending (not always a good one!)
Choose wisely, the destiny of Arstotzka, your family and many other people is in your hands
Pros: -Well written dystopian settings-20 different endings-Lovely retro graphics-Jorji Costava-Great plot and sub-plots-Shooting terrorists from your inspection booth since 1982-Did I already mention Jorji Costava? Cons:-Maybe old school graphics are not everyone's cup of tea (I personally love it though)-Stamping visas and check out papers will probably sound boring to someone-There's no "Escape to Obristan with your newfound best friend Jorji" endingPapers, Please is hands-down one of my favorite games
Be sure to give it a try, you definitely won't regret it

"Ideas are more powerful than guns
We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas?" - Joseph StalinCongratulations! You've won the lottery and earned the "right" to become a nameless, faceless little bureaucrat who is responsible from the border station of a fictional socialist country in 1980s, alongside countless entrants and their tons of paperwork
Glory to Arstotzka!Before describing any kind of gameplay, I'd like to warn you: Papers, Please is a highly political satire that parodies Stalin's Russia, or any oppressive totalitarian regime in human history
The humor of the game is comedy noir: cold, immediate and careless with an appropriate dose of existentialism, presenting some genuine examples of your good old-fashioned political dystopia
If you like your sarcasm served cold, and patient enough to go through a simulation of routine banality to observe a comment on the dynamics of government, keep reading
The game manages to set the mood for it perfectly
Papers, Please doesn't even closely resemble any game that I've played so far
It is a basic simulation that lets you try and decide whomever is eligible to enter the country, and whomever is not
And guess what? The rules change daily, always getting more and more complicated until the point you cannot possibly "not" hate the government
Endless political conflicts between the government, the neighboring countries and terrorist groups that are ever present don't make things easier or even safer
You live, work and try to earn enough to feed your family, but life is impossible for the honest as always
So things start to get interesting both financially and politically for our bureaucrat as the scenario progresses
The game has 20 or so ending, which presents huge replayability and contains some hidden achievements to hunt for
As a plus, the game takes each save file for each day separately, so it is real easy to load a specific day and replay for the achievement or ending needed
As the last call: I really liked the game, and probably gonna try to achievement hunt for a while
I advise the game for the curious, the bitter and the know-it-all
The graphic lovers won't find anything satisfactory though

												Papers, Please is one unique snowflake in the massive ammount of Indie Games that is turning up lately on Steam
If you get to pick one Indie game to play, make it this one
While playing it you will not only be confronted with moral dilemmas and unexpected inspections, you might also be encouraged to think about oppressive regimes and what they mean for the people that have to live in them
Bonus points to you if you start pondering about what a state should do for its citizens and what not
And even if you are unable to grasp the deeper facettes of this game, you will have still a great time stamping "Denied" or "Approved" into Visa markings
The game gets more and more complex the longer you play it
Discovering all the endings and unlocking Achievements also add to the fun
I also enjoyed the music in this game, its suprisingly nice
You should plan your next holiday in Arstotzka, make sure you get your Papers in time
Glory to Arstotzka!

General Thoughts / ReviewEvery once in a while an indie game comes along that, to me, is not a clear like or dislike
 I started playing Papers, Please and go to day eight before quitting the first time
 I thought to myself, "Who the hell wants to play a game based on stamping visas?  I can't wait to get done working for the day at my REAL job!"Two days later I found myself thinking about the game
 I wanted to know what happened to the people I approved or denied
 Was it better to deny them entry, or to be a tyrant and detain them?  I mean, who doesn't know that their visa information is incorrect
 LIAR!  YOU ARE A CRIMINAL!It is just a game though, why do I care?  I did not, really
 I played again, anyway
The game kept my enthusiasm up as the difficulty ramped up, money was tight, and I seemed to be responsible for the lives of so many more pixel people than I anticiapted
 I enjoyed it up until the very end
 Good job, author
Pros Amazingly enough, makes stamping visas intriguing if you are the type of player that can get immersed in pixels
The save system is AWESOME
 Almost like a source code repository, if you start playing at an existing day, you create a branch at that day and continue playing in a parallel universe
Many different endings depending on choices made throughout the game
 Reminiscent of Chrono Trigger, you do not have to get to the last day to trigger some endings
Even though simple and interactions are quick, you can feel sympathy or opposed to certain characters
Cons Replayability was low for me
 The game has very varied endings, but I found that after I meta-gamed the Steam Achievements out, I was not inclined to go back through and try to get the endings for which there are no achievements for
Certain things feel pointless in the game - although that might have been the developers intent
Can be frustrating and wig out your OCD
RecommendationI would recommend Papers, Please if you are type of gamer who does not need flashy graphics or rapid game play to be entertained
 If you are a fan of indie game development, Papers, Please is an enjoyable title that may grow on you as it has grown on me

												The first Portal had genius, original gameplay mechanics, great story, great level progression, great voice acting, great characters, great engine and such a nice british humour it originated a ton of memes
If you didn't play, finish and love Portal 1, you are a bad person
This sequel brings all those qualities to a new level: _the story is deep_, lots of wow moments, graphics is beautiful, much more levels, environments and elements to solve the puzzles, the co-op multiplayer is so fun it's epic
In my heart and in my mind I have no doubt: _this is the best game ever made_
If you didn't play, finish and love Portal 2, you understand nothing about videogames

Here goes nothing, and I hope you rate this up
If you already know a thing or two or hate reading, visit my Pros and Cons section as it helped many customers decide if this game is right for them
-------------------------------IntroYou know how when you are on vacation and say, "I am so glad it isn't winter right now
"? Yeah, that sums up the power this game has on you
When you play the game, it is so


crisp (Vacation-like) and when you have to leave, it is like that miserable winter I was talking about
-------------------------------Summary:This game, as you should know from some other reviews and through the fact that it is one of the best selling games of all time, leaves an effect on the player
It is a beautiful story-line
You play as a female test subject through the campaign
She (I won't spoil her name) is forced through many tests GLaDOS (a powerful robot who took over Aperture) has prepared for her
You learn a lot about this character as you portal around puzzles of rooms, and a lot is learned about yourself
The programed-to-be "idiot" (whom you will find out through the game) is something to look out for as you think he is helping you escape
It is a clever twist
You will learn that the industry you are escaping from used to be a shower curtain/part factory
Yeah, It will all make sense when you play
-------------------------------Multi-PlayerThen there is the multi-player mode with Atlas and P-body who are trying to free the humans or whatever
That itself (with a partner) is totaly worth a lot of Friday nights
Now that they are implementing items/loadouts into the game (or hats/taunts/clothes/flags to those who are uncertain of the term), the game will be more interesting
Now, I may not have many hours, but I assure you that I have beaten multi-player in about 4 hours, and the single player in 3
I mean, the rest of my hours come from exploring more/community maps
And that is the amazing thing about this game


no matter how many times you have beaten it, it is still fun
Also playing multi-player with a different friend every time makes you find a lot out about their creativity/teamwork/leadership/meatal abilities
-------------------------------Other important thingsThe many achievements with variety are also something to look on about
There are many things you will NEVER notice no matter how many times you play unless you YouTube some of it
The deeper you dig into the storyline, the more interesting you find the game
There were many rumors that we are still uncertain of, which makes this excellent
To dumb it down:-------------------------------Pros+Amazing graphics for a non-stop beautiful gameplay
+Wonderful audio and music for a great experience
+Well-designed maps and challenges
+Unlimited maps (user-created)
+Fantastic story-line
+Many users own this game
(Lol I remember the commercials)
+Holiday sales make buying this game super affordable
+Gender neutral
++Helps with cognitive brain activity
-------------------------------Cons-Limited story-line (I wish there was more to it, but there is always Portal 1)
-Some levels take seconds while others take many minutes
(Not really progressive difficulty wise in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing here to me
)-Limited campaign exploration
(Some repetitive looking levels here and there
) -Restricted to the short story line
(However, there are some mods which are amazing, but if you want more, you have to manually download them instead of them being included with the game
)-------------------------------My opinionated reviewI would say the cons are so minor that I shouldn't even have mentioned them because it may not make you buy the game
DO NOT let that happen
Get this game
I recommend buying during a sale to get Portal 1 and 2 for a cheap price together for the full experience (because they raised the price of this game recently)
This is a classic game and will go down in history as one of the best - revolutionizing the way we think/game
It was such an amazing thought that I hope you guys consider for yourselves
-------------------------------RatingOut of 100, there is nothing wrong with this game
You may not like it if you aren't creative, don't have friends to play it with, or can't appreciate an amazing "Portal transportation" concept
But listen, you will fall in love with this game and stack hours to it
There is no community to worry about other than wonderfully made maps from users like you
Definately get this game if you don't have it - that being said, my review shouldn't even matter
I would give this a 97/100 after all of that
I hope you read everything before looking at my rating
-------------------------------FinallyThanks so much for reading, so I hope you share the love and rate this review up, as it took some thought to make
If you are still wondering whether you should get the game or not


well it always will be a must-have, and YES! Get it!~thedubmark(I write reviews now :))

												this is one of my impulse buying on summer sale and i love it! it was dirt cheap considering how well polished this game is
this game makes me somewhat feels stupid and smart at the same time
PS:if you can't solve one of the puzzle, here is the to-do list :1
check your surrounding carefully2
find the exit first, and try to back-trace the route
3
always think physics with portal, more importantly, momentum
this is the most used physics in this game

												I have never seen so many interesting "scare mechanics" in one game before
The whole game plays like you are walking through a haunted house, and it is GREAT
Every time you walk into a new room, you never know what to expect
Bear in mind however, this game is VERY dark, and I'm not talking about brightness settings
Some themes in this game can be very disturbing
A very short but very good horror game with a dark and interesting storyline
Highly Recommended

												I picked up Layers of Fear after I noticed it had come out of early access
I refuse to buy games in early access anymore, so I just add them to my wish lish and wait for them to be "finished"
I am posting this review after I played and beat the game
Layers of fear is kind of an interactive story, puzzle, survival horror kind of game
You play as an artist returning home to work on his opus magnum
At what first appears to be a basic jaunt around his home, quickly turns into a psychological horror, the house appears to be (possibly) haunted as the layouts change, you are confronted by visions of your dead wife and other various paranormal-esc situations
Along the way, you'll collect notes and other memorabilia within the house that offers quick glimpses into the painter's past life, his family and even the state of his mental health
The game isn't as "scary" as other games of this nature may be and in fact, you are put in several situations in which you can avoid confrontation entirely if so desired
As far as I am aware, there isn't really a way to die in the traditional sense, which is nice, because the game is set up in a way that you won't have to restart entire chapters of a mistake you may have made
The writing for the story is farily good, I'd say much better then games such as Penumbra
It's a fairly unqiue and engaging story that made me want to continue playing just to find out a little bit more
The puzzles are (generally) not too hard and there was very few moments I was actually stuck
Unfortunately the game doesn't help you in any real sense, besides some hints scattered about the game and as a result some of the more obscure puzzles can leave players scratching their head
While I did enjoy the time I spent with the game, there are issues with it that I feel inclined to inform people of
For starters, when you first start playing the game, it's fun and fascinating to explore the artist's big, beautiful house
The problem is that very early in the game, the exploration aspect of the game is all but removed, Instead the game becomes somewhat of an "on-rails" adventure game, instead of walking freely through the house, instead you'll be traversing hallways and single rooms
9 out of 10 times, as you enter one room, the door will close and lock behind you, denying any sort of back tracking in the game
This can become an issue, because the game feels as if it were meant to be explored and it was just a concept that was throw to the side
On occasion you may be given the opportunity to travel off the beaten path, but it is almost always just for a moment and it usually results in a dead end or locked door
The missing exploration concept bothers me, because I have always loved horror books, games and movies that involved big, old, beautiful mansions
Another problem that I had with the game is it never really changes scenery too much
A large majority of the game just looks the same
Expect to see a lot of dark, dingy rooms, broken walls and floors and broken furniture
Also expect to see the same art, furniture and random junk over and over and over again
This becomes an even bigger issue when the game starts to begin recycling rooms
Finally, the last problem I had with the game was the story
Remember earlier when I said they had a good story? They do, the problem stems from the fact that there's a lot of information presented for players to process and it's never really tied together or explained in any real sort of meaningful way
While I enjoyed the game while I played it, after I beat it, I felt very dissatisfied because I really didn't learn all that much and the game doesn't really make a good attempt at helping you understand
I have questions, no one appears to have answers and frankly, I am no really into the entire "fan theory community" in which the developers of a game simply don't inform or release information to players, instead they just wait to see if someone gets it "right"
For me, it just seems like a really lazy form of writing and I tend to get high aggravated with it
Don't get me wrong, I love reading long books, I like guessing at the story, or the plots or even coming up with theories as I enjoy whatever book/movie/game I am playing
But I expect the writers to eventually tie down and explain what is going on in a clear, concise and satisfying way
If you like games of this nature, if you have enjoyed games like 'A Machine for Pigs' and 'Penumbra', you'll enjoy this game a lot
If you like psychological horror, you'll appreciate this game
I can without hesitation recommend this game to horror fans, even given the rough spots of the game

												This is a game that genuinely tried to scare me by throwing a bunch of garlic in my general direction
THE BAD Here's how the plot of this kind of games is structured
1
You launch the title
2
You know that everything that happens around you is a visual metaphor for one of the following (because it always is): you being dead you dying right now you being an, ahem, bad person your family/children/loved one being dead your family/children/loved one dying right now your family/children/loved one being, ahem, bad people you having killed someone you having killed yourself you planning to kill yourself you being in denial about a traumatizing memory trying to resurface3
You then play the game, eliminating the wrong options and thus arriving at which inevitable MINDBLOWING AND UNEXPECTED twist this particular one features
(In case you're curious, in LoF's case it's a combination of  3, 4, 6, and 9
)What I'm trying to say is, the plot of Layers of Fear is so horribly cliche and delivered in such a stilted, overwritten, and unnatural way that it actively hurts the game
The story of a Super Tortured Artist living with a Super Tragic-slash-Insane Wife (who is also a person of art, a musician) in a Super Posh Mansion is one that would fit on fanfiction
net, not in a game with a price tag
The worst part is, the writer of the game that is supposedly about art seems to know very little about it, which is why all plot points, letters, and discussions of art remain incompetently vague, afraid to go into specifics
We keep reading how the main character's art became bad, but—how? Why? Did his linework become weak? The use of colors, blurry and muted? The composition, skewed? Did he become repetitive and second-hand? What was the context of his creations?For a game supposedly about art, Layers of Fear has surprisingly little to say on the subject, if anything at all
THE GOODFortunately, the rest of the game is good—great even
Keep in mind that this is a walking simulator with mild optional puzzles (either skippable or impossible to fail)
However, among walking simulators, this is definitely the most visually impressive and robust I've played
It tried very hard to reinvent something as simple as walking—often successfully
For the most part you will follow a linear path along a corridor of rooms
Each room is a carefully-crafted separate experience that does its best to be surprising while still using an extremely limited number of mechanics
Sometimes you need to find an item in a drawer
Or walk past a painting
Or, say, look up
Or turn around twice, with the room changing behind your back
Or maybe just move along unobstructed
And then something surreal happens
It also thows original challenges at you, like instructing the player not to look back and then playing an intriguing/scary sound behind them
It's not too complex, but it's hard not to respect the thought that went into turning Layers of Fear into something more engaging and interactive than a common walking simulator
THE PRETTYThe horrors are of the common screamer variety—you won't find subtlety or taste here
However, there was a particular type of screamer that I really liked, and that was huge paintings sometimes appearing behind your back
They do nothing, they don't even move—but unnatural size and proximity definitely make them uncanny in a not-so-overused way
And yes, the paintings are beautiful, as are the rest of the designs
All in all, I would recommend Layers of Fear to fellow lovers of the genre—especially those who are ready to look past the cliches and enjoy this beautiful and oftentimes inventive game for what it is

Early Access Review
								This is a great horror game:1
It's not build up on jump scares, there are some jump scares, but not to the point where it gets annoying
2
The graphics is very very decent3
The controls are okish, but could be awkward sometimes4
The music and sound effect


OMG!5
The way the atmosphere and sense of horror builds up gets scarier and scarier as you play
Man, this is some true horror6
You can actually get killed7
The story is good and very rewarding as you reveal it

Early Access Review
								Being a huge fan of horror games, I absolutely had to pick up Layers of Fear
As described it as a “psychedelic horror” game, as you play a painter who is feverishly attempting to complete a true masterpiece, while going mad in the process
“Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter
” ~ Oscar Wilde The game mechanics are incredibly refreshing, as there was no specific villain you were trying to escape from, for the most part, which meant that the 'environment' was what you needed to fear, including several jump scares along your way
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=519450951Atmospherically, Layers of Fear is astounding from the moment you enter the house you will be exploring
Rain is falling heavily outside, with occasional bursts of thunder crackling behind you
The entire game is influenced by art and décor from previous centuries, particularly the architecture and design of the 19th century, and the visuals are very well tied together with this theme
What also worth mentioning is the incredibly alluring and chilling soundtrack during the gameplay, that gives you the emotions the situation pulls you in
https://www
youtube
com/watch?v=7sB_6mk-XTwI’d recommend the game to anyone who enjoys horror games as a genre, particularly if you don’t mind games where you can’t defend yourself and it’s all about you, the antagonist, and the spooky atmosphere
Despite the game 'still' being in Early Access, what IS available to play is deeply engaging, if in need of a little polish here and there
The game relies heavily on its ability to set you on edge, so if you’re the type with nerves of steel you likely won’t get too much out of it
To horror fans, however? I wholeheartedly recommend Layers of Fear to you!9/10

Early Access Review
								This is a keeper
I don't usually play scary game's unless they're top-notch in terms of overall quality and production, and this game is one of them
A high quality horror/thriller game that I really hate myself for playing and continually playing
So far an hour in and screw me, screw this game, but love the quality in the controls, gameplay, features and voice acting
https://www
youtube
com/watch?v=MpweuoNAgdQThe graphics are really great and beautiful alongside the atmosphere being really tense and immersive
The level of quality in this game and the attention to detail can be put just below P
T
if not alongside it
The voice acting is just lovely and the dialogue that it has in relation to what you see in the game alongside to what you interact with that's story specific is really awesome to read
And speaking of story, from what I understand so far it's pitting crazy with crazy and I love it
If you're wondering about jump-scares, there are in the game but within the realm of confusion and mystery the game has so I appreciate it more so than the usual crap in other scary games
Still playing it and will continue to hate myself as I continue to play it
I whole-heartily recommend this game because of the combination of the high quality production in every aspect, the low price point and the amount of crazy in it in terms of features and story
Update: So I finished it, the "early access version" in about 2 hours, but damn was it fun
Yes, a horror game that I had "fun" in, and even though I mentioned that I hate myself for/while playing it, I wanted more
The game is just a joy and I don't mind if the price goes up if they add more and more crazy and content to it
To re-confirm what I said, I love the game because it's high quality and has a lot of crazy trips in it, and it's definitely worth the purchase

Early Access Review
THIS GAME IS TERRIFYING!To be completely honest, I was nearly scared into a coma by this game
Layers of Fear offers a truly immersive horror experience
The story takes you on a tour through the mind of a madman
As you progress, you find clues that give you details about life of the character before he went crazy
I actually had chills during certain areas of the game
The environment is constantly changing around you, and you never know what is waiting for you at the next turn
I would definitely suggest picking this game up while it is in EA (Early Access)
I was left hanging because the game is unfinished
The cool thing about being a part of this game while it is in EA is that the game is constantly changing
You can help the developers iron out the kinks and help make this game better
Plus, you get the game much cheaper than people who will purchase the full game when it is released
I cannot wait to see where the developers take this story! Even though it is unfinished, I consider this game a horror masterpiece!+Story+Jumpscares+Immersive environment+Visuals+Creepiness+Early access offers a chance to help the developers make the game better+Early access means you get the game at a cheaper price-Cleaning urine from my chair-Feelings of dread-Nightmares-Uncontrollable cryingIf you have any questions about the game, post a comment here and I will answer it!One of the jumpscares you could encounterhttps://www

												My five-year-old daughter likes to scare me occasionally, sneaking into my room while I’m busy brushing my teeth and screaming as loud as her distressingly-powerful lungs will let her
It’s jarring and unpleasant but I laugh it off because she’s just trying to be funny, and more importantly she doesn’t do it that often
If she screamed in my face every morning and afternoon and evening it would quickly reach tiresome and cruise straight on to aggravating
My five-year-old daughter understands this, but for some reason the people behind Layers of Fear do not, despite crafting an otherwise beautiful and fascinating game to house their cheap jumpscares
The game opens with very little explanation, you alone in a palatial Victorian mansion stuffed full of art supplies
It soon becomes clear that you are a painter, a husband, and a father, and these aspects of your life do not coexist peacefully
You are compelled to complete your greatest work, but there are demons pulling at you every step of the way and the further you get in the closer to home they hit
As you battle through the twisted mansion to achieve your goal, the true nature of your painter avatar is made shockingly clear
In gameplay terms, this is a walking simulator
You wander the halls of your mansion, free to open drawers and cabinets in search of collectibles or rare discoveries like keys, ever onward towards your goal
Every chapter starts in your studio and takes you through a seemingly random assortment of nightmarish halls and chambers
There are points where your path will branch in subtle ways but it always ends in the same place, a dramatic setpiece that reveals key events in your character’s past and supplies him with one of the necessary pieces of his masterpiece
I don’t use the term “walking simulator” derisively, in fact I rather enjoy these guided tours of nightmare mindscapes
Layers of Fear is near the top of the pile in aesthetic, at least, with an impressive amount of detail on every wall fixture, desk drawer, and pile of rubble
The many halls of the manor are distinct enough to be memorable, and setpieces often use huge numbers of small objects like checkers or books to give locations a tactile, lived-in feel
It’s a wonderfully dreary place topped off with some incredible effects like melting furniture and paint flows that make you feel right at home in a twisted projection of reality
There’s plenty to marvel at as you explore the vast mansion, but you’ll be scouting around under a permanent air of dread
This is a horror game after all, and all those magical details are designed to make you feel as fraught and threatened as possible
Flickering lights, broken doors, scrabbling in the walls, melting paintings, and darker things still will accost you as you slip further into the madhouse
The atmosphere reaches a number of feverishly oppressive peaks, always capped off with a shock like hurtling books or slamming doors or screaming ghosts
And honestly, that’s where the game loses me
It doesn’t just lose me, it actively drives me away in a huff because as much as I love the atmosphere, I DESPISE the jumpscares
I’m a jumpy person and I don’t care much for big shocks like screamers, but I’ll tolerate ones in games like SOMA and Oxenfree because they’re infrequent and earned
Layers of Fear, in stark contrast, ends almost every single one of their building spooks with a loud noise and jarring visual
There’s hardly any break between them, as scares usually come only three or four rooms apart
What’s worse is that they’re often telegraphed, too… anytime a door locks behind you or the next one doesn’t open immediately, you’re in Scarytown for the duration
Combined with the ultimately linear nature of the game, this sucks a ton of the fun out of an otherwise promising horror game and turns it into a cheap carnival ride
Walk 10 steps, watch a screamer
Walk another 20, get books thrown at you
Turn the corner, a window bangs
It becomes utterly perfunctory, yet keeps trying harder and harder to shock you by getting louder and more audacious
By the end Layers of Fear feels like a game that was designed to be moody and atmospheric, and then was harangued endlessly for not being scary enough until it was completely over-tuned
The cheap jumpscares are so much more annoying because they’re not even necessary, yet they persist and fight ever harder to shock you
That should tell you everything you need to know to decide on this one yourself, but if you’re in the mood for spoilers I’m going to talk about the story a bit
I don’t normally dabble in spoilers but by the end I was so fed up with the main character that I simply couldn’t manage my ire anymore
Your dude is a tortured artist who is obsessed with his work, obsessed with professional validation, and obsessed enough to neglect his family to literal death
Ostensibly this is a story about redemption but you’ll soon find he’s so irredeemable that you’ll almost wish his demons would just kill him
I actually did that in the later chapters where his dead wife is wandering around, I would run him right into her cold, fatal embrace because after everything I had seen and heard from him he deserved nothing more
Seriously, to complete his masterwork he’s searching for pieces of his family, tanned skin and blood vials and an actual eyeball, to paint with
The man turned his wife and daughter into art supplies and we’re supposed to believe his soul can be saved? Really?Ultimately, Layers of Fear is a horror game with an incredibly promising base and a painfully inept structure built upon it
The technology and artistry on display is undeniable, the game looks amazing and has a talent for surprising and impressing
But instead of using that talent to build a compelling story and atmosphere, the game settles for cheap, mindless scares and a story that simply doesn’t work
I won’t deny that I enjoyed admiring the squalor of the mansion and rifling through dressers for clues, but the knowledge that another dumb room with a dumb screaming scare was coming up always filled me with the wrong kind of dread
When I finished the game I felt such relief, not at the conclusion of a compelling story or at the accomplishment of a goal, but at the fact that I would never have to play this wretched thing again

Early Access Review
								I'm going to start this right off the bat by saying this is by far one of the best horror games I've ever played
I cannot get enough of it
It's a bit slow paced at first, but it builds you up for all that's to come - and does an amazing job at that thus far
The graphics are phenomenal, the game is absolutely stunning
It does need a bit of optimizing, but that's understandable at early access
The voice acting is amazing, the attention to detail, the music and sounds, everything is just superb
It all came together so nicely and the developers can only make it better from here on out
Now I, and most people, have come accross a bug in which a room just goes pitch black - causing you to go back to the menu and then back to the game
A bit of a drawback, but can be fixed nonetheless
This game outshines most games and I just cannot recommend it enough
If you're an avid horror fan looking to add something new to your library, this is it
10/10 buy this game naow
EDIT: My goodness, this game just gets better and better with every update
Layers of Fear is incredibly unpredictable and because everything just comes together so nicely, you're constantly on alert; I have yet to come across a game that does that so smoothly and efficiently as this one
You're in for one hell of a ride if you get this game

												So Meta, Even This Acronym
OneShot is cute, imaginative and, at times, simply mind-blowing—and blowing the jaded mind of a modern gamer is not an easy task
The meta nature of the game is highlighted by its name: you only have one shot at it, and then the save file becomes corrupted
There won't be a second journey
Only


how is it fair? Whatever you do, you will have to face a dilemma in the end, and choosing either of the cruel options is reductive and simply wrong
Can you


rebel against the whole thing, perhaps?These, however, are the thoughts you'll deal with by the end, but even before it the game is littered with charming meta-humor
The main character needs to sleep, for example, and when she does, the game closes
Some puzzles require thinking very much out of the box and using unexpected approaches
All the while the touching and lovely story of a hero stranded in a strange land and carrying a lightbulb to light up the local sun continues to unfold
The game is at its most poignant during the moments when the hero interacts with you, the player, whom she considers to be a god
You get to chat, encourage her, and fight your own enemy—often outside the game
The execution of OneShot leaves something to be desired: while very sweet in terms of visuals, it's often clunky and makes you do a lot of unnecessary walking back and forth solving various puzzles; coupled with imperfect location layouts, it gets frustrating sometimes
However, I'd say the game itself is charming and unique enough for it to be easily forgivable
			
Posted: 11 June
												I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam
I've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot
I don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context
(I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party
Be warned!)Transistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life
They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you
They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously
However, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason
In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters
When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the "eyes" of the protagonist
OneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story
Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all
It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close
It was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game
It's really hard to put into words


but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees
:DAnyways, random game comparison tangent over
It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended
Extremely solid 10/10
If you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc
, this is basically a must-buy

Posted: 31 March
NOTE: This spoiler-free review is accurate as of the newest update (Solstice)
Due to the content and ending added through this update, I highly recommend this game, and if you have finished the game before this, I implore you to replay it to experience the true ending
I was introduced to this game by Markiplier's playthrough
I only heard 10 seconds of what he said before I closed his playthrough and decided to get this game myself, feeling that this game is worth going in blind, and would be one with a lasting impression
It's True
This is the most emotionally-invested game I've had the pleasure to experience
Even after the end, it haunts me till today


and my emotions are so messed up just thinking about my experience that it's difficult to even review it
Even so


I'll try
Oneshot is A story-driven puzzle-adventure game
You play as a cat-like persona named Niko in a Mission to restore a world's lost sun, a large lightbulb
You only have one chance to save the world
It seems very straightforward



Except you're not playing as Niko
You are considered a separate entity



yourself
By opening the game, you unwillingly become "god", in charge of a world that operates, exists and disappears at the click of your mouse
Niko, meanwhile, is just dragged in as the "protagonist", waking up in a different, crumbling world


a child trying to get back home, to the waiting arms of mommy
You are essentially Niko's guiding voice, in a world both of you have no understanding of, and are in charge of leading Niko to bring light back to the lands


and at the same time, bringing Niko back home
Of course, its not that simple
The game is sentient, aware of how it's a program running on your computer, and will attempt throughout your journey to keep you from returning the sun
But in the end, it is unable to control your final decision


and yet, it still gives a last stand by denying you a perfect ending
It's in control of the story and is hiding things, and without you thinking outside of the box to beat the game's coded "story"


Niko, the world, and the game itself


will never find peace
The writing and story in and of itself is one of this game's strong points, as the amount of fourth-wall breaking and events that reveal the true nature of the world is extremely compelling, especially since its all addressed to who the ingame people think is "god"


you
The biggest draw to this game, however, is simply How personal it makes the relationship between you and Niko
Leading Niko feels like leading a younger sibling, in which Niko doesn't really understand what's going on, but will deal with events in their own childlike, innocent way
During your advanture, Niko also comments on Every action you take and even questions you about our world all in your own name


which further got me attached to Niko
Standard game mechanics are also used to strengthen this bond, as when Niko is tired, you have to find a bed to let Niko rest in; this is the only way to save and close the game "naturally", and also initiates dream sequences along with more dialogue between you and Niko
If you decide to close the window instead, Niko will be afraid and in a state of shock when you open the game again, as you brought darkness to the World Niko is in
This happens often, to the point where you'll likely be afraid to hurt Niko by closing the game
Yet, despite your cluelessness and inability to explain how you can access things out-of-game


Niko trusts you
It's a sort of child-like trust towards an adult that's so innocent that you can't help but love Niko back
When the game denied me the Opportunity to respond to Niko, who was frantically calling my name


I Realised that I could do nothing but stare at the screen
That feeling is horrid, accompanying a person almost all the time


and then being denied the chance to say "I am here for you"
Eventually, I wasn't playing for the sake of the world


I was playing for Niko
For Niko's happiness, and to hear Niko speak to me again
Niko felt real
I wasn't ready to let my little cat-like child go, even though that's what I was fighting for this entire time
And that made the full game's ending all the more painful
You wouldn't expect a person's happiness


to hurt you so much
OneShot is initially a story of trust and moral decisions, but its true lesson is of attachment


before Letting go
The initial ending will make you think of your consequences
The true ending will make you cry, reluctant to pass the credits
You only have one shot, as once you complete the story


you'll want it to stay completed
And yet


I Don't want it to end
I'll never forget you, Niko

												Do you like a game with a story line? Like to solve puzzles that makes you think twice? Like games that make you feel soemthing? Then this is a game that you've been missing out on since December 6, 2016! As you might have noticed with all the comments, "trying to explain the game would spoil the game"
 All I can say is that OneShot is an experience that you won't forget anytime soon
Just a small note though, "Prepare yourself for a great OST, along with some pancakes
We love pancakes!!!!"

"The world knows you exists"I cannot describe just how amazing this game is


OneShot is a game where this game breaks the 4th wall and knows about your existance
You are guiding a character named Niko
Niko wakes up in another world that is "decaying"
This world is dying because its sun went out and your mission is to save the world


However


your choices will affect the gameplay
This game breaks the 4th wall by knowing that YOU exist
It has puzzles that you have to find out using your computer, and not the game itself
This game, is by far, the most amazing game I have played


I never know that I can grow attacthed to a cute character as Niko
The soundtrack is really good, the storyline is amazing, and the characters are well placed
This



is the first game that legit


made me cry


I would totally recommend this game to people, because its simply really good
Edit: I just completed

												WHEW! A much rougher game toward the last few chapters than I expected
But I was glad I did this with someone as I could see it becoming tedious playing solo story mode

												Unlike all the "Buckle yo pants" Reviews that are funny but useless to a guy who dont know this gameThis review will be different and aim for the game itself hopefully you'll read First i wanted to say i considered myself so lucky because i was able to join the beta test, honestly i wouldnt have been able to wait the games full release
This is a 4 Player online platformer that has a great mechanism in controls and really addictive and easy to pick up on
The game has 2 Player Co-op Adventure mode, Or 4 In Arena mode
Adventure mode can either be normal or INSANE ( insane mode, is one death mode basically)The game can be pretty brutal in some stages with insane mode
Arena mode Targets 2v2 team and has a lot of great endless fun modesCapture the Fla


Horse 

its called capture the horse which is same as CTF but a horse that looks like a piece of walking candy, and even more funOr Basketball which is my personal favorite and its something you wont play just once : )And a lot more Modes from soul catcher ( Kill and get their souls) To "Grab the gold"  9 Different fun modes
The mechanism of the game makes it possible to do a great teamwork in adventure mode
You can pick up your friend and throw him or he just simply jumps on your head to reach a high place and then lifts you up to join him, or use a weapon to blast your friend to a certain places, and just be creative with what you wanna do :)
A huge selection of weapons and faces, ( You can make your own face and put it in game folder for everyone to see)the game is basically Get the (Certain number) of Gems in each level and reach the end in the best time ( And the hidden yarn ball ) Gems buys you Faces, Yarn balls buys Weapons
WITH! the ability to Trade them in-game or in steam trading system, or even sell them on steam market
Which is a good feature because you cant buy a certain thing you just buy and the outcome is random
Each weapon is different and has a different use and great ways to make combos with
You can either play good to finish, play dirty team killing, or see who can reach the end first
Some levels however relies on teamwork cant afford to be selfish there
With this ADORABLE looking graphics and soundtracks fun can never end, They made it even more fun by making Level Editor to make your own levels/playlists of levels, arenas or whatever the hell you want to make
Steam workshop was definitely a great feature for the steam version
THIS Game has the FUNNIEST STORY I have ever seen in a video game, Every Cut scene you will be a FOOL to skip it because its just 


too 

funny and perfect with that amazing narrator
its sad that they asked that no one posts a review or livestream or a video while on beta, but everyone did anyway 



and so i tried to make this review as resourceful as possible, so people would actually get a clue of what this game is if they never heard of it before or was wondering about it
This game is worth every penny, watch some youtube commentary videos on its gameplay and decide for yourself :)A Few updates
they keep adding some special faces you can get by finishing every once and a while so its cooland for summer sales people are wondering if the game is worth playing just for singleplayer yes , i have maybe 20 hours stored only singleplayer playing this wonderful game alone is also fun and the levels changes when you play singleplayer to be set to solo mode ( Makes it possible to do everything solo ) and in multiplayer they are set for double so you need someone else to help you finish the level or you can also use the weapons to do it alone if you're good enough with them
So yeah its pretty much fun singleplayer grinding for faces and achievements is always fun : )hopefully you'll make the right choice and buy this and make sure you have friends to play with its more fun that way

												You know that point when you are mentally exhausted or slaphappy or a teenager?  That's usually when you want shut your brain off and play something amusing and stupid
 If you can find a buddy in a similar state, play this game together
  The trick to enjoying this game is to not take it seriously
 Learn to enjoy killing and being killed
 If you can pull that off, you will laugh until you cry
 Play for about an hour or so and then quit
 Come back another day when you both are out of it again
 Then just repeat this cycle
If you don't enjoy poop jokes, stay away
 If blowing youself up again and again makes you smile, this is the game for you

												Once upon a time, in the land of Colorado,I was very bored, in fact I was just staring at my own shadow
That was until, my friend named DT,Said he had found the perfect game for me
"It's called BattleBlock Theater" he said as if he was the creatorAnd I replied, "Eh, I'll look at it later
"Soon later came, and I said with a sigh,"Let's get this over with so I can finish my pie
"After watching the two trailers, my mind was blown!Buying this game, I shall not postpone
I clicked the "Buy Game" button on the internet,and I zoomed through the PayPal process which is actually quite intricate
I waited for nothing and immediately installed,An adventure that assured I would soon be enthralled
Soon enough it was done, and I double-clicked on its name,Waiting impatiently for my brand new game
And just like that I was playing away!Staring deeply into my monitor's display
I was jumping, punching, and boating through any kind of weather,And best of all, me and DT were doing it together
So, I urge you to get out your money,And pay for this game whose humor is funny
I promise you, if you buy this you will not be disappointAs this game is amazing to no defined point

The gameplay is exhilarating as you run through these obstacle courses set up by devious cats
The thing that makes this game the most fun is playing on hard mode where the most will come out of you as a player and even though it can be annoying or tough, it's what makes the BattleBlock Theater experience better
Also, I would like to add, even though I have little time played on steam, I have owned this game on the Xbox 360 for years, and I could still come back to it and play it again

Early Access Review
								Sigmar's Garden is a fun cross between solitaire and chinese checkers, with a couple dorks providing color commentary every so completions
The rules are puzzling at first, but the elements of strategy and forward thinking gradually develop through play
It's relaxing to map out your pathing strategy around the quicksilver and metal marbles, or to find ways to cut through bunched up lanes
Overall, a great complement with absentminded YouTube watching
The attached game, Opus Magnum, is a pretty neat programming puzzler too
In all seriousness, the main thing to mention is that Opus Magnum is the most beginner-friendly Zachtronics game yet
For instance, you get a luxurious unlimited scrolling canvas for you to make incredibly inefficient contraptions
 This makes the game so much less frustrating to work through, as you won't be constrained by space was you were in SHENZHEN I/O, more so in TIS-100, and infuriatingly so in SpaceChem
For all the discussion about the game being easier, the real difficulty lies in defeating your friends' histograms, as Zach has somehow realized that friends do a much better job at motivating better solutions than a difficulty wall
 And really, there's something a lot more intuitive about clockwork arms passing around marbles, as opposed to trying to grok how XBUS works or avoiding message collisions between TIS-100 nodes
 As such, this is probably the most friendly game to start with for a newbie Zach-like player
That the solutions often move like beautiful clockwork and can be easily exported as animated gifs also helps with the feeling of recreational accomplishment
Update 10-26-2017: (Finished the main story campaign, and ordered the iron-on patch)Wow golly this game could use a way to speed up to later breakpoints, or to skip state to a program location
And divine architect help you if you need to insert more steps near the beginning of a long work-in-progress instruction chain, where you need to delay the rest of the concurrent multi-page instruction sequences in all the other components
Still, it's very doable to beat this game, but the last few levels involve some very intricate bonding patterns, and can take a ton of instructions to complete
In the end, I was satisfied with how the plot wraps up, though the level design was a grind for me at the end
I'm not sure if the depth of the systems and puzzle design lives up to those of SHENZHEN I/O, but the relative simplicity may be a strong reason to recommend this game as a first Zachtronics game
For more theoretical players, I'm not sure if the systems here are Turing Complete, and I can't imagine how you would implement NAND (perhaps the needed components can be introduced in a later update?)
That said, one could argue that it is elegance, not systems design, that shines in high skill play here
Along those lines, I'm looking forward to seeing some really elegant animated solutions from others
Just seeing Notch's solutions on Twitter just proves how messy my problem solving style was
In the end, this setting and story is easily my favorite out of all the other Zachtronics games, being strongly evocative as a mashup of The Diamond Age and The Baroque Cycle
This is an incredible remake of The Codex Of Alchemical Engineering, and suggesting the latter flash game as a demo doesn't do justice to the massive improvements since the last decade
If Opus Magnum was this much of an improvement, I'm kind of curious what a remake of Bureau of Steam Engineering could be like
Come on Zach, you know you've thought about rebooting the universe of Ironclad Tactics
;)

Early Access Review
								Did you enjoy SpaceChem even a little? Buy this, as it's an upgrade in most departments
Did you skip previous Zachtronics games because they were too real-world oriented and resembled actual programming of components and hardware more than you would like? Buy this, as it's the most gamey puzzle game of the bunch
Do you have any interest in open-ended puzzles with no fixed solution that allow you to work with all their components in any way you please, presented with brilliant production values, clarity and elegance? Buy this!I was a SpaceChem religious fanatic but this might be my new favorite Zachtronics game! <3

Early Access Review
								Be warned, there are some big issues with UI/Scaling/Resolution on this game that Zachtronics have confirmed on a recent Gamasutra podcast/stream (broadcast Nov 1st, 3pm Eastern Time - go to 15:34 of the video on youtube, search 'gamasutra opus magnum') that they have NO intention of fixing at any point during this game
It is an issue they don't hope to tackle until their NEXT game!This has never been an issue on any other Zachtronics game 



but it is a big issue now
It goes like this, it appears they designed this aesthetically simple 2d puzzle game with 1080 resolution in mind, and nothing else
I am running 1366x768 


and at this resolution, the game elements are HUGE 


the UI panels are HUGE 


and the gaming area you can see at any one time is TINY, likewise for the instruction lane that you need to input instructions is SHORT
You can only see 24 instructions at any one time, and this issue is compounded by the fact your view of the instruction pane won't scroll when you are trying to select a larger sequence of instructions, or when you're trying to paste a sequence you just selected (fingers crossed super firmly that at the very least that can be solved, otherwise consider this game a total write off if you want to play anything but the simplest of levels)
this is a big problem for more than just one reason 



1st of all, the later puzzles of the game you will be asked to produce products that take up the entire visible gaming area (if you're on less than 1080) 



just imagine all the scrolling around you're going to have to do to manufacture the product, you will never have an over-view of the entire solution you are working on, and furthermore you will never completely see your solution in action unless you render it to gif and view it in a gif viewer 



what the actual feck
the 2nd reason this is a significant problem, as if that really wasn't bad enough, is that the game is the most 'accessible' (i
e easiest, and I include optimisations in that summation) zachtronics game yet 



so to get a decent challenge going, you're going to be relying on those levels with larger products 


and if you're using a monitor that is less than 1080 the biggest challenge won't be in solving the puzzles, it will be in enduring the tedium of mousing around the gaming area of a 2d puzzler that absolutely should not be having this scaling problem
people with 4k monitors seem to be having an inverse issue to this
But between people on the lower end of the resolution spectrum and the higher end of the resolution spectrum, this has been a frequently made feature request - to FIX this issue
So, while I have not seen the issue addressed directly on Opus Magnum's Steam discussion area (where it should be addressed, I would have thought), I instead learn that Zachtronics have absolutely NO intention of fixing it via a Gamasutra podcast 


wtf ? 



Not only that, there is a brazen streak of arrogance in their manner of addressing the problem on that podcast 



basically anyone suffering with this problem has a 'terrible, dank, old laptop that's 5 years old' 



This laptop isn't 5 years old, it is a midrange toshiba 2
5+ years ago
Their attitude to 4k users isn't so toxic, but it is no more considerate
Basically if you're monitor isn't 1080, either larger or smaller, you're the problem 



Well, I put it to you that if a developer working on an aesthetically simple 2d puzzler is having these issues, to such degree that he can't solve it without 'rewriting the game' 


it is the visual programmer, or the game designer, who is the problem 


I am honestly not sure where the buck stops on that one, but I am really shocked that this is an issue
and an issue that won't be resolved
to add insult to injury, not only have they not addressed this on steam, but they haven't even made a note of it in the minimum tech requirements to play the game on the store page 



how can they in good conscious speak about this problem as brazenly and dismissively as they do on gaming podcasts, acknowledging that it won't be fixed, but still refuse to alert potential customers of this problem ? that seems to be bordering on willfull deceit, imo
this game is good in other ways 


but just past the midway point and the UI/scaling problem is already causing serious interface issues where enjoyment is taking a hit, and more time is being spent trying to compensate for the programmer's failings
this will only get worse as the products you are asked to produce get bigger, and the instruction sequences get longer
So if your monitor is not 1080 


beware
I can not reccommend this game for anyone playing at monitor resolutions other than that 



even if it would be at a 50% discount, I would say be prepared for a very awkward gaming experience if you're running a 'terrible computer' with a 'dank' 1366 x768 resolution monitor 


like, get real man, don't expect the developer to do something crazy like make his 2d puzzler scalable or develop it in such a way that it wouldn't need to be scaled

								Another great Zachtronics game!Great puzzles which gameplay is an evolution from "The Codex of Alchemical Engineering", a free Zachtronics flash game available on their website if you want to try it as a "demo" before buying
What I would like to remark is the stunning art and presentation, I feel they keep improving in this regard game after game
The story is compelling enough to keep you interested in solving puzzles besides their inherent challenge
As they keep proving, Zachtronics is one of the few developers that I can trust to deliver an excellent game on day 1

Early Access Review
SummaryI've played every game by Zachtronics except for TIS-100 and this is definitely my favorite one
Shenzhen was great but I prefer a more fantasy settings of Opus Magnum; and especially when compared to SpaceChem I love how it offers you much more freedom - you choose the location of both input and output which may make it easier, but lets you get a lot more creative
Graphics are much improved and feel fresh compared to CAD-like Shenzhen
The story lets you feel like a powerful alchemist and while perhaps a bit cliched is really fun to explore and I would love to see expansion packs that explore the world a bit more
Overall, I can't recommend this game enough
If you like puzzles then this is definitely one of the best games on the market, if not THE best one
I really love it that what I do really means something - you're not just solving one puzzle after another to solve some mystery, but you get a lot of opportunities to produce something that will be of importance - like fuel for an airship, waterproof sealants for ships, or a device that will let the surplus lead be turned into gold
Solving every puzzle, however, lets you advance and explore the story so your price is twofold, at least for me
The price is low for the amount of fun, and the game, though Early Access, is not buggy and seems very polished
It's truly a staple of quality
What works1
The setting
I like it much more than the previous ones, and would really love to see it explored a bit more
2
The graphics - they are definitely a huge improvement over previous ones and are, simply put, gorgeous
The world is colorful, elements symbols are clear, and the way machinery works made me simply keep staring at the working machines for a long time - they are very elegant, yet simple, something that a person that loves engineering can truly appreciate
3
Steam Workshop - you can easily download and solve hundreds of different puzzles available online and easily make your own, which allows for an almost endless replayability
4
Sigmar's Garden - a rather simply minigame, but really addictive
5
And finally puzzles themselves - the difficulty progression curve is handled very smoothly, and you get a really well-planned tutorial that explains pretty much everything in a very simple way; the graphs that show how effective your design is compared to those of other players makes you feel really competitive, striving for the utmost perfection; and they're no longer too constrained due to the predefined inputs and outputs like in the previous games
Overall, solving them was much more fun than in any other puzzle game 
What doesn't work1
There are not that many metals available - just six, but that's a nitpick
2
I would love it if there were some storage containers for what you make - like vials and flasks, but then again, there are no liquid ingredients

Early Access Review
								Summary : A lot easier than other Zachtronics titles, but a worthwhile purchase for Zachtronics fans and beginners with an addictive solitaire game
Compared to SpaceChem and TIS-100, Opus Magnum has an infinitely scrolling board on which to build and plan your mechanisms
This allows for a lot more leniancy in design of your solutions which, while making the game "easier" to create a functional solution, also creates a lot of potenital for optimization and faster running solutions
There are a few hidden features which should be more advertized (control drag to copy instructions or components, A/D to rotate selections while dragging) but it's pretty mninor
The story mode also feels a lot shorter than the other titles (It took this reviewer ~8 hours to complete, with fairly average solutions for someone not completely dedicated in finding optimal solutions)
This isn't neccisairly a bad thing, with the promised additonal puzzles from community puzzles and the wealth of options in the Steam Workshop
The story is also quite charming, if a tad cliched
The artwork is wonderfully vibrant and colourful, and complements the story and gameplay well
The solitaire mode, a Mahjong-solitaire like puzzle, is also very fun (and maybe even a little more addicitive than the main game!), set up so that every game is winnable from the start, which ensures the only frustration you get from a failed attempt is your own fault! (It also doesn't tell you when you've failed, which is a lot more satisfying than a pop-up exclaiming that you've lost!)Overall a great game, if a little more forgiving than fans of Zachtronics' unique brand of puzzle might have come to expect, but for the price, (for this user) a definate buy!

								Opus Magnum is OK, but it lacks complexity compared to Zach's previous games
There is no state feedback element in this game (e
g
sensors) or means of varying the operations performed based on the state of the system
This makes for a more accessible experience, however for Zachlike veterans this open-loop limitation makes for a noticably simplified experienced
Perfectly good game, but manage your expectations - this is not SpaceChem's second coming

												Go ahead and try to find something to criticize about this game
Maybe graphics scalability? Can you even be offended at that? The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail
Don't quote me on that one
Most systems out there can run this game no problem


If they are Windows systems
Maybe the friend requirement? Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience
The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people
How many games are like that?Lack of voice chat feature? The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue
Lack of netcode? The design of the game makes this irrelevant
You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game
Frustration? You can pick up or close the game at any time
Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health
It's far less frustrating or "cheap" than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2
Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort
In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game
Brevity? This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place
Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2
9 * 10^11) variations
It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation
Cost? It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket
I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference
Keep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game
Even if you're never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example
After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment
Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15? Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation? If you said yes, it's time to buy

-Tell him I need help defusing a bomb
-Friend instantly says: "Lets go
"-We start solving through each module
-We got stuck on a maze
-Finished the maze
-10 seconds left until utter doom

10/10 But on a more serious note,  this game is a blast to play with a friend or two, and is quite an adrenaline rush

												Wonderfull fun little puzzle game, the game is half figuring out the puzzle and the other half is making the "Human" do what you want him to do
Other than that i really really loved the Polygen art this game contains, a 10/10 buy, PS

												Stunning
The online mode is incredibly fun
It's one of the funniest games i've ever played
There is only one problem: It ends
If there were a mechanism to avoid the ending of the game, it would be one of my top 3 favourite games
Just something like a LEVEL CREATOR attached to Steam Workshop
To sum up, a way to create objects and maps to publish at Workshop would be amazing for "Human: Fall Flat"

												(I'm 47, so you may have different results if you're younger) Nice game
Really fun, and not too hard to grasp the movement
There's a slight learning curve when climbing, but it's easy once you learn how
For some reason, tho, this game gives me motion sickness something fierce
So, only good in short bursts for me

												This game is truly amazing
At first, you spend a bit of time grasping the controls and marvelling at your ability to climb and move things
Then the puzzles become more complicated (but sometimes menial)
There isn't just one way to do things, either
I passed an entire part of a level because I broke a window, stacked some matresses and clambered through
You could also use a rope swing to cross a chasm instead of jumping your way across big rocks
Basically, the game has some replayability, if you wanna go back and do the level a different way
You can also do local co-op (NOTE: It's only with two gamepads, no keyboard
But you use the keyboard and mouse in singleplayer
) Co-op just makes it more ridiculous, but the puzzles stay the same
You could use your new buddy to try new ways of doing them, though
I'd say this game is worth whatever it's being sold at, because you can't put a pricetag on honest fun

												Human: Fall Flat is one those hidden gems that manages to take you by surprise and offer you a really well thought-out experience
The game itself is visually simple in style, but fantastic in its presentation
There is a genuine adventure to find here and it can only be achieved if you continue playing it
At first glance, it gives the impression for being a linear puzzle game
From the mechanics and controls to the environment - it does seem like just an ordinary game that relies on its experimental physics
Yet, there is a layer of wonder to it and shows us that a lot of love and care went into making it very fun for the player
Once you've progressed past the first couple of stages, get ready to discover huge areas to explore
You are free to approach each stage however you please
Many of them encourage creativity since it offers you more than one way of completing an obstacle
Not to mention that every one of them is challenging enough to feel rewarding at the end, because there is a clear logic to their design
While the motions of the character may seem confusing at first, you will eventually learn how to control them and be more accurate with their actions
The soundtrack is perfect, helping you relax as you try to figure out the puzzle in front of you, which fits in with the gentle nature of this game
And if you think the solo playthrough isn't pleasing, then you are in luck
With split-screen support you can invite a friend over and complete the game together, making the adventure a lot more hilarious
Go for it!I'm definitely going to recommend Human: Fall Flat

												Ok


the game


oh gosh, my tears, I can't hold it



Because THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
Here are the pros and cons (or not) for this game
The pros:+ Well-written and touching story about love, forgiveness and sacrifice
+ Beautifully hand-drawing, from characters to every detail of the environments
(Too much clear water :)) )
+ Ahhh, musics to my ears



It made me cry




+ Responsive control
Nice
+ The platforming section is really well-executed, tricky gameplay
+ As the upgrade version of the original game, with more contents, more balance, more secrets,


more grinding for the ability poinits
+ Now it has 4 difficulties, from Easy to One-life


I hate one-life mode :))
+ A huge map with lots of exploration
+ There are parts of the game when it requires you to escape from certain death
Well, It's time to ultilize your skills to get you through danger
+ This game reminded me of the game named "Cat Mario", the game which makes you suffer from falling, dying, danger at every corners
RAGE!! :))
+ The game now is more compatible than the original one
+ The game is best example of Unity Engine Games that can run smoothly on low-end pc
+ No FPS drops
+ First playthrough with 340 deaths for finding EVERY SINGLE SECRET in hard mode, how bad could it be? :))
I bet that i will die even more if the game were bigger
+ Can you make a speed run from beginning to the end without using ability points, no death, under 3 hours in one-life mode?  How long you guys can endure it? :))
A MUST-HAVE GAME for anyone who want solid (with some trolling and surprise moments :)) ) and challenging gameplay with pure story-telling
And I am still waiting for the sequel "Will of the Wisps"
Oh boy, I cried even more when i watched the sequel trailer




Amazing game to the end

												Every now and then there's a game that changes the way you look at all types of games in the same genre
Take Witcher 3 for example, good RPGs are now bad because we now know that is possible to do better, MUCH better
For many of you this game will fly under your radar, many of you might even ended up here by mistake
Whatever the reason i don't care just BUY this game
This is a masterpiece, this is the Witcher 3 of metroidvania 2D plataformers
The story is beyond good, is beautiful, it'll break your heart and make you smile, it wont bore you and it has enough to keep you engaged
The MUSIC? The music in this game has life, it tells a story in it self, without a word you can understand the world around you, it whispers in your ear, never yells, it tells you a secret for you to keep
The art style is stuff of dreams, the color palette is vybrant but also dull when it needs to be
The hand drawn vistas and landscapes are worth the games price, just so you can bathe in how good this games looks
The controls are just good, and they have to be, because this game is HARD, it rewards acuracy and quick reflexes, have you got those?I died 422 times on my first playthrough and let me tell you, i'd die 422 more just hoping this game would be biggerThis IS the 2D plataformer to beat, this is more than a game is an EXPERIENCE			
Posted: 12 June
												This is an action platformer in the Metroid style
As you explore areas you gain new abilities that allow access to previously unpassable ones
It plays as good as it looks - which, considering it looks phenomenally gorgeous, is no small feat




The controls are responsive, and the platforming gets nicely tricky (though not too frustrating)
It also has several really cool "escape" setpieces that are just right for being challenging, and making great use of your skills
You get the ability to slingshot yourself off of certain objects, which includes enemy projectiles, and these sequences make crazy use of that
Mixed up also with various jumping / gliding / wall jumping bits that make them very exciting to do
For a 2d platformer it really is quite thrilling when these setpieces kick off
It's an exceptional game mechanically, and hugely enjoyable - plus its also surprisingly hard on the highest difficulty, so represents a fairly big time to complete
There is a downside depending on your tastes - the story and music are pretty twee stuff, and the "voice acting" is just kiddyish gobbledygook
But other than that its a very engaging, artistically stunning game, and I highly recommend it
			
Posted: 22 June
If anyone ever told me a video game cannot be a piece of art, I would show them Ori and the Blind Forest (soon to be the Ori franchise)
Ori and the Blind Forest is one of few games that recieves very little negative attention (only notable negativity come from those complaining about the Definite Edition release)
There is very little wrong with the game itself in terms of gameplay, glitches, and music
The story itself is known for making even the toughest of men cry as well
Everything in the game itself seems to come together and forge a masterpiece
The main gameplay of Ori and the Blind Forest is the platforming
It features a unique respawn system I have not seen in any other game (though someone else may be able to name one), utilizing an ability to create a respawn point anywhere at the cost of energy
This energy can also be used for a blast charge that can break some walls
Respawning by itself needs strategy, deciding whether the energy could be used for a better cause or not
Platforming itself isn't frame perfect like many say, the game was very responsive with the jumping and was never frustrating at any time
This is one of few games where I had not one issue with the movement and controls
As for glitches in Ori and the Blind Forest, they are so few that you are highly unlikely to experience any in the entire thing
You aren't going to be coming across a Spore: Galactic Adventures experience here, where you have to be purposefully avoiding things in order to prevent glitches
The lack of game-breaking glitches is actually rather impressive
Yes, there are some, though it appeared to me you have to be purposefully trying to cause them to occur
The art and music in Ori and the Blind Forest is the most notable thing in the whole game
The music score by Gareth is incredible
Once you hear the songs, with how emotional and fitting they are for the game, you could easily see as to why they recieved such praise
The art design is incredibly unique compared to similar games as well
It is a 2D game that looks and feels as gorgeous as a 3D game
The backgrounds and foregrounds are utilized to their greatest potential, being able to see the antagonist, Kuro, flying at you from a distance to Gumo hiding in the foreground behind tall grass
The two combined, art and music, end up creating a visual masterpiece that is incredibly pleasing to look at
Despite how simple Ori's sprite appears to be, it is at the same time very detailed with the animation and look
Everything in the game looks and moves like something that is alive
The final part of the game, the story, is known to make grown men cry
While it isn't the most unique story when you first start, with Naru perishing and Ori going on a quest for 3 elements, it ends up becoming apparent as to why it is unique later on
Gumo, Kuro, and even Naru end up making the story incredibly unique for many, many reasons
Each character has a lot of backstory, and it is incredible how it is told without words
Gumo, Naru, and Kuro are incredibly detailed and interesting to learn about despite how simplistic they appear to be
We learn all about Ori throught the whole game, similar to Kuro
Every character, even the dead ones, have so much thought and effort put into them that it shows what Moon Studios is capable of
Gameplay: 8/10 - It could do with better combat, but since the platforming was nailed incredibly well with the platforming being the main focus as well, the combat can easily be looked over
Soundtrack: 10/10 - This is the only soundtrack I can say I have never enjoyed more in my entire life
Every song fits the scenario and changes the mood drastically
Without the work Gareth did, Ori and the Blind Forest would not be so amazing
Art Design: 9/10 - The game looks and feels exactly like you are playing a painting
The characters move and look like they are alive as well
There is very little I could say bad about the art of Ori and the Blind Forest
Story: 8/10 - Every single character has a massive amount of thought put into them and has their entire story told without the need of text
Even the least interesting character, Sein, is still incredibly interesting to think of
Every character in the game has incredible amounts of story put into them and the game tells it without saying it directly
What happens to Kuro, you have to piece together
Why the ending is sad, you have to tell yourself as to why
The character's stories are incredible, and the game might have been even better if it was even more focused on them as opposed to the elements Ori and Sein were searching for
Bugs/Glitches: 9/10 - While there will always be bugs, I did not experience a single one during my entire time playing the game
I thought this was incredible, considering how buggy many games are today
The game still has some glitches as expected, but the lack of any glitches that occur during the playthrough of it is astonishing
They seemingly have to be activated purposefully
Overall: 9/10 - Ori and the Blind Forest is perhaps one of the greatest games I have ever had the chance to play
I highly urge anyone who hasn't play Ori and the Blind Forest to do so
With Will of the Wisps coming out soon, now would be the time to play the original masterpiece that began my new favorite franchise

												(Already played the original game? => skip the first few paragraphs)Ori and the Blind Forest is a very beautiful metroidvania platformer
It has won several awards for it's art and music
The entire world is handcrafted and every area has a unique feel to it
You play as Ori, a tiny being in a huge forest
Your task is to restore the elements and restore balance in the forest of Nibel
During your adventure, you will gain abilities and skills that give you access to previously unaccesible locations
The game has a unique save-system where you can place a checkpoint ("Soul Link") almost everywhere
Are you stuck? Create more savepoints
Forget to save and die? -- Too bad, you're going to have to do that all over again
Besides that, the game allows you to pick skills from a skill tree that give you more freedom in how you want to play
Want to explore, pick some of the exploration skills
Need more fire power, pick a damage increasing skill
This game is an extended and improved version of Ori and the Blind Forest and is a stand-alone experience
You do not need to play the original game first (the core game is the same)
Why buy this if you already own Ori and the Blind Forest?- New abilities that both change how you move around and change combat in a new way
- A large, optional, beautifully crafted and varied new area which tells Naru's backstory
You need to backtrack to find it
- No more closed-off areas; Spirit Wells can be used to warp across the map and you will have access to every location, even after you finish the main storyline
- Difficulty scaling
Was the original game too hard (or too easy)? Try the new 'Easy', 'Hard' and 'Single Life' modes, each with their own leaderboards
- Behind the scenes content and concept art!- 7 new achievements to get!Like the original; probably best played with a Xbox 360/One controller, although not impossible to play on kb/m

												Ori and the Blind Forest is one of the most visually stunning games out there right now
Not only that, the storyline touches the heart and makes you feel the want to keep on playing
Though the game may be tricky at some points and you may have to use your brains to figure it out, the game is a masterful piece of art

												This game was already good
Insanely good
Unbelievably good in fact
But now it's perfectLet me try to explain how the new areas look, if i even can
The new areas are definitive (heh) proof that video games are indeed art
This isn't even a game anymore
This is a painting
You are literally playing a painting
Seriously,  Moon Studios went to WORK on this game
If you walk over a leaf, the leaf moves
If you step on a single blade of grass, it waves along back
If you run across the ground, it glows in response
The environment, the atmosphere, it's all perfect
You could set steam to take a screenshot every 10 seconds
The soundtrack to this game is hands down the best soundtrack for any game i will ever play
Gareth Coker, you take a bow
Even if you don't play video games, or don't have a computer, or anything you owe it to youself to listen to the soundtrack at least
The Definitive edition expansion to the soundtrack is name your price
GO DOWNLOAD IT
Listen bud, you had better go download this game
Yes, you
Right now
You're missing what will likely be one of the best game's you'll ever play if you dont

												I just finished my fist playthrough of this game, and I think it's become my favorite ever
 I generally play action RPGs or just RPGs (souls series, witcher, elder scrolls, fallout etc
) and I've found some phenominal titles
 But I've felt that every game I played up until now has been lacking something, for example, The Witcher 3's story and quests are fantastic, but the combat is sometimes clunky
 The mechanics of the souls games are great, but you have to go out of your way and do research to figure out the story, which I've done, and still the stories haven't really grabbed me
 Ori and the Blind Forest is as close to a perfect game as I have ever played
 It has some really unique mechanics that all work beautifully, the story is bittersweet and wonderful, the music and artstyle are perfect for the game and its environments
 In summary, this game is a work of art
 I had one problem during the entirety of my 11 hour playthrough, which went through almost 100 percent of the map: I got stuck under a rock and had to quit out
 That's it, that's the only thing approaching a glitch or a mistake I found
 If this game is on sale, it's criminal not to buy it
 If it's not on sale, it's still criminal not to buy it
 This is the first game I've written a review for, because these developers deserve more attention for this masterpiece

?Multiply by 9000 feels, pour into a bowl of Princess MononokeAdd a dash of Spirited AwayMix until a tidal wave of feels makes you cry like a little girl And thats just the main menuNow I get teary every time I see an apple
The music in this game is phenomenal, think Trine just 10 times more beautiful with added vocals
Controls and physics feel perfect, fluid and interesting
You really do feel like a little cat spirit gliding through the forest, climbing walls and trees
Visually the game is beyond stunning, hands down the prettiest game I've ever seen
Storytelling is amazingly done through game mechanics and not just "passive" cutscenes
Next time someone tells you video games is not art, show them Ori
			
Posted: 10 March, 2015
Truly one of the most gorgeous games ever
DISCLAIMER:- I bought this game on a whim after seeing it in the Steam Store for the first time
I watched the promotional videos and was immediately interested in it
- I love this game, therefore this review is biased
I am not some professional games journalist who makes a living off of reviewing games and tries to provide an objective and totally unbiased point of view on the subject material
If you were expecting such a review from the average Steam user, then your standards might be a bit high
No offense, high standards aren't really a bad thing
My intention with this review is to convince others who might be interested in the game to take the leap and drop $20 on it
That's all
- At the time of this review, I only had about two hours of playtime invested
Overall the game isn't terribly complex, and the gameplay is what you'd expect from the average Metroidvania title (with more focus on platforming than combat)
It's polished, the art is beautiful, and the story is engaging while not getting in the way of playing the game
After two hours, I felt that I could wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who might show interest in it
REVIEW:If I had to briefly describe the game, I would say it's a very artistically-driven 2D platformer with common elements from both the Metroid and Castlevania series
But that merely scratches the surface
I won't go in to excruciating detail regarding the gameplay
It's a branching world with areas you can't access without certain abilities
You progress naturally until you unlock a new ability, then more options open up and you can progressively explore more freely
Naturally, the world is littered with hidden goodies like health and energy powerups (like energy tanks and missiles from Metroid)
Platforming does become rather challenging, and the fact that the movement is very responsive and feels polished makes platforming a blast despite the difficulty
However, a certain ability you are given right from the start can detract from the challenge by essentially removing the consequences of dying
Combat is pretty simplistic (you basically just spam the attack button and it auto-locks to the nearest target), but it is clearly not the focal point of the gameplay
The majority of the abilities you unlock cater towards more efficient and complex platforming maneuvers
There is a simple experience system which rewards you with skill points that allow you to unlock an assortment of abilities that are split off in to three different skill trees
These abilities are either unique passives, or augment the main abilities that you acquire through progression in the game
As far as visuals go, this game is in my humble opinion at the very apex of gorgeous
The art style is surreal and brimming with color and personality
I'm not exaggerating when I say you could take a screenshot anywhere in the game and it would make for a great picture
There are certain areas in the game where you just have to stop and marvel at how downright beautiful the art is
Not many games these days are capable of that (the last one that comes to mind is probably The Vanishing of Ethan Carter)
People might say that gameplay is all that matters, but this game is a prime example of why that's simply just not true anymore
I believe that in regards to modern games, visuals will always play an important role in making the game what it is
Games are a from of art now, not just pure entertainment
Anyone who plays this game and says otherwise is probably insane
The musical score is just as good as the visuals
There's heavy use of woodwind instruments and a touch of harmonic female vocals that really set the mood
There are overaching themes throughout the score that gives the whole soundtrack real cohesion
The best part is that the music doesn't overplay itself during cutscenes to create a sappy, melodramatic mood
During general gameplay, the music is calmer and more relaxed
In turn, it helps to keep the player feeling the same even during the tougher platforming areas
The story, while somewhat simple in nature, does a great job of presenting the game's gorgeous world and giving you a solid sense of pace
It's not a really big RPG story with tons of lore or anything, but you can still easily be enveloped by its provocative and charming nature
The game can even be surprisingly emotional and deep when you least expect it
Think of the art as a painting and the story as a frame
The frame may be simplistic, but it just goes great with the painting
Moon Studios have made a strong debut with this game, and I can't wait to see what else they have in store for us in the future
If you have the money to spare, I highly recommend you pick this up; or wait until the next big sales event and maybe you will find it for cheap
Either way, it's worth every penny

												Everyone should play this game
I've never written a review of a Steam game, so take the existence of this one as a testament to the impact it had on me
The gameplay is fantastic, sort of like Metroid, sort of like Donkey Kong, sort of like so many other classics
And yet Ori stands on its own
Ori is intuitive; it's inventive; it's surprisingly challenging (I died over 200 times in the 10 hours it took me to complete it
) But damn, is it fun
Everything is seamless
And I mean everything
From the minimalist interface, to the controls, to the microsecond load time between dying and respawning - the latter of which you, like me, will come to know well
And equally well the fact that you can save, more or less, wherever you want
Power ups and ability trees keep things fresh, and like a good piece of Zelda equipment, every addition to your platforming repertoire opens up a whole new mechanic to the gameplay
The story is as flawless as the game
(And the opening is as memorable as the ending
Have ready a bucket for your tears
)Few action platformers have a decent story to accompany it
Ori is different
No, the game doesn’t play itself; it isn’t one of those
Rather, like a player to respawn points (see: this game), gameplay and narrative are intimately connected; character actions are justified, and power ups serve the story and the player
The result is that each accomplishment you make is both rewarding and intensely satisfying
I testify to what others have said: the game looks beautiful, sounds beautiful, plays beautifully
Everything about it is stunning
But don't be fooled: it's beautiful *and* hard
If you aren't a skilled platformer now, play Ori and the Blind Forest
You will be
10/10			
Posted: 13 March, 2015
												This game


it's damn near perfect
The art direction and animation are really tight and well executed, the controls are something to be envied and are incredibly well done, the music is captivating and remains in my head well after I've put the controller down


I am completely and utterly head over heels for this game
I look forward to exploring more in this game
The sense of accomplishment you feel from gaining a new ability to reach a part of the map that was previously unavailable is particularly satisfying
I wish I had more time for this amazing experience
I can't recommend this game enough
Anyone considering this game, don't consider
Just buy
Install
Play
You won't be sorry

												TL;DR --> vmdflgnsdjgnvk lkdfj gvbjk 11/10---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------From time to time a game appears that gives a lesson to every developer and company about how to make games properly
Well, Ori is one of those games
Even though perfection will never exist in videogames IMO, I find it really hard to search for cons into this game
Just notice that I was very hyped about Hotline Miami 2 for almost a year and I honestly admit that this hype banished once I purchased Ori
Ori and the Blind Forest brings something new, something fresh, something NEEDED
I can't imagine the amount of work required to build a game like this but trust me people, devs can be hugely proud of it
Visuals are the closest to perfection I've ever seen in a videogame
Just see it for yourselves and get stunned about what a 2D platformer can give you
Seriously, you don't need to go to an art museum anymore
This game is well enough
From beginning to end it'll be impossible for you not to stare at every single detail, every singe hand-made background
The tag "Great Soundtrack" is not one of the most voted without a reason
Such a great visuals strongly need a great soundtrack too, and that's what you'll find
Tracks add so much feeling and emotion into this game that together with the visuals it becomes one of the greatest combinations of the WHOLE industry
Controls are tight and super fair
Mind this words: the game is challenging and every single death will be of your fault
This is the regular metroidvania where you get more movement skills as soon as you progress into the story
I found quite some similarities to the experience I got with Guacamelee (in terms of gameplay)
The story


OMG
Just when I thought I saw everything a 2D platformer could give (mostly soft and simple plots), this game appears
20 minutes were enough for me to start clapping in front of the screen
This game has one of the strongest prologues I've ever played
AND IT'S IN 2D
SO MANY LIMITATIONS, YET SUCH AN INCREDIBLE EXECUTION
The length is also good enough
Not too long, but not too short either
Map is extremely well planned, together with collectibles and secrets
Getting everything can perfectly give you 8-10h, which is more than the average platformer can offer
Finally, achievements are very well written too
This sounds stupid but it's sad to see some nice games where the achievements are completely senseless or wrongly directed
This game has every kind of achievement I like: storyline achievements, collectible achievements, movement achievements, and hardcore achievements
I think that the only con I can find to this game is that sometimes there are so many glowing things together that you can't really distinguish the friendly ones against the enemy bullets
But this mainly applies to one particular enemy and I'm partially colorblind so I can't say it's a con at all
Overall, just stop buying mediocre bundles nor triple A games
Do yourself a favor and pay 20€ for this game
We're in front of one of the best games of the year, and we're still on March
But seriously, this game is something I've never seen before (and I've played more games than I can count) and probably no one will dislike this game (aside from fake haters and people pretending to be funny)
Final Mark: 9
75/10 this is one of the best 2D platformers you'll play in a very long time

												So I was skeptical about this game but I kept hearing good things so I picked it up one steam sale and forgot about it
A year and a half later I see it in my unplayed favorties list and decide what the hey lets give it a shot
OMG from the intro I was hooked it really punches you right in the feels im a grown man and I had tears in my eyes during several parts of this game
The Visuals are amazing
The Game play is fun but can be old NES hudsons adventure island dont mess up once difficulty but remained fun and a challange
Those escape sequiences good lord I was on edge and of course yelled at the monitor a few times



ok more the a few times
The soundtrack well it was so good I bought it which is rare
If this is any indication I have never seriously NEVER reviewed a game before on steam and I felt compelled to write up on this one
Truely one of the best games I have played in years

												I very, very rarely review games, so I'm doing this out of sheer respect and thankfulness for the developer, Moon Studios
Ori is easily  one of the best games  I have bought on a whim (in 8 years of Steam), and had I had any idea of that


well, it wouldn't have been on a whim
The art is probably what stands out the most, but that's only because the controls are so well implemented, they never really took me out of this immersive - and touching - story
Not for a second, honestly
It was sufficiently challenging for me as a seasoned gamer, but I'm more than sure it shouldn't be frustrating for any casual gamer who doesn't possess a really, really short temper
In fact, I cannot think of another game that made me care so little about dying and having to repeat the same difficult scenes
To the opposite: I was so excited by them (in no small part thanks to the amazing soundtrack and artwork that surely accompanied), that I sometimes died on purpose at the end of a tough part to try to play it again more perfectly
I feel like this is a really big deal and I hope you believe me
I can honestly think of only one con: you cannot (as of yet at least) continue playing your save after you finish the game
I wish I had known this before, because I truly wanted to go back and finish it 100% - something I'm not at all used to - but I'm sure I'll play through it again
By the way, I makes me happy that the Ori has TEN different slots for you and your family/friends to start a game on
I don't understand why so many games lack that
In short, I HIGHLY recommend playing Ori, and I can see no contraindications to warn buyers of
Gameplay, art and soundtrack are truly remarkable, and the story is surprising and nothing short of beautiful
This is a game that stands out, and one to remember for a long, long time
Thank you and congratulations to the developers for making such a brilliant game, and selling it for such fair price
Things Ori reminded me of, while playing: Studio Ghibli, Rayman, Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons, Guacamelee, Disney, The Lion King


I'll finish by quoting another reviewer: "Oh how I wish there were more games like this one, especially when they come out of nowhere like this one did
" One of the best things I've played
 
Posted: 10 March, 2015
												I have been waiting for this game since E3 2014 and boy does it deliver
Absolutely breathtaking visuals, wonderful ambient soundtrack, and an emotional story that brought me to tears less than 5 minutes into the game
It's also a pretty challenging platformer with some light RPG elements, so there's plenty to like about it
Do yourself a favor and buy this game
You won't regret it

Early Access Review
								So, Besiege
This is a really unique game, and I'd really recommend it to a lot of people
If you're deciding whether or not to buy this game, just spend 5 minutes on reading this review
Who should buy this game People, who look forward to playing a very fun physics-based sandbox game Gamers, who are interested in some kind of technic and war contraptions The creative ones, people who can find a thousand solutions to one taskWhy should I buy Besiege? It's growing very quickly and is not abandoned, unlike a lot of Early Access games Very cheap as for the content that it gives you Enjoyable gameplay and graphics A ton of space for creativity The developers promised to add a multiplayer mode and a multiplayer level editor in late 2017!Below is a more detailed breakdown
GameplayGameplay is the main point of Besiege
Just to list a few things off, this game provides you with a nice campaign (even though there are not so many levels yet, but every level has a ton of replayability potential)
There are also a couple of sandbox maps
The player is equipped with infinite amounts of different varieties of building blocks and elements
There is literally everything, starting with a simple cube and going right to holders, pistons, different versions of cannons, bombs, wings and a lot of other stuff
The best thing is that anything you will build will work and people have already came up with some really crazy ideas
Ever wanted to create a huge flying carrier? Or a machine that swings a giant hammer around itself, smashing everything to pieces? You can basically do that
Also, slow-motion is epic
GraphicsI like the graphics
There is not much to say, but the visual style is pretty unique and is just enjoyable
Fire, water, explosions, the machines themselves look great and organic
SoundThere is some nice ambient music that I really enjoy listening to
The sounds produced by machines and structures are simply great
Sanbox-inessThis is not some kind of an official criteria, but I just wanted to mention how flexible Besiege really is
First off, in any level (including the campaign ones), you are able to disable the small building box that limits you and build anything
The sky is the limit (and your computers hardware, of course)
There are quite a few cheats on the options panel, that can give you something like zero gravity or infinite ammo (most of the weapons fire only once or just can be held on for around 10 seconds)
There are 3 large sandbox levels
And, as I've already mentioned, a level editor and a full multiplayer system are coming in 2017 (well, hopefully in 2017
The devs promised at least
)VerdictAs for a sandbox fan, it's pretty much a 10/10
I would rate is as the best "wait, did this just really work?" simulator

Early Access Review
								So I gotta be completely honest here


This game is freaking beautiful
The animation quality, texturing, modeling, and even the music are all fantastic!Even the menu for the levels is addictive in a way


I'm actually HOPING they get around to finishing this because the framework of it is really astonishing
My only complaint is the lack of a tutorial; it kind of sets you out in the middle of the first level with the VERY basic blocks and such and doesn't tell you about certain mechanics
For instance: You can add steering devices for wheels
STEERING DEVICES FOR WHEELS
I'VE LITERALLY NEVER SEEN ANY OTHER GAME DO THIS BEFORE
Truthfully, I feel this is going to be one of those great games once (or if


though I hope not if!) the devs finish it
Really I think I'm going to play more, because this game is something special! :)

Early Access Review
								I've only played the first 4 or 5 levels, but I would say the game is worth the $7 for early access already
My favorite part about Kerbal Space Program was unexpected and hilarious explosions, and my favorite part of playing with LEGO was thinking up weird death machines
Besiege has begun to combine those interests, and I'm excited to see where development takes it
Hopefully there will be many more blocks, weapons, etc to build with
Right now we only have the basics

Early Access Review
								For $7, this game contains more fun, challenge and longevity than most $50 games out there

Early Access Review
								This is the BEST game I've EVER played with my two boys, aged 7 and 9
A+++++ 11/10, best ever
Together we've learned about physics, gravity, centre of mass, flight, ballast, geometery, engineering, problem solving, and other great topics
As a bonus is it probably the first game my wife has shown any interest in too! It's also sparked more interest in the kids toward real-life building, and they've dusted off their lego and are often inspired to build in real life after playing
In the course of 'beating' the first island we built a number of tanks with progressively better steering and durabily, a couple flying machines including a kamakazee model, a crane, a couple cars, and a number of mostly useless but fun "prototypes
" Awsome
I've found many games like this have been too complicated or been burdened by a cumbersome UI
This game perfectly strikes the balance between simplicity and complexity
The game mechanics are deep enough to stay very interesting for a long time, and simple enough that we've never been frustrated
I really hope the devs stick to this winning formula they have here and just work on content, refinements, and more building pieces

For any potential Customer out there, look for Reviews that don't focus on the ending - which will be hard given the Majority of negative Reviews focus on it
It's controversial given the fact that it can be interpret in many ways and many people missed some clues/hints, making them think the wrong thing
I mentioned it before because I am legit annoyed at the fact that people review a game badly because they didnt like the ending
PRO- Most of the Characters are well written
- The game is always 2 steps ahead of you
- No seriously the amount of Plot-twists will change the way you think about cases
- Art + Music is p gud
NEUTRAL- It is not recommended to play the game as the first Danganronpa Game as it references the first one heavily, and the second one more lightly - However it wont stop your enjoyment of the game for around 90% of it
If you are looking for an order on how to approach the series, I'd recommend: DR1 -> DR2 -> DR3(Anime) -> DRV3
- The game can hook you pretty badly
What this means is that it's time consuming, and, if you dont have enough self-control, might start feeling like a chore to play
If you start investigating, you dont wanna end because you dont wanna leave on a cliffhanger - then you cant end on the trial itself, because you wanna know who done it
That's how you spend 4-5 hours in a session
- It reuses the Danganronpa formular
As expected
Some people find that annoying or boring while others don't mind it
This only affects you if this isnt your first rodeo
CONS- The price
The game is excellent, however 60 Bucks for it are kinda on the limit for me
The game has an average time of around 40~ Hours to complete + has content that you MIGHT wanna check-out after that
- The port isn't the greatest
The Team is patching the Issues slowly, however there are still some problems - like Fullscreen being problematic, sometimes inputs not being registered or slight FPS drops
Overall the Game is fantastic, and Id go so far as to rate it the best in the entire Series
It ironed out some kinks and issues of the last few and had new fantastic twists to go with it
			
Posted: 30 September
												You should play the two first games (Trigger Happy Havoc and Danganronpa 2) before playing this because this game contains major spoilers for the first two games
If you've enjoyed the first two games, then you should like this new installment for the most part
Gameplay is the same - people get murdered, you investigate crime scenes, and solve them in a class trial
Now as for the overall story, I won't mention any plot details, it's better you go into this game blind and judge for yourself
However in my opinion, although I enjoyed this game, the 1st Danganronpa (Trigger Happy Havoc) is still the best overall

If you're playing on Steam/PC and using a keyboard/mouse, make sure you launch the Configuration Tool to select the keyboard layout before launching the main game (you can't switch in-game)

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Tomb Raider Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Action; Adventure; Atmospheric; Third-Person; Gorgeous Graphics; Story Rich; Cinematic My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 12-18 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseursREVIEWTomb Raider (2013) is absolutely one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played
 The single player campaign mixes in a myriad of well-crafted elements to create what I personally would define as a 10/10 gaming experience
 There is also a multiplayer mode, which actually has the potential to be fun; unfortunately it has nearly no community, and many of those who do play: cheat (driving away potential new players)
 Nevertheless, the game is a total gem for its single player campaign alone
 I would recommend this to anyone who likes playing great single-player video games, regardless of their usual preference in genres
The graphics and animations are absolutely stunning, and the soundscape is enthralling and AAA quality
 This is the kind of game that makes it worth having an expensive/powerful GPU
 Drawing from the gorgeous graphics and animations, the game is a heavily cinematographic experience
 This takes the form of both longer, elaborate cutscenes; as well as short, little camera cuts that are integrated right into the gameplay as you explore
 This is all reinforced by an interesting narrative that is well told, with excellent voice acting to back it up
 It is the kind of game that definitely feels like an interactive movie
The gameplay mechanics and the gameplay itself are also a delicious blend of tasty ingredients
 There are many interesting and atmospheric areas to explore throughout the game, with various collectibles to find (many of which elaborate on background stories)
 There are “puzzles” to solve (a la classic Tomb Raider games) and there are secrets to discover
 Besides exploring, the combat/action sequences are also quite fun
 Headshots, finishers, explosive barrels—all the necessities are there
 And as the game progresses you get new weapons and weapon upgrades as well, which spice up the combat scenarios
 There are also high adrenaline “escape” scenes, where you are trying to escape a collapsing bridge, or burning building
 Mixed into all of this, and again drawing on the cinematographic experience, there is also just the right amount of quick-time-events littered throughout the game
The game runs on a checkpoint system
 I will always prefer manual saving/quick saving in PC games, but the checkpoint system in this is pretty flawless
 Collectibles save instantly, so if you die you don’t have to recollect them
 Also the checkpoints are extremely common; so if you are learning how to win a fight, you basically always restart right at the part you messed up
 There is also a decent fast-travel network, so you can return to gather collectibles at any time (including after beating the campaign)
Lastly, as I alluded to, there is also a multiplayer mode separate from the campaign
 I have played it a bit and can honestly say it has the potential to be pretty fun
 Unfortunately barely anyone plays it
 Although, like most games, it isn’t completely dead; you will be able to find some people on here-and-there
 There is a high percentage of cheaters, though— which is also common for low-population multiplayer games
 In short, I wouldn’t count on the multiplayer mode adding any value to your overall experience of this game
So, in summary,  Tomb Raider (2013) is an outstanding game, with several great features contributing to the experience
 It is an amazing blend of adventure and action with a strong narrative and beautiful aesthetics— a truly “top-shelf” game
 I recommend it to all gamers who enjoy great single-player experiences
  Even if this style of game isn’t usually in your wheelhouse, this is the kind of game that creates new fans of the genre

Posted: 18 June
 Overview This is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game
For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline
This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do
And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet
Story The storyline is definitely a strong point of this game
Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it
You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past
However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game)
The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story
There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom
Level Design/Graphics Speaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game
One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience
Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive
And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good
The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable
I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience
Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point
Gameplay Last, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience)
The gameplay was fluid and interseting
You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series
This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either
Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die)
However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this
Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm
Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend)
There are so many ways to make your way through the levels
And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder
The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic
However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments
Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death)
But other than that I don't really have any complaints
Conclusion Should you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience
			
Posted: 8 March, 2014
												As my first entry into the Tomb Raider franchise, I found this reboot a very well-crafted game
 It was very apparent to me that a lot of time and care was put into the making of this excellent game
The visual effects were stunning
 Cutscenes were directed very well and provided for a lot of great screen shot moments
 Character animations were realistic and played smoothly
The writing was done pretty well for an Origin story
 The plot mostly takes a survivor story spin with a small amount of adventure thrown in
 The story is linear, though once you get access to fast travel, you can go back and get collectibles you may have missed earlier
 The game took me roughly 20 hours to complete on normal difficulty settings
 Voice acting was also very good
 I really enjoyed seeing Lara starting out so green and inexperienced and then grow into the seasoned adventurer that she eventually becomes
 The game is very tough on the young Lara and I could not help but feel bad for the character as she gets battered and bruised repeatedly throughout the story
Combat takes a cover shooter approach
 The game does provide some small amount of stealth activities to take out enemies silently but few options exist to stealth past encounters entirely
 There is a simple progression system that allows Lara to aquire skills that improves combat and survival
 There is also a system that allows upgrading and improvements to weapons that Lara acquires throughout the game
 I found the progression to be extremely well-paced throughout the linear plotline, much like the Arkham series of games
 In addition to the shooting, there were a good number of well-placed QTE activities that mixed things up a little
 The maps were very nicely done and made full use of all dimensions to provide for lots of platforming opportunities
 The game auto-saved progress regularly and had very generous checkpointing so that you will not have to redo much at all after a death
I only had a couple of issues with the game overall


There were a few crashes as I played through the game
 Especially if I ALT-TAB frequently
 My system is well above the recommended specs but found that reducing settings helped a little with the sudden crashes
 The game still ran very smooth when my settings were maxed-out but those occasional crashes did get annoying
For an action/adventure type game, it was a bit heavy on the action and a little light on the adventure
 Not quite what I would normally expect from a genre that is heavily inspired by Indiana Jones
 Shooters are one of my favorite types of games but this one felt a little too "shooty" for my tastes
 I was not keeping a tally, but Lara would have claimed a body count the size of a small army by the time I completed the game
 Boss encounters were also very lacking
 I would have liked to have seen more tombs that had something to do other than simple physics-based puzzles to complete and ways to complete more sections of the game through stealthy non-lethal means
One other minor complaint are the death animations
 I already had a hard time seeing Lara put through some of the tortures of this adventure, but a few of the death animations were a little over-the-top
 Not sure if getting impaled through the face was really necessary after failing an action event
Overall I was very surprised and pleased by this game
 I am hoping that we will see further adventures for this rebooted series with the same attention to quality
			
Posted: 21 July, 2014
												While I've seen many people who disagree, I think this game is magnificent
 The story, the characters, the gameplay, it all goes together very well
 While I have not played any of the older Tomb Raider games for any extended period of time, I can tell that one difference is that in this, Lara seems more human insofar as she actually has emotions
 There are tons and tons of games where the character you play as just seems to lack emotions in many cases, most often combat situations
 They just go and kill the enemies like it's an everyday thing for everyone
 I've seen people say things along the lines of Lara being 'whiney', but I disagree
 She was just a regular person, and never went through anything outstandingly terrible at the beginning of this game
 What would you do if you were thrown into this situation?  You would probably freak out, and she did, making her character be realistic
 My one complaint is that sometimes it seems like half of her dialogue is some kind of grunt or scream
 Yes, again it is kind of realistic because you and I would likely be grunting and screaming as much as we are talking, but still
 Some of it seems much more high pitched and girly than necessary
I've seen people say that Lara takes too much punishment to be able to walk and run around
 Yes, this is true, but think of it this way
 She is in a survival situation, the adrenaline would help keep her going
 Besides, what fun would a game like this be if it were 100% realistic?  You get shot once and you're dead?  Boring and frustrating
 She got impaled through the abdomen at the beginning, you want her limping around slowly through the whole game?  Again, boring and frustrating
 Although it can be said that they could have skipped the injury entirely, it actually does contribute towards the game, showing that she initially does have at least an above average pain tolerance, still being able to climb around when necessary while still showing obvious signs of more than just a little bit of pain from the injury
Now, the story?  Well, it's hard to go into detail of why I like it so much, so I'll put it simply
 I've played through the whole game twice the first three days I had it, and now I'm going in for a 3rd time just because I love it so much
 Enough said?Also, graphics?  There's a graphics option just for the quality of Lara's hair
  I think that speaks for itself
 It also absolutely KILLS my framerate when I turn it on, too
 My PC is decently powered too, frames are really smooth otherwise

Each experiment is guided by Glados voice, the mainframe development center computer
Glados is one of the best virtual characters in recent years
That computer has more personality than many humans from other games
Throughout the game the player acquires a portal gun
This gun allows you to create portals, to enter and exit portals in order to go forward in the game, which requires solving logic puzzles to advance
You will  acquire a good sense of physics, position and movement
The game is a marvel of Valves creativity
Many would prefer to kill zombies in left 4 dead , but personally, I think games like Portal are those who write history
The game lasts a few hours and when it finishes,  with music and lyrics, it makes you want to stand and applaud
No other game in recent years has touched me so much when it ended
It is an ode to creativity
Its sequel , Portal 2, expands the concept of the game and makes it much longer, making it a standalone game
The Portal 2 was named Game of the Year in 2011 for various publications
The game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360 before being ported to MAC OSX
Now that I've finished the review I want my cake ! 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ESPAÑOL----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Portal es un videojuego de lógica y estrategia en primera persona desarrollado por Valve en 2007 y lanzado en un paquete llamado Orange Box
El jugador despierta en una sala de cristal, el centro de desarrollo de Aperture Science, donde es sometido a una serie de experimentos hasta que …… no les voy a arruinar el juego



En cada experimento lo va guiando una voz, que es Glados, la computadora central del centro de desarrollo
Glados es uno de los mejores personajes virtuales de los últimos años
Esta computadora tiene más personalidad que muchos humanos de otros juegos
A lo largo del juego el jugador adquiere una pistola de portales
Esta pistola de portales le permite generar portales para entrar y salir por donde le es posible e ir avanzando en el juego, que requiere resolver acertijos lógicos para seguir adelante
Para ello hay que adquirir un buen sentido de la física, la posición y el movimiento
El juego es una maravilla de la creatividad de Valve
Quizas muchos prefieran matar zombies como en el left 4 dead, pero personalmente creo que juegos como el Portal son los que escriben la historia
Finalmente al terminar en unas pocas horas, con musica y letra, dan ganas de pararse y aplaudir
Ningun juego posterior a portal me emocionó tanto
Es una oda a la creatividad
Su secuela, el Portal 2 amplía el concepto del juego y lo hace mucho más largo, convirtiéndolo en un juego independiente
El Portal 2 fue nombrado Juego del Año en 2011 por diversas publicaciones
El juego se lanzó para PC bajo Windows, PS3 y XBOX 360 para luego ser portado a MAC OSX
Ahora que terminé el review quiero mi torta!

												for some reason the tf2 lady turned into a robot so you have to kill her			
Posted: 4 March, 2015
												I will be brief: I downloaded demo and played for 5 minutes
Then I removed it, went to the store and bought  Portal 1-2  bundle
That same f'n day - 16 of July, 2011
The consequences: 50+ hours, all challenges completed and the place earned in my digital heart for ever
The first Portal is for sure shorter, has less story and features than the sequel
Though it has something


the mistery, the charm, the feel of menace, elegant sci-fi scent and terrific GLaDOS who hasn't gone over the top yet
Valve, put your sorry Dota 2 down and please make games like this just like you don't care

It's both challenging enough puzzles to be interesting, and short enough to not be tedious

												Portal, rather than a game, can be considered a metaphor of life
We wake up every morning with a commanding voice that, like it or not, pushes us to face trials increasingly difficult to get a prize
A voice that we find strange and that we don't know if we could trust
A voice that can come from the outside but also from our own unconscious
We never know if the final prize is real but we are armed of portals
But what are the portals if not the ability to be able to see the world from different perspectives? The portal is the human ability to abstract being able to immerse himself in aspects of the world that had been hidden by the limitations of the senses
Ok, if you're already confused, I understand
Just buy the damn game

Welcome to Hopes Peak Academy where the Ultimate's hope falls into despair
Traped and forced to play a murdery game
Let's begin with the simple rules of explaination:Live forever in a peaceful life within the school
Inorder to get graduated students have to murder each other without being caught
Game is divided into 2 sections:Daily live:Story continues as usual and player got the opportunity to know their classmate better
Deadly live:Murder occours and player are forced to investigate inorder to survive
During Class Trial player has to represent evidences, argue a lot by finding contradictions
Also summarizing the case is the reward to close it once and for all ! ProShows a perpective from an ordinary boy
Can tell how the characters react towards despair
The dialouge offers player many positiv adjectives, interesting quotes and humors that can either be: Irony or sarcasm
Offers you to think instead of sitting there and read
Highlights the definition of hope and despair
Offers an alternative mode
The soundtracks are indeed fitting into situations that players are confronting with at the spot
ConSome achievments requires you to grind a lot
The character's audio speaking is somehow irritating
No alternative scenes
Conclusion:This game is funny and got indeed lots of mysteries which are waiting to be discovered to enjoy but after you've reach a certain part, it can be boring

												"But I watched the anime, I don't need to play this, right?"Let-Let me stop you right there
The anime is trash*, plain and simple, but this


this is another matter entirely
Danganronpa answers the age old question of "What happens if you let a mechanical bear with a despair fetish capture a bunch of highschool students with extreme proficiency in one field and force them to kill each other?"The answer, of course, is one of the most incredible visual novel experiences I've ever had
Danganronpa takes everything up to 11, shows you what it would look like if you went to 12, and then skips straight to 15
Everything about it is enthralling and horrifying all at once
I lost a lot of sleep thinking about this game
Do yourself a favor and just sit down and play it straight through
Don't read anything else about it
Don't risk ruining the experience for yourself, because hot damn is it an experience
Everything after like the first 30 minutes is a game changing spoiler
I can come up with about 11037 more reasons why this game is great, but I'll spare you my ramblings
Just


just play it
*This is called comedic hyperbole
Please read my edits
EDIT 1: In response to some of the comments on this review, let me expand my discussion on the anime a bit
The anime is a direct adaption of only the most essential elements of the plot of the original PSP game
The result is next to nothing as far as character development, and the suspense and thrill of solving the crimes is completely eliminated by the investigation/courtroom montages that sort of just


exposit, with little of interest otherwise
I have absolutely nothing against the adaption as its own work or even against anime in general
It's just that when compared to the extremely detailed characterization every single character gets in the game and the satisfaction of actually having to solve all the crimes yourself, the anime falls flat
In short, the anime is definitely not a substitute for actually playing the game
I hope this helps!EDIT 2: Well


yes, if you've watched the anime you'll have the plot spoiled for you
However, like I said, you still only know the gist of how each crime happened
You still have to actually do all the legwork to prove it, which is still a lot of fun in and of itself
At least I think so
Plus, there character events and bonus scenes that can't be seen by just watching the anime
So if you have any attatchment to the characters, then yes, I do think there is value in playing the game
If you just wanted the plot, well


you got it

												SPOILER FREE REVIEW -- [I have beaten this on Vita]Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a deceptive, mystery-driven variety adventure title with visual novel, horror and romance elements
Sounds like a mouthful? But this game manages to split these elements proportionally to make them enjoyable and add fuel to the evolving, amazing, storyline that will haunt you for years to come
Originally a PSP title, with multiple ports for years to come, the PC version is more akin to a straight-up port than a HD remake
Which is fine, and understandable, because it isn't the games' aesthetics which make it one of the best adventure games I've ever played; but its story, characters and setting
Again, spoiler-free, but you play as Makoto Naegi, an average high school boy finding himself trapped in a mysterious building one day with other students; aptly nicknamed given their personality and fashion
Not long in, there's been a murder and you are put in charge with finding out who murdered said person, by learning about the other characters, finding clues and going into a trial with them ala Ace Attorney
Speaking of - I feel Danganronpa is a strong franchise which can be compared to the Ace Attorney series as there are identical gameplay elements and quirky design choices
Moving on though, general gameplay consists of room-to-room movement, talking to characters in visual novel-esque, with their beautifully drawn portraits to keep you distracted from the text
During the trials, there are well-placed, reasonable and sensical QTEs that tie-in with how both the story and gameplay present themselves up until that point
Your quick fingers, your own intuition and feelings for the characters will make you feel confident, or weasel out of wanting to press those button propmpts
Anyway, for me personally, one of the best portions of the game is its atmosphere: its forboding, compelling, repressive and tense building was mostly on my part because of the direction the game goes
It


isn't your typical raincoat detective story, there's nicely used humour, a strange but loveable villain which is introduced early, whacky, bizarre, creative yet at the same time, reverse-stereotypical characters
But what did it for me


was the way the game progresses, what happens when each new day passes


what your consequence is for not finding the murderer quick enough
All the dread, mystery and tension is added as layers of fear, heh
At one point, I felt legitamately frightened to continue, but I did anyway knowing what would happen next was going to blow my mind
I can't say enough good things about this game, BUY IT
BUY IT NOW
It will be one of the best adventure games you'll play, there is something for everybody in this game, big and small
This game is a masterpiece

												On the surface, this game is just a big bunch of stereotypes put together
However, this turns out to be one of its biggest strengths
The game strikes a good balance between rolling with the tropes and subverting them, constantly leading you into an 'obvious' conclusion and then pulling the rug from underneath you
Then, as soon as you start accounting for this, the game once again switches gears to keep you guessing
I encountered quite a few unexpected plot twists during my first playthrough of the PSP fan translation a few years back, which was a pleasant surprise given the predictable nature of most video game stories
While the story is still pretty fun even if you do know what's going to happen, if you are currently unspoiled, I suggest you try and keep it that way
Stay away from forums, don't look online for fan art and for God's sake do not listen to the soundtrack until you finish the game (I managed to spoil myself by reading the tracklist during my first playthrough)
In terms of replayability, I consider the game to be worth at least two playthroughs: there is a lot of clever foreshadowing that you will simply not get on your first playthrough hidden throughout the game and focussing your gift-giving and free time activities on different characters will reward you with additional backstory for them
As such, I'd say the current asking price is very fair, even for a six-year old port
Aside from buying the game based on its merits, if you are at all interested in seeing similar games get ported from Sony's ill-fated handhelds to Steam, buying Dangan Ronpa is a good signal to companies like Spike Chunsoft that there is, in fact, a market for them
It's unfortunate for Sony, but thanks to Spike Chunsoft, I won't have to consider buying a Vita (TV) anymore to play the second installment of this series and I sincerly hope that other hidden gems will eventually make their way to Steam as well

												Think of Ace Attorney, but full of fast paced and action oriented arguments
As a person that finished it on the PSP (through unconventional methods) I am very satisfied that it's on steam so I don't have to feel guilty!Also it's another game that is full of spoilers, so Googling is very, very risky
Wanna search up your favorite character but without spoilers? Good luck
Searching up fanart? Goodbye

												Plant vs
Zombies is a cute,addictive and fun game for all ages
I play it a lot of my old school laptop, and it runs completely fine even on that
The game has a lengthy story with various challenges to overcome
There's many plants, zombies and maps to play around with
The story is very simple, but fun
Crazy Dave is quite hillarious
Plant vs
Zombies is a defense game
Your task is to defend the garden against waves of enemies and upgrade the garden
It starts of easy, but new zombies and plants are added throughout the story
You will earn coins and other rewards which you use to buy new items from the store and upgrade your Zen Garden
The game is really simple when it comes to graphics, but it's adorable
All the plants and zombies have unique abillites and funny looks
The game is really small, but there's so much content here
Challenge mode, survival, story, Zen Garden, water park, mini-games,tree-challenge and a store full of important and fun upgrades
The fun simply never ends
This is a must own!

And to redeem my sin,  I decided to buy this
Sadly, this game doesn't support widescreen
			
Posted: 7 June
												After playing the very disappointing DS version of Plants vs
Zombies, this PC version feels and plays great
When I heard about PvZ the very first time when I was like 8, I watched ZackScottGames play it, and loved it
A tower defense game that I was really looking forward to play when I realized it's on the DS, and got it on Christmas
When I started playing, I was really disappointed, but I forced myself to finish it since I got it
I finished it in about a week, and it was hell
The graphics did look good for the DS, and using a touchscreen made it easy to place plants and collect sun/money
Other than that, the framerate was awful when Waves happen (Can go from decent to like 5 fps), a good amount of small bugs, the Multiplayer was a bust, and the funny zombie animations weren't there (Like for example: when a zombie gets blown up on the PC version, they turn black and turn to dust
On the DS version, they just turn black and disappear
)
So much was so downgraded in the DS version it wasn't even funny, and for 40 dollars? No thanks
8-9 years after that train-wreak, I got the PC version when it was on sale, and it's so much better and more enjoyable
Okay, on to the real review:Plants vs
Zombies is a Tower-Defense game where you need to use plants in order to defend your home from zombies
In order to plant your plants, you need Sun
In order to get Sun, you can plant Sunflowers to increase the amount of Sun you can get, or just wait (planting Sunflowers is the best idea at the start
)
Once you get enough Sun for a plant you want to plant (Example: Peashooter), you can select that plant, and place it into an available spot on the lawn
It's simplistic, yes, but it gets challenging as eff in later levels
At level 1-# and 2-#, you are at your lawn
The lawn is the easiest, since it's only 5 lanes, and you don't need a special plant in order to fully secure all the lanes (exept on 2-#)
Level 3-# and 4-# is the backyard
The backyard is harder, since you have 6 lanes, and the 2 lanes in the middle are water lanes
You need Lily Pads in order to place plants on the water
Level 3-# isn't all that bad, and does take a bit to get use to, but on Level 4-#, you need to know what you are doing
Fog takes up half of the right of the screen, and you need a special plant in order to get rid of some of the fog
You don't know where a zombie is at or what lane it's in, because the fog blocks the view
 Level 5-# and 6-# are the hardest levels of them all
It all takes place on your bloody roof, which means there is no ground for your plants
You need a special plant, which is the Flower Pot
Flower Pots can be placed on the roof, and you can plant a plant on it
What makes it so hard? Flower Pots cost Sun in order to place down, and there is 7 lanes, so it will take a lot of time to save up a lot of Sun for Flower Pots and plants
Not only that, but in Level 5-# and 6-#, they use the strongest zombies in the game
It makes things much more challenging
You have to be fast, and you need to know what you are doing
The final level in the game is the final boss, which I won't spoil at all
At level 1/3/5-#, it's daylight, which means you can get Sun from the sky, but at 2/4/6-#, you don't get Sun from the sky, meaning that you can only get Sun from your plants
There is a ton of different zombies in the game
There is the normal one, which are easy as hell, Conehead Zombies, which take two Peashooters to kill, Ironbucket Zombies, which takes 3 Peashooters, Football Zombies, which needs some really good defense to kill, Disco Zombies, which summons zombies when he poses and just as strong as the Coneheads, and much, much more
It keeps the game fresh and doesn't make it dull after the very first Levels
There is a ton of different plants to choose in the game as well
There is over 25 different plants to choose, and you unlock one at the end on almost every level
Sunflowers are your friend, and will always be in this game
Even though there is a lot of plants to choose from, the game doesn't really hold your hand when it comes to choosing at the start at almost every level
You can only hold up 6 plants to choose from, and you can buy more at Crazy Dave's store
So that means you need to think when you do your choices, as it can backfire
Speaking of Crazy Dave's store, you can buy upgrades and other things when you are in Levels
In order to buy items, you need to get Crazy Dave's keys (which is in 3-5, I think), and you need to save up money for the items (coins are dropped sometimes when zombies are killed
)
If you have enough money, you can buy that item, and can use it in the Level
It's quite useful
I know there is more to the game, but I want you to try it out, and see what the game has to offer
For 5 dollars, it's worth it!But I did have some flaws with the PC version:It needs Co-op, like on the console versions
Playing alone by yourself is fun, but playing the game with a friend makes it a blast to play
If it was Vs
Multiplayer (like the DS version
), then no thanks
Wish you can skip the tutorial at the start of the game, because the tutorial is just boring to play
TL;DR, I really recommend it! If you love Tower-Defense games, or a game that will give good entertainment or a good laugh, this is for you! The gameplay is great stuff
Get it on PC, not on the DS

												Overall better cast than the first game
But it has a few problems that DR1 didn't have, which to me was what made the game fun in the first place
DR1 spoilers:  All of them seem capable of killing which I couldn't say about the first game where it was obvious that weedman, the giant and donut girl wasn't a threat to you
DR2 spoilers:   However unlike the first game where Kirigiri, Byakuya and other characters were arguing during the trial and bringing up interesting points
DR2 has a lack of persuasive characters
There's effectively just Nagito (who argues in your favor half the time anyway) and Chiaki
The other characters never challenges you in a convincing way

												(No spoilers)Let me preface this review by saying that you shouldn't play Danganronpa 2 without playing the first game
Danganronpa is a mystery series, so you'd want to play the games in release order for maximum effect
That said, DR1 and DR2 pair together very nicely so you should try to get both of them if you can afford it
Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is an excellent followup to DR1 that excels the original in almost every respect
Memorable characters, a soundtrack worth shelling money for, a unique/bizarre gameworld and story, and to top it all off, the PC port is pretty great
I can't think of any reason *not* to recommend DR2 if you even remotely enjoyed the first game

												There are a fair number of horror games out there
Many of them, to be candid, are fairly bad if not downright awful
The issue being that a lot of the time games in this genre seem to want to follow a set list
There is somewhat a rigid rulebook on how horror games are meant to be, but these rules aren’t supposed to be one hundred percent abided by
Developers can and should, for the most part, make up the rules and experiment as much as they want
At the end of the day I find that it’s the somewhat unique games that capture people’s attention
Now I’m not saying Detention is unique, I mean let’s face it what is unique nowadays? However it does like to throw in its own little rulebook
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The summary of the plot is; you start off the game as a male student named Wei who falls asleep in class
Hours later he wakes up alone in a dark and obviously quite spooky school
After sometime  exploring he comes across a girl sitting asleep on the school stage
He wakes her up and things start really kicking off
A lot of weird stuff starts happening around the school and creatures called Lingered start appearing
These seem to be undead students and teachers and are the first enemies you come across
They’re slow creatures which, like the rest of the enemies in the game, seem to have a hunger for anything that breathes
Luckily there’s a useful mechanic that can help with that
By clicking the right mouse button, or whichever button it’s been mapped to, Wei or Ray will hold their breath
This allows for you to scamper on past the Lingered without them attacking, however you will have to catch your breath if you hold for too long
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Detention plays out as a point and click horror game where you will need to solve puzzles in order to progress
Some of the puzzles can be fairly straight forward, for example using an umbrella to fetch a key from a ventilation shaft
But others require a bit of thought to them
One example was where I had to look at three clock faces
Two had hands and the one in the middle didn’t
There was then three pictures, each with a bloody symbol on them
These symbols represented the clock hands and once I’d adjusted the clocks to the correct times the door that was previously locked opened
Some puzzles do require certain items to complete them
These items aren’t too difficult to come across, you just need to be a little bit observant
The puzzles themselves don’t feel too tedious or pointless
There’s always a valid reason to complete them and most of the time it’s to move the story forward
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Graphics wise I’d say detention has an unusual but very well done art style
It’s clear the artist took a lot of time to add in as much detail as possible to give the game a sense of reality
Each area is well drawn, with clear distinctions from the odd dark world, with it’s grainy overly, to the creepy school at night
The characters and enemies are defined too
With Wei and Ray wearing very white school uniforms and the enemies seemingly very dark and shadowy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In conclusion I think Detention is horror game that tries to break the mould of the genres standards
But does it? Yes and no
There are a few things that really shine for me in Detention
The story is pretty complex but welcome, as I know of many horror games that have little to no story at all
Also I like the various stealth mechanics that are introduced for the number of enemies you have to face
It does throw in the odd jumpscare here and there, but I mean what horror games doesn’t
It’s got puzzles of varying difficulties and an eerie soundtrack that fits the game’s quite chilling atmosphere
All in all if you love horror games and want something a little different than the norm then I’d suggest giving Detention a go
And even if you don’t want it for the horror aspect, it’s full of puzzles to test your wits too
Good Day!

												Holy heck this is a good one
Good enough for me to post a review even!From start to end, I was left in awe
The characters are interesting, the story is told beautifully, the art is unique (in a good way), and the music/sounds were done masterfully
The only real complaints I had were that a majority of the signs posted throughout the world weren't translated (however, ALL notes and signs essential to the story are translated)
It doesn't rely on jump-scares but pure atmospheric horror (granted there is like maybe two jump-scares but they're done so well I can't even be mad)
What I also adored about this game is it's "puzzles
" They weren't complicated but they were done in such a way that makes this game unique
I highly recommend this game

She likes horror
But I really don't
The whole story and the puzzles of the stages were so good, The background music and sound effects fit nicely with the vibes of the game
But it scared me as f
I recommend it to the gamers that love horror

												Disclaimer: I am a supporter since this game's beta phase but only playtested its Traditional Chinese version
I bought the game from Steam again and tried it out in English setting so as to write this review in English
I think Detention nailed it with interweaving its background setting and the foreground story that's being played out
In a seemingly simple and short (2-hour play time) 2D horror format, it presents a whole lot unique Taiwanese cultural elements to the player, while unraveling what's this not-so-horror horror story is about
Writing is really good, and fortunately the English translation is also good enough
There are soooo many things in game you just can't find a direct translation into English or other languages, but they somehow pulled it through, which is pretty impressive
What's really a shame to me IMHO is that there are also many detailed environmental clues in the visuals that just couldn't be totally translated
These won't hinder your understanding to the plot itself, or to feel the emotions that the game wants you to feel, but surely there's going to be something missing if you don't read Traditional Chinese
Gameplay wise, the game does have some survival elements in the former half of the game, and puzzles throughout the game, but difficulty should not be a problem
If you are into short narrative games that give you a movie-like experience this is definitely for you too
Visually the game may not be "stunning" in a high production value sense, but all the props and closeup interaction views are all designed meticulously
I would praise the team that they put their resources into where it mattered the most and it paid off well
Audio on the other hand, is sooooo good
I doubt you can find other 2D narrative games that really rivals with Detention's audio design and music composing
Finally, my friendly warning would be don't come to the game to expect truly gory or extremely scary stuff -- if you watched the game's release trailer just once I don't think you can somehow miss the point
But of course I won't go into what the story really is about, but prepare your tissue ready
It's probably one of the few horror games that's going to make you cry of sorrow but not horror
Definitely recommended

												Detention follows a unique arc in horror that not many other titles manage to trace
It starts in a perfectly grounded place, with familiar characters and real-world concerns
From there it spirals off into a fantastic journey of bizarre horrors and vivid, dreamlike imagery
At the tail end of this, it comes right back to a grounded conclusion somehow enhanced by the weirdness endured on the way there
It’s a deeply-affecting game because of this, one that wields its symbolism and purpose with a confident hand
The game opens in the shoes of Wei, a high school student in 1960s Taiwan
After falling asleep in class he awakens to find himself trapped in the school during a typhoon, his only companion being an upper-classman named Ray
Mysterious events are set in motion that put them in peril, including the road into town washing away and a strange presence stalking the halls
As the story turns darker their relevance to the lives of these two students is laid bare, along with the reason for their isolation and the effect it has on their lives
There are some VERY heavy overtones here, ones that resonate powerfully in the real world
Citizens of Taiwan in the 1960s lived under martial law, a brutal regime that allowed only limted speech and political ideology
Anyone who resisted was not long for this world, a threat that extended even to students
A cornerstone of Detention’s horror is set in this terrifying reality, where instructors and authorities are constantly watching for dissident thought to excise
Simply reading the wrong book could mean vanishing into the night with a bag over your head, and to me there are few ideas in horror more horrifying than that
Detention brings this world to the player as a stark reality, where students and teachers alike are fearful and suspicious of each other with threat of death hanging over them all
It takes a terrible toll on them, and the psychological damage is a major focus of this title
It’s expressed through a great deal of striking imagery, much of it steeped in Chinese folklore
You’ll encounter religion in the shrines and talismans set about, mythology in the strange creatures you encounter and how you escape them, and culture in solving puzzles containing unique concepts like spirit money
For those of us unfamiliar with the culture it provides a unique sort of immersion, since we can’t be sure how some of the more esoteric elements fit with reality
I wish I could explain the story more directly but it would be a crime to spoil any part of it, considering how gripping it is
The tale is told through a lot of shifting environments akin to Silent Hill, where familiar locations like classrooms and auditoriums become bastions of symbolic horrors
The further into the game you get the less grounded in reality these places become, yet this happens because they symbolize events in the real world more closely
You’ll learn plenty about one character’s broken home from a network of nightmare rooms filled with ghosts and needles and connected by a cursed radio
The intensity of the experience builds as you creep closer to the truth, and the closing revelations hit hard enough on a purely human level to make a major payoff
The gameplay that gets you there is some basic pointing and clicking from a purely side-scrolling perspective
Items and points of interest are highlighted with a question mark when you draw near, so wandering the full extent of a room is sure to reveal everything of note
Puzzles here are plenty unique owing to the cultural influence, but are never confusing and have logical solutions
There’s not much challenge to the game aside from learning how the enemies work, since there’s a very different way of dealing with them than what you’re used to
There’s a curve to it but dying helpfully sends you to a special place with a strange NPC who advises you on what you did wrong
Topping this package off with vivid, finely-animated graphics and some wonderfully horrifying sound design makes it a near-perfect entry in the genre
The only complaint I can level against it is a common one for quality titles, that being a lack of content to enjoy
Detention shouldn’t take you much more than two hours to complete, with no branching paths and only two endings which depend on answers given in the final area
There’s also an issue of consistency, as the game is split into four parts but the content of each varies pretty wildly in terms of threats and tone
This isn’t really a complaint but more of a warning that if you like something about an early part, it may not return later
Detention did almost everything I could ask of a psychological horror game
It gave me interesting characters, it gave them depth, it threatened them with a horrifying concept, and it explored all aspects of that horror
If it were longer it might be my new pinnacle of the genre, but for what it is it’s still an impressive piece with the power to rattle anyone
The strange and intense symbolism gives way to fears that anyone, anywhere could have, reflected through events that really took place in the past
It’s a brilliant, terrifying, heartbreaking game that succeeds at everything it sets out to do, and deserves major recognition for it

												This is one of the best narrative experiences I've ever seen in a video game, and possibly in any medium
It seems like a standard point-and-click horror game, but behind its gameplay lies a brilliantly subtle twisted form of storytelling comparable to Silent Hill 2
It's fairly short and isn't groundbreaking, but the hours I spent playing this game were absolutely unforgettable
If you like when horror doesn't spook or startle you, but slowly digs at your emotions and leaves you with nothing left to say, I cannot recommend this game enough
			
Posted: 20 August
												TLDR: If you look only for an horror game, look elsewhere, if you are in for an experience and like to reflect on things, this gem is for you
First of all, there are a couple of things that have to be said:1
-The game is labeled and marketed as an horror game, but this is only done on the first part of the game, if horror is all that you're looking for, it migh dissapoint you, if you're interested in other generes you genuilly have to go  for it
2
-This is sort of point and click combined to a side scroller to some degree, you can't play it with a controller, and don't need a keyboard, the game is played entirely with the mouse
Now that that has been cleared, this is genuinely a gem of a game, it goes from horror, to traumatic, to surreal, to introspective, to reflective, but to really get the grasp of what the game has to offer is best if you actually reflect on everything that you read and see, and try to get the meaning of everything that you see, even on what's on the background, literally everything  has a meaning, yes, you can still just rush through the game, but you'll loose on the experience
You might notice that all the reviews a have short play time, that's because the game is relatively short, it took me 3
4 hours and I took my time, but still is long enough to give you an experience and not become tedious, and actually gives you a sense of closure at the end
			
Posted: 14 January
												I picked this game up without any prior knowledge of it
The visuals looked interested, like a cross of old Silent Hill games and The Cat Lady, also it was cheap so I bought it
I have to say it didn't turn out to be what I expected, but I still liked the game
Looking at the screenshots, you'd be under the impression that the game is a point and click horror game about some kids stuck in a haunted school, but that's just the first quarter of the game
The later chapters dwell much more deeper than such a simplistic plot
I want to say more about the game but I'm afraid I'll be giving out spoilers and I really request you to experience the story first hand
It might be a little convoluting to get so pay attention to every little detail in the game
Regarding the game's length, I clocked in 4
4 hours and I believe I experienced the game in it's entierity
I wouldn't call it short though, any longer would have made the story feel stretched out
Overall, a great game
I wish there were more games like these which dealt in old asian folklore and history

												Amazing game!!! i would say the game is worth around 10-15€The gameplay and the atmosphere, graphics, soundtrack everything were astounding
There is a lot to this game when it comes to artistic meeting, it says quite a a few things without saying anything at all, leaving everything up to visual story telling and making connections,  it's a dark, twisted, wierd and wonderfull bit of indie game art and storytelling

An amazing game that builds on what made LIMBO greatSummary at the end - for the easily persuadedOverall Impression:INSIDE is another great game from Playdead[playdead
com]
While it has no direct connection to LIMBO except that it comes from the same studio, you immediately get the sense that this game is based on LIMBO
The fluidity of your character´s movement, the subte yet beautiful background and the sounds that match the action perfectly - all these staples of LIMBO are artistically reinvigorated in INSIDE
Without spoiling anything, INSIDE has a creepy atmosphere that is complemented by simplistic, yet stunning visuals and sounds that give an eerie feeling
Storywise, it leaves almost everything up to interpretation, which I percieve to be a good thing because it doesn´t spoon feed you
There is no notable dialogue
No tutorial
No help
You´re thrown into the game without even so much as a main menu
And that´s great because it´s unique
However, this game does have some cons, as any indie game does (otherwise it would be mainstream)
It is fairly short - at a relaxed pace, I played it through in four hours
For the price of €11
99 (-40% on sale), thats more money per hour than most other games
Especially when we consider that there is a lack of replayability in this game - once you´ve played it you know the solutions to the puzzles and can (maybe) come back to it a few months, if not years, later
But if, like me, you don´t measure games by cost per hour but rather by entertainment value, you´ll be impressed
That said, I do recommend getting INSIDE on sale rather than full price, or waiting for the price to drop over time, because €20 is pretty steep
Another negative is the ending
MINOR SPOILER AHEAD In my opinion, the ending is pretty unsatisfying and leaves a lot of questions unanswered
It leaves much up to imagination, which could be considered a good thing as I said before, but in the case of the ending it lacks clarity
Pros:Simplistic yet stunning visualsFiiting, creepy soundsAtmosphere of uncertainty that inspires player´s imaginationAppeals wonderfully to LIMBO fansYou aren´t spoon-fedCons:High price per hour (if purchased at €20 and not on sale)Lack of replayabilityEnding - see minor spoiler aboveSummaryINSIDE is an indie game with beauty and is artistically executed
While it lacks replay incentification or price value (at the current €20), it doesn´t spoon-feed you and instead inspires your imagination
If you liked LIMBO, you´ll love this
Final verdict: 8
5/10 - Buy on sale or after price drops

4/10* First of all, I strongly recommend INSIDE for people who would like to experience a very atmospheric and meaningful designed game
INSIDE is all about paying attention to all kind of details and events that you will encounter during the journey in the game
- The sound effects and well designed graphics perfectly fit the general dark atmosphere of INSIDE
- There are no instructions, no explanations, no story telling, no dialogues and absolutly lots of meanings in this game
It's not just about puzzles and getting yourself to the next step, if you pay attention to whatever happens around you; the sounds, voices, movements, light affects and the ideas, you will actually know that INSIDE has a very deep meanings
* I enjoyed INSIDE although it's a short game that took me nearly 5 hours to 100% finish the game along with its achivements, taking into concediration that I normally had to repeat some parts where I died few times before solving the puzzle and moving on
* For me I got INSIDE on the Summer Sale 2017, and I recommend buying the game on sale
PLEASE NOTE: The coming parts, along with my screenshots includes spoilers !! SPOILER ALLERT	 After completing the game, you might start wondering about what does all of this mess means
Well it differs from one player to another but for me I think that INSIDE is all about mind manipulating and enslaving poor and weak people
That can go as a general idea, but for the idea that is a little bit more obvious, the main character of INSIDE is this little boy who came from the poor or similarly, the low class of people
somehow this little boy managed to escape and not being captured by the scouters who appears at the beginning of the game
these scouters work for a huge orgnization that targets the low class people of the society as they are considered as worthless creatures regardless their role in the society, capturing them and using them as lab rats under the supervision of the company's or orgnization's scientists
Performing new tests and experiments directly on these enslaved people which will lead into so many mutations and transformations
One experiment after another (The Company) have reached to a point in where they can control the minds of the enslaved ones which will result in controlling their actions
This is the new trade that gains the capitalists huge profits by offering this mind control to the high class people of the world so they can use the enslaved mind controlled people as machines at their service
	 Back to the little boy, as I mentioned he managed to escape from being captured by the scouters, and then he tries to find his way out of all of this
But, on the way his concepts changed as he experienced the role of the mind controller
Now, he aims to free out all of the other people who have been captured and been put and used in the experiements of The Company
During this journey some concepts can be noticed as they describe the little boy's thoughts changing such as: the little tiny chicks at the beginning of the game, if you pay attention, after blowing them towards the box none of them dies yet one of them starts to walk slower than others and apperantly seems weaker
The mind whipped bodies that the little boy controls using the mind controling helmet are another example; in the part of the game where you need to gather 19 of them to open the huge metal door, you can realize that the last one of them is a dead body
And the other group of the mind whipped or controlled people who provides help in the elevator, you can actually realize that this group includes individuals that lost an arm, a leg or even a head
All of these details are pointing to one direction: the change of heart and mind of the little boy
 How? the little boy now knows that working in a group and for the benefit of the majority, a sacrifice is a must
The little chick, the dead one and the lost organs ! as he reaches the big dome that he knows later on that it is actually a big tank, he manages to dive in and be close to a big, sticky, organic blob that is made of organs and people, body parts, legs, arms and even heads ! all in one big strange manipulated formation ! these are the people of his class in this society, could be his friends, or even family ! so he now believes that he must sacrifice him self for the benefit of the majority as he tries to unplug the mind controlling healmets he gets sucked into the blob and then try to lead it to its freedom and its way out of this place
The blob causes chaeos and huge losses inside The Company while on its way out and finally rests on a shore with some sun light away from The Company


The little boy managed to save the currently captured people, but who knows what rich and powerful people can do again !	At the end thats my opinion, and as I said other people may have different thoughts about all of this
The game is amazing and worth buying it

Posted: 6 March
Disturbed
Speechless
Wholeheartedly in awe
That's how I'm feeling after full playtrough
It was few years back, when I began depressing journey with Limbo
Back then it was for me much more discouraging because of the puzzles, that my brain just couldn't handle; but I was in Love with the tone, visualisation, and playing it - until I reached the end - and to this day, Limbo is game that I will, with pleasure, recommend till the end of time
After five long years Playdead[playdead
com] came up with their second tittle - INSIDE
Let me tell you right away - waiting this long was worth it!INSIDE is showcase what someones devotion to games, great artistic vision, trust in player base and brilliant mind can come up with, in this crowded gaming world
From start it wasn't for me possible to look at this game, and be bored, or be disinterested; because with every frame comes new thing to discover
I was trying to keep away from spoilers, as much as I could
I succeeded
You playing as little kid; running from people, beasts; timing your jumps so you wouldn't end as splatter in dark alley, and being careful while swimming in the dark; trying to grasp control over you life, and life of others
You run forward where mystery of this world is hiding, and along the way figure out your purpose in this dark and twisted story
What is happening here is disturbing, weird, confusing, and if the ending won't leave you with sense of "What the F*, just happened!", I seriously don't know what will
This story works perfectly, and when credits starts to roll, that is the point where your interest will spike even higher, cause you want to know more 


also there is alternative ending, which digs even deeper
Story (despite how much I enjoyed it) is sidetracked by astonishing visuals and overall aesthetics
INSIDE looks spectacular
Foreground and background seamlessly coming together at the center where the action lies
Work with lighting and shadow in just incredible, and the level of detail that is made because of this, is just top level
Everything on screen is set as indented, just to give us this eerie feeling, sense of hopelessness and misfortune behind every corner
When you add to this mix great ambience sound, with on point sound design - result should leave you entirely at awe
Controls are smooth, and on point
I didn't experience any issues whatsoever while playing with controller
My biggest fear were puzzles
After Limbo, I was really cautious
Why? Let's just say, there were moments I rage quit a lot
Not with INSIDE
Yes, I admit, there were few instances of me getting annoyed and discouraged, but if it was up to five times I'm already exaggerating
So on this front, I was satisfied with myself that I could get thru, with only smallest possible help of guides (just a couple - I swear to God, I don't believe in)
Also it was so satisfying for me, to pat my own back for job well done, when I figured something out (yes, I'm one of those people - dumb)
I won't shy away from statement, that INSIDE could easily be pinnacle of gaming in my personal experience
This is art that should be celebrated by playing it, and afterwards recommended it to others, so they can too experience this game
I agree; story might not suit everyone (ending is probably even worse in this manner), but from technical stand point and playability this comes to very top
Thank you Playdead for this game, and whoever you are reading this, and still didn't play INSIDE just do it!Grade: A+

												Inside is a really great game and I don't really want to give anything away with a review, so I will just summarize;-The graphics and sound are just stunningly well done-The gameplay is smooth, fun and controls great-It builds an excellent atmosphere with uniquely eery storytelling-Has puzzles and mechanics that are clever while not becoming tiresomeThere are some totally unique things about this game that you will want to have experienced yourself, It's really something amazing
I highly recommend
Easily one of my favorite gaming experiences of all time
Great job developers

												I see people complaining how short this game is
Personally, I'd rather play 3-5 hours of perfection than 50+ of repetitive, unoriginal crap
The atmosphere and design are like nothing I've ever seen in a platform styled game
To be honest, you're doing INSIDE a disservice by considering it a platformer
The puzzles are challenging, yet not frustrating, and the ending leaves you with chills
TIP: (minor spoiler) Make sure you collect all of the orbs for the secret ending
This game is a genuine masterpiece

Well, its obvious where the Limbo developer's have been putting in their time
INSIDE is brimming with atmosphere, feelings, and attention to detail
I mean it doesn't take more than 10 minute to see how meticulously hand-crafted and polished this title is
The only question in my mind, really, is if its worth the debatably steep asking price
For me? Oh sure, you bet
You aren't going to get 20 hours (likely closer to 3-5), but damn, you will get an experience
While I enjoyed Limbo, I thought INSIDE was overall much better
Essentially, this is a walking/experience simulator with medium-level puzzles
And I don't mean 'walking simulator' in a derogatory way - its great fun
I should note that this game is rather dark, triggering some moderate level anxiety at moments
Definately scary at times, too
Pros:+Definately some of the most attention-to-details I've seen in a game
What points it loses for overall length, it definately gains in being one of the highest of quality experiences
+Sounds and music are outstanding
+The feelings are real, with this one
You will definatley go through a range of emotions
+'Storyline' is quite original, albeit abstract
Don't expect to walk away understanding everything
+Thankfully, the puzzles aren't super difficult
This is more focused on the experience, which I appreciated
+The scope of the rooms and areas were just magnificient
+Controller support is great
Cons:-Definately expensive, although they arguably earned their money
The devil is in the details
Those animations are obviously all custom
-Some moments verged on being too anxiety ridden/scary for me
Thankfully I pushed through and it worked out well, though
-While there was a range of environments, I would have liked to see less 'Portal factory' and more perhaps outside
Its fine, and I'm being slightly picky, but there it is
For any indie game enthusiast, this is a must have
Now with that being said, I'm sure if you wait, it will be on a half-price sale sooner than later
Either way, make sure you play through this game some time in 2016

												Imagine a gorgeous, detailed graphical story
A story of goblins, dragons, wonderful lands and gorgeous colour
Imagine a story made of heroes undertaking an epic quest to protect the kingdom from a terrible menace and journeying far and wide
Now imagine that story being brought to life, animated, and you being in control of the heroes
That's Trine 2
The artwork is jaw dropping, not because of technical wizardry or the number of polygons it pushes on screen, this isn't a game that will murder your graphics card, but instead the artistry comes from attention to detail
The watercolour feel of the skies, the glorious use of colours and sweeping vistas to sell the graphical novel element, and the heroes and villains, brought to being in near hand drawn detail
Behind this rests a solid, if somewhat generic feeling soundtrack, but a narrator who really sells the atmosphere, combined with solid voice acting for each of the protagonists (and indeed, the antagonists), it helps immerse you in the game and the story as a whole
The mechanics of the game are a refinement and improvement over the original Trine, with you switching between heroes on the fly and using their respective strengths to fight and puzzle your way through various environments, however this time it feels much slicker, and much more confident in what it does, there's many points where you'll be scratching your head, only to have the light flick on with a genuine "AH HA!" moment
It's never punishingly difficult, but it's pleasantly challenging
The lack of gore and fantasy nature of the game makes it very family friendly too, older children will get a kick out of the fantasy setting, and adults will no doubt get many of the references
In this it resembles a Pixar film, a comparison I make very affectionately
Do please check this game out, it deserves your time and attention

												This game is completely different from all other 2d games


It's like you put your headphones on, ignore everything around you and you're in a new, amazing world, full of things to discover with a facinating nature
The best part about the game is the enviroment, its beyond all other games
The details and animations are awesome
It puts you in the mood for epic battles and doing puzzles like never before
The atmosphere is a drug itself
Does have funny achievments actually worth to spend time getting, they're both fun and challenging
You can upgrade your heroes to do even more neat stuff
Also got multiplayer, cooperactive mode so you can play it with your beloved friends
I must say that this game is catchy, not addictive in a bad way, but once you get the hand of it, you really wanna play it alot
BIG shoutout to the music, it fits the game perfectly
Worth the money NO doubt
I think this game is why god invented the word 'magic'
Do yourself a favour and buy it
Yes, right now

												Go for it
The bundle is almost always on discount
Both the first and the second are gorgeous games, i mean GORGEOUS!The game design is amazing, there's always a way to finish the level if you're smart enough
One thing to say tho, it can get really boring/frustrating at some point (the second one especially since it's a tad bit longer than the first one)

But still, it's definitely worth the few hours you'll spend playing it, it was for me at least

												The best thing that I like about this game, is its graphics
Every single level, character, enemies, background and platforms are well refined
Just look at the trailer and screenshots! It is exactly as pretty as the actual game itself
It is a puzzle platformer with a little bit of action in it
There are a lot of ways to tackle all the puzzles, and a lot of different approach to advance the levels
The story itself is quite interesting
The puzzles are interesting and not too overwhelming
The boss fights pose some challenge but not impossible if you get to know how to fight (or just checkpoint-abuse)
The flexible difficulty settings make this game suitable for different type of player
After you defeat one playthru, you can replay all the stages from the start again with your already-unlocked skills to get past the stages in different way, and to collect the experience vials whereby you cannot collect in your first playthru
Multiplayer is best played with friends that has almost the same progress to avoid spoilers and trolling
The achievements added quite a bit of challenge and replayability if you're going for 100% completion
My score: 10/10

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Trine 2: Complete Story Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Platformer; Adventure; Puzzle; Coop; Beautiful Artwork   My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 10-25 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamers; Multiplayer gamers REVIEWTrine 2 is the sequel to the instant classic that was the first
 And it successfully takes a big step forward from the first game in all the positive aspects
 However, not too much was changed, ensuring that the charm achieved in the first game is still prevalent
Like its forefather, Trine 2 is a light game that is easy to digest but offers gripping visuals, a mystical atmosphere, and enticing gameplay
 All of the features of the game are simple in design but intricate in execution
 The gameplay, aesthetics, and narrative all come together to create a whimsical and charming adventure
 I highly recommend this for all gamers to consider; and for fans of the genre it is a sure bet
Keeping in the tradition of the first game, the best aspects of Trine 2 are the stunning visuals and alluring atmospheric presentation of the setting
Each and every environment you explore is diverse, captivating, and charming
The ambiance really captures the mystical aura of the game perfectly
Trine 2 somehow even manages to feel even more mystical than the first, and also has one of the most immersive 2D environments in the realm of video games
The gameplay is light and quick to grasp
Anyone should be able to dive right in, regardless of ability level
But various difficulty levels and a “hardcore” mode ensure that skilled players can still find a challenge
And whether you are playing on “easy” or “hardcore,” the gameplay is entertaining
Trine 2 also offers a decent amount of increased depth to the character development aspects of the game compared to the first installment of the franchise
There are more abilities and items; and more varied strategies are needed to solve the puzzles
As a direct sequel, the whimsical narrative is continued from the first game and the endearing trio of characters return
Even though it is a direct sequel, though, the story is quite separated from the original
So it won’t be the end of the world if you haven’t played the first game; but you probably should because it is also fantastic
Also the option of playing in cooperative mode adds an additional layer of possibilities, as the unique gameplay of the Trine series is a joy to experience with friends
So like I did with the first game, I would say that Trine 2 is worthy of your consideration regardless of your standard preferences

TRINE 2: COMPLETE STORYA majestic platform puzzle game with a dash of action
Rating 6/10It’s similar in many ways to the classic Shadow of the Beast series and The Lost Vikings
You take control of one of three heroes, a wizard, thief and knight, whilst being able to character swap at any time even mid jump
 It's this fluid change from styles in the middle of battle or solving a puzzle that adds another dimension to what could turn into fairly simplistic gameplay
There are times when it doesn't work such as having your thief or knight die and only being left with a wizard who is rather useless in a fight
However there are enough character reviving checkpoints that it doesn't become too much of an annoying handicap
Despite being a fairly traditional side scrolling platform game it's a truly beautifully made game, in artistic terms it's near perfect
It's this beauty coupled with the fun physics puzzles and quick action that keeps you playing as the plot is non-existent and the voice acting is weak
The DLC adds a few new environments such as dusty desert and the inside of a giant worm and whilst every bit as stunning as the main game by this stage Trine 2 has overstayed it's welcome and it's a fairly boring slog through the last seven extra levels
The DLC doesn't add any real new mechanics or gameplay, it’s just more of the same
So whilst trine 2 doesn't offer much in the way of innovative gameplay or a great story it's beauty has to be seen

												This game is a proof that 2D gaming is not dead at all
The game is beatiful, the artwork the colors and design
The way you have to go is linear (to the right),  but to make it there you will find a lot of puzzles and obstacles
You control 3 characters, each one with different talents to learn, and abilities to use
you will need them 3 to get through the puzzles the game presents
The game is not short, it will take you a good time to get to the end
And even if you do, you will not have unlocked all your abilities
After you finish it you will most likely try to complete it on the hard difficulty, and get all the collectibles
After you find every single collectible item, you will be able to play the locked levels
The most fun I had with the game is playing with my brothers
The online play on this game is amazing, as you will find the three characters at the same time, interacting with each other
Pros: Beautiful game amazing graphics, tricky puzzles that don't get repetitive, as they are always different
Great online play
I recommend it, as it's a very enjoyable experience
Cons: Sometimes getting through the game to find collectibles can be a pain
The game is not perfect, there are ways to 'cheat' and skip puzzles, specially on multiplayer mode
Try not to find gameplay guides and videos, they will probably show you the wrong way

												This game surely has the potential to be translated into English
Plot: 10/10Don't want to spoil this game too much so please check for yourself
Music: 10/10Never expected such high quality music to appear in a Chinese IF game!!! Shocked by the first several tunes
Last time I was shocked by a game's BGM was in undertale


Gameplay: 8
5/10Noval idea and brilliant language tricks, also some surprises which expand the depth of this game in mid-late game, but is a little bit repetitive
Overall: 9/10Extraordinary plot, amazing music, interesting puzzles, diggable lore
-0
5 some of the choices are not so 'logical' on a second thought
+1 The music and text coordinate so well in this game, creating a highly immersive experience
-0
5 could have more branches and endings, maybe add them in a DLC? In conclusion, if you are a fan of traditional interactive fiction games, or games like undertale/papers, please where you have to make a lot of choices, this game will surely give you something very familiar yet very different
			
Posted: 7 June
												An innovative game of considerable quality with a fresh take on interactive fiction
With little of the repetitive clicking that we so often see in IF, the story and dialogue are highly compact, even to someone as impatient as me
That said, the story is by no means bland or simple
It is an immersive, engaging tale that manages to weave in charismatic characters with diverse, yet believable backgrounds and distinct personalities that develop as the game progresses
Given the game's nature (branching outcomes, multiple character stories progressing in parallel, leaps in time, mysteries and sci-fi etc
), I am rather amazed at how the stories manage to connect and intertwine with minimal flaws in logic
There are certain segments that I feel could be more meaningful/could be further explored, but personally I do find the story to be set at a comfortable pace
The game is peppered with countless CGs of very high quality throughout
I am not an expert when it comes to art/design, but I did appreciate the attention to detail that helped show more of the characters and the story setting
Music and voice-acting is pretty great too
Each story piece (represented by a square block) has multiple outcomes but there is often a "true" or "best" outcome which is required for the next piece to open up
The more text pieces to manipulate, the more combinations, hence the more outcomes that have to be created
This means that many outcomes tend to feature only a minimal change in detail, although it is understandable given the tight budget and the sheer number of outcomes that have to be created
Fortunately, alternative outcomes do contain interesting "what-if" scenarios, CGs and/or information that are otherwise not found in the "true" one, so there is still some value in exploration
That said, this game is in no way perfect
The gameplay, while fairly creative, does get a bit dry and repetitive halfway through
Sometimes, it is difficult to follow the author's logic ("why is it that rearranging the text in this sequence results in this ending?")
The overuse of the illusion of choice also cheapens the outcome occassionally
There are also a few bugs, although nothing that seriously interrupts gameplay
As an IF game, its innovation is notable; as a Chinese indie game, its quality (art, music, voice acting) sets a good standard; however, it still lacks polishing here and there
On overall, it is a worthy purchase for one to kill time
It also shows the tremendous potential Chinese indie games and IF games possess
I truly hope that an English translation can come out soon so that I can recommend it to my English-speaking friends

												My first comment goes to this one
This game is not so common in steam but more welcomed in eastern culture
The gameplay is using choices to control the fate to the character or characters to lead to several ending
The uniqueness of this one is the choice is to switch the sequence of two peoples' talks
And you can easily see their choices of talks will affect the fate of theirs and others from the tree diagram
Sometimes S level choice might not always lead to the best results
The story is interesting and the music is quite beautifully done to be in tune with the mood
I have always been a fan of such type of game
I have seen some examples in Japanese games
This one is Chinese
Well done
But, there is always a but, some of the lines might not very much logical
It happens because the line will be switched between different situations
In order to get all the trophies and badges, it could be repetitious to a certain extent
Still I will recommend it
The only thing is that it would very difficult to translate into English, I suppose
			
Posted: 16 June
												A creative gameplay system coupled with the intriguing and touching story line
The music and CGs in the game are also extremely well made
I would definitely recommend this to people who are interested in mystery/story driven games
However, as of now, the game is only available in Chinese
I look forward to an English patch of the game, so I can recommend it to my friends who do not speak Chinese
All in all, I give it a "whatareyouwaitingforjustfreakingbuyit/10"!

												Looking forward to seeing the English and French versions of this game, even though the very concept of the game makes the translation considerably difficult
Meanwhile, a little review in English for those who would be intrigued by the concept!---Intrigued by the original design of this game, I played the Chinese version and was very pleasantly surprised
The principle of the game is unique, you play a goddess with a supernatural power: inverting the order of words in the letters that you receive from desperate characters who ask for help, and by this, changing the meaning of the sequence of words, and thus the course of past events and the fate of these same characters
You receive letters as you go and you discover at the same time the interwoven stories full of adventures of dozens of characters with entirely different social background, age, profession and nationalities
The characters are very interesting and endearing and the story rich, magical, dark sometimes yet still full of humanity
I recommend it to all visual nouvel enthusiasts or those who are looking for original stories without being afraid to read tons of dialogue :)The +:- Very interesting characters- Rich and touching stories- Original and interesting gameplay- Beautiful CG & OSTThe - :- Maybe too many dialogues for those who are not used to it- Obligation to re-read the same dialogues while trying several different solutions- The game could become a bit repetitive after a few hours- Solutions are not always logical- The ending (the story of the "goddess") is a little disappointing

Posted: 14 September
												Oh my god the references! There's so much nostalgia here for me
I grew up in the period this game is set, so there's so many toys and other junk that I recognize
That aside, this game is, SO FAR, fantastic
If it keeps this level of quality that I've had in the first hour, then it's going to be one of my all-time favourite point/click adventure games
The music, the visuals, the humor! And the hidden achievements! I just got an achievement for trying to feed the Bubsy poster a pet treat
The result was hilarious
EDIT: I've just finished ACT 1, which is currently all that's available
Here's my thoughts on my experience:I'm sure if you only spent your time solving puzzles, you could beat it in about 20 minutes
But that's not what I did
I spent as much time as possible using every object and action on everything else even to the point where I got an achievement for trying to use a pigeon on 30 different objects
3 hours later, I was very satisfied with the experience, and I will probably play through it again tomorrow to try different object interactions
I hope ACT 2 doesn't take too long to release
If you're looking for reviews of specific things or whatever, then here you go
Visuals: Very familiar to Homestuck fans
Some camera errors that don't impede gameplay that I'm sure will be fixed soon
Audio: The soundtrack is stuck in my head
UI: The top bar can get in the way of some puzzles, so if you're stuck, maybe try minimizing it while you look around
On the subject, there is no highlight on the interactable objects (aside from your cursor changing when hovering over), which I feel was actually a good choice
When you discover some funny writing by doing something like, as a previous example, feeding a pet treat to a Bubsy poster, it feels all the more special by the knowledge that the game didn't explicitly try to tell you there was stuff you could do with it at all
Stability: Well, in all the time I played it, it didn't crash
That's something
Story/Writing: Top quality writing
The story definitely seems to be accessible to people who have never read Homestuck
In fact, I think it will make those people go and start reading it

I don't write reviews often so maybe I've missed something you want to know

Posted: 14 September
												I can't, in good faith, recommend the game in its current state due to constant visual artifacts that slowly lead the game to be borderline unplayable (primarily that the entire view of the game will be shifted too far to the left or right)
As soon as it gets patched I've got a strong feeling this will change to a positive review
EDIT:Just had confirmation that these issues happen due to the wrong resolution being set when you first launch the game
If you immediately restart the game after changing resolution you wont run into any of these issues
What I didn't realize was also an issue is that if you dont restart the game not only do you get a displaced window but extreme letterboxing
			
Posted: 14 September
												Alright, I've been waiting for this game for a LONG and arduous time, so you know it's gotta be good for me to recommend it
Pros:- Really good humor and writing(I would say it's as good as Homestuck's Andrew Hussie's, if not as eclectic)
- Excellent soundtrack
- Amazing art, tons of unique animations and cutscenes for even tiny stuff
- Attention to detail, both in gameplay and text
However, I feel like this might have harmed the game's length, check below for what I mean
- Vast breadth and depth of references that are subtle enough to not be cringey (and in fact would go over most players' heads, there were even humanimals references), but recognizable enough to still make you smirk
- Good worldbuilding and setup, I can see future acts having a really good plot
- Very, very good characters
I wish Jude could have been fleshed out more, but I guess that's for Hauntswitch so I can't complain!Cons:- Music transitions are buggy, especially around strifes
Volume is also extremely inconsistent across rooms, even compared to sound effects
Seems more of a programming issue than anything related to sound design, however
- Weird "hitboxes" for items, and a few "conflicts" between movement and interaction
Particularly, having to use an item on a door was unexpected, considering the icon didn't change from the regular movement icon when you hovered over it with the item, and the fact using items on transitions was unprecedented
- ANY button skips stuff, even the screenshot button
A nitpick, but an annoying one
- Relatively short, took me three hours while taking my time
I would have vastly preferred a bigger amount of interactions between the characters over item combination/interaction text, which I enjoyed, but wouldn't deliberately seek out
That said, this is no big deal: I have to remember it's only Act 1
- It's just too easy
I got stuck one time, and that was with the door incident I mentioned above
I definitely don't want an obscurely frustrating experience like with some old adventure games, but I feel like the only times the game made you use your head were ruined by the fact you got unasked hints for them right afterwards
Maybe make the hints optional in future acts?Conclusion: 8
5/10
A very fun adventure game, and a great Homestuck experience (if you're into that), but a bit too easy and too short to be perfect
I hope future acts make you think a bit more often
I can recommend it to everyone who enjoys adventure games, and it's definitely a must-play for Homestuck fans

 Target Audience:   Danganronpa/Story Driven Fans, or surprisingly, Puzzle enthusaists  Summary:  Let me get this out of the way: if you haven't played Danganronpa 1 and 2 at this point: well you should probably do that before you play Ultra Despair Girls
It's not that you can't get anything out of this game if you play it alone: but it's SO much better after playing the first two games
And those two games are fantastic
While Ultra Despair Girls tries to spice things up with a new gameplay style, it's the iconic and fascinating story is the reason that you should pick up the game
The spin off takes the story in a new direction but not only keeps a lot of the themes from the original, but adds a more character relationship driven angle with Toko and Komaru which really REALLY works
The angle with the kids takes the series to new creepy depths, and if you were concerned that the game who pull punches with the new characters involved: you'd be dead wrong
It can be down right disturbing at times in the right way, causing you to shudder in your seat
The gameplay however doesn't do as well
The basic shooting doesn't play to its own strengths, as the generic gameplay and lack of AI complexity keeps it from being interesting
It's got a bunch of tools, but it doesn't use them well in the main gameplay
Frankly, its the worst part of the game
When it switches to a more puzzle like format: that's where it starts to get a lot better: as thinking about how you use each bullet to kill all the Monokuma's at once
It's all a case of wasted potential, as the tools here could have been used to really work in a Survival Horror type setting
The presentation is pretty good (for a vita port), and the port itself is great performance wise,  although has some options missing that I would want
The voice work is good, and the music work is great despite being all over the place genre wise
Overall, Danganronpa series fans have to pick up this game because well, the story is worth it
And if you aren't a fan of the series as of yet, even though it's not the best way to get into it, it can do the job for someone who ABSOLUTELY NEEDS action gameplay
Video Review:  https://www
youtube
com/watch?v=muDSpdQX0tE Lists: Positives: The Story keeps the themes of the original series, but takes them in a new interesting direction with more traditional dystopian/survival elements
They kept the lore in tact without going completely off the rails
This feels like a Danganronpa story
The Star of the show is the relationship and complexity that develops between Toko and Komaru
They play off each other well, and the growth of both characters is fascinating to watch
The world is built on in a lot of good ways, and does a good job of bridging several of the holes in the plot up to this point
 Pushes your uncomfortable meter in good ways
Can legimately get under your skin and make you wonder if the villians/heroes are justified
Kudos to the writing
 The kids characters
All of them are rather well done
 Very clever references to the original game, and makes fans who pay attention really appreciate the tight narrative here
 The tools for the gameplay have interesting concepts, and if they were assembled better, it would make for some good gameplay
(More on this later)  Character design and artwork is still superb, doing well in giving little details about the characters while still having a style to it
 60 FPS will drops every so often, but not more then 4/5 frames
Does support up to 4K in Fullscreen (although really, you're not going to notice it that much) All controllers are supported that I tried
Including a default configuration for the Steam controller!Negatives: The standard shooting is rather repetitive and doesn't do well in constructing interesting scenarios to keep the player entertained
 The enemy AI is pretty gosh darn horrible
Will constantly run into walls, and is able to be easily exploited
This added to your speed makes even the hardest difficulty



a reasonable cake walk
 The 3D models don't do well in complementing the emotional elements of the story
The Animation/3D cutscenes conflict with each other
 Note, my main machine could not play via the keyboard/mouse controls due to …

something causing the game to auto rotate the camera and not allow me to use the virtual directions
The thing is, this problem was not seen on a second machine, and seems to be some directx/other issue
Keep it in mind as you may have to refund the game if you run into this problem
 Some of the deaths this time around don't have that much of an impact due to the format chosen here
 The strength of Toko almost undoes Komaru's character at times
Side characters sorta get overlooked from the “good” side
Don't like the split of options here with the launcher and the in game options
Missing bindable keys, which for a third person shooter, is sorta a big feature to miss
 
Posted: 27 June
												I finished the game at 100%
See last section for the final conclusions:Very early review of the game
First of all: DONT PLAY THIS GAME BEFORE DANGANRONPA 1 OR SUPER DANGANRONPA 2, because it will sure spoil the story
About the port:For now I have only played the prologue, but the game looks very good and has not any performance issues
You can clearly see how everything in game has been remastered for higher resolutions; the only thing that is a bit lacking are the 3D cutscenes which still seem a bit bad, although in my opinion that is not an issue because they are good enough
I have not tested the keyboard+mouse control, but given that the game is a third-person shooter, it sure will feel better, I migh even change later, although you can use the a controller without any problems
UPDATE: I have been playing with Keyboard+Mouse and I prefer it over controller
The only downside is that there are not customizable keybindings, althought the default ones are pretty good
About graphical options, in my opinion the game has enough
You can customize in the launcher of the game if you want to display it borderless window or fullscreen along with other graphical options like antialiasing
Something I noticed is the lack of V-sync option on Fullscreen mode, but I didnt see any tearing so its okay
About the game itself:This game does not follow the same pattern as the two ones before (simply because the author wanted to make something different lol) and instead of a trial-murder-puzzle game, is a fps with some hack-and-slash
Even so, the game keeps the Danganronpa feeling and I think its worth a play if you are fan of the series
Storywise is not very important, but give details about what happened between the first and second game and introduces some characters that are then shown in the Danganronpa 3 animation, which ends the Hope's Peak Academy Arc, so if you like the universe absolutely play this
Final conclusions:The game is fine
Recommended if you like the Danganronpa Universe and dont expect nothing like DR1 and SDR2
The port is fine overall, I havent find any bugs nor performance issues
The only con I can say is that its a little easy with keyboard+mouse simply because aiming to the weak point of the enemies is very simple

												A word of warning going into this game, whether you're a Danganronpa fan or not: a lot of the subject matter in this game is WAY darker compared to the first two Danganronpa games, and is pretty dark to average person
You may be saying "Wait, it gets darker than just straight up cold-blooded murder like in the other games?" Yes it does
It's not a deterrant of the game, just a word of warning so that those who play it know what they're getting into
That being said, it's a really solid game
Great storytelling, great characters, a nice blend of serious, bone-chilling semi-horror and almost 4th-wall breaking silliness
It's absurdIt's (somewhat) scary (in a cartoonish kind of way)It's fanservice-y at timesIt's Danganronpa!Hope to see you aboard Kazutaka Kodaka's Wild Ride!			
Posted: 27 June
												An incredibly solid third-person shooter / puzzle game filled to the brim with all the things I love about Danganronpa and more
I highly recommend the keyboard + mouse controls, because the mouselook camera is fantastic and makes the game incredibly satisfying
Also, Genocide Jack has no qualms showing off her panties mid-fight, so that's a plus
			
Posted: 1 July
												If you haven't played Danganronpa 1 and 2 yet, do not play this game
Saying that, if you're a fan of the Danganronpa story or puzzles, you'll enjoy Danganronpa Another Episode
			
Posted: 27 June
												After all this time for a PC port was it worth the wait?Yes!This is definitly worth it to anyone having enjoyed danganronpa before and while the shooting isn't spectaculair danganronpa plays to its strengths with its writing and atmosphere while forming a connection between the first 2 games
I do advise that while having played the previous games isn't required, it will add so much more to your experience if you did and they are definitly worth checking out
			
Posted: 29 July
												Score: 6
5/10Time to 100%: 20 hoursOne just for the fans
PROS:Story - Amongst the Danganronpa series this game has easily the darkest of the storylines, for reasons such as torture, betrayal, murder, sexual abuse and all for the most part involving children no less
It is a pleasure (or displeasure?) to play thorugh if only to see how things turn out for the characters involved and its the primary reason to play through this game
Characters- The characters in the game - specifically the bad guys - are fascinating individuals in their own right
They're full of different neurosis and demented backgrounds
Their history is unravlled through their breakdowns and from books scattered throughout the game shedding some light on why they are just so f'ed up
There's also the appearance of a very special someone
CONS: Gameplay- It's pretty basic third-person shooter fare with substandard level designs with poor looking graphics
Although in all fairness, this is a port of a PS Vita game so just bare that in mind
It's also extremely easy as most enemies in the game will die in one shot if you hit them in the right place, even on the hardest difficulty
Other Characters - So in the pros I had mentioned that the BAD guys are the interesting characters
That's because for the most part the good guys, namely the two main characters are not interesting AT ALL
Let's start with Toko
I never liked her in the first game and I still don't like her now
She's whiny, neurotic, annoying and insulting pretty much all the time and while they try to give her some kind of character development it falls far too short as she's still just as irritating as she's always been
Then there's the main character who is so bland and boring that they constantly make jokes about this fact again and again
We get it, you're normal and boring, okay great
So in conclusion, play this for the great story and certain characters if you're a fan of the series
As it is worthy of a playthrough and fills in some of the gaps between the first and the second game
And need a fix before Danganronpa 3 comes out!			
Posted: 27 June
												Make sure you've played the rest of the Danganronpa series before playing this
Otherwise, you'll get unwanted spoilers (and it also might not make as much sense)
Technically this game takes place between Danganronpa 1 & 2, but it all feels more fluid if you save this one for last imo
Keep in mind that this game is very different than the other two
It's more of a puzzle/FPS so it's more interactive in terms of gameplay
There are no trials, and the flow of the story is more fast paced
It's still a solid game with solid mechanics and helps round out the story from the other games
			
Posted: 28 June
												As with many spinn-offs this game is made first and foremost for fans of original serie, it heavy relys on player to be familiar with at least first game
So to put it out of the way1) People unfamiliar with Danganronpa games, don't buy it
Or buy a bundle with all 3 games
2) People who played Danganronpa games: if you like those games and want to know more about lore, charecters and whatnots, buy it
3) Hardcore fan? Absolutely must have for you
Plot:Player takes controll of Komaru Naegi (sister of Makoto) and fanfavorite Toko (aka Genosider Se)
Another Episode takes place between 1 and 2 games, and follows events prior to second one
Without too much spoilers; the story itself is the strongest side of this game -- shouldn't come as a surprise
Nice twists, great addition to first game, likeble charecters, humor and drama


Danganronpa!Gameplay:For the majority of the game you will play as Komaru armed with hacking gun (looks like megaphone) and in her case game pretty much is a mediocre TPS: sure game tries to keep you entertained, tosses new enemies now and then and hacking gun have a variety of diffrent ammo -- 8 types to be precise,  each more effective against certan enemies (for example knockback will swat shields from hands of monokumas with said shields, dance will make monokumas dance -- but use it against siren one and every enemy in vicinity will gather around him etc)
The second charecter is Toko Fukawa, you can switch to her and play as Genosider Se for a short periods (she doesn't have health instead it's battery


Think of her as your super mode), slice and dice Monokumas with signature sccisors, use extremely fun blood lust moves, take it back and relax for a while
Still gameplay is very weak, enemies are slow, fragile and come in small groups (on max difficulty I expereinced exactly zero challenge from them)
So yeah a mediocre TPS with boring slasher tossed inbetween
Oh right there are also chalenges and puzzles!  Again not a bad way to keep player entetained, does bring variety, and developers tried their best to make those puzzles and chalenges diffrent, but to be honest those puzzles and challenges will became a chore somewhere around third Chapter


They are easy


One or two may have an intresting concept and fun solution, but majority is kindergarten level
Still, guss it wouldn't be Danganronpa without a little mind excercise now and then
OST and sound: As always Danganronpa provides a good music and decent sound design
English dub still sucks -- switch to Japanese as soon as you can (to do that press C on keyboard\Y on controller on difficulty chose screen)
Overall not much to say
In conclusion
It is a game for fans of serie, don't buy unless you played previous games, buy if you are a fan or simply a person who is intrested in this universe
Sure gampelay is not the strongest side of game, but story, charecters and mystery will sure keep you on your toes till the end

Posted: 23 September, 2016
												Mad Father is a Wolf Editor Horror Game (think of it similar to an RPG Maker Horror Game) which originally released in 2012 (and was translated into English in 2013)
This Steam release marks a rework of the game with an overall nicer layer of polish & some new content
I've only dabbled in the Steam release a bit at the time of writing to compare some early game differences, but I had played the game & gotten every ending back with the freeware version
I'll start off this review with a general review of the game itself, followed then a mention of some of the new content & early game differences
-----GENERAL REVIEW:-----The game follows the story of Aya Drevis, a young 11-year old girl who lives in an expansive mansion with her father, Alfred, & their maid, Maria
Aya is aware that her father does somewhat cruel experiments with a chainsaw to people in their mansion basement, but she still loves her father all the same
She has seen his good traits and love he gives to her as his daughter
However, one night she awakens to some odd sounds, & finds shambling corpses and other strange beings wandering the mansion with murderous intent
A curse has been put upon the mansion from the countless people Aya's father has slaughtered, & now the dead walk among them seeking revenge on the Drevis family
The only way to escape now & save your dad is to lay these spirits to rest, either through forgiveness or force
Mad Father gained a strong cult following for good reason, it has a number of creative & interesting varied scenarios despite its simple nature, ranging from puzzles, to light stealth, story, exploration, minigames, & backed with good gothic atmosphere with just a hint of the fantastical
While the main setting of the game is a Mansion, you quickly begin to descend in it, finding surreal labyrinths with intricate detail & interesting elements to each room
Some play a role in gameplay, others are simply interesting to look at
As you explore you'll come to face a number of challenges & entities who want you and your dad dead
You must find a way to put the spirits at rest, & make your way to your father deep in his underground labs
Along the way there is a colorful cast of odd characters you learn more about, & a number of side-quests off the beaten path you can partake in (they're optional to complete the game, but needed to get the true ending, though of note is the whole mansion is explorable even at the end of the game, you can go all the way back to the starting room of the game from the final room of the game)
While the story isn't surprising, it is well-told and full of charisma
Aya is a likable protagonist and her relationship with her twisted father is interesting, & the members of the core cast and their interconnecting relationships are just as interesting (if not more so)
The journey is engaging all the way through if you're into these 2D RPG-Horrors, & will easily give you a good 3-6 hours of playtime (depending on how much you explore, how many endings you go for, do 'optional' stuff or not, etc)
It has a charm to it simply due to its tone, a mixture of a Victorian-styled setting & characters combined with a more modern twisted sci-fi mad scientist doctor via our father and the gruesome undead experiments of his, forging a sort of scientifically twisted vs supernaturally malicious scenario
It's an interesting contrast that creeps its way into various aspects of the game I just find wholly fascinating
I will mention while the game has some good atmosphere, it isn't all that scary, nor is it trying to be
There is the occasional moment or scene, but the game aims more to unsettle you as a mood-piece with a central interconnected narrative and attract you with elements of intrigue, abstractness, & feeling to set a tone than to startle or even shock you
This said, some of the scenes are rather tense and creepy
If you're into the scene of 2D Horror games that came from the like of Wolf Editor and RPG Maker, this one is definitely worth checking out if you haven't before
-----FOR THOSE WHO'VE PLAYED BEFORE:-----But then for those who have played it before, you may ask yourselves, "What's new here? What makes this worth $5 compared to the previously free version?"The first thing you'll probably notice as you play is the graphics have been updated in almost every room of the game
Some rooms have been changed drastically with completely new layouts & details; they hardly resemble the rooms from the original
Others just have nice new touches that help bring them more alive & add character
In the mansion at the beginning there wasn't a room I encountered that hadn't seen some sort of overhaul, and the touches look very nice! Along with the new spritework, there is also a few new pictures that pop up during cutscenes to give more life to them & the previous pictures have been revamped to look much nicer
Also has new enemy sprites, better sprite animation & details, more detailed death scenes, & other touch-ups
For an example of the graphical difference, here's a comparison of Aya's Room: Aya's Room (Original Game): https://66

pngAnd so far, most rooms have been drastically redone like this
The game had to get rid of things it couldn't use for commercially, with the element that stands out the most being the music
Most of the original OST is present, but there are a few new original music tracks in this version of Mad Father in-place of the few unusable songs they had
I've only heard a couple new songs thus far, but I like them! They fit the game nicely & don't feel out of place
I may even like them more than the originals
The game also has some new ease of use elements
Aya now will have exclamations pop over her head when near things she can interact with or investigate
Items glitter now to stand-out, so you don't have to observe everything just to find key items hidden in shelves or the like, & the hit-detection feels much better & smoother than before
The UI/Menu is completely reworked, & the QTEs the game previously had have a new gameplay style where instead of rapidly pressing a button, you now must press a series of buttons before time runs out (with an improved UI element as well)
While I can't speak in full length as I haven't quite beaten the new version of the game, there are some new dialogue & scenes in the game
There is some changes to the layout of the locations as I said before, some new areas as a result
The dev has also said there's some new optional side-stories to uncover, new scenes, & some of the gems have been relocated
There's also a new "IF" option on the title screen, which is unlocked once you get the True Ending (not sure what it is, tho)
Game also comes with the Steam features of Trading Cards & achievements (which there's a 27 of)
Some may not find the new all that new, but it's made revisiting this game a joy for me so far, and as I loved the original I don't mind putting down some money for a revamped version with some new paint & some additional content to support future endeavors
-----OVERALL:-----While some may want to stick to the free version for its 'freeness', I think this version of Mad Father is an overall improvement which will be the best way to experience the game for either new players or fans of the original
Maybe not the huge expansion some may have hoped for, but the much more detailed & realized world along with the various additions, changes, & fixes all feel in-line with the vision of the original game while in my opinion steadily improving on it
Mad Father had a cult audience & will find new fans
If these type of games interest you, I do think is wholly worth checking out

												Took me a while to play this because there were some critical bugs during release day, but the devs worked hard to fix everything up
Now, this is the premium version of Mad Father which is not just a straight re-release of the free version, but an upgraded one (in many ways, I'm told)
Better graphics, better level design, better everything
It's a really tight experience without any filler and with an interesting story, so any fans of RPGMaker-type horror games will find this a highly enjoyable experience
You can also increase the game's window size, so don't worry if you're running a high-resolution display
This is a feature that is not exactly common for these types of games, but this game has got you covered
I'm looking forward to future games from the dev!			
Posted: 24 September, 2016
												Totally worth it
I bought it more to thank the developers for all those nights that made me scary when it was free
			
Posted: 25 September, 2016
												Man, this is even scarier than original



We need Misao remake as well!			
Posted: 29 December, 2016
												The description on its Steam page is actually you need to know before you start playing the game
The whole gameplay is just as interesting as my first impression of it when I first saw the title and the capsule art
It's so fun and immersive that I didn't even notice I've been playing this for over seven hours already
Mad Father is about a crazy family
You play the role of Aya Drevis, a ten year old daughter of a mad scientist
Despite being aware of her father's inhumane hobby, Aya still loves and respects him
The story begins at midnight of her mother's death anniversary who, according to her father, died of an illness
While attempting to sleep, she heard her father scream for help, and she is determined to come to his rescue
However, the further she goes, the more she learns about her father's nature
There's not much to say about the story
It is fairly straightforward and even predictable
That's not to say that the story wasn't good
In fact, knowing how it unfolds adds to the excitement because the gameplay is almost the story in and of itself
Every character is very likeable except the father, although the father still has a reasonable motive behind his actions
There's no other word to describe him other than 'Mad', which stays true to the title of the game
While the gameplay is a masterpiece, the selling point of this game is the art
I must say that it was what made me want to get this game in the first place, and it didn't let me down
The game was an eyecandy until the end despite the dark and gore theme
The music was also very ambient
I honestly did not notice the background music, and that's a good thing
That means it was a part of story
Overall, This is one of the games where the story, gameplay, art, and music all work together seamlessly
I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to everyone regardless of your taste in games
Besides, who doesn't want to be a little girl whose weapon of choice is a chainsaw?

												This game's been available for a few years for free, but it was easily worth a price tag all along
I'm very glad to be able to support the developers after all this time
It's a short-but-sweet, but nonetheless excellent, story driven adventure puzzler of sorts
A real gem for anyone that is a fan of horror or slashers

												One of the most enjoyable RPG games I've played in a while
Though the jump scares weren't anything to sneeze at, the music and atmosphere that it brought really brought the game together as a horror RPG
I adore the sprite animations, and I really enjoyed the 'If' Ending because it was refreshing to step into another character's shoes, if only for a brief moment
This game has fantastic replay value and the achievements are manageable for even the less seasoned players
I got so frustrated my first play through when I ruined my chances of a True Ending because I didn't properly explore, but it was so fun starting over again to guarantee the ending that I wanted to experience
Overall, it's a well made, beautifully atmospheric game that's very afforrdable to play if you're really not sure about the style!

This



one messed up game





but that isn't necessarily a bad thing
Yet another gem on Steam that unfortunately many would let slip by
Personally, I couldn't recommend it enough, due to the resonable pricetag for all what its worth as an experience
The game, had one of the most original and unique plots I've ever come across in a top down RPG game
I personally was so engaged and moved by the storyline that I just couldn't find the leeway on leaving the game half way through without having curiousity lingering in my mind
Consequently, I managed to finish the entire game in straight 5-7 hours, collecting all the achievements whilst emphasizing on the comprehension of dialogue and minor details to get the perfect grasp on what the game had offered and truly, it was worth it
By the end of the game, my experience regarding the game was unsettling due to the disturbing plot and the many twists that it had as per the progression in game but regardless of that, they were part of the escapade which was, dare I say, amusing
Mad Father, as the title goes by is a psychological horror that offers exceptional soundtracks for every scenario in the game, an atmospheric top down level design, minor puzzles, simple controls and grotesque material / content in compliance with an innovative yet captivating plot
It comprises of multiple endings for which the choice is to be made at the very end of the game for the subsequent ending
Final summation
A fine indie rpg,  purely a bang for the buck, twisted yet fascinating

												This is one of the games I bought without hesitating and thinking if it's worth it
I remember playing free version about 3 years ago and I enjoyed the story and all the spooky moments, so I was pretty happy to see that it's been remastered and made it to steam
And to be honest this version is way better than the original, not only visually, but because it got some additions to the storyline
If you enjoy horror rpgmaker games that have beautiful graphics and a nice story with some plot twists, then you'll certainly enjoy this game
Storyline is quite short and takes a couple of hours to run through, but it's certainly worth it's price

												As a senior citizen, I like this game because:it engages my mind rather than my reflexesit follows a consistent set of rulesit has large and clear fonts for readingit has clearer outlines for placement of objectspuzzles are mostly deciperable through observation and logictolerances for clicking are good enough for my impaired handsThis puzzle game requires some understanding of how to break up problems into small parts that are solved and and recombined into larger solutions
The challenges are:placement of wires and parts onto a grid with a limited board writing small amounts of computer codeworking out how to get parts to communicate with each otherI find this game to being very enjoyable

Early Access Review
								it's a Zachtronics game; he / they own the programming puzzle game catagory and if you are a fan of TIS-100, this game will not disappoint
 Out of the Zachtronics game library, this one seems most like TIS-100, but with more variety
If you already played SpaceChem and want more from the same developer, play this game
 If you liked TIS-100 and want more, play this game
 If you haven't played any of them, I'd tell you to play SpaceChem first, then this one, and if you like this one, to go back to TIS-100
 There are other Zachtronic games that are good and all are worth trying, but I'm pointing out the two that had the most impact on me
 Infinifactory and Ironclad Tactics are good, but Ironclad Tactics is completely different, and the graphics / UI / control of Infinifactory made it more cumbersome to play (I still played a lot of it though)
Out of all the Zachtronic games, the interface of this one feels the most polished

Early Access Review
								This is one of those cases where I really wish there was a more neutral option for recommendations, as it pains me to bring down the score of a Zachtronics game, and for people who already know how to code this is a game I would 100% recommend
Personally I found it overwhelming in the extreme, because the way in which the manual is written assumes you already have a base level of competence with programming, and there is absolutely no effort made within the game to familiarise you with practical implementations of the functions the manual describes
If you're after a game that might teach you a bit about programming, this is not it
Spacechem is my favourite game of all time, and Infinifactory is not far behind, but if Zach intends to make his future projects as unwelcoming and opaquely explained as TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O, this is simply a path down which I cannot follow him
I very much hope that his next game might cut neophytes like myself some slack, otherwise I guess I'm done with my favourite developer
Edit: I deliberately kept my playtime low to keep the possibility of a refund open (one I've since taken up), however I spent at least an hour poring over the manual before even booting the game up, and closed and restarted the game many times after consulting the manual to try and come up with a solution
I gave it much more than 30 minutes of my time, but it just didn't click with me
And before giving this a thumbs down, please keep in mind that 'Did you find this helpful?' is not synonymous with 'Do you share this person's assessment of the product and find that the level of enjoyment they derived from it closely matches your own?'Edit 2: This review has attracted way more attention than I had anticipated
It was written quickly on a first-and-last-impressions sort of basis, so I didn't go into much detail
At this stage I feel I have a duty to provide more context about myself and how this affects my enjoyment of the game
An argument could be made that I was stupid for buying this after having difficulty with TIS-100
I bought SHENZHEN I/O because it was made clear that TIS-100 was a side project created for a very niche audience, and the visually dreary interface itself reinforced this
From the trailer, SHENZHEN I/O seemed like it would have much broader appeal - an attractive interface that made use of the mouse, the usual great Zachtronics music, actual promotion in the lead-up to its release
I thought that, while employing similar concepts to TIS-100, it would make them more accessible
I was wrong
And it's possible that assembly programming mightn't ever be something I find accessible
Personally, I suck with numbers
I hate them
As it turns out, assembly programming deals with almost nothing but numbers
I didn't go into this blind, however - I had a quick look at what assembly programming looked like, and, true to my username, I made an erroneous assumption: I assumed that the numbers were not used in the sense of value but, rather, purely as symbol
For example, in a sudoku puzzle, the numeral 9 doesn't actually represent a quantity of nine units, it's just a symbol interchangeable with any other character which simply represents a guarantee that there are certain other places in the grid within which it cannot appear
In the context of assembly, I assumed it would work on the basis of 0 representing an off position and 1 representing an on, and similarly simple functions
Numbers can function in this way, however they also often need to be used in a quantitative context, functioning within complex, infinitely repeating algorithms
If this doesn't sound like your cup of tea, don't bother with SHENZHEN I/O, or assembly programming in general
I got along with Spacechem and Infinifactory because their circuits used sensors which worked on the basis of 'if x = true then do y'
Simple stuff, with which you can make extremely complex devices
Assembly works more on the basis of 'if x = more than n squared divided by acc then do y, else do z'
Complex stuff, with which you can make even more complex devices
I'm sure that someone more experienced could give a far better explanation than that, but I think I at least have the nuts and bolts correct
SHENZHEN I/O requires not just the purely visual logic of Infini/chem (i
e
how do I combine and transport these ready-made products) but numeric logic as well (i
e
how do I make these ready-made products function differently by playing with the digits within them)
One works with objects, while the other works with concepts
I have to reiterate, there is no problem with the game - its standard of presentation is right up there with any other commercial release from Zachtronics and it plays just fine
That said, there is a portion of the Zachtronics audience to whom this game will not appeal, and for whom this game was not made, so I've written this for their benefit
I put it into the 'not recommended' category, not to disparage it, but because I truly would not recommend the game to a person with my tastes
My abilities with programming and numbers in general are not of such a standard that I could write a 'recommended' review which would offer anything more than uselessly facile, vague praise, directed towards an audience I'm unfamiliar with
I instead put it into the category where I could offer honest opinions of my own
			
Posted: 12 March
												I try to complete the circuit but don't have enough space for the components I want to use or lines in the components to write the code I need - RAGE QUIT the game
Can't stop thinking about my failure - what did I do wrong? I can't think about anything else, I get distracted trying to watch TV, I can't sleep properly - I get even more frustrated - I RAGE START the game - no way is this going to beat me - I erase my previous attempt and complete the task with about half the code I was trying to use in the first place
I look at the final completed operational circuit and how blatently simple it actually is and wonder how the hell I didn't figure that out earlier
Many games can frustrate me into rage quitting but very few can frustrate me to return
There is a great deal of sastisfaction in finally completing that task which had caused me to struggle for hours
			
Posted: 25 June
												While I dont have a lot of hours online, I have around 50+ extra hours offline
This game is a complete blast if you enjoy low level programming/assembly
I really enjoyed trying to get the power usage and costs as low as possible
--------------------*SPOILERS*--------------------2 undocumented commands may help you if you plan on purchasing the game putting @ before your instruction makes it so it only uses it once
the second command is, which is a command that generates a pulsing effect, with gen p x y with p being the output, x being how long is stays pulsed, and y being how long it stays unpulsed

												A lot of people's reactions to programming puzzle games are along the lines of "why waste your time in a game when you could be doing actual work?" To be honest, the sentiment is well reasoned
However, what I think these people miss is how much better of a programmer doing puzzles can make you
The key to developing your ability to think algorithmically is to approach familiar problems in new ways
The easiest way to do this is to give yourself arbitrary constraints, such as limiting the data types you allow yourself to use, etc
Putting yourself in tight constraints forces you to think creatively and that skill will put you miles ahead of where you would be if you always took the easy route
A great analogy is the skill guitar players are encouraged by their teachers to develop from day one: learn where all the notes are on each string
When you start out you might not understand how important this skill is, but then one day you watch the video of Jimi Hendrix playing Red House at Woodstock and, after his high-E string snaps, plays one of the most legendary solos of all time with only five strings
Shenzhen I/O is a game that will help you become a better programmer in the same way that learning every note position on the guitar will help you be a better musician
The game, due to its sparse and creatively constrained assembly language, will force you to think outside of the high-level programming box
For example, what is the optimal way to create an AND condition with only IF conditionals and instruction jumps? These types of "arbitrary" constraints are difficult to force yourself into in practice, but the environment of a puzzle game helps alleviate the sense of arbitrariness
Shenzhen I/O, like TIS-100, uses a made up programming language
However, as any third year CS student will tell you, all Turning complete programming languages allow you to compute the same exact things
The real world skills you develop from playing this game are not that of learning a powerful, new language that will make every program you write in the future trivially easy
The skills you gain are the same stated above: an increased ability to think algorithmically
Realizing that CS is a giant tapestry of computable functions and there's more than one way to compute a function is the first step towards becoming a good programmer
Increasing your ability to creatively implement algorithms will help you in the long run more so than sticking with one language and implementation scheme could ever do

Early Access Review
								With our powers combined:  SpaceChem presentation quality
+ SpaceChem reactor placement
+ KOHCTPYKTOP signal inputs/outputs
+ TIS-100 processors and core mechanics
+ Ruckingenur part connections
+ TIS-100 manual
----------------------------
= SHENZHEN I/O
 
Posted: 18 November, 2016
												SHENZHEN I/O is a game that will make you a better engineer
If this appeals to you, read further
Unlike SpaceChem and Infinifactory, which focus on spatial reasoning, SHENZHEN (and its predecessor, TIS-100) dive into coding in assembly
What this loses in presentation, it makes up for in depth: the puzzles generally have more compact solutions, requiring more planning, and almost always require a divide-and-conquer approach to succeed
If this is not your thing, stick to other Zachtronics titles or other puzzle games
If this _is_ your thing and you have yet to play TIS-100, play that first
Puzzles in SHENZHEN will build on the principles of sorting, searching, and solving that you'll learn there
TIS-100 can thus be considered the 100 level course to SHENZHEN's 200 and 300 level courses
Since many of the puzzles in both games are inspired by real algorithms and computer architecture principles, you'll learn a thing or two about how professional software engineering works, too
The biggest improvement over TIS-100 is story and scope
The story is _fantastic_, easily exceeding the writing quality of SpaceChem and Infinifactory (and providing depth and heart that would be too spoilery to describe)
The language and modules give you far more freedom than any other Zachtronics title to date, even allowing you to design your own (TI Calculator-like) games within the game
Seriously, check the forums, those games are amazing
The primary drawback to SHENZHEN I/O is its difficulty and its reliance on the manual (by design)
SHENZHEN is unashamedly not a casual puzzle game -- it is a game that requires investment, paying that investment back in triplicate
If you're a puzzle game affectionado or a programmer looking to expand the limits of what you thought yourself capable of, pick this up
If you made it through TIS-100 and hunger for more, pick this up
Otherwise, sincerely do not buy this unless you are prepared for the challenge

												If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius
I can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal
It's beyond Portal
It takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate
The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain
And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the "main" puzzles
The graphics are fantastic
Landscapes are gorgeous
Controls are perfect
Music is superb
Voice acting is impeccable
Length is ideal
Puzzles are mind-bending
Progression is non-linear
This game might be officially "indie", but its quality is triple A
Or quad A
To call it non-trivial is like to say that a rocket is non-slow
And what's most valuable, is that you don't feel that profits were the top priority for the makers
The game was
The things I love about it the most:• Assisted jumping
Just brilliant
If only Quantum Conundrum had it
• No fake puzzles based on arcade elements
• Weather effects
• I can get as close as I can to a wall and still see no blurred textures
• Wherever I go, I never get stuck in terrain
• Skippable intro movie and sensible menus
• Runs on my Macbook Pro
• Has a free demo
• It's so clever, it feels alive
The things I dislike:• Loud "Death" sequence can give one a pretty good scare when comes unexpected
• It ends
If you like puzzles - buy it
If you like first person games - buy it
If you like philosophy - buy it
If you like lasers - buy it
If you like finding secrets - buy it
If you like clever writing - buy it
If you like computer games - buy it! And if you don't like computer games


You just never played this one :)

												In today’s world of microtransactions, games releasing before they’re finished, glitch-ridden open world engines, and games that overall fail to live up to their artistic vision, sometimes there will come a game that’s so perfect that it’s hard to believe it even got made
The Talos Principle is a single-player puzzle game made with full triple-A production values, arguably leaving Portal 2 in the dust at what it does
I liken it to Dear Esther, but twenty times longer and filled with actual gameplay, while keeping the beauty of the world and the philosophical overtones intact
The game consists of walking through majestic-looking outdoor areas to find closed-off puzzle areas, then solving puzzles using only a small handful of simple and easy-to-understand machines
The puzzles themselves are eloquent and very well-tested
There are over a hundred of them in all, but each puzzle introduces a new idea or uses old ideas in new ways, so they never feel repetitive or stale
The game’s environments are simply breathtaking with their huge draw distances and ridiculous detail, while the puzzle areas feel aptly like claustrophobic rat mazes while never losing the area’s sense of atmosphere
The puzzles get very challenging near the end, but expert level design makes them all very rewarding to solve
And if you’re particularly clever, the game’s third ending requires you to figure out how to break the level design and take items out of their designated areas to find secrets hidden in closed-away or out-of-bounds places
It’s rather mind-blowing and something that I’ve never seen incorporated into a game intentionally before
The icing on the cake is the storytelling
The story is that you’re a robot who wakes up in a garden and follows the commands of a god-like figure constantly talking in your head
It quickly becomes apparent that the whole world may or may not be a virtual reality simulation, which may or may not have been programmed by humans for a specific yet unknown purpose, and you are given the choice of blindly following the god’s orders or trying to unravel the mystery of who exactly you are and what lies outside of the simulation
The game has three different endings, and you will find whatever answer you seek if you search hard enough
The game poses a few difficult philosophical questions and studies them from countless different angles
I know that some people will find the philosophy pretentious and trite, and I know it’s completely up to personal preference, but for me it really, really worked
I was hooked on the story the whole way
I think that even if some of the game’s lines fail to impress you, there’s enough material here that you’ll find at least something that will strike a chord and challenge the way you think
Besides, if you don’t like the story, it’s easy enough to skip everything by ignoring the computers, but you might miss out on the brilliance of some of the game’s endings
I give The Talos Principle a perfect score
It’s got sublime puzzle design, mind-blowing secret collectables, gorgeous environments that put Dear Esther to shame, above-average voice acting, a professionally-written and well-presented story, nearly zero glitches, and depths and depths of content
It’s truly one of the best games I’ve ever played
Go play it if you haven't already; you might come out feeling like a different person

												A computer terminal in the game asked me why I wanted so much to prove I'm human
I spent like 10 minutes thinking, unable to answer
Thought this was just puzzles, ended up on one of the most philosophical rides a game has ever taken me

												HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!"The Talos Principle" is one of the most enjoyable and rewarding gaming experiences I've EVER had and I've been playing video games since the Atari 2600 days
 There is a reason why "The Talos Principle" is a hit among critics and the player reviews are "Overwhelmingly Positve
" For me this is a new classic
A game that catches lightning in a bottle
 One of those games that scratches an itch I didn't even know I had
NOTE: If you think you might get this game, I'd recommend against watching video and looking at player  screenshots
They are both highly likely to contain spoilers and inadvertent puzzle hints, both minor and major
 I only played the demo going into the full game and I feel the experience was better for it
This is a first person, sci-fi themed puzzler in which the player, an artificial intelligence, is left to complete puzzles by using a series of tools that are introduced throughout the game
The first tool is the Jammer, a tool that jams electronic devices and force fields
Another tool connects to and aims laser beams
 You'll also learn that tools can be used in combination, keeping the progression interesting
Solving a puzzle rewards the player with a sigil (tetromino) which are then used as puzzle pieces to unlock new areas when arranged correctly in puzzle mini-games
The only conversational contact the player has is with another AI program that often presents itself at computer terminals as the game progresses
The player is also, through communicating at the terminals and reading information displayed on them, left to ponder the role of the disembodied voice known as "Elohim", as well as the meaning of life, consciousness, being human, being alive, free will, and the afterlife
The game itself is solid
Easy and tight controls
Very nice music, sound effects, and voicework
Clean, often beautiful graphics
Intelligent writing
No profanity or violence
Menus with many options like FOV, character speeds, FPS display, time display (something I never used as I chose to take my time), etc
This is a quality "product" every way I see it and a fantastic game from a company that respects it's PC customers
Many have compared this to the Portal games, which is high praise
While both offer clever puzzles and a high quality experience, "The Talos Principle" only rarely depends on any sort of physical dexterity or reflexes
 With those few puzzles that do require quickly timed movement, even the most casual of players shouldn't have any issues whatsoever
While the presentation and story are high quality, it's really about the puzzles
What makes them so satisfying?  First, puzzles do not need to be finished in an exact order
Leave one alone for a while that you are having trouble with and try again later
 I found it interesting how I'd find myself struggling with a puzzle but after a day or two, the solution would become clear
It was almost "scary" when realizing how hard at work my subconscious was
I would also think about certain puzzles when not playing and come up with new things to try out
 I  found myself overthinking many times when the solution was much simpler
Also, just when I thought I had a handle on a "recipe" that certain types of puzzles used, the game would throw me a curveball, forcing me to deviate from previous "patterns"
Some puzzles, even of the harder variety, can be figured out quickly depending on the player's frame of mind, while "easier" puzzles (those without numerous elements) can be trickier
You know the puzzles are good when you find yourself wanting to do "just one more" before ending a session
 And puzzles can often be completed in more than one way
I found out later that some solutions I used were much much more complicated than they needed to be
This dynamic of overthinking vs
underthinking is what helped make my time with "The Talos Principle" so interesting, as well as thinking out a solution before acting vs
using a lot of trial and error at other times
This game also encourages and rewards exploration
There are stars to collect, which unlock additional content in the form of more puzzles and ultimately an additional ending choice (there's a main ending and two possible side endings)
These stars are often "puzzles within puzzles" and gathering them is rewarding and can be quite challenging
It's not just a matter of "hide and seek"
For example, a star may be within a puzzle and behind a door (force field)
It is up to the player to figure out how to reconfigure his/her solution so that an additional door can be opened
There is also an ample amount of "Easter eggs" to find, many of which are interactive and well worth seeking out
Many are references to other games, like Portal 2 or Papers Please
Pink Floyd is honored with one as well
Keep your eyes wide as you traverse the puzzles and worlds
Even just finding ways to exploit the simulation is fun, for example, finding a way to climb over the outer walls of a puzzle and into "out of bounds" areas (where there are some Easter eggs to find)
Or  "breaking" a puzzle by finding an "unintended route" to the finish by climbing over a wall, or walking above one
(This accounts for a lot of my game time)
"The Talos Principle" should appeal to a wide variety of players
I spent about 80 hours on my first playthrough and a less thorough playthrough will of course take less time
I then replaid  for 100% achievements (which I usually don't do)
I suspect that many of the people finishing Talos in "20 hours" are not doing everything (reading files, getting all stars/doing the puzzles they unlock, looking for easter eggs) and likely to be using a walkthrough here and there
You can play this game as you want
Complete the puzzles in order or don't
Do them fast or slow
Solve star puzzles or don't
Don't read every piece of information at the terminals if the story side of the game doesn't interest you
Look closely for Easter eggs or don't worry about them at all
Try out the side endings or don't
The support is very good with developers active on the Steam forums should anyone have issues and updates have been released to fix and add things (like an added special settings menu for "motion sickness", a speed time function, additional language support, etc
)
This company, Croteam, does it right
You should give them your money just "based on principle
"NOTE: The demo is also good, yet only a taste of the full game
It ofters a solid introduction to gameplay and some clever puzzles
There is even another free game called the "Sigils of Elohim" that is made of tetromino puzzles
Solving them will reward you with codes that are then entered into the menu of "The Talos Principle" for bonuses
These do not change the core game at all but, for instance, you can get stars with these codes
All the regular stars will still be in the game to find
If you get the codes for bonus stars (three in total), you will start with three stars in the full game
So, you'll be free to leave three stars unfound if you wish and still receive the bonus content for finding all of them
In other words, if you start with the bonus stars and then go on to find every star in the game, you will finish with an extra three stars
PS: If you get and finish the game, check out my screenshots if you want (NOT before you play)
Some hint at additional "challenges"
Like getting a picture of the blue man visiting the greedy man and living to tell about it

												A first/third-person puzzle game with beautifully themed environments and captivating original soundtrack
You solve world puzzles to collect Sigils (Tetris pieces, essentially), and you use those collected Sigils in Sigil puzzle locks (which unlock doors or new puzzle mechanics
) To solve a lock you must arrange the Sigils in a preset rectangular pattern
Along with Sigils there are collectable stars which are used to unlock more difficult content
The stars themselves are often fairly difficult to collect, but are very satisfying
The game plays at your own pace, as puzzles are solved with theory and execution as opposed to timing and platforming
Due to the design of puzzles being self-contained experiences, you can play casually, only completing a few puzzles during a session without worrying about losing progress and having to redo a bunch of them
You can't manually save in the middle of a puzzle, but progress is saved as events get triggered, and your last puzzle/world location is kept track of, so it's easy to continue where you left off
The game does not hold your hand as you play


you aren't told how to use puzzle mechanics, but rather you learn how to use them through natural play and experimentation
The learning curve is very gradual but you will find yourself dealing with fairly complex puzzles later on in the game as you become accustomed to the mechanics
The game isn't a linear progression of puzzles so if you get stuck on a puzzle you can skip it and come back to it later (and often solving it after having an epiphany
) The only barriers are Sigil Locks, which do require you to collect at least certain  "easy" Sigils before advancing too far
The story of the game is conveyed through various means


through ELOHIM (the voice in the sky), audiologs (from a female scientist), journal entries (archived data in computer terminals), and messages written on the walls (by various characters
) A big, unique part of the story is done through interactive events in the terminals, where you will interact with an AI character through dialogue trees
The AI will make you think, articulate your thoughts, and ultimately question yourself
If you wish to partake in the story and get the most of it, you'll find yourself having a lot to read, but it's all completely optional and can be skipped if you really just want to solve puzzles
The writing and voice acting are all super high-quality with perfect execution
The level design is based on real-life environments and themes primarily from Roman, Egyptian, and Medieval architectures, with a few "fantasy" environments thrown in
Weather and time of day add a lot of variety to the worlds and keep them fresh and feeling unique from one another
Environmental textures and models are very detailed and are made from real life photographs and 3D scans, as I understand it
Puzzle mechanics clearly stand out from the detailed environments by being pristine and more technologically advanced in nature, as to not get in the way of solving the actual puzzles
Puzzle areas are designed to feel open and allow you to see to other areas so you get a good sense of what all you have to work with and the area you have to utilize
Areas such as walls, fences and stairs feel natural while still retaining very distinct purposes, often aiding you in coming up with the solution without you necessarily realizing it
There's a ton more I could say about this game, but all in all you're looking at around 20 hours or more of content spanning around 120 puzzles (not including Sigil lock puzzles or additional secrets
) A second play-through is likely if you're wanting to explore alternative dialogue trees, get all the achievements, find all the secrets/messages, or attempt speed-running
There is also a level editor included as well as Steam Workshop support for user-generated content
The PC version of this game has more settings than you have ever seen before, so it can run smoothly on rather low-end hardware, and you can adjust to your liking
Full disclosure: I was a volunteer beta-tester for this game for ~3 months prior to release, and I have ~180 hours of play in ~4 playthroughs
I highly recommend this game and supporting the developer, Croteam!

												The puzzles are good, if perhaps very slightly too easy, and it's definitely the most competent treatment of philosophy I've ever seen in a video game* (speaking as someone who 1
has played a lot of video games and 2
has a PhD in philosophy**)
Definitely worth buying, if not necessarily at full price
*If you ARE a philosopher, though, or are philosophically inclined, you might suffer some mild frustration at being limited by multiple choice answers to complicated questions - though again, the options you are presented with are generally better than you might expect from a game
**Please forgive me if mentioning this makes me seem like a d**k

												Philosophy, A
I and the downfall of the human race
Would totally question my existence, the nature of reality and my place in the universe again
10/10
It's a puzzle game a bit like Portal, you use lasers and angles to power up doors and shutdown force fields to gather tetris like puzzle pieces while a over inflated ego (voice in the sky) thing talks to you like you're a child
It feels a bit like a university students project got out of control, sometimes it looks like it was rushed together and levels feel like development just stopped, but it didn't, it is all intentional
			
Posted: 3 January, 2015
												Comparing The Talos Principle to a game like Portal is unfair, but immediate
The first time I manipulated a gadget to set off a part of a puzzle, I muttered how much it reminded me of the amazing and witty Portal 1 and 2, and that trying to replicate it was unwise
However, I removed my premature opinions and discovered a whole new world of puzzle and story, placed perfectly in what is called The Talos Principle
The game starts out in ruins, immediately piquing interest and curiosity
This first person interaction makes it impossible to know who you are, or what you are doing in the deserted grounds of what seems like Rome
The land is littered with broken pillars and faulty statues, most of which are missing their heads
Very shortly after running around, an all powerful voice beams from the skies, introducing himself and welcoming you to his garden
The puzzles ahead are a test to see if you are worthy (of what is unclear) and to strengthen your faith in him, "ELOHIM
"Without going into spoilers, I must say that the story is my favorite part of this game
Despite everything right about The Talos Principle, I’m a sucker for a great story, and very few games have the tone that this one carries beautifully and makes one question the nature of humanity
Almost every word spoken or typed holds a deeper meaning
Nothing is there without reason, and everything is set up in such a way that I didn’t feel left out of anything
There will be no regrets to finishing this game and seeing everything tie together
Gameplay is very simple, which is nice, because the puzzles are not
Having the option, I opted for controller, assuming I could sit back, relax, and enjoy a nice, scenic mind game
I was wrong
Despite the scenery being beautiful and the music peaceful, my anxiety levels were high, attempting to freeze the laser gun that will shoot you down and sneak past the bots that will blow you up
And that’s within the first puzzles
You can’t do much on your own, only using what is provided to pass each task
It makes learning controls easy, which is nice when you have to take most of your focus into the puzzle
There are only a handful of gadgets as well, each with a specific task that they do
Don’t be fooled though, because sometimes they are good for more than what they are intended
The puzzles themselves are short, only getting a little longer with time
Difficulty levels vary, but progress nicely with you, rather than slamming you with something impossible
There are also several puzzles per section, which gives you some options in case you get stuck
This attribute is great as the story is a heavy part that everyone should be able to complete
What the game lacks in wit and comic relief, it replaces with promise and charm as that nagging curiosity presses you forward
There is a lot of content, which can be overwhelming if you want to follow the story, but luckily the audio tracks and journal entries are logged and easy to access at any time
Another nice feature is the hunt for stars, which can be within the puzzle or just randomly hidden on the selected map
It had a lingering feel of Mario 64 about it
It also gives you a break from some frustrating enigmas and allows you to enjoy the landscapes
The signs are helpful to look at as well, so use them
They even mark off what you have completed, though who does it for you is unknown
Kind of spooky, right?The Talos Principle doesn’t let down on graphics, either
Each stage and each little world is beautifully done, with sounds and music to match
Voice acting was very well done, allowing you to stay immersed in the game
The settings are almost too good to be real, which makes the game ever more creepy
Keep a look out when just walking around
There are some questionable sights on the rocks, in the water
You are clearly the only one around which raises the question, “where is everyone else?” Though questions like this will be answered, the theories I came up with thanks to the surrounding areas wwere a little unsettling
With all of the story, the background, creepy settings, and subtle hints, I’d say this game is very replayable, especially if you are like me and forget how to do the puzzles
I know I’m one to miss things the first time around, so going back is always good
Despite the eerie feeling I got every time I turned the game on, I was so compelled to read the QR codes on the walls, left by others before me
I wanted to understand the notes in the computer library and I wanted to know who ELOHIM really was, and what he wanted with me
All of this and more is explained if you are strong enough to pass over 120 puzzles in The Talos Principle
Abstract:    Story 9
5    Gameplay 9
25    Graphics 9
5    Sound 10    Replayability 8
75    Controls 9

												12-14-15 Edit for Road To Gehenna dlc at bottomhttp://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=414324438Possibly the most existential game I've played
Though it is, at it's core, a puzzler
The puzzles are often complex, a few head-scratchers, but sometimes require a more reductionist approach
What may seem complex at first may turn out to be very straightforward
At times it requires you to question the assumptions it has itself given you
Good exercise for the whole brain, as it doesn't train through repetition but demands both creativity and reason, both abstract thought and technical logic
Along with the puzzles a story gradually unfolds
Concepts of self, place and time begin to dawn while another mystery deepens
I like that the story is only hinted at and alluded to, so that you formulate the idea on your own
It makes it that much more meaningful and powerful
It is likely the most existential and eternally relevant topic one could imagine, and the story itself would make a fascinating novel or film
My only complaint is personal, that the game seems to make assumptions concerning beliefs, more specifically, that having them is a universal quality of humans
But this is not at all the case
At times it seemed as though the authors had an agenda to express their own beliefs, but perhaps this was just my suspicion of beliefs in general
The dialogue trees where multiple choice and never once did I actually agree with any of the choices
So it felt like being pigeon-holed and I ended up arguing for a point I didn't actually think was correct
Other than that minor brow-furrowing frustration, I really enjoyed spending time in the beautifully rendered game world
The music was lovely and atmospheric
Extremely smooth play with a good variety of menu options
It's rare that a puzzle game addresses both hemispheres of the brain as well as the subconscious mind
I strongly consider it a work of genius
Oh, and if you decide to play it, I left some messages for you
;)http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=575360255 Edit for dlc: While a bit on the pricey side for a dlc, it is well worth it
For those seeking greater challenge, many of the puzzles in RtG are considerably more difficult than in the base game
With greater challenge comes greater satisfaction at solving them
Themes from the base game are carried over, and somewhat expanded upon, in a way that I found both humorous and enlightening
It seems to me nothing short of a mirror held up to human nature itself
My earlier point about feeling pigeon-holed in the interactions is rendered moot by new understandings and realizations
So it goes with real learning, when something this worthwhile makes it's dawn across the mind, all one can do is smile

												Glorious 9/10, A MUST BUY!Potentially long review ahead:When it comes to FPS puzzle games, people usually point Portal as the definitive game of the genre
With all respect, I can conclude that The Talos Principle walks one step higher and I dare to say: completely blows out Valve's game out of the water
You probably never heard of this game, and to my original surpise, it is made by Croteam, famous for their legendary Serious Sam franchise
Who knew they also created one of the best puzzle games ever? Before starting, let me tell you the only thing I knew about this game was that it was a 'philosophical FPS puzzle' and such works usually come out too pretentious, corny and as people jokingly love to say: "2deep4me"
What I immediately spotted was something that has the potential to leave a deep mark in anyone for years ahead
Underrated, but carefully touched piece of perfection
What people seek in puzzle games is, after all, the puzzles themselves
Various player skill demands various challenges, and puzzle games often lose the balance trying to catter to different minds, and usually hopelessly fall down into either "too easy" or "crushingly hard" while also dealing with the problems with keeping enough variety to not feel like a deja-vu slog

However, mechanics here are simple and straightforward
Although not many in number, here they are perfectly used for building a large variety of challenges
Levels have clear objectives, they are clean, and various little clues are scattered all around them
What I saw here made me awe, as The Talos Principle shows a massive competence in level design, something that I truly admire in such type of games
Also, who wouldn't like playing co-op with himself by recording his moves beforehand? :) No, wait, don't be scared! All puzzles are completely solvable and if they seem to easy for you, there are always other additional hidden challenges for hardcore hunters
What I really liked and completely left me in ecstasy was looking at a level and telling myself "WOW WTF THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE", only to come back 1-2 days later and facapalm while laughing like a lunatic at how genius the solution was and how I managed to magically solve it
I find it funny how some levels are designed in such ways that 'normal' tries will lead into just a tiny little detail or centimeter of a distance that will make your plan fail into mild rage
You will really need to think outside of the box for some levels, but at the end YOU WILL SOLVE IT and all will be worth it, trust me the feeling is great and great games should really reward their players with such joys! It's interesting to note that some levels have multiple ways in which they can be solved
But never worry, there's always another choice that players are given, wandering around the "gardens"; you aren't strictly locked into a single level and when times go hard, you can always try something else
You also have the ability to acquire up to 3 'jokers' if you really want to go down there
There's enough variety to keep you entertained in the world, both mechanically and thematically as 3 very distinct 'world zones' exist
The whole platforming mechanic is mastered in a clear way that makes you relieve having to count pixels to make the 'perfect' jump or else fail miserably into level restart frenzy

Here you just press JUMP and the game guides you into the perfect landing spot

Adding the underlying themes, the whole experience becomes truly unforgettable
What The Talos Principle shines in is the masterfully crafted lore and worldbuilding, dealing with themes of existentialism, artificial intelligence and 


getting verbally rekt in an argument with the computer
x) A very peculliar and engaging, the game never tries to force ideas on you, and nothing really feels contriving
You can read text, listen to time capsule messages; what Talos does is to make you feel! And it does it perfectly in a natural way!! Even if you aren't a fan of such mind-boggling adventures, you might still like the ideas present as the game never goes overboard into mumbo-jumbo complexities that might as well not mean anything at all to 'ordinary plebs'
It's a fascinating work that pushes you to explore, and the whole ideas of being trapped in a virtual world with no direction but random scibbles left behind from pissibly eons ago makes you really dive into the solitude atmosphere; Who is that voice from the skies? Is he an ally? Why is nobody else here? What happened, why are you collecting sigyls to unlock doors? What is at the end? Should you trust the 'serpent' from the screen? HEY WHAT IS ON THE TOP OF THE TOWER??? 


Your choice affects what happens next in this world, and there are 3 different endings in total
Although some poeple might find the 3rd one kinda harder to obtain for it's supposed importance

but guides always exist
;)Talking about atmosphere, I can't really miss the soundtrack
One of the best OST I've ever heard; with numerous memorable songs, encompassing different genres and moods
You can't really deny what music does for games, but here you will notice a whole another added dimension that keeps you focused, relaxed and hungry for more adventures
Everything just fits and the various melodic loops will never bore you trying to solve that god damn hard puzzle!! The environment is trully spectacular (DAMN THOUGH, THAT TOWER!!!!) and at times you just find yourself stopping there to relax and sniff the air while looking at the backgrounds
Worlds are indeed beautifully designed, and receiving a new response on the terminal makes you relieve some stress by attempting to argue about abstract hypotetical thoughts with AI that acts surprisingly convincing
You aren't all that alone after all

:))But of course, every precious egg has it's bad side
I can't say there's a critical problem with the game, and while I think some things could have been done better, they don't really strike as something ruining the overall experience
The main gripe I have is with the ending, it's crafted nice and offers an interesting conclusion to the story, but at the same time it feels a bit disconnected gameplay-wise, with rather lackluster execution
What you've seen so far in puzzles kinda loses its focus and appears as a different game that punishes you by time limit


where the lack of proper save checkpoint system can get kinda enraging trying to retry the same chain of events again and again
This is probably the thing that hurt my interest in the last parts of the game and made me remember it as something just not so so masterpiece-tier
Whatever I felt at that time, I can't really deny now that this is one of the best games I've ever played
Combining the serene atmosphere, beautiful soundtrack, exceptional narrative with mind-bending themes and references to real mythological and literal texts, The Talos Principle is an ever shining gem that will definitely satisfy your gaming needs and will keep you waiting for more
The DLC is worth it if you want even bigger challenges, and a second game is confirmed to be in the works
Do not miss this game! I guarantee you will enjoy it troughoutly
You probably got massively bored reading this needlesly long pile of words, but if you somehow managed to do it, congratulations dudeee!!!!!Enjoy a great game, you awesome piece of thinking blood-driven flesh-machinery

												People are calling this game 'Calming,' or 'Zen
' Is it, really? The design is minimalist, and the audio is subdued, and you can pause whenever you want - but all that just disguises what is actually one of the most deviously clever and difficult puzzle games I've ever seen
So: Stations are little shapes on the map
People show up at each little shape, wanting to go to some other shape
You connect the shapes with metro lines, and a little train will show up to ferry people along the lines you drew to get everyone where they want to go
There's a few more mechanics, but that's 90% of it
There are only so many metro configurations you can have for any given map, but with every station that pops up, the possibilities increase in number exponentially
There's never quite enough lines or enough carriages or enough tunnels to keep all of your passengers totally satisfied
In essence, playing this game is endlessly performing triage on an ever-growing network that's a few bad decisions away from becoming an unsustainable mess and collapsing under its own weight
It's mind-warping how fast things can get out of hand if you're careless
Forget Telltale; here, every choice you make feels genuinely heavy and difficult, because they actually are heavy, difficult choices
Crucially, though, there's always a right choice that will keep you alive for at least another week
Every game ends in you frantically trying to fix a bottleneck in your network, or deperately rerouting half your lines to ease up the congestion in one distant corner of your map - and failing
But there's always something you could have done, out of the umptillion different decisions the game threw at you
This game is terrifying
I've been pulling my hair out
The quiet bleeps and bloops of the passengers arriving and leaving no longer register as something Calming or Zen but as something far more sinister
Needless to say, I absolutely love it

												You can check other reviews for a gameplay review, I wanna write about the developers of the game
Dinosaur Polo Club is a great indie studio, they did everything right
Start an early access and keep this game updated with new content for free almost 2 years after release, also they don't abuse of the RECENTLY UPDATED section, they do a right use of it, only to communicate the news and updates of the game and not spam like others
I hope they start a new project because I gonna fully supported :)Update 1, 20 October 2017: I was looking my completed games and found that I lost one in my count, so I checked completionist
me and found that Mini Metro had a new Update with one new City and two achievements, looks like its that time of the year to reinstall and complete the game for the sixth time because they keep updating the game :D

Early Access Review
								I love this game
It takes place in an alternate universe where commuters patiently wait for the next train when the current one looks full
			
Posted: 24 October, 2014
												<Review Update> I originally reviewed this game in 2014
 Since then the game has added a number of features
 First, the game has sound and music now (they are sort of one and the same
 All sounds are music notes, and all the notes make the music
), which I think is quite good
 You get an audio cue now when things start to become frantic, as the music tempo begins to pick up
 Secondly, there are now more modes and objectives, which gives even returning players something new to accomplish
 Third, the game now has much better options, including color blind modes and automatic gif recording of your metro system
 Fourth, I can now confirm that the game works great with touchscreen systems like the Microsoft Surface
 Past these items, the core gameplay stays the same (just smoother) against my alpha review from two years ago
 I continue to recommend the game with two big thumbs up
<End Update>Mini Metro belongs to the category I call "Optimization Games
"  These are games like Banished, Prison Architect or Sim City
 These sort of games are more about building the best thing you can with your resources available, and less about reaching a "win" state
Mini Metro is a extremely minimalist version of these sorts of games
 Whereas in a game like Banished you'll be trying to balance population growth, food supplies, trading resources, lumber, etc, Mini Metro just asks you to get your passengers from station A to station B
Mini Metro doesn't have saves or anything, and you can expect a single round of the game to last about 15-20 minutes
 During this time, stations of various shapes will pop up, and they'll begin to have passengers show up
 Your goal is to build your rail lines in a way that gets the people to their intended station
 Have too many passengers waiting too long to get somewhere and you lose
Where Mini Metro really succeeds is that it builds a lot of tension easily thanks to the constant need to incorporate new locations, while only giving you minimal additional resources
 Can your Red Train Line handle an extra circle station?  Maybe you can rearrange the stations a bit to fit that new station onto your Yellow Train Line instead?  You'll be juggling these decisions constantly
Overall, I highly recommend Mini Metro
 It's kept me occupied for longer than many other optimization games have
 Despite it's simplicity, there's a lot of room to improve your skills in the game, and I tend to find myself thinking of new station arrangements when I'm not playing
 That's the sign of a good game, and it's the same feeling games like XCom or Banished gave me
 If you enjoy these sorts of games, I would very much say it's worth your money, even in it's current Alpha state

Early Access Review
Mini Metro is a zen-like strategy experience with pleasing minimal visuals that utilizes the real-world simulation of public transit and the growing system of subways that various corners of the world have come to know
The simple metro-line style of the game is not only a minimal aesthetic, but a symbol of civilization that is powerful to those who have relied on it for a better portion of our lives
Although simple in appearance Mini Metro is nothing short of a complex affair with lots of little mechanics to learn as you delve deeper
The game is easy enough for players of any level to hop into but offers layers upon layers of choice and consequence that you will need to learn and master through hours of your own planning of expansive transit systems
You begin by connecting differently shaped metro stations to other stations with similarly shaped passengers, which gets complicated as you notice your limit on Metro lines you're able to make and the amount of trains you're able to have carrying passengers
Without an even balance between how much load each of your lines have you'll quickly have a station overcrowd leading to a Game Over
Overcrowding can be avoided through careful planning as well as the help of upgrades you get to choose between at the end of each week
These can be very hard decisions as you'll be deciding between the ability to build another carriage to hold more of your overflowing passengers, extra bridges to allow you more tactical planning under rivers and other tracks, or a new line giving you a new color-coordinated track to work with on the constantly expanding map
Only one of these upgrades can be chosen and not using the chance efficiently will end your reign as a metro tycoon much quicker
The game is currently undergoing some extremely ambitious and promising sound work, including a soundtrack being composed by the legendary Disasterpeace
Sound is a feature I am greatly anticipating, because while the silence serves the minimalistic approach to the aesthetics of the game it could really use a bit of atmosphere
Until then I can easily throw on any appropriate Brian Eno record and bliss-out to the creation of my own Metro system, And as Eno himself wrote, "I lose control and at last I am part of the machinery
" Mini Metro does its part well in capturing the machine driven lifestyles of the modern world and infusing it with a tactical and addictive interactive twist that anyone from casual strategy fans to serious transit geeks can get excited about
There's already a good selection of real-world maps allowing you to construct and plan anywhere from London to Hong Kong, as well as more than enough features like Leaderboards and alternative Nightmodes to play around with
Its state in Early Access is merely a sign of great things to come for an already blissful strategy game
I'm extremely excited for what's in store and can't wait for the upcoming procedural soundtrack, additional features, and very hopefully some new maps
Two cities I'd personally love to see are Tokyo and Prague (Hi Timmy!) and with enough support Mini Metro is sure to deliver on fresh content

Early Access Review
								Mini Metro is a game that allows the player to teach all those transportation moguls how to properly setup a metro grid, or how to properly fail at doing so
Odds are it will be the latter
It's an incredibly fun and challenging game, that will leave the player looking for the best possible routes
Transportation is the center of the world! It is the glue of our daily lives
When it goes well, we don't see it
When it goes wrong, it negatively colors our day, makes us feel angry and impotent, curtails our possibilities
Robin ChaseWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Mini Metro
GameplayIf riding a metro is part of your daily routine, you'll either be extremely interested in trying Mini Metro out, or completely uninterested
The goal is to "survive" as many days as possible by having customers happy, which means providing them transportation without having to spend much time waiting for it
As you can easily imagine, that's pretty simple to do, but as the game goes on, not only will the map increase, more stations will also start appearing, which can, sometimes, force the player to redo all the lines
At the end of each week there will be a couple rewards, from more locomotives, to carriages, tunnels and extra lines, all of which can be used to make life easier
But choose wisely, as you may find yourself in need of either reward sooner than you think
It's up to the player to make sure they don't end up like all the metro companies in the world, full of angry customers
Pros Really good concept; Has a feel of progression looking at the map grow as the game goes on; Minimalist UI, containing everything that's needed and nothing more; Beautiful design; If you ever get eye sore from all the white background, you can also change to night mode, and vice versa; Doesn't get too repetitive, as the starting stations are randomized; Various city maps; Active development team; Price
Considering it's an Early Access (EA) game, I've decided to add a "Neutral" category, for details I consider important, but not gamebreakers, and could easily improve the gameplay if attended
Neutral Lack of a soundtrack/sound effects (which is already part of the developers' plan); Would be nice to see different vehicle models, even if only for each country/city
Not much to point out "Cons" wise, as the game is pretty solid
Cons Once you get the hang of it, it sort of becomes trivial
VerdictI'd give it a 9/10, as it offers the player a nice and relaxing experience, as well as a nice change from the current gaming trend

												Oh man, where to start with Mini Metro
I picked up the game in alpha, I remember greatly enjoying it, and when it was released on PC, I started looking for it when it went on sale
I grabbed it through a Humble Bundle, and I have played it for multiple hours since, as you can see
The game is about building an efficient metro/subway system in ever-growing cities with randomly generated stops, and unique features
The inclusion of night and colorblind modes are fantastic
The simple Harry Beck aesthetics of the game and relaxing(ish) music are good enough for me to recommend this game to anyone
Also, circle stations are satan spawn, and you will hate them as lovingly as I do one day
PS
Dev team is amazing, I love all of them and they are the best kinds of people that exist
			
Posted: 27 June
												What can I say , I just love these simple things
It helps me relax
No stress and a simple game to learn
It is on summer sale I would get it

You will not waste your money here			
Posted: 7 June
												Love it
Sit down, have a cup of tea, play this game
Beware that it's not exactly like Where's Wally, there are a handful of characters where you have to get an animation going before you can actually click to 'find' the person
This advice won't make sense, until it makes sense, y'know?

												A spectacular game, Hidden Folks is an absolute joy to play
We had some fun playing this on the TV while everyone pointed at cool things and passed the controller around
It is relaxing, pleasant, and sounds/looks great
I am really looking forward to the next chunk of content
Great job developers, this game is really something special :)			
Posted: 25 May
												Hidden Folks is one of the very few hidden object games I like
It’s not like the others that have a weird story or extremely nonsensical item layouts
It’s Where’s Waldo with a strange sense of charm due to all the mouth-based sound effects and abundant animations
I’ll start off by saying the game has very few problems
I found the default color scheme much too hard on my eyes with the generous amount of white, but the developer included a sepia filter and an inverse color scheme if you wanted to see tons of black
Sepia was perfect for me, so I’m glad it’s there
The only other issue was the number of interactive objects on the big city map
I did not enjoy clicking and dragging open a bunch of blinds, only to have them close again shortly after
I tended to forget what was in there and I would have preferred they just stay open so I didn’t have to open them repeatedly
Most of the little people and creatures have animations and sounds that play when you click on them
They also produce an ambient murmuring type of deal depending on the map and how zoomed in you are
It feels lively with all the movement and I appreciated the number of silly mouth sounds
I highly recommend clicking on things multiple times to hear all the voicework
You’ll not find a soundtrack, so having a podcast readily available wouldn’t be a bad idea
The gameplay is what you’re probably thinking
You’ll have objects and people at the bottom of the screen that you must find
They all come with little hints which helps greatly for some of the very large maps
You’ll have small maps and large ones which will require zooming in and out and some screen movement
It all works without any bugs during my experience
There are more levels incoming from what I saw in the game, but what’s there provides a pretty good time
It’s a wonderfully pure searching experience that I hope to have more of soon
I also wouldn’t mind a sequel that introduces some maps with colors

												For such a simple looking game I wasn't expecting this much fun; plus some good laughs between friends on those amazing sound effects
Would recommend to anyone with a few bucks and some time to spare

												It's Where's Waldo but no color, animated, riddles as hints, and the most lively sound production that might beat out some triple A games
			
Posted: 16 June
												I just played under an hour with my kids, and we all had a blast
The sounds are funny, the animations are great, the fact that you need to dig/cut/shake/click on things make this hidden game really cool
It's a really nice casual game where you just kick back, have a cup of coffee and relax
A well deserved purchase !			
Posted: 18 February
While not perfect, Hidden Folks brings back fond memories of Where's Waldo? along with some cool bells-and-whistles that makes it more of a 'game'
This title gets an A+ for some really neat art and creative sounds
The ambience is very well done
Yeah, it becomes a bit of a click-fest after a while, and yeah, the animations become repetitive quicker than I'd like
That's why it's best played in short bursts
Well worth the few bucks to experience something unique for an afternoon
Essentially, this is a hidden-object-game styled after a classic childrens book series
There is a bar on the bottom of each screen that has characters or objects you must find
Hovering over said object gives a slight clue - which is supposed to be used (unlike 'help' in other hidden object games)
The sounds are all acapella
You can invert the black and white screen if you are playing in the dark - the game has nice touches like that
Pros:+Fresh take on a classic childrens book series+The artwork and sounds are quite creative and work well together+There are a few 'mini-game' esque level variations that are neat+As of 2/17, they are apparently adding more content in the future+Good choice of quality-of-life game optionsCons:-Best in short bursts because there is limited animations and artwork; examples of this are things like - there are only a certain number of poses that quickly repeat, and other things like clickable holes in the ground or trees become redundantWhile I won't be logging dozens of hours here, it certainly makes me smile and give me fun coffee breaks:) 
Posted: 15 February
												A delightful game
Clicking anywhere will give you a lovely sound effect, and finding new items with different sounds is quite fun
The actual objective of the game is to find special people/animals/objects hidden within the different levels, however there is a lot to see and interact with outside of the set objectives
The game is very enjoyable, both in trying to find the hidden folks, and in exploring the rest of the landscape
			
Posted: 15 May
												I picked this title up at full price on a whim
It didn't last long, but for a few short hours I forgot all about my high-pressure job
 I was six years old again, and clicking repeatedly on cars just to hear them go MEEPMEEP
I bought several more copies for some friends

												Games don't scare me
Movies don't scare me
In fact, short of being dropped in the middle of the ocean or singing in public, there's not much I'm bothered by


except Amnesia
Why? Because in this game, I am powerless
I cannot fight back
Games like Doom, Resident Evil, Dead Space, etc
; They fail to send chills up my spine and make me squeal like a child because they made the mistake of giving me an arsenal of weapons and badass personality traits
Are Isaac Clarke and Claire Redfield afraid? Sure, and I don't blame them
But I'm not, because I look awesome and I can materialize various tools of immenent destruction
Those creepers waiting to pop-out from behind the corner aren't trying to scare me, they're sacrificing themselves to the God of Death! Amnesia, though


My tools are the world's worst lantern and a number of closets to hide in! I couldn't fight if my life depended on it, and it most certainly does
Well done, Amnesia; I haven't looked over my shoulder this much since I was 12

												The original indie horror game that started it all
If you are in need of a good scare with an incredibly creepy setting, and actual storyline, this is the game for you
I cannot stress enough how fantastically horrifying it is
This is mostly done through the constant needs to push forward to avoid the darkness chasing you, but the knowledge that ahead lies horrible monsters
You're sort of stuck in the middle and it leaves you with a sense of helplessness that I've never experienced before

I especially recommend playing this before going to sleep as it will ensure a good night's sleep for you! The overall atmosphere of this game is very cheerful and bright
The maps are filled with great landscapes, ingenious architecture, and friendly creatures and characters
In my opinion it's exciting and constant entertainment for all ages and genders
A great game in every aspect and 100% worth the money! The only con is that a character known as 'brute' is sometimes very naughty

Amnesia: still the ruling king of horror gamesHorror games are a special genre
What scares one person to hell, could make somebody else just raise an eyebrow, or even come across as comical to yet another gamer
Opinions on what makes a good horror game do vary accordingly, but amidst all these discussions, there's one game that stands out: Amnesia: The Dark Descent
Almost everybody who has played this game, concedes that it is exceptionally scary, and thus succeeds wonderfully as a horror game
The first of the two Amnesia games, it was released just five years ago, in september 2010
It's not the first horror game by its developer, Frictional Games, who earlier made the Penumbra games, but it's certainly the title that made Frictional Games famous
With the hype around the upcoming release of Soma, yet another Frictional title, playing through their best known horror game yet only seemed appropriate, and long overdue
Actually I started this game already three times earlier this year, every time not finding the courage to move on after the first hour or so, out of pure fear
I only play this kind of games when it's dark outside, using headphones, in order to let them develop their full scaring potential, but with Amnesia: The Dark Descent this kind of approach just looked impossible
The past couple of weeks I finally found the courage to persevere (in complete darkness), but I was only able to play the game in small pieces, only half an hour or so on end, after which I literally had to recover
This may seem like exaggerated, but it's not
This game is by far the scariest I've ever played
Playing as Daniel, you have to re-discover who you are and what you're doing in a medieval castle somewhere deep in the German woods
As the game progresses, the story poses more and more questions, and only at the very end did all the pieces come together for me
But it's not the story itself that's particularly scary
It's the way the game puts the player in an extremely vulnerable position, without any means of defense (no swords or guns in this one!) and only some tinderboxes and a lantern as a means to progress through the increasingly unsettling surroundings
The game is by far the darkest I've ever played
Darkness is actually transformed into one of the game's defining elements: when standing in darkness, Daniel slowly but surely turns mad, and the only way to counter this is either to light some candles with the tinderboxes, or to light your lantern
Since lantern oil is quite scarce, I found myself constantly trying to save it as much as possible
There is a constant looming danger in the form of monsters, who are seldomly to been seen but impose terror upon the player by sound or just by thought
For when a monster finds you, it's almost surely instant death
The game manages to strike the perfect balance between slowly progressing episodes where I was fumbling around in the dark, hiding for monsters and looking for clues or letters, and some scenes where the only option was: run!It's hard to describe in words exactly why this game got so deep under my skin, though, because it terrified me on an even deeper level that has nothing to do with graphics or game mechanics
I think the theme of man turning into a monster even worse than any monster imagineable struck a resonating chord inside me
I found myself screaming out loud at times, mostly out of utter disgust at what was happening
The game had a very unsettling effect on my, and probably that's why it took me several tries to play and finish it
It's a masterpiece in its genre, yet to be trumped
Very highly recommended, but not for the faint of heart, nor for heart patients

												Many times a second game in a series doesn't live up to expectations set by the first - this is definitely NOT the case with The Room 2
While I'm not finished with it yet, it is just as good as the first! I highly recommend picking this and the first one up if you love good, solid, logic puzzle games
And I suspect I'll be revisiting them in the future for another playthrough
			
Posted: 16 June
												The Room 1 was absolutely brilliant
The Room 2 builds upon that foundation with slightly less frustrating puzzle design (no painstakingly tiny hidden switches, better hint system) and better graphics as well as atmosphere
The Room is a game series as unique as it is awesome and beautiful
A true masterpiece and due to the suberb art design, it deserves to become a timeless classic for years to come
			
Posted: 5 July, 2016
Another fantastic remaster of a great gameLike its predecessor, The Room Two is an immersive first-person puzzler of the Myst-like variety where you follow a trail of clues and tamper with eldritch mechanisms
Failure to solve a puzzle doesn't mean you don't get it, it just means you've not looked everywhere for clues
The game is about the same length and difficulty as The Room 1, but the environments are bigger and more detailed, which is a nice touch
Where the first game has you focus on a central setpiece, moving around it to examine every detail, this game incorporates several such setpieces in each level and allows you to move freely between them (Perfect for roomscale VR, eh devs?)
That doesn't mean you can solve them in any order, however, as they are usually interconnected with eachother
This leads to a minor issue where sometimes you're not sure what has changed since you're looking another way, but this only happens once or twice and is mostly avoided by the camera moving automatically to focus on what changed
While I think the controls probably feel better with a touch device, using a mouse works perfectly well
All in all, a brilliant title made gorgeous on PC
And it has nothing to do with the movie, stop asking

Posted: 24 April
Who am I:Hi there! My name is Claire, I am 26 years old and from Denmark
I have over 20 years of gaming experience
 I do all achievements for the game before I review it
So my review truly reflects a 100% completion of the game
However it is still my subjective opinion of the game
Hope you enjoy!Gameplay:You generally solve puzzles by using your mouse to interact with the objects you come across
It has a very Amnesia feel to it where you flip you mouse up to flip open a boxor slide your mouse to the side to move something out of the way
It makes you feel more engaged with the puzzles, and I liked that a lot
You solve puzzles of increasing difficulty, which at the beginning are very easy but as you progress through the rooms they end up being quite complex
The puzzles are varied, ranging from finding hidden objects to aligning seemingly random things to form something i
e a word of a symbol
If you are stuck on a part the game will automatically prompt you with hints, although these can be turned off for more of a challenge
All the puzzles have multiple stages to them, and seeing the whole room evolve as you solve more stages of the puzzle is quite addictive
Every stage has a distinct feel to them, although all the stages have a mysterious and dark theme  to them
Story:You are a seemingly unknown character trying to uncover the mysteries of the rooms you find yourself in
The story is set in the 1800's based on the environments, butyou seem to be able to travel in time, as not all the rooms seem to be from the same time period
The notes you find throughout the game confirms this aswell
From what I gathered from the cryptic letters and messages lying around on each level
The story is about you uncovering a deep mystery that has been hidden away forcenturies
From time to time you will come across these red symbols which has almost a demonic undertone to it
It makes you wonder what kind of deeper power or mystery you are uncovering and it helps build up a mystery surrounding the puzzles
I will say the ending is pretty ungratifying and the story really is quite irrelevant and left quite a lot to be desired
Ultimately it didn't really matter to me, butif you're hugely into storylines then The Room Two is not for you
Graphics:The objects of The Room Two and the puzzles are beautifully integrated
As an example you will solve puzzles on a model ship where everything from the ships cannons to the deck is created with an impressive attention to detail
On another level you will fix a broken crossbow to later use in the puzzles on that level
You get the impression that the developers really had a great time making these puzzles as beautiful and realistic as possible and I am very impressed with the naturalistic artstyle and the overall quality of the various objects you interact with
However with that said, the surrounding area in the various puzzlerooms are not very impressive and are often just blackened out areas where you can't really see much
The texture quality of the non-interactive areas are also not very impressive often very crudely designed and with low polygon numbers
You could make the argument that the low quality backgrounds and the very dark areas surrounding the interactive areas makes it easier for the player to know what he/she can interact with
I would've preferred all of the levels to be of the same graphical fidelity, especially considering how few rooms The Room Two actually has (6 rooms, with 1 being obnoxiously short
)Not much customization graphically, the only being resolution and a handful of graphic presets
Sound:There is very little music in The Room Two, which I personally think is a great decision
I felt much more immersed into the various rooms and their puzzles when all I couldhear was the ambience from the background and the beautiful sounds when you turn a key or place a weight on a counter-scale
The background ambience is very good and it helps solidify what kind of area you're in
You'll hear the ocean and the wood twisting and turning when on the boat level, andyou'll hear faint echoes and rocks falling when you're in the tomb/cave levels
At the end of most levels, you would be presented with a final puzzle relating to the story of the game, and in this puzzle random flashes followed with a loud almost demonicsound pops up
I personally found the flashing noise quite obnoxious, and it broke my immersion with the game
I couldn't figure out if it was an attempt to make the game a little scary or why it was put in there
Price:The Room Two is very cheap, only about 5 euro when not on sale
It took me around 3 hours to complete the game, and although the game doesn't really have any replayabilityfor the low price they are charging you get quite a few hours worth of entertainment
Conclusion:If you are into dark mysteries, puzzles and an immersive atmosphere, then you should pick up The Room Two
It's nothing revolutionary, but it delivers solid entertainmentfor about 2-3 hours at a low price
On a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is unplayable and 10 is a masterpiece, I will give The Room Two a 6 out of 10
If you enjoy my reviews please thumb up the review - and you're always welcome to add me here on steam :-)

												'The Room 2' is just as good as 'The Room'
If you played the first game, all you may want to know is that 'The Room 2' is more of the same
Yay! The only differences are: environments are more varied and there is a little more story (but only a little)
'The Room' and 'The Room 2' are the best puzzle games I have ever played and I've been playing them since the 1990s
It's puzzling in its most basic form
There is almost no story being told
Chapter after chapter, you just tackle one big puzzle
In order to solve each puzzle, a number of tasks need to be performed, ranging from solving mini-puzzles to spotting hidden compartments in the puzzle and coming up with a logical way to open them
Solving the puzzles feels exciting and rewarding, and it's just a lot of fun
I think a large part of the reason is that in 'The Room' and 'The Room 2', the puzzles feel very 'physical', as opposed to just seeing a board of some form in front of you like in most other puzzle games
It almost feels like you could reach out and touch the puzzles and solve them that way
To conclude, a few short additional notes that may help you decide whether to buy 'The Room' and 'The Room 2' if you're still not sure:- both games are short: about 3 to 4 hours each, so you may want to buy them when they're on sale, although I think the quality of both games certainly justifies their full price
- they're not very difficult: for me the games were just challenging enough but if you're the sadistic kind of puzzler who only likes being challenged to the point of migraine, you will not find that here
On the contrary, there is a hint system in the game so if you feel stumped at any time, you can click a button to give you some pointers
- the Steam Achievements are the most basic: one achievement for completing each chapter of the games
I would recommend this game to everyone, not just to people who like playing puzzle games
It's really that good

												What made The Room so good in it's great formula of mystery and puzzle solving is back yet again for an outstanding sequel! If you're unfamiliar with the series, The Room firstly came out on mobile platforms, and was then fully remastered for PC
The original Room was released back in 2014 and The Room 2 released in 2016
The game's quite simplistic in it's concept
You have a safe, a box, or just a lock, and the player is supposed to open it
To do so you're gonna have to solve all of the sub-puzzles before cracking the big one
While I do get frustrated a lot of times in puzzle games, I feel the difficulty for The Room games isn't too hard but also not too easy, it's perfectly balanced and is able to be satisfactory throughout the entirety of the game
It lasts about 3
5 hours total if you don't rush through it, just like the first one
While some people may not like the short length, I think a short game fits the genre better than a longer one
There are 6 chapters in this sequel, one of them lasts a minute and another one is a tutorial, so in the end we have 4 chapters with challenging rooms to crack
I was quite surprised by the creepy atmosphere in The Room Two, it certainly felt darker than the first game while the main objective is pretty much the same between the two
However, there's a slight difference in this installment, instead of being focused on just one safe or table, now there are multiple places in the room to explore, so moving around with the mouse is possible now
The port is really well made but I did have some slight annoyances
Sometimes I wanted to move a drawer and the game decided to move the camera instead
Also, it should be possible to type on the typewriter with the keyboard
It's nothing game breaking or too frustrating, just little details I'd like to point out
The Room Three is already out on mobile, but I do hope it is ported to the PC just like the first two games have been
This is two of my favorite mystery/puzzle games of all time and having to pick between which one is the best is a tough call, they stand on equal ground in terms of quality, challenge and entertainment, two phenomenal games I'd recommend anyone to check them out, even if you're not into point & click / puzzle games
9/10

												In my opinion "The Room" series is the best of the simplistic puzzle games or ones that you can play with one hand
This is of course excluding games with full controls like Portal, Myst, or The Witness
The ambient noise as well as the sound each switch, cog, & lever make set the mood perfectly
The torches, lamps, & candles all light each room as I would expect them to in real life
Plus this time the puzzles encompass the whole room & not just one puzzle box like it's predecessor making you think just that little bit more
Story is a little naff but I came here to solve puzzles primarily so this is forgivable
Replay-ability is also at a zero as you will already know all the answers to the puzzles
Apart from these factors I would still pay full asking price just on the intricacy of the puzzles & level design
The Room & The Room Two give me hope that games CAN be ported properly
They're fun to play on your own or with your girlfriend and/or kids
They make you think for once instead of shoot and/or kill aimlessly & I will most definitely be purchasing their third game whenever they decide to port it across to PC

												The sequel to one of my favourite puzzle games ever - the Room and even if it isn't as good as the Room, which felt more elaborate, well thought, mysterious and alchemic, it's still a worthy game for all the Room fans

												This is a good game
Want to see any pros? Read any other review
I'll list cons just to help you make the decision:* There are no high-quality puzzles that you actually have to solve with pen and paper
Nothing is more complicated than "monkey see, monkey do", and in the majority of the cases it's even simplier than that
If you want a real challenge, this is not the right game
* A lot of things you have to do are too random and make no sense whatsoever
This is a big downgrade from The Room 1, where most interactions were a lot more "explainable" ("because this is a big puzzle box with hidden compartments", etc
)* Your greatest enemy is your monitor's brightness setting
Thankfully, you can adjust the brightness of the game in the options menu
* Sometimes game uses creepy flashes for the atmosphere
Not quite as bad as real jumpscares, but if you are sensitive to such things (or you are playing with an easy-to-scare kid), beware, and play in a well-lit room
In my opinion, this was completely unnecessary for a puzzle game without a real horror element
* Some parts are just tedious and annoying
There are quite a few "puzzles" that will make you repeat the solution several times, probably just to make the game a little bit longer
* Despite everything, the game is super short
I guess it can take longer than 2 hours if you just got stuck and don't want to use hints, but it's not something good, because most likely that means that you missed a tiny barely-visible thingie somewhere, and you will just sit in frustration till you'll finally notice it
Other than that, this game is quite nice, and it totally worth the price if you just want a short nice atmospheric mystery experience

												The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is a remake of the popular Lucas Art point and click adventure game which was released back in 1990
The remake was released in mid-2009 on PC, Mac, PSN and Xbox Live Arcade
The game is set in the Caribbean at the time of pirates
You play as Guy Threepwood - a guy who dreams of becoming a pirate
This game is set in a third person perspective point and click style gameplay
You are able to explore around the world and interact with objects in a couple of different ways, such as inspecting them, picking them up, pushing or pulling for example, whilst you are also able to interact with other NPCs in the game through multiple dialogue options
The game has no death scenes in it for your character; game play is heavily focused on puzzles and exploring
The puzzles in The Secret of Monkey Island are in adventure style; and make no sense what so ever until you finally figure it out, then it becomes clear as day, but all of the puzzles are fun to take part in
Personally my favourite would be the pirate insulting duels
This was the first game in a long while that actually had me taking notes on a pen and paper! None of the puzzles are really time based, so you can spend as much time as you want on them without being penalized
What I really liked about The Secret of Monkey Island is that you can either play the game in the remastered settings with the higher quality art style, or you can actually play it in the classic pixel style that the original game was based on, you can do this on a scene by scene basis too
 The art style of the remastered edition looks really good though, lots of vibrant colours and some really nice looking background environments
As this was my first experience with The Secret of Monkey Island I wasn't sure what to expect from it story wise, but I was pleasantly surprised when there is a whole load of humour added into the plot
Every single character I ran into had an extremely memorable persona
I don't want to spoil any of the story since the game is essentially the story, but it is captivating and interesting right until the end
The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is completely voice acted, and done really well
Even the none main characters are voice acted, such as bar dwellers and town folk which was a nice touch, much of the sound track is also the same, just remastered to a higher quality
This is another game that completely baffled me at parts, whether it be on some of the puzzles or just knowing where to go next to progress the story; which resulted in me looking up the guide, to be honest I am not sure how you are supposed to figure some of it but it has been done by plenty of others! I was really immersed in the story of the game and didn't want to lose too much time faffing around with not knowing where to go so I was happy to look up the answers this time
Each of the game's scenes has plenty of objects that you can interact with, most will end up with Guy giving some sort of witty remark towards them, and there are also lots of NPCs which you can talk with to get more out of the plot and some of the side stories going off in the game too
The Secret of Monkey Island took me ten hours to complete; this was with the aid of a guide at parts, and following up all dialog options with NPCs to get the most out of the lore; I thought this was a pretty good length for the game considering I actually thought it would be a lot shorter given my past experience of point and click games
Given that the story is linear and that there is only one ending to the game, there is no reason to replay it through a second time though
Given that this is a remastered edition of the game, it works fine on the newer operating systems, and I was able to play at 4K resolutions perfectly fine
I encountered minor problems with the controls in the game, and the scroll wheel functionality when choosing which action to take on objects stopping randomly - but this was easily worked around by using the keyboard shortcuts
 An odd issue which has been reported is that for some reason the game refuses to run when being installed on a 3 TB hard drive, so that may be something to consider if you are purchasing it and you only have a 3 TB drive
The Secret of Monkey Island is often referred to as the pinnacle of point and click adventure games, and this series is what spawned many more of the greats we have today, and rightly so
I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of my time playing this game, and the story is absolutely brilliant and I cannot wait to get stuck into the rest of the series
The low price of £6, 99 on Steam makes The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition a serious contender for a must play title

THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND: SPECIAL EDITION - A LucasArts Classic beautifully and masterfully reworked  || 9
5 || Score Comment   Graphics 9 Simply stunning, switching between the original graphics and the special edition you can really appreciate the time the artists have taken to faithful reproduce the backgrounds, characters and animations
 Audio 9 Excellent music (I mean come on! its monkey Island I don't think I will ever get that tune out of my head) and really well done voice acting for all the characters
Gameplay 10 Ok, first I admit I am completely biased here: I love Monkey Island
Back from the days when I first got it to run on my 268 (I know showing my age) this game was something special
Monkey Island is one of the classic games from the golden age of point and click adventure games where LucasArts and Sierra ruled supreme with games like Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max and the Kings Quest series
The controls have been reworked, making them more user friendly for a modern audience, but are still faithful to the original and don't detract from the game in anyway
Even if you weren't old enough to appreciate these games the first time round they are masterpieces and I feel stand the test of time
  Story 10 The game is pretty much all about the story (a truly amazing story), and while you are free to do some exploring around the islands and some trial and error with the puzzles, the story is essentially linear (so don't expect an open world game)
The dialogue is full of dry humour and the situations (and solutions to puzzles) fantastical, absurd and brilliant
While the story has many aspects that will appeal to younger players (slapstick humor), much of the humour will appeal to adults
The puzzles are challenging but not to the point of frustration and are worked into the story well
  Replayability 7 If you have played the game its likely to be memorable enough that you will know the solutions to the puzzles, but its still good fun, and was for me very nostalgic
  Overall 9
5 Completely biased review, take from it what you will, but we all have childhood games special to us and this was mine

												The Secret of Monkey Island is THE graphic adventure
Funny, engaging, gorgeous art


It's a game full of highlights and worth playing once in your life
That said, I'm not a fan of the new art
I don't like it and if I compare it to the original pixel art I can only name it hideous, I don't understand how it got approved
But since you can switch the art style on the go that is not a problem (for me)
The added voices are great though
So the only problem with this game is why the hell can't we play with the original graphics and the new voices
There is not an option for that
Judging by what I read on forums a lot of people would love to be able to
And it is possible using ScummVM and following a slightly complex tutorial, but


it should be an ingame option

Monkey Island (MI) is a unique blend of bizarro characters, whacky plots & even stranger puzzles!The most entertaining aspect of Monkey Island though is the humor used throughout; in the dialog, situations & actions you perform
It's rare to have humor used so well in a game
With your want-to-be pirate,  'hero',  ahem, Guybrush Threepwood there are plenty of hair-pulling challenges & interesting locations to explore
There is even swashbuckling sword play, although in a much more creatively different way than you would ever expect! Mind you, that will happen a lot in MI, where the most creative 

strange 

crazy step is often the next step, not the logical one you think
The fresh coat of paint in the Special Edition with its 3D-ish cartoon look enhances the setting well, although you can also switch to the classic graphics at any time too! Voice acting is excellent taking full advantage of the great dialog
Always enjoyable taking a pirate holiday back to MI! Yarr!Timeless point 'n' click adventure! One of the best!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												If you haven't played this game before, do it now
It's video game history
If you already played the 1990 original it's time for another playthrough
Everything that makes the game great was left untouched: The story, the humorous dialogues and the puzzles
The changes made to this re-release really add to the experience
HD graphics, outstanding voice acting and a beautiful re-recording of the classic score
Purists have the option to switch between enhanced and original graphics anytime during the game, even during cutscenes, and experience the game in it's original glory

												It's easy to see why The Secret of Monkey Island is one of the most beloved adventure games of all time
Some of the gameplay may be a little old fashioned but the characters, humor and situations are timeless and with the new lick of paint the game doesn't show its age
If you've never played it before play it now; if you haven't played it for a while just give it another go

AUDIOClassicVISUALCrowd-pleaserDIFFICULTYToughVIBEUnforgettableCRAVINGChallengeON SALERarelyPROS: Remastered game looks amazing, remastered music is spot-on, voices are all great and fit with the rest of the series
Story and dialogue are wonderful
Puzzles are outlandishly-memorable, but entirely possible
I absolutely love the ability to switch back and forth between classic and remastered to see exactly what was changed
CONS: Most people don't like the way Guybrush looks in this one, understandably-so
Someone even made a full mod to fix his hair
Dialogue stops are necessary to keep the game in-tact with the original flow, but can be a little distracting once voices are added to the mix
WORTH: Did I mention you can transition back and forth from remaster to classic? well, you can transition back and forth from remastered and classic
Both experiences in one pretty little package! Excuse me while I fangirl
OVERALL: 10 years ago, Ron Gilbert said in a magazine interview that he was amazed at how often Secret Of Monkey Island is brought up, 15 years after its creation
I wonder if he's realized yet that he's made a piece of gaming history

												Rarely does a sequel capture essence of the original so well
In Monkey Island 2 SE, you will have more of everything! More islands to explore, more bizarro characters, whacky plots & harder puzzles! I still remember all those years ago getting this on 11 floppy disks back on the Amiga & how much longer it took to complete than the original just a year or so before!Guybrush Threepwood returns, still regurgitating the story (to those that will listen) of how he vanquished LeChuck
This is old news now, so Guybrush sets out for more fame & fortune to a new island, and a new adventure 

the hunt for the Big Whoop treasure! Our dimwitted hero also will come across many of the memorable characters from the first game, but as as you can guess, his luck takes a turn for the worse pretty quickly
I won't say much more on the story other than to point out it is most enjoyable with some great dialog & some truly funny moments
Although one thing I didn't like so much compared to Monkey Island 1 was the ending
I thought it was clever when I first saw it all those years ago as a kid, but now it seems not to fit the game very well 

don't let that disuade you from trying it though as its still a great adventure (and besides, you might like it!)
Fast forward about 25 years to the Special Edition re-make; no more floppy disks to swap out & improved graphics/sound/interface, plus a 'modern gamer' friendly hints (& highlighting) system to point you in the right direction when you get stuck
Certainly the help system can take the frustration out, but something I would recommend avoiding to really get the most satisfaction out of the game experience
Progress should be earned & figuring it out yourself is so much more rewarding!Another timeless point 'n' click adventure! One of the best from the era!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												For me this is a masterpiece of adventure-games!A part of gaming-history!The early Lucasarts adventures were great, including Monkey Island 2
I actually started gaming on the pc with it, that's why it is and always will be my favorite adventure game
I never played the special edition so far, but it's really well done!I like the idea of switching between the old pixel-graphics and the new special-edition
Actually, i didn't missed the old one, though it still has it's charme, as they did a great job with the new graphics (but i still can't forgive them completely what they had done to Guybrushs hair in the special edition for monkey island 1

ugh)
Even though they kinda overhauled the graphic, they still managed to keep the spirit and charme from the old pixelated graphics
The sound is great as always and the spoken voices add a lot to the atmosphere
I recommend this to all adventure fans out there

Early Access Review
								Ever programmed assembly language? You will *love* TIS-100
Yes, you will type CODE in this game
Easy code, but it's code nonetheless, like MOV and SWP and SAV and so on
Because you're trying to "test" this machine with bazillion little processors


by writing little programs in little CPUs, and the little CPUs have to talk to each other
Instead of rotating shapes and link atoms, you're moving numbers and popping registers and moving them through ports
And yes, this is intentionally looking like messing with the 80 column text days, And before you ask, yes, there's a meta game


you're trying to figure out the origin of this piece of hardware


by unlocking more bits of the little CPUs, dump the microcode, and solve the mystery


If you understand the concept of registers (and it's rather simple to visualize, but there's always a debugger to help you), then this game is a lot of fun
Though being Early Access, this doesn't have the solution site like SpaceChem but it's probably getting there soon
And this is VERY good exercise for people who intend to get into computer hardware engineering
Highly recommended


if you dig this genre

												Excellent programming puzzle game
If you've played Spacechem (also from Zachtronics) to some extent, you know how you could network factories together: molecules would go out one factory and in another
In TIS-100, you're managing data flow: you get a pre-connected network of computing nodes (that look remarkably like a downscale version of  a 1980s Transputer[en
wikipedia
org]) that can be programmed using 13 simple commands (assembler opcodes)
Each node has space for 15 commands and two pieces of data, which isn't a lot
(There's a stack memory node later
) You typically get a list of input data provided to your network, and there's a list of output data it must generate, usually based on some simple rules
For example, the input data might be groups of numbers separated by zeroes, and you need to send the sum of each group to one output and size of it to another
There's also a storyline included, but who cares
My theory is that TIS-100 stands for tis-ioo, or tease you, because that's what it does: as in Spacechem, you don't just solve the problems and move on, but you can optimize them for speed, code size, and node count, and compare your performance to your friends or general statistics
Programmers take to this game like a duck to water
If you have no prior programming experience, this game is probably going to be quite tough, and Spacechem might be a better game for you
(If you've already played Spacechem, that counts as programming experience
;-)-------------------------P
S
: On TIS-100 as a learning tool (from one of my forum posts): Branching, loops or repetition or data storage are the tools you need to learn imperative programming concepts, and TIS-100 and SpaceChem have them
TIS-100 even has a stack as a generic data container, and both games have synchronous data transfers
What I mean to say, when I recommend this for people who want to learn programming, I have more in mind than just the logical thinking - you need more than that to be a good programmer
I tutor programming courses, and I have seen people who didn't have programming experience struggle with these concepts, get familiar with them, and become able to design simple algorithms and implement them correctly
They don't just struggle with the language or the logic: they struggle with branches and loops and data storage, and experience with these (while having the brain turned on) helped them get better
You won't be an ace programmer after completing TIS-100, but I'm certain playing it teaches quite a lot of central programming concepts

												Uncle Randy unexpectedly passed away recently and you have inherited an old computer he was working on — a machine that was manufactured in 1980 known as the TIS-100
 Unfortunately much of the operating system’s code is corrupted — despite your late uncle’s best efforts to repair it — rendering the computer's origin and purpose a mystery
 Now that your curiosity has been piqued, will you be able to finish his work and figure out the reason for its existence?If the synopsis doesn't intimidate you then the game’s front end probably will
 It is an assembly language programming interface and you must come up with the code required to solve the conundrums it presents
 These problems often seem deceptively simple to resolve, and initially they are, but thanks to the limited number of instructions available on such an archaic system — not to mention the limited space to enter code — they quickly become very challenging
 As far as puzzle games go, TIS-100 makes Sudoku look about as threatening as noughts and crosses


but that is not a criticism; the complexity is what makes it so good
You just have to understand before buying that it gets very hard very quickly, and any satisfaction comes out of learning new concepts and solving the problems yourself
 This sometimes involves spending considerable time making notes and devising solutions on paper because the mental gymnastics required of you occasionally get too much
 Yes, it can be frustrating, but it’s a fantastic feeling when the solution finally hits you
 I even had a couple of great Scott[i
imgur
com] moments while taking a bath and ended up rushing — stark-naked and dripping-wet — to my untrusty TIS-100 for that much sought-after rush
Obviously this game will appeal to programmers more than most, but such credentials aren't essential
 You’re just as likely to enjoy it if you got good grades in maths and are partial to number puzzles
 On the other hand, I’ve come across users who don't fit this profile and love the game, but for this type of person I think the initial purchase will always be a gamble
Consequently, I give TIS-100 a glowing recommendation but with the caveat that it won’t be everyone’s cup of tea

Early Access Review
								TIS-100 is an assembly programming puzzle game which requires no previous knowledge of programming (meaning everything you need to know is explained in the manual)
Once you start the game, you actually just virtually start up the TIS-100 machine (e
g
you'll get a boot screen and the like)
As you can see from the screenshots, the game is entirely text-based, but the beauty of the game lies in what happens in your mind
Zachtronics managed to keep things interesting from the outset, hinting at a mystery lying somewhere in the machine and prompting you to print out the manual as first thing (something I truly encourage, too)
The TIS-100 architecture is made up of several different nodes (small square panels)
You generally get some values as input and you have to handle/modify them in order to obtain the required output
As in SpaceChem, there are of course several limitations which will hamper your task: each node can contain up to 16 lines of code, you must synchronize the communication over the port between nodes


you get the picture
I played through 6 levels, and things are beginning to get spicy
I'm perfectly aware that this game "isn't for everyone" but what Zachtronics game was? If you liked SpaceChem and are interested in low level programming, you'll fall in love with this game
If you haven't tried SpaceChem and are unsure if pure programming might appeal to you in the long run, I would suggest starting off with SpaceChem or Infinifactory, before moving on to TIS-100, because they probably feel more "fun" in the traditional sense of the word
TL;DR If you are interested in low level/assembly programming, this game will probably be a great way to have fun with it

												Got Information System bachelor degree but still solve 6 program so far
Time to burn my bachelor degree
Joke aside, this game didn't need any special programming knowledge to play
It's only moving number from one node to another, add & subtract, and simple conditional operator
The learning curve is a bit high, you could simply solve couple first puzzle with a smile in your face and then bang those same face to the table when trying to solve puzzle number 6
And the pseudo story line encrypted in nodes is also pretty goodVerdict :9/10 : Need workshop integration

												I'm just at the beginning of the game but I must say that it already has more than impressed me
The art style is just beautiful and I just happen to really like the concept of this game
It is cute but at the same time disturbing and cruel, dealing with serious and complex topics like mental illness, psychological and physical abuse an murder
Additionally, this is full of pretty weird and morbid creatures that reminds me of Tim Burton's work
It is clearly visible that this game was made with a lot of care and love
As far as I understood, Killmonday barely consists of two members who created this little gem all by themselves
This leaves me even more impressed and you can clearly tell the difference by the personal effort they put in it in comparision to big game developers who create games in mass production
So if you like point and click adventures that are not AAA-title-polished but have their very own beautiful style and if you have strong nerves to deal with the twisted themes in this game, I can only recommend you to buy this game and help Killmonday sell this game well so we can look forward to many new interesting games from them in the future!

												Very polished game
Fran has different animations when she says something, and it's not random
Her animation reflects the mood of the dialogue
Consider that each interactable object/character also has 3 different dialogue to trigger
I have never seen this level of detail in other point and click games
Also pleasantly surprised by the length of the game
My first playthrough took 15 hours
Great art direction

												This game 


This game is the most amazing game I have ever had the chance to play
I am not a person who usually plays games like this, I donated to the greenlight project of this game becuase I thought the usage of different things were very intresting
But I went into this game having average expectations, I expected getting a game that was maybe 2-3 hours long, with an average story and average gameplay, but god was I wrong
Fran Bow is absolutely amazing and really boogles with your mind, hard puzzles,weird questions and answers that makes you question your own ideas of how things are, disturbing pictures that makes you wonder how you would have reacted if you were in Fran's spot
I know many people with mental illnesses and after this game I have so much more respect for them, I already knew they had it hard, but thinking that this is what some people have in their head (probably in a milder form tho) really makes me amazed
I love this game, I love the story, I love the characters (All of them, they are so creative), I really love Fran and Mr
Midnight, I love the puzzles, the music, the animations
I just love everything with this game, except for one thing
That it had an end
I really hope there'll be more Fran Bow in the future, but that's probably having high expectations
I rate this game 10/10 if it was possible to give it more I would most definitely do so

												Do yourself a favor and pick up this game
After backing this game on indiegogo, and seeing it go over the estimate release by a year, I thought this game was going to feel rushed halfway through and just overall be bad; but I was blown away
There is never a slow point in this game, it always manages to get under your skin and makes you feel uncomfortable
Natalia and Isak crafted such a wonderful game and deserve a massive recognition for their work after putting 2 years of their lives into crafting such a great point and click adventure game!

The horrorFinally another horror adventure game
If you liked the Cat lady you definitely should play this one
It's sick and twisted
You play as the little girl named Fran, who's parents were killed and her kitty ran away
Fran awakes in the mental hospital and you must help her to find her lost kitty
On your journey you will encounter some strange creatures and travel to some strange worlds
And of course there's gore and disturbing images everywhere
The game plays as the standard point&click adventure game
You collect some items, combine them, find the use for them and talk to characters for clues
The puzzles are not very easy, but not too hard either, most of them are logical, unlike in some other games
Also the game involves a few mini games, which i don't like personally
I think there's no need for them
The graphics are perfect
It captures the mood just perfectly
The game has no voiceovers
But maybe it's for the best
The atmopshere and music makes up for it
By the way i think this song would've have been great for a soundtrack: https://www

												Playtime: 6
5 hoursI was very excited to finally play this game
Although I had a fun time with it, I'd give it about a 50/50
OverviewThe player takes on the role of Fran Bow, a young girl who experienced a tragic incident and was sent to the mental hospital
I really enjoyed the mechanic of taking your pills, that allows you to see another world which is gruesome and psychologically twisted
Switching and interacting between the two worlds allows you to affect things you otherwise wouldn't be able to, for example you could open a door unnoticed in the "bloody world" and pass through on the normal world
Gameplay & Art designFran Bow is a pretty standard point and click game, the player may move around and interact with the environment
The inventory system is easy and smooth to use
As mentioned before, there is a mechanic of switching between "worlds" or how Fran can see different layer(s) of reality when she takes her pills, which I really enjoyed
The art style is one of the best parts of Fran Bow
Everything is unique and detailed, which really brought the gloomy and dark atmosphere of Fran Bow's worlds to life
The environments especially stood out, and made entering every new area a pleasure to explore
Thoughts on storyI have mixed feelings about the story
Not going to spoil anything, but it started out strong in the beginning and kind of went all over the place near the end, finally just petering out
I wouldn't say I got very emotionally invested in the end
My favorite part was an area where you're stuck in a house of two strangers, and it was the art and atmosphere it created that made it memorable
The art style definitely made a longer lasting impression and carried the story, almost
ConclusionI did enjoy this game, and have nothing but praise for the art style and atmosphere
However the plot didn't feel tight, and at times it felt like as a player my motivation was slipping away
It was like one of those movies that you'd watch once and never again, nor really remember after a couple of weeks
I'd say play it if you have it in your library anyway (Steam hoarders rejoice), or if you feel like playing a point and click game to kill time
Having played it, I personally wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it

												Best adventure game of all time IMO
Perfectly integrates clever puzzles, humor and plot
Not much else to add -- it's a classic
Regarding this remaster, it's generally very good
The voice quality is superb relative to the original, and the graphics are much sharper
DOTT was a game that really bumped up against the old 320x200 VGA resolution
VGA didn't work very well for cartoony graphics, and the move to modern high-res has done wonders for the graphics
At the same time, it's not perfect
Had DOTT been made today, the graphics would have been sharper and involved more detail
Instead, the detail that's in the game is just what was barely possible in the VGA version -- they didn't want to taint it by adding more
This results in a game that looks very good to people who remember the original and is clearly the best version of that game, but isn't particularly impressive to newcomers
There's no easy answer here though, since had they added more detail to the graphics, purists would be complaining
All in all, it's a terrific game
If you've never played it, you should, and if you have played it, this is the best version there is

												Video Version: https://www
youtube
com/watch?v=qQOxJEqkLBAReview code was provided by the developer
Before I get into the full review, I need you to understand that Day of the Tentacle is a game from my childhood
 My parents would sit at the computer with my brothers and I all huddled around a CRT monitor yelling at mom to try different combinations of items or click on certain things, in an excited way, not a mean way
 The nostalgia is huge here for me, just like it was for Monkey Island
 However, this also means that because the game is important to me, I’m holding Double Fine to a high standard
Day of the Tentacle from a story perspective is ridiculous
 Dr
Fred Edison appears first in the game Maniac Mansion, along with some of his family and tentacles that he had created which were in that game, devoid of any personality
 DoTT, being a sequel to Maniac Mansion revolves around Purple and Green tentacle
 Purple drinks some toxic sludge from the back of Edison’s house and becomes evil, even growing these cute little T’rex arms and he then goes on to take over the world
This is the pure essence of a point and click adventure game
 You pick up items deemed pick-up-able by the devs and rub them together with other objects in hopes of combining logic and dumb luck to stumble on what the devs were thinking at the time
 For those who have never played a game like Day of the Tentacle, these types of games are based on inventory management and progression through the story comes down to using the right item in the right circumstance
 And to keep with the design consistency we’ve seen since the Monkey Island and Grim Fandango remasters, you can hotswap back and forth between the original and remastered versions by pressing F1
You play as three characters in the same world area but separated by time
 Bernard, the stereotypical pocket protector geek in the present, Hoagie the rotund metal head 200 years in the past and Laverne the utterly bonkers girl 200 years in the future
 And the entire game revolves around Dr
Fred Edisons mansion, how it looked during those various time periods and how actions in each era cause changes in the other times
 For example, Fred has two identical twin ancestors who are only distinguishable because one is right handed and the other left
 By swapping out a right handed hammer for a left handed hammer, see?  I told you it was ridiculous, you can make a statue that is in the present day mansion swap right and left arm positions, a rather important change
And one of the beautiful pieces of the design is that unlike many other point and clicks, Day of the Tentacle offers a significant portion of the game that is non-linear
 Controlling three characters in three separate eras allows for a fair bit of player discretion and while the ultimate actions are all the same, for the most part you will often have somewhere else you can go solve a puzzle if your current task is proving difficult
The puzzles in the game is identical to the original
 What is new is a complete rebuild of all of the graphical assets
 Double Fine did a very good job of sticking to the essence of what made the art style so effective and fun in this game
 It remains stylized but updated to match current day computer expectations as far as a cartoon look for a video game
 The characters are goofy looking, intentionally so and very little in the world involves right angles, and just looks enjoyably wacky as a result
They have also rebuilt the user interface
 The original Day of the Tentacle used a bottom section of the screen to contain your inventory, the action words you would use to interact with the world and also the character swap buttons
 You can use that original style UI as they did redo the visuals if you want, or you can use the new UI that was added which puts your inventory into a hover to open button in the bottom left of the screen
 This new UI also lets you right click on items and choose actions from a dial
 It is just as effective but frees up significant screen space that was previously unused for game art
In addition to the graphical side, unless I miss my mark, the audio has been remastered
 The voices and some of the sound effects are the same, but the quality scaled up from the original recordings
 New music has been added in place of the original audio as well, with rerecorded versions of songs and a number of other sound assets
Beyond the remastered art and music, they’ve also includes some nice bonus material in the form of concept art that unlocks as you play and developer commentary which can be turned on and listened to while playing
 Both of these are nice little features for the nostalgia buffs and also perhaps for budding game developers who enjoy seeing behind the curtain of the finished product
As far as game options, there is little to speak of
 You can select fullscreen, change music, voice and sound effects independently
 You can also select the original or remastered art and music if you wish inside the options as well as swapping between the bar or dial UI
 They included a controls screen that has all of your non-rebindable key controls
 It does support controllers which while awkward, isn’t ultimately a problem because very little in the game is time sensitive requiring fast reactions
 There is one section with Ben Franklin that could cause controller players some trouble, but by the time you get to that bit, you should be pretty comfortable with the controller interface
What is my conclusion?  All in all, much like the new Monkey Island versions, Day of the Tentacle Remastered is an extremely faithful rebuild of a classic point and click adventure game
 There is nothing here that made me question any design choices that they went with
 It looks great, is still a blast to play through and for those of us who have played it before, hits all of the right nostalgia buttons
 If you enjoy point and clicks, this needs to be in your game library
 If you’re not sure, it is an excellent example of one of the most popular genres of games in the early 90s and is a great experience in that regard as well
 Though, if you’re young enough to have never used a VHS tape in your life, you may want to google what SP and EP related to VCRs mean
 It will save you some pain

												As good as it was years ago, and then some!Keep in mind that this game contains a fair bit of 90s pop culture so newer audiences may not pick up on everything
If you've never played a point-n-click before this is a great starting point, as well as one of the best point-n-click adventures of all time

If you think I missed something in my review feel free to tell me  Day of the Tentacle Remastered  Day of the Tentacle Remastered is an adventure game that was originally released June 25, 1993 and now it has come back in a beautiful way
I will add a TL;DR at the end
Gameplay  In Day of the Tentacle you manage three different characters alongside three different timelines
Your actions will affect the future and you will be using items across the centuries to slowly advance through the game, and stop a maniacal purple tentacle who is going to take over the world and enslave humanity
The game has you go back and forth between different locations and slowly advance through the plot
Day of the Tentacle has plenty of humour to keep your attention, and contains a rather long playthrough for someone who has not had the opportunity to play the original
Within the game there is a developer commentary to allows people to actually hear the developers comment upon the game as you play through it (although it does cut off the natural game so I did not use it)
Graphics/Sounds Something to love about this version of Day of the Tentacle is that you have the ability to switch between the classic music and graphics or the remastered version
The remastered version has done a great job of polishing the graphics
The animations of characters doing certain objectives and the music make the game seem nostalgic and cartoonish making you appreciate how a game, even though it originally was released so long ago, is better than most adventure games we have today
Pros/Cons  Pros  + Long playthrough with enjoyable dialogue + Option for remastered or classic version+ Interesting plot and objectives+ Three different and unique characters and three different periods of time+ Colorful characters+ Humorous  Cons  - Text delay within cutscenes in certain areas (Text cannot catch up to voice)- Slight graphical glitch (Only seen once though) Final Thoughts I am not part of the nostalgic group who played this game when it was first released however I can easily say that this game is a true achievement as an adventure game
Day of the Tentacle holds quite a long playthrough for one clueless such as myself and  I love the comedy, all the different characters, the villains, the dialogue, it's simply a good adventure game, and sadly we do not see vey much of those these days
TL;DR If you played this game in 1993 I would urge getting the remastered version if you have not already
If you never played the game, and like adventure games with comedy, try the game out
You will not regret it
There are even star wars jokes within it, there is no other way to say it than this is a beautiful game that has been remastered to shine again

												If you played the original Day of the Tentacle back in the 90s, you owe it to yourself to buy this
Double fine did a great job with this remaster; it's exactly the same game only with updated graphics
Being able to switch between the new and old graphics on the fly is really cool too, makes you think 'wow, were the previous graphics really THAT bad?!'If you haven't played this before, you'll enjoy it if you're looking for one of the most classic and famous adventure games of all time
It's a great game with lots of humor and imagination, memorable characters, a fun story, and really cool artwork
Some of the puzzles are very difficult to figure out, but you- unlike those of us who played it back in the early 90s- have the internet and google to help you with anything that has you stumped, so you're good to go :p			
Posted: 22 March, 2016
												The original Day of the Tentacle was probably the best point-and-click adventure game in the 90s
After playing the remastered version, I'm glad they stayed true to the graphics and controls while improving on them immensely
They also kept the easter egg where you can play Maniac Mansion, which is DOTT's predecessor game released in 1987
Do yourself a favour: if you've never played the original, be glad that there's a remastered version that improves upon the original in every aspect and get this game!

What is it?The Room is the first in a series of three games (two of which have been released on PC, the third is still only on Android and iOS)
 It is a 3D puzzle game where you must manipulate ornate wooden boxes, highly detailed mechanisms, locks and gears, light puzzles and secret panels to unlock the secrets of the 'null' element
 Each part of the puzzle you unlock unfolds another room with more of the puzzle to unlock
 The whole game is point and click, with fluid and responsive movements all controlled by mouse
Is it any good?It is exceptional, but then the store page reviews have probably already given you a clue to that
 The game conveys perfectly the textures you are manipulating which, along with the atmospheric audio, creates an incredibly tactile feel to every moving part
 The puzzles are taxing without being impossible, and each solved part provides a level of satisfaction that ensures you can't wait to unlock the next part!Who will enjoy this?Anyone who is familiar with the Myst series of games, Obduction or the incredible puzzles of the once-great Safecracker by Kheops Studios (not to be confused with other games of the same name) will definitely enjoy this one!  As far as difficulty goes, the pitch seems perfect (easier than some of the Myst games, but still sufficiently challenging)
 Anything not to like?There is a small glitch that affects anyone playing on monitors with anything greater than 60Hz refresh rates, where the marble in the final maze puzzle can get stuck, making the puzzle impossible to complete
 However, this can be remedied in one of two ways: either switch to the beta version of the game in your Steam library (because the developers released a fix for it in this version), or simply lock your referesh rate to 60Hz for that puzzle
 Personally, I play the beta version, but I've also tried locking my refresh rate and both solutions work just fine
The only other small disappointment is that the developers don't seem overly fond of porting their work to PC and so it is possible that the third game might never find its way to Steam at all (which is a shame because ALL the games are equally brilliant)
In summary


The Room is an incredibly tactile and involving puzzle game that will appeal to anyone who'd appreciate unlocking a complex series of wooden boxes to access what is inside
 The intricate puzzles are both highly detailed and a lot of fun to solve, and are original and varied, making The Room an exceptional game
 A word of warning: this game will absolutely make all other puzzle-based games feel decidedly 'meh' when you see what can be achieved by the developers of this series!  Highly recommended!

												Challenging and original puzzles that inspire you to press on until all the mysteries the story has to offer are solved
I never played the iOS version of this game, but the PC release has been severely upgraded from the original, in the best way possible
The atmosphere is amazing and looks very good graphics-wise, the music supports the eerie feel you get when playing this game, and the puzzles themselves work perfectly well with a mouse
10/10 would recommendThe only downside would be that it's a pretty short game, though it varies depending on how well you are at solving puzzles, and whether you'd replay the Chapters or not (I've done them all 3 times already)
But look at the low, low price of this game

												If you truly love puzzle games then this and it's successor, The Room 2, are definitely right up there with the most excellent puzzle games
The puzzles require some thought but they are not stupidly put together - rather they require some logical thinking to solve and, to me, this is what makes a puzzle game truly great
Throw in beautiful art and design that compliments the game
Really my only complaint is that the controls are not all that intuitive but I just considered them part of the puzzling adventure
I suspect that I'll end up replaying this again in a couple of years - it's one of those games, like Myst or a truly good book, that you can enjoy again in the future - like reconnecting with an old friend you haven't seen in years

												An extremely amazing game truly unlike anything I've ever played before
 Valiant Hearts adds a human element to the game that is missing from a lot of these war games that we see and is a fresh break from the whole "Kill kill kill" mindset you need for those games
 The majority of Valiant Hearts is done through puzzles
 The player needs to find ways to navigate around in the game, and do it by using their smarts rather than their trigger fingers
 There are indeed parts where you do attack the enemies (you have to so they don't detect you and end the game), so it isn't just puzzles
 Each of the characters are very likable and have their own unique stories, motivations, and reasons for getting involved in "The Great War" - and the best part is that those reasons, like these characters, are all believable
 Valiant Hearts also does well in capturing the nightmare that was World War I, and does it without graphic depictions of blood, gore and violence that is prevalent in games set in war
 In the final chapter of this game the full scope of exactly how brutal and bloody this whole sordid affair was becomes obvious (there is a part where you have to take cover from machine gun fire by hiding behind solid cover- a few piles of dead soldiers are used this way at one point)
 There are also many very interesting facts this game presents about WWI that most players may not have known, so history buffs and fact lovers are going to be in for some good info
 In my opinion, it is not only good to see a game that is set in WWI when most game studios seem to prefer WWII (perhaps it is because of the "noble cause" of the allies in that conflict), but Valliant Hearts takes both an unflinching and unapologetic look at the first World War and presents something as vile as trench warfare in a manner that is much more palatable than a shoot 'em up sort of game would have been
Just a heads up, though: Valiant Hearts FORCES you to download and install UPlay
 This is a fact that is not READILY visible on the store page unless you have enhanced Steam (which I do not)
 While that fact may not have prevented me from getting this game, I just don't want to HAVE to download a new DRM console every time I get a new game from a different publisher

												I bought this game expecting it to be a quick play with a focus on an artistic art style that only an art snob would like
I couldn't have been more wrong
The game will last you about 5-6 hours, which is well worth the normal $15 that this game goes for
If you see this on sale for any less, buy it instantly
The game is simple to learn, with challenges that will stretch your brain, but once you figure them out you'll think "My god, I'm an idiot"
The story of this game is the main thing that will keep you playing this game
You easily get attatched to the charecters
They will make you laugh, cry, worry, smile, and laugh out loud
There are plenty of plot twists to keep things interesting, but not so many that the story is hard to follow
The game displays plenty of historical facts about the time period, and place, that you are playing in the game
While you are motly never directly tied to the events except for a few level designs, it was refreshing to get some background information about the world, and the war, while you go through it
TL;DR version+great story+great characters and development+simple, yet challenging missions+realitvely cheap for what you're getting out of it+The BEST intergration with music that I have ever seen in a video game-first time I've cried over a video game since Mass Effect 3's revamped endings

												Valiant Hearts: The Great Wars tells you the story of 4 different characters where destiny brought them together
As soon you start the game the first thing you will notice is the simple yet very creative art-style from the world during dark times
With brights colors and a very warm design, soon you find that while the cartoon style may try to tone down some aspects of the true events of war, the pages of the Diaries as well the photographies from these past events may hit you
I dare to say that, depending on your sensitivity one or two can actually make you feel uncomfortable, but war never was a pleasing sight to start
The soundtrack is quite simple but it’s strong enough to make a nice companion here and there or even on those tiny bits when you find a solution to a puzzle or when are about to discover something related to the main plot
You can expect one or two plot twists but it’s nothing serious, yet, the story managed to keep me hooked until the very end
I simply couldn’t stop until I found out what happened to them, and I’m glad for being able to experience this game from start to finish without feeling any sort of boredom
There was however, some emotions which brings the next point
The game may offer a big contrast depending on who is playing and how someone plays a game
If you play for a mere completionist purpose or because you simply like to play videogames, you will find a 6-8 hours long depending on how much time you take to discover the solutions to the puzzles or if you are interested in collecting every hidden object
However, this game offers much, much more depth
It’s clear that the creators did their homework and worked hard to deliver great content for those interested in the culture of war
The “Facts” are filled with a variety of knowledge from all sorts of equipment, weapons, special events, conditions from the soldiers such diseases and locations where this war took place
Since a little bit of knowledge is always welcome I found this to be a satisfying surprise to see in a 2D game
Then there is the immersion
I felt for it and I’m glad I did
By letting myself "fall" into the game I could enjoy the Story as it might be intended by the creators
A warm hearth will love the constant ups and downs that the player will experience
This game did not made me laugh, but it did made me smile quite sometimes and while It didn’t made me cry, it made me a bit emocional because they created a story showing the horrors of war, where when you are faced with a bit of hope, it quickly dies and you are in deep trouble yet again
It’s not a fair story, there are no heroes, there is no right or wrong, only wrong because this game showed how pointless and destructive is the war
The letters who are based from real ones, written by the people back then showed how the quick turn of events made regular people into soldiers and how bonds like family and brotherhood can play a decisive role during such times
I honestly hope anyone can play this game with a open heart and look at it as a mean, cruel time-machine who let you experience a tale of the horrors that happened during war and how love can patch a wound, offer hope or give the only strength to sustain such adversities when all seems lost and pointless

												Simply put, Valiant Hearts is a fantastic game
It's mix of simple yet interesting puzzling and storytelling, combined with its gorgeous visuals make a game well worth it's price
While the driving scenes act like a rhythm game, trying to dodge various things popping up on your screen, they don't distract from the overall game
The story of the first world war is somewhat simpled down to make a game that could be played by a young child, perhaps to teach them about the war
However, the diary and history facts littered throughout the game allow you to delve into the history and the story of WWI
Your faithful canine companion gives some depth to the puzzles, and also a character to feel for and love
Even though the characters themselves aren't developed massively, you can connect with them on a personal level
Overall, Valiant Hearts gets an 8/10

												One of the best all around adventure story games released in the last few years
A mix of a beautifully composed musical score, stellar artwork, great story, impressive puzzles, and real life historical content
This game actually made me think about the collectibles and ponder the historical facts as much as I did the story at times
Set during World War I (The Great War), Valiant Hearts gives you a look at individuals in war and how this particular group of individuals finds themselves connected
A German man married to a French woman who is forced to go back to Germany and fight
His father-in-law forced to fight for France
An American who befriends the Frenchman
A female doctor that finds herself crossing paths with all of them
Then there is Walt, the war dog, who becomes their ally, friend, and savior at times
While they all may battle for different reasons, countries, or leaders, they all care for one another
They all find ways to help one another overcome struggles, support one another in troubles, and connect to one another as humans rather than enemies
While the art style is cartoonish, you feel immersed with its very stylized and life-like animation
Faces and body language are done well so that you can see the story without having to hear dialogue
Even most of the speech bubbles are only pictures to give you clues as to how to solve the puzzles, or where you should go
The puzzles that are incorporated into the gameplay are interesting and clever at times
They aren't overly difficult, but a few make you feel like you figured something clever out
They are easy enough to keep frustration low and you focused on the story
Besides puzzles there are quite a few action sequences
This makes the genre tip a bit away from a point and click adventure as it would seem from the outside
These action sequences aren't hardcore fighting, or anything extremely daunting, but there is a lot of interacting with objects and other people in the game to push it away from a traditional puzzle solving adventure game
You even have a pet dog named Walt that you can have fetch you items, pull levers that you can't do, or have him distract an enemy while you slip in and steal something you need
It adds a nice change to just simply having to solve puzzles in the old fashioned way
You can actually die in the game as well, although it is only about 2 seconds of time lost if you do
Dodging bombs, bullets, and even driving sequences become part of some action sequences that keeps you on your toes and gives certain battle heavy chapters more immersion
Then there is what many may feel is annoying, the doctor rhythm quick time event sequences
They aren't difficult to pass, but can seem annoying to some with slow reactions
Within the game there are dozens of collectible items that are some of the best collectibles for any game I have ever played
Each chapter has 4-6 of them where you must find items that are pieces of war memorabilia
You will find things from war helmets, dog tags, items that soldiers made themselves to pass time, and even things like bars of soap
Each items carries with it an explanation of its historical uses in the war
You will see some very interesting and thought provoking items here
Sometimes you will find old letters from soldiers to family, or wives
Everything is quite interesting and adds a lot to the overall feel of the time period and the war
Some of these items are even from contest winners who shared things their ancestors had with them during The Great War and were used in the game
All of these are materials and collectibles you will want to read, and find not for some Achievement and completionist ideal, but because they are just that interesting that you want to see what their story is
They put a human face on the war with a bit of a shared humanity and recognition
They make you consider what it was like to be a soldier based on the things they carried, and this is why they are such a great addition
These are items that we can understand because they are simple and we can put them into the context of how they were used while in the battlefield
On top of all these collectible items you get historical data that will explain the real life battles that you are playing in the game, talk about all aspects of war from the economics, farming, civilian life, military police, and many, many others
All this additional material is fascinating and a phenomenal addition to the game
Some of these items, or histories had me pondering war and just how horrible it must have been as a soldier in these battles
Trench warfare, the weather, barbed wire, the mud
Even the idea that they were fighting in mines underground where enemies would set explosives below them to have them crushed
They really tried to give you a sense of the reality of it in this material
Valiant Hearts is a complete adventure game that excels in all areas
It is a polished experience with lovely art, a soundtrack worthy of separate purchase, and a “feels” story
It has some of the best collectibles and supporting material of any game I have played
 I would recommend this game to any fan of story games
Especially those of you that like to feel some emotion
Point and click gamers should be fine with it, but realize that there will be some action sequences that you may get a bit frustrated with if you don’t have OK reflexes, but I would still give it a chance because it is worth it
Included are 3 card drops
There are NO Steam Achievements in the game because


this is a uPlay game
It does have uPlay Achievements, but who cares about those
uPlay I had to go online just to paste the CD key in after I bought it, then I put it in offline mode immediately and never had to go back online
The game will start from your Steam Library, although it will launch uPlay before running the game every time
Since I already have about 5 uPlay games I have no issues with it
If you do then either buy it on a console, directly from uPlay, or don't buy it at all
Your loss

												First ten minutes: Haha, what a cool concept, and it's funny!First hour: Whoa, this is a game built on barely-coherent mechanics that would definitely appeal to someone with neurochemistry very different from my own
Fourth hour: I just rerouted power from a lightswitch into a power socket into an elevator call button which when activated will knock out a guard patrolling near the elevator which clears the room so when I arrive the sound detector will open a door that contains a guard whose gun is linked to a different gun on a different floor so when the guard fires he'll trigger the other gun which will kill a guard defending a laptop with sensitive data which I can only reach by throwing a different switch and leaping down through a glass ceiling and knocking out the gunman guard before he can reload at which point I bolt through the vault door before it closes

												I definitely milked every ounce of entertainment and replay value out of this game after I bought it by going for A+ grades on all of the levels and 100% achievement completion, but despite the tedium that I thought that that would entail, I enjoyed every second I spent playing this little indie gem
It has a convoluted sense of humor akin to a Yotam Perel or Edd Gould cartoon, but with more f-words
The gameplay involves 2D stealth platforming similar to Mark of the Ninja, but with a pixel-art style and a noir theme
The music is great, and makes you feel like a modernized incarnation of a gumshoe detective as you punch out guards and rewire electronics while trying to solve a twisted, oppurtunistic murder
My personal score for Gunpoint is a 9/10
There isn't much true replay value to speak of, which takes away from a perfect score from me, but like I said I had a lot of fun replaying levels and achievement hunting for over 15 hours after I had beaten the game

												After interviewing the creator of Gunpoint, Tom Francis, on my channel on this game I delved into it passionately
The game is incredibly fun and intuitive, hilarious and just all-round excellent!The game has you playing as a private detective working for both sides of the law, where you as the player are able to decide where your future will take you
The uniqueness of the game comes down to the control you have over all the electronics and nuances of the scene, letting you recalibrate lightswitches to open doors or computers to shoot guns, foiling the guards on duty and collecting your reward
I completed the game in 5 hours, with full A+s on each level, and had a great time with every minute of it! Check this out as soon as you can!Nilesy

												Richard Conway is a private detective in the wrong place at the wrong time
Shortly after strapping on his new pair of hypertrousers he finds himself on the receiving end of quite a few pointed fingers, the result of making himself seen on a security camera seconds before a key figure was killed in the same building
Rather than come clean and hope the police believe his story, he decides to take the easy root of breaking into the companies headquarters and destroying the footage, and hopefully getting out with his new coat blood stain free
Tom Francis's Gunpoint isn't what you might think
This isn't a game about guns, or about pointing them; it's about jumping through windows like a maniacal frog and rewiring security systems to suit your needs
To an outsider I imagine this sounds incredibly silly, but that's part of why it's so brilliant
It manages to be both self aware and hilarious, yet remarkably smart in every aspect of its design, and the pieces come together so perfectly that it never ceased to blow me away as I dug deeper into it
You could call Gunpoint a platformer, but if anything it's more of a human catapult simulator
Using your futuristic hypertrousers you can jump incredible distances without the worry of a quick death when you hit the ground, or more accurately, smash through a window or onto an unsuspecting guard
Movement is made even more fluid by Conway's spider-like ability to climb walls and cling to ceilings, essentially turning you into the ultimate cat burglar as you effortlessly move through buildings
It's an extremely impressive move set that feels amazing and as if its constantly evolving as you play, with new levels making use of moves you may have never used or even known were possible before, creating a constantly satisfying and stylistic loop of continual mechanical growth
Standing between you and a parkour bonanza however is a plethora of electronic doors, security switches, cameras, alarms, and other traps that will send you home in a body bag if the guards are alerted, or simply stuck in place
Luckily Conway comes prepared with the ability to hack and rewire these devices to his own uses, with the animatronic like guards being more objects that need to be rerouted than anything resembling human intelligence
This is where Gunpoint evolves into something beyond a clever hook into a ridiculously smart puzzle game, allowing you to quickly reconfigure circuits to set off other devices, open doors, disable guns, and on the whole make you feel like a tech wizard
It's not so much the great mechanics themselves that make Gunpoint an amazing game though, as it is how they are balanced so effortlessly between being clever and keeping the player moving forward, something all to often lost with puzzle games but that Tom Francis has got down to an absolute science
There was never a moment when I felt I wasn't doing something useful in Gunpoint, and even when I failed the brilliant auto save let me quickly restart just seconds prior

It can't be stressed enough just how much style Gunpoint exudes, from its subtle but unique art design to its masterful noire tinged soundtrack
The graphics are simple yet have a ton of detail squeezed into every pixel, with superb use of lighting setting the mood for a dark detective story and smooth animations allowing you to forget how simple the character designs actually are
Gunpoint succeeds most where so many "retro" games fail in making itself instantly identifiable and memorable, and using its aesthetics to compliment its mechanics and narrative
I said it before but I'll say it again, it blows my mind when I think about how amazing every single moment of Gunpoint is
The writing is witty yet crafts an engrossing, compelling narrative that didn't need to be complex for me to devour every line of dialog eagerly awaiting how it would all end
The mechanics fit together as if they share a cellular bond, evolving and challenging the player while keeping them in constant control and giving them the option to approach encounters however they see fit
The absurdly polished presentation makes it effortless to sink into its world for the few hours it takes to complete, which left me satisfied yet eager to go back and see how I might could play through it differently
It's an absolutely astounding accomplishment for something almost entirely developed by one person, and a brilliant experience that topped any expectations I might have had before hand but have since been all but forgotten
Now if I could just get a pair of those pants for myself

												Antichamber is easy to dismiss as a Portal clone at first glance; it is a first person puzzle game wherein you move from chamber to chamber, equipped with a puzzle “gun” which interacts with your environment
 But while Portal deals mostly in learning the rules of its mechanics and then adding complexity to those mechanics, Antichamber is a game which aims to subvert your expectations about how a puzzle should fundamentally work
 It makes you question the unspoken rules that video games abide by
 Frequently, it is simply brilliant and mind blowing, though occasionally it’s too obscure or random for its own good (especially in later parts of the game)
There’s no real story to speak of in Antichamber, but the entire experience is expertly accented in a very sterile atmosphere and minimal graphics
 Sound design is also minimal, but well done
 Certain audio cues can give you hints to where you are in the world, and the simple tick-tock of a clock can become a fixture of an entire portion of the game
 It’s definitely a polished game which looks and feels nice
Of course, the real meat of Antichamber is the puzzles, and it’s hard to say much about them without revealing part of what makes this game special
 Suffice it to say that it is one of the most unique and creative games that I have ever played
 Environments are frequently non-Euclidean in nature, and rely heavily on perspective or understanding the rules of the universe which Antichamber itself has defined
There is inherent difficulty in designing that kind of puzzle; if you don’t abide necessarily by the rules of physics or perspective that we’ve come to rely on, puzzles can have arbitrarily hard solutions
 For the most part, especially in early parts of the game, Antichamber does an excellent job of staying consistent and teaching you the ways of its mind-melting world
 But in the later hours, you are bound to run into situations where a puzzle solution will feel almost entirely arbitrary
 Frustration will set in, and occasionally solutions don’t have the satisfying payoff they were designed for
There was one instance where I resorted to some online hints because, it turns out, I had completed an earlier puzzle in a non-traditional way and didn’t have the resources the game expected me to have
 It took quite a bit of digging before finally understanding how I was supposed to complete the prior puzzle so I could complete the current one
One very smart addition to curb some of this difficulty is the ability to, at any point, press escape and jump out to the central hub of the world
 From there, you can see your progress and also a map of the entire area you have so-far discovered
 You can jump in to any area you’ve previously visited, and I found it helpful to jump from puzzle to puzzle I didn’t know how to solve
 Typically inspiration would strike somewhere, and my frustrations would yield relatively quickly
 Overall, Antichamber is a smart, mostly incredible puzzle game
 Moments of frustration are almost inevitable here, and for the most part the balance is hit just right so that frustration results in joyous satisfaction when you make progress
It occasionally missteps and frustration just leads to greater frustration, but it’s easy to forgive when so much of the game is so good
 Highly recommended

												Antichamber is by far one of the best games I have ever played
It is a puzzle adventure game similar to Portal
You have many different types of guns that can modify the blocks around you to help you solve puzzles
In addition, Antichamber uses a variety of different ways to mess with your head, such as the countless numbers of geometrical paradoxies
For example, you can walk through walls that you thought were solid
If you turn around at almost any point of the game the end will be right behind you
This game is extremely hard to explain but it is incredible you really must try it to find out

												You have to play this game
It is not a game, but you have to play it
It is not that fun, but you have to play it anyway
This game is hard to explain
I cannot make a pros and cons list
Please, read the review, but my advice is buy and play the game without looking it up at all
It will just ruin it
This game is not really fun, at least to me, as I stated earlier
It is not much of a game, as I stated earlier
But it is a work of art
You will lose yourself in it's surreal world
You will have to learn a new reality
You will have to explore
You will fail
You will learn
You will like
You will hate
Now, I might be coming across like this "game" is bad, but it isn't
It is not even that much of an "artsy" game
It is an experience, there are no quests, there is no seeming goal
No real tutorial, nor any hand holding
It just is
You will feel smart at times, and at others you will feel dumb
Yet, the whole way through the game is 


is




have you ever had the feeling of contentedness? Or the feeling of awe and wonder while learning or seeing new things? That is what the game is
You WILL, lose yourself in it, and that is good
The game is cleverer then you
But that is good
This game is good
Play it
Some things are always worth it

												Pros:-If you love hardcore puzzle games this is the game for you
-Unlike other shallow games, this one tells a story, the Journey of life -as it was first called
You slowly see it unveil as you make progress
-The main feature that I like is that you never know what to expect in the next step you make
The map is full of surprises
-The design is beautiful and unique
-The game requires you to pay attention to details and think outside the box, then you will realize that the solution was right in front of your eyes
It has its own logic and its own specific style, and once you come in terms with it, you will love and appreciate every single puzzle
Cons:-The music gave me headache after some hours into the game, so I had to turn the volume down
It's supposed to be soothing, but I personally found it a bit annoying
-There is no Antichamber 2

												I bought this game when it first came out in the year 2008
It cost 19
90 USD then, and I got it at full price (there wasn't so much discounts on steam back then)
Was I skeptical? Yes, I was
I was skeptical because the concept of this game seems simplistic
Of course, this game has convinced me after a while that I have made the correct investment by paying for it at full price
What this game appears to be is that it converts sound files (music files such as 
mp3 ones) into a linear ongoing track of some sort
You get to control a small little car-like vehicle, though the only movement you can perform are sideways
The speed of your little car-like thingy is determined by the pace of your music, which is represented by the colour of the track you are riding on
I won't go into detail on the blocks and game play, but that's basically it
In short, this game lets you ride the music
And yes, you can ride on almost any musical file you've loaded into the game, and this is what make this game great and worthwhile
There is one particular game mode which I like - mono
It's basically a no-brainer where you simply hit the colour blocks and avoid the grey blocks as you move forward along the track
It's a splendid mode to relax yourself with, especially after a day of tiring work when all you want is some of your favourite music and soothing gameplay
I got it at 2008, and it's 2014 now
Years passed, and many parts of my life have changed
Still, what remained the same is that, after all these years, I will still give new music a run or two here, in audiosurf
Oh and did I mention that I am still getting e-mails from audiosurf's scoreboard saying that I have been dethroned? Yeah, it's nice to see these e-mails amidst all those work mails and all

												Audiosurf is a very, very unique game and is definitely a landmark in the music/rhythm game genre
Unlike other rhythm games, which limit you to specific in-game songs, Audiosurf is limitless - it allows you to play any - that's right, any - MP3 of your choice, so you can suit your gameplay to your own music tastes
This freedom is rarely found, if at all, in music games, and it has set the stage for other music games in the vein of it, such as Beat Hazard and the more recent Melody's Escape
In my opinion, Audiosurf has infinite replay value, as long as you have a large amount of songs to play
Basically, Audiosurf is a game where you can "ride" your music to a track that moves and flows in sync with the song, as you hit blocks along the way
It’s sort of an amalgamation of F-Zero’s gameplay and Rock Band’s note charts (albeit less precise)
Each MP3 has leaderboards, and for songs that haven't been played in the game yet, you have the opportunity to make the first play on a song and create the leaderboards for it yourself
Of course, this isn't the case with more popular songs that many people have played
Leaderboards also have a comments section, where you can (obviously) comment on a song
A neat aspect of leaderboards (and probably my favorite) is that if you get dethroned from the global leaderboards on a song, you’ll receive an e-mail by default, though you can turn it off if you’d prefer
You’ll also get an e-mail if an Audiosurf friend beats your score on a song, regardless of whether you have the throne on it or not
There's also several ways you can play Audiosurf: just for fun or for competition
Audiosurf has a variety of different characters that are well-suited for both beginners and the more advanced players, amongst three difficulties - casual, pro, and elite
For example, Mono is the easiest (but also lowest-scoring) character, with a simple strategy - hit the colored blocks and avoid the greys
Then, there are the trickier (but higher-scoring) characters along the way, such as Eraser (my most-played character), which allows you to erase blocks and undo erases to create organized matches, and Pointman, which allows you to scoop up blocks and place them in different spots
It is highly recommended that beginners start with Mono, though, as I have had friends try the more complex characters from the get-go and it did not go very well for them
However, I’m not going to go as far to say the game is for everyone, as people have different strengths and weaknesses when it comes to video games
Aside from the fact that you obviously have to like some sort of music, quick thinking, reflexes, and sense of rhythm play a big part as well
Also, if you are one of those people that tire out of songs easily (like myself), you shouldn’t have a problem for the most part in Audiosurf, but if you play for competition and someone dethrones you on a song you like, you may end up playing the song repeatedly to get a good-enough run to reclaim the throne
It’s happened to me a time too many :PAll in all, if you’re a music lover and want a new visualization experience to go along with your music, Audiosurf might be for you
Be warned, though - it’s very addicting if you have a large library of music

													You are staring at your steam games
There is a big list of around 70-80 games
You bought them couple games on the steam summer sale, but they have become bland, boring, and gray
You see you have an extra ten dollars left over from the last game you bought, which for you has also become boring quite quick
You scroll through steam and something catches you eye


Audiosurf
As you check the main page you see it might be fun and buy it
You play for 3 days straight
	This, is just as I was with Audiosurf, Bored of all my boring war games, the idea was old, and I needed something new
When I got audiosurf, I played the sample song,but thet quickely realized you can play custom music
Me, being a music person had a lot of music downloaded, but others may have to buy a few tracks and albums
I played everything, ranging from Skrillex to Nirvana to The Beatles, but this game can be played with virtually any game
This colorful cheap game was a new expirience to me, the gameplay was like nothing I have ever played before
With the charactor moving fastley dodging some colors and collecting others, making combos, passing song, it was extraodinary
	Audiosurf has many charactors, each with different powerups
Some will scramble colors, others may avoid certain colors or jump colors
The most uniques charactor (and my favorite) Is Ninja mono (With ironman Mode on)
It increases speed and difficulty, and all blocks are the same, but you must avoid gray blocks
But some others may prefer different charactors, I enjoy the ride, but some may go for points and records
	Overall this Casual Music/Rythem Game has had me play for days and is quite addicting, but like everygame it has its flaws, it may have beutiful art and interesting gameplay, but after the first few days, you will only play it on days when you have almost nothing to do
Other than that this game is amazing
If you want a cheap game that will give you something to do and you love music, buy this game

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Trine Enchanted Edition Original Release: 2009 Genre Tags: Platformer; Adventure; Puzzle; Coop; Beautiful Artwork   My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 12-30 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamers; Multiplayer gamers REVIEWTrine is a light game that is easy to digest but offers gripping visuals, a mystical atmosphere, and enticing gameplay
 All of the features of the game are simple in design but intricate in execution
 The gameplay, aesthetics, and narrative all come together to create a whimsical and charming adventure
I highly recommend this for all gamers to consider; and for fans of the genre it is a sure bet
By far the best aspects of the game are the stunning visuals and alluring atmospheric presentation of the setting
Each and every environment you explore is diverse, captivating, and charming
The ambiance really captures the mystical aura of the game perfectly
Trine easily has one of the most immersive 2D gameworlds I have encountered in video games
The gameplay is light and quick to grasp
Anyone should be able to dive right in, regardless of ability level
But various difficulty levels and a "hardcore" mode ensure that skilled players can still find a challenge
And whether you are playing on “easy” or “hardcore,” the gameplay is entertaining
Mixing elements of platforming, action, and puzzle solving with the unique identity of the game establishes an experience that is simultaneously familiar and novel— and irrefutably fun
The story is whimsical and fantastic; and the characters are pleasant and endearing
This synergizes well with the aforementioned atmosphere to establish an amusing fantasy experience
But it also remains light and relaxed, and never takes itself too seriously
 So even casual fans of fantasy will enjoy the narrative
Trine is definitely a worthy pick-up
No matter what your standard preferences are, you should give this game some consideration
Check it out
Addendum:  The game was upgraded to a better engine and to add online coop
The new cooperative mode adds an extra layer of possibilities, as the unique gameplay is a joy to experience with friends

												What a gorgeous game!Pretty fun and easy to master
Totally worth!I recommend it!

												Trine is a puzzle platformer with some action thrown in there
You have three characters that you can switch between on the fly, similar to the old Lost Vikings game
You first have the most useful class, the Thief that can use a grappling hook to wooden ledges, a bow, and a flaming bow to light torches
Then you have the wizard that can magically make boxes by clicking or holding the right trigger and draw a box
You can also draw platforms and click and drag specific things to move them or get them out of your way
You can use your boxes and platforms to crush enemies
These first two classes are a lot of fun and have a lot of depth, but then we get to the third class / character, the warrior
He is just your straight up sword swinger, effective melee character



with a shield that seems pretty useless
The game is very beautiful, bright and vibrant
It is also very physics based and the physics feel nice
There are nice visuals with diverse settings and instead of cut scenes, the game just uses narrations as you play, which I greatly prefer
Since it is so visually beautiful, it can be a beast on lesser video cards, even at the lowest setting
Your platforms and boxes crush enemies, objects can be thrown into enemies or through destructible walls, the grappling hook lets you swing, and you can wrap hanging spike traps around platforms so they don't fall
I seemed to get the most fun out of unintentional things, such as teeter tauter platforms combine with Ferris wheel like platforms coupled with skeleton warriors jumping and sliding around to fill the room
The platforming dynamic of moving physics based platforming was a lot of fun
The controls are very simple, and a controller is highly recommended
You have a jump button, a change weapon button, a trigger for drawing boxes or a grappling hook, two shift character buttons, the left stick controls the character, the right stick is like an aim for the bow, to draw platforms and to aim your shield (which is useless when you can easily dodge attacks)
You can aim the bow and the longer you aim it, the further the arrow goes
If you don't like switching between characters, you can also play with a friend, but it is sad there is no online co-op
Each character has their own health and mana bar, but the mana never really seems to run out with enemies constantly dropping potions
If one character dies, they're dead until you reach a checkpoint, even previous checkpoints
If all three characters die, then you simply restart at the last checkpoint
Its a forgiving system, which I'm happy about
As you progress through the game, you'll level up to get your choice of skill upgrades
You'll also find new tricks and skills
The enemies seem competent and dangerous enough
The basic enemy is the skeleton that comes in four flavors, standard, shielded, archer and pyro
They will jump over pits, climb, fall and do everything to get to you (except archers that stand and shoot)
The enemy AI seems good enough so every situation can be different  There are also spiders and bats, but for the most part, that's it
It is a quick game, about 4 - 6 hours, but still a fun play through (not as addictively fun as Guacamelee)
There is some replay value here with collecting stuff from each level and no playthrough feels exactly the same due to the physics and AI
It was a good design choice to have collectables stay collected when you enter each level so you don't waste time getting what you already had
If you can get it cheaper than $10, go for it
If you're not into puzzles, avoid it, because the combat is pretty shallow

												Nobody really knows why this game is good
It's written down on a scroll somewhere
It's a platformer in an ocean of platformers
It's sweet and pretty, it's enough and not too much, it's easy on Normal and sometimes annoying on Normal, cos who enjoys falling to their death repeatedly? But that's the genre
Get into the swing of things using Thief; mow down skeletons using a bow with up to three arrows in one shot
If she's dead for some reason, choose the knight to mow down even more skeletons
If these classes fail, use the Wizard to get to the next checkpoint
You can even fly Aladdin-style using two conjured planks on top of one another, once you turn on levitation
Leviosaaa, baby!I haven't tried co-op  and I've yet to play the game on Hard mode, but I'm 4 achievements shy of 100%, so I felt comfortable enough to share my thoughts
Finland has some great developers, so I feel good about supporting them
I rate this game "Ihan mahtava, peukalot pystyyn!"			
Posted: 12 February, 2016
												Beautiful graphics, pleasant background music, decent amount of humour and comic mischief, item pickups, straightforward puzzles and arcade platformer
Achievements are reasonable and can be obtained singleplayer or co-op with 2/3 players
Published Steam community guides, online walkthrus and videos are available and all achievements can be obtained during normal playthrough of the game, after several attempts replaying a particular chapter as well as the option to replay each completed chapter on Hard difficulty

												I think we should have more of these games nowadays
Trine simply looks stunning! It successfully captures the atmosphere of a medieval fantasy world
To make it interesting we have 3 protagonists - a knight, a rogue and a wizard - but we can only use one at a time
And no, the wizard cannot conjure up lightning and summon creatures or throw fireballs at the approaching enemies
Amadeus can only create boxes, planks or triangles - objects with which you can proceed further ahead on each level
And this is where Trine shines: There are many puzzles and you need to think and find the solution
Occasionally, you can progress fast but on your way you notice you have left some collectibles behind
So, while completing the game does not necessarily take long you are apt to spend hours with the game just to make a 100% progress on each stage
Frozenbyte did a wonderful job when releasing this gem back in 2009
Instead of picking this one you should look for the complete edition which has its sequel, the DLC for the 2nd episode and the soundtrack included
Here in Hungary the retail version of the same bundle costs around 5 EUR and you can activate all the contents via Steam
You cannot go wrong with this one and as Trine is regularly discounted you can easily find it for a suitable price
Just make sure to grab it with a friend as the sequel includes co-op mode!

Three's companyTrine is great fun in single-player and it's worth experimenting with the three-player co-op even if the game works best as a solo experience
Players are given a set of tools (three characters with unique abilities) and are presented with problems that can be solved in several ways, resulting in an adventure that feels wide open despite being relegated to a mere two dimensions
The beautiful visuals and sound bring this world to life and there is something new to discover around every corner
A lack of enemy variety, disappointing conclusion, and the wonky multiplayer keep Trine from greatness, but this is still a highly recommended puzzle platformer

												Very rarely do you come across a game that is a work of art
The areas, music, characters, and gamplay complement each other in such a purfect way
A must buy
10/10great co-op and single player and story to boot

												My thoughts on Trine:Trine is a beautifully designed 2D action-jumping-fighting-puzzle solving indie game
You get to play three differennt characters at once - a knight, a thief and a wizard
While obviously only controlling one of them at a time, you can switch between those three at any time, using their individual strenghts and abilities to make it to the other side of the map
As the knight, you're armed with shield and sword and are capable of lifting heavy objects and throw them at your enemies
The shield can be used to block any incoming attack, while the sword is the perfect weapon to deal with the growing numbers of skeletons, bats, and other enemies that you'll encounter
The thief is armed with a bow and thus able to fight enemies from afar (duh), and can shoot a rope on wooden objects to swing across pits, pull herself out of them in case you still manage to fall and perform cool looking jumps
As the wizard, you can summon cubes or planks to make yourself an easy way across pits, build stairs to get over high cliffs or drop them on your enemies
Each ability and spell can be upgraded throughout the game, like letting you shoot several arrows at once, create more cubes to stack on each other or make your sword even deadlier
There are hundrets of casks granting you exp or mana hidden across the game and finding (and reaching!) them all is no easy task!The graphics are among the best I've seen on a 2D game, only behind this games successor Trine 2
A special praise goes to the awesome person who created this beautiful soundtrack, the music fits this game just perfectly
I personally didn't like all of the jumping parts that much, just because I'm usually not a big fan of jumping games (and suck at it too), and died several times over
I know I'm criticising a jumping game for its jumping parts, so someone who's into that kind of stuff will have a really good and challenging time with this game
For people like myself, it's still enjoyable, and swining around with the thief is fun, but after a while it can get boring
There could be more different enemies too, since in like the first three chapters or so all you fight are skeletons and bats
Lots of good things to be said and a few bad too, still I'd recommend anyone to buy this game, especially if it's on sale for like € 1,- or so

												A beautiful blend of action, platforming, and puzzling Trine manages to offer lots of fun and even some challenge
There are also some RPG elements through level ups, skills, and hidden equipment
I will admit, the story wasn't very gripping and my friends and I would often just skip it, but the gameplay is top notch
Armed with a bow, the thief is the most agile of the three and you can use her grappling hook to traverse the environment
The knight is the traditional melee character and comes with a shield, sword, and a hammer
Probably the best character though, is the wizard
He can create boxes, planks and floating platforms, and he can also move them around
If that doesn't sound exciting, wait until your slinging boxes at all your enemies or throwing planks on your friends to make them fall into pits
When you aren't busy knocking each other off of cliffs or into fire or spikes, you will find that Trine is an extremely well made co-op game
Everyone character and player really has to work together to get through the game, and everyone fills a role
The thief's grappling hook is perfect for those hard to reach places and she is often the one retrieving experience potions, though she can hardly do it alone and the wizards platforms help immensely
The wizard is arguably the leader of the team because he is able to carry everyone on platforms, disable traps by obstructing them, and he can handles enemies fairly well with his objects
Admittedly, the knight seems to have the short end of the deal as he really only shines in combat; he can throw boxes and break walls, but there are very few cases outside of combat where he is absolutely necessary
Trine was the only local co-op game me and my friends would play for quite a while, it was just too good to put down
Now with the automatic update to Enchanted Edition, this game just got better
This game goes on sale often, and I buy it for friends whenever I can because this is a well made game and this is great developer
They worked tirelessly to completely update a 5 year old game that probably didn't rake in as much other less deserving games, and when they finished they just included it for every owner for free
You might find find a better action platformer, or a better puzzle platformer, but you probably won't find a game that blends the two together well and offers a terrific co-op experience

												Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile
She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome
I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released
 To be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it
 Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations
And it was worth the wait
This is an awesome piece of art
As a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace
Visually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios
The gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming
Finally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot
Rakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles
It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist
It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title
Thank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen

												Let me just dry my eyes again




this game is amazing!The characters are ALL totally unique, they have you relating to them in many different ways, the music is amazing and certainly helps set the mood in some emotional situations
One moment I was laughing at the funny jokes in the dialog and the next I was wiping the tears from my eyes as the game tugged on my heart strings!The game takes you through many different stories, all of which are tearjerking, funny, warm and sometimes a little scary and they all have their own hidden message for you to reflect on, you could learn a lot from this absolute masterpiece! I could talk about this game forever but to save me doing that I think you should buy the game and experience it for yourselves, I can promise you that you won't regret it

												If you think you're the target audience for this game, you probably are
It's a game with a story to tell, and that's what it does
It's a story about grief and loss and regret and hope and accepting the inevitable
It's about acknowledging the awful unavoidable things that occur in life--disasters, illness, accidents, bad decisions--and how people can decide to handle the awfulness and the importance of understanding
It's a game split between a hospital filled with patients with long-term illnesses, and a brightly colored fantasy land populated with cute animals that mirror the occupants of the hospital
But the fantasy land isn't really a happy retreat from reality, and it's not a bright paint-job over a horrible truth
The kid-friendly atmosphere isn't trying to hide the brutal reality of what's happening, just to look at it in a different, brighter light
If a story-driven game with light puzzle elements and an unapologetically bittersweet story sounds good, you'll like the game
If not, you probably won't
To the Moon comparisons make sense, but I do think that Rakuen hits emotional notes that will resonate with a wider audience
And the game has a dedicated 'talk to Mom' button; more games could use a talk to Mom button

												If you liked To The Moon, you’ll probably like this game
Rakuen is a bittersweet, yet endearingly hopeful, emotional rollercoaster
It made me laugh, it made me cry, it gave me chills, it broke my heart and soul, and it made me wish things were different
Bring some tissues because there will probably be a 99% chance of precipitation originating from your tear ducts
The story is about a Boy who is in a hospital
He has a book called Rakuen that his Mom reads to him every night and finds out the world inside the book, Morizora’s Forest, is real
He’s able to travel to that world through doors that appear in the hospital and the game combines elements from both worlds into the story
There are characters in the hospital that also show up in Morizora’s Forest, and you have to find out what happened to these people (in both worlds) – what are their dreams, regrets, and hopes?  There is no combat in this game – it focuses more on exploration and character development
The puzzles were not too challenging, nor too frustrating
The story itself is broken into 5 different parts/arcs and all of the arcs blended together seamlessly
I got really invested into the characters and their storylines
I could relate to each story in some way, which got me even more intrigued to find out what happened to these characters
There are a ton of endearing characters, like a little girl named Sue who collects marbles that have planets inside of them and Tony, a grumpy old man who guards a broken music box
There is such a huge contrast between the hospital and Morizora’s Forest
The hospital is gray and drab and is the location where most of the scary-ish scenes occur
It’s where the majority of the depressing elements of the story will come to play
Morizora’s Forest, however, is vibrant, colorful, and has adorable inhabitants
There are beams of sun that move as you do, giving a resplendent feel to the forest’s charm
The music is upbeat and everyone there is (generally) happy and very comical
Although the game can be very sad, there is a lot of humor in the game as well and provides good comic relief during the unrelenting sadness
There were moments where I would be bawling my eyes out but there’d be some humor laced into the scene, so I’d be laughing with snot dribbling out of my nose
The world of the forest itself was full of ridiculously humorous characters
I was dying when I saw what the equivalent of a cat is in the Forest
One thing that I appreciated, and loved, was that Mom was a huge presence in the game
It established a great dynamic of Mom’s and Boy’s relationship and showed how far Mom would go for her son
Mom was always there with you, to guide you, to give you helpful hints if you aren’t sure what to do next, and to even hold your hand when things got scary
I’m 27 years old, but I felt so much comfort and reassurance in having Mom there with me all the time, especially during scary scenes
Mom was such a badass – she’s strong, witty, smart, kind, reassuring, sassy, super knowledgeable about tea, and always looks at the goodness in people - and she even comes with dad jokes! She’s a beacon of hope in the darkness
The graphics and art style are super cute
I like cute things (sue me, I’m a grill) so when I saw how adorable the Leebles, buds, minimoris, and more from Morizora’s Forest were, I was a goner - I died from cuteness
The music was phenomenal
I can’t really say much more than it was amazing and added so much to the mood and atmosphere
The music alone would make me want to cry sometimes
The game itself is pretty short and I wish it had been longer – if only because I didn’t want it to end! I took my time with the game since I wanted to explore every inch of both worlds
It took me 9
5 hours to finish the game – that includes all the stopping to bawl my eyes out and finding the strength to go on
This game is so magical and heartwarming and instantly became one of my top favorites
It will take you on a beautiful and amazing journey
I can't recommend this game enough!

												I have never cried at the end of a videogame
Not in UndertaleOr in To The Moon
Not in any story-based game I have played or watched a playthrough on
I cried so much in playing Rakuen, I could probably fill up a sink with tears- of happiness and otherwise- and fill up a bucket to water my sky-island-reaching plant
I felt for these characters
I laughed at their humor and cried for their pain
This is why you should just buy the game- even if you think you know what will happen
Even if it was spoiled
Even if you have never played a game like this before,please buy this game
This game not only shows what small-dev groups can do, but what games should be like
In the recent years of game sequels, game devs becoming lazy and creating terrible games, game creation that lacked a certain finesse,games that are full of happiness, sadness, humor, kindness- everything a good story gives- are the games that should succeed
Please help one of these great games, one full of something that means more than destroying monsters or enemies, succeed
Buy Rakuen

MaestroRakuen has the potency of a violinist’s last note
The bow moves, the fingers tighten, and the string sings with a cry of joy,  pain, anguish, or hope
A spotlight shines down and the musician bows her head in silence, surrounded only by the circle of light and blackness of the stage around her
 The audience, frozen in place from the tenderness of the moment, tries to gather themselves from the emotion of her performance
Yes, Rakuen is like that
 I never saw it coming
Here, out of this sweet little game packaged in an RPGmaker wrapper with happy faces and cheerful dialogue, came a tempest of storytelling
 Make your comparisons to other games like To the Moon if you like, but this game can make you pause for a moment, shocked at the very real drama that unfolds within a single scene
One minute I am picking Sila Berries, the next I simply forget to breathe as the tragedy of the story leaves me with that sinking feeling in my gut as if I am falling
 Perhaps it rang too true with me, maybe I’m a softie
 What I can say without a doubt, though, is that Rakuen makes the player actually care about characters like very few games can
Gameplay/StoryWhat I’ll begin with is our lead character, Boy, a young child, of perhaps eight years of age
 He is in a hospital, along with many other characters, recovering from an illness
 A doctor informs him of a thief that is stealing items from the hospital, and to the Boy’s surprise, his favorite book, Rakuen, has been stolen as well
 The Boy sets out to find the culprit and retrieve the book, leading to an exploration of the hospital by opening drawers, discovering keys, collectibles, and solving puzzles along the way
 The real meat of the game opens up after speaking with the entire cast of hospital residents and staff
Once the book is retrieved, the Boy’s Mom appears and she stays with him throughout the rest of the story
 She gives him a key to unlock the book’s magical land of Rakuen, which apparently is not just a story, but also a fantasyland juxtaposed to the real world of the hospital
 Strange portal doors begin to be revealed, and the Boy and his Mom travel to Rakuen through these doors
 Once there, they discover the land of Rakuen is in dire straits
 The powerful forest guardian spirit, Morizora, has fallen into a dark sleep due to the negative energy of the Envoy spirits who are changing the forest into a land of doom and desolation
 It’s up to the Boy and his Mom to save the land by helping the inhabitants cope with their problems and collecting parts of a magical song called Mori no Kokoro in order awaken Morizora
 Once awakened, Morizora can grant the Boy a single wish and save the forest
Right here is where the game takes on some adventure gameplay that feels quite a bit like the Blackwell series of games
 Two characters are being played at the same time, the Boy and his Mom, to uncover clues and find out the tragic story of the other characters with the sole intention of helping those people find peace
 Each time you help someone, you get a piece of the song, Mori no Kokoro
 What you won’t need to worry about, however, is how to combine items
 That part of the game is done automatically once you figure out the puzzles and locate the keys or objects required to progress
 That said, the puzzles are cleverly broken into sections that take some thought to figure out
 There is nothing incredibly hard, yet you may get stuck occasionally due to a single key element that has yet to be uncovered
 Rakuen has the uncanny ability to layer the clues and puzzles in such a way that the answers may be elusive even if the actual solution is right in front of you
 Most of the difficult puzzles are in the first few sections, with the latter half of the game being much easier to get through
The main part of the gameplay that separates Rakuen from other games is that there are counterparts in the real world of the hospital
 For example, with Winston and Gemma, Gemma is in a coma in the hospital with her husband Winston at her side
 When going to the land of Rakuen, you see the exact same couple with Gemma sick in bed and Winston caring for her
 In order to set these lives straight, you must visit their past, and patch together the story
 The key here is that you interact with their past and show each character how to unburden themselves from the weight of their unhappiness
 Each time a song is sung that becomes a piece of the final Mori no Kokoro song to awaken Morizora
 There is no fighting, no leveling up, or weapons
 Players are only able to help people not fight them
So, at this point, you may ask, “What’s so special about that?”
 For one, there is the dynamic of a child who is dealing with the arduous task of assisting these people with his mother by his side
 Just like in Blackwell, the secondary character protects the main character, guides them, and helps with useful hints here and there
 It also forms a relationship, one of the key components that made Blackwell successful, when two people are involved with each other you feel that connection between them
 It not only moves the story along, it creates the opportunity for the mother to become a significant part of the plot
Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, Rakuen creates segmented drama
 There are scenes where you want to continue with the story but have to unlock a series of events that go further than a simple explanation
 A mere storyline is not enough
 There are properly set-up scenes, not unlike a theater play
  Here, Rakuen bravely drops hints of underlying secrets while keeping the big secrets in mystery until the final curtain drops
 You complete one area only to discover another hidden alcove with insight into the backstory of someone, or a tiny snippet of life much like the calm before the storm
 And then, there is the presentation of pacing
 You might be completely unaware of the power of a scene until you get to the center of the story and have your heartstrings pulled when it all finally clicks together
 It takes a lot of care and effort to pull that off correctly, and Rakuen does it in spades
Final ThoughtsEver have someone give you an origami figure that you unfold and discover a hidden story carefully tucked away inside?  That’s Rakuen, a small and compact game which reveals the most endearing game experience I’ve had all year
Rakuen’s focus is about personal connections
 Each character has lost that connection and it is up to the Boy and his Mom to reassemble those bonds
It’s also about a tragedy, and I’ll warn players that they very well may cry during this game
I certainly did, but I’m prone to that because Rakuen hit a nerve with me
 When I was a little boy my sister had cancer and I remember those hospital rooms full of patients, each with their own personal stories of how they got there
  It’s not easy to manage through that and I’ve never seen it portrayed in a game through a mother and child point of view
 It’s unique and touching, making you feel like you are right there in the hospital with them
Each scene is carefully constructed, with very close attention to the pacing and timing of select moments
My throat got dry
My eyes welled up
I have to admit, it can be hard to take as the game pulls punch after punch
 Yet, the journey is worth it
 Rakuen aims right at your feelings with no holds barred
 I’ve seldom come across a game that tackles real world tragic events and uses them as core components of a storytelling experience
 The pain you feel is entirely because these things can and do happen
 The fantasy of Rakuen took me to a place I certainly did not expect
 It connected me back to those difficult memories of the hospital that I purposely tried to forget
 I wasn’t sure how I’d feel at the end but I have to say, I am thankful
 My rating is an AutoSave, I encourage anyone who loves storytelling to purchase this game

												A beautifully written experience from the dev, Laura Shigihara! Don't let the simplistic art style fool you, this game is spicier than the spiciest meatball you've ever tasted! And I've tasted some spicy meatballs! (In a good way!)If you've played and enjoyed 'To The Moon,' and have been craving for a fresh new experience; this game does it all
Amazing music that seems to fit every situation
Cute and funny character development, even with characters that don't have a huge impact on the story
Oh, and most importantly

the feels! I've had games make me teary-eyed before, but this game made this 6'2 bearded man emotional
If I'm correct I believe this is Laura's first game


? If so, she nailed it first try!Do yourself a favor and pick up this work of art! 10/10

												For me, Rakuen is a great showcase of video games as an art medium
Combining the cinematic storytelling with the exploration mechanics of classic Zelda titles, Rakuen is an incredibly personal project and you can really feel its creator's touch on every aspect of the game
As a non-combat, story-focused game created with RPG maker, I'll try to focus my review on these elements specifically
Thematically, it's probably easier to compare Rakuen to titles outside gaming realm such as the animated movie 'Spirited Away'
Rakuen's main themes are family, friendships and the duality of life & death, which it generally handles pretty well - even though the pacing, depending on the player may seem overly melancholic and in some instances even pushy
I've seen many people hype this game up mainly as a tear-jerker, what for me feels both as an overstatement and disregard to other parts of the story which I found great
I do think that Rakuen has a touching plot, but the real highlight for me was its amazing side characters and hilarious writing that acted as a good counterpart for the overrall sad tone
On a mechanical level, Rakuen shines
The limitations of the RPG engine and how the developer approaches them is often a good way of judging a game, and Rakuen feels like the framework was created for it and not the other way around
Completely dropping combat aspects works well, and the usually tedious puzzle-solving of RPGM titles is done in a way that entwines it well with the story
For me however, the enjoyability of said puzzles varied greatly
A classic Zelda-esque dungeon was an amazing experience, but some of the more cramped and ominous parts felt monotone and only times I wished for a peek in the walkthrough
Graphically Rakuen is a treat with good character design, beautiful enviroments and fitting effects
The unique artstyle coupled with original soundtrack might not be for everyone, but they really nail home the creator's passion for the project
Overall, Rakuen deserves the praise it's gotten - if it had been published to a handheld console ten years ago, it would be definitely praised as a classic gem by now
Even now, it's a great example for both what you can do with such a simple engine and the emotional depth you can create with a videogame

												Rakuen starts off slow, but never loses the player's attention until the heartbreaking end
What makes this game feel so special is, in my opinion, that it just feels complete
While there is still room for interpretation, the game will answer all relevant questions through its great storytelling
And not only the main story is crafted this well, every character in this world feels unique, like a real living being
For 10 Euro (15 incl
Soundtrack - definitely worth it!!) I highly recommend Rakuen,because - even if it suffers under the same 'weaknesses' as other storydriven games, e
g
not offering enough gameplay, it does not need to hide behind To The Moon, Life is Strange etc
as it will definitely touch your feelings, and this game did it even more than any other game that I have played before
Please spread the word and give Rakuen a try even if you are not a fan of RPGMaker products,as this is the perfect example of a storydriven game highlighted with the right use of music at the right time
Thank you Laura Shigihara for this experience!

Early Access Review
								Door Kickers is one of the most extreme tactical SWAT games I have ever played
It offers hugely evolving gameplay and a load of weapon combinations to suit your playstyle
You will be able to use armories from multiple countries (Germany, France, UK, US, etc
) and also have different forms of each weapon (Silences, or non-silenced) for you to be able to in stealthily or blow your way into the enemy lines
You will also have the option of creativity as each time you do a mission you will want a new strategy, and it allows you to have multiple ways of getting into a room, from pick-locking a door to blowing it down with C4 or shottgunning the lock
You will also enjoy the challenging gameplay of only having a limited amount of men and will likely be outnumbered, forcing you to strategize and plan instead of rushing them like it's a Third-person shooter
Also note this game is being created by a small, indie team
So you will not get updates every other day, but it seems so far they have been having extremely large updates every two weeks, which likely means they love there buyers so much they are over working themselves
If you have the money, and enjoy planning and then watching your men burst in and dominate the enemy or have one thing go wrong and watch your team get slaughtered, then buy the game
It's fairly cheap and really innovative to the market, it's also in early access so there is so much more to come and it's completely playable and almost bug free in its current state

												Door Kickers is an immensely fun and at times highly frustrating game for all the right reasons
Tasked with commanding a team of SWAT members in numerous different scenarios, in a top down tactical manner
You need to plan and execute raids upon drug lords villa's, a hostage situation in the suburbs and anything inbetween
 You need to consider each and every detail of these raids, from the men you are picking to go on it, the classes best suited for the job and which weapons would be most effective
When all of this done, you are able to map out routes and commands for each member of your team before executing your plan
This can lead to moments of brilliance where your best laid plan completely cleans out an area without a casualty or it can end in a flashbang not going far enough into a room and your entire squad being gunned down in a doorway
 This is where Door Kickers shines, through its iterative process
Not every plan is going to go off without a hitch so to progress through the harder levels you need to learn from your mistakes, change your plans on the fly and be ready for anything that could go wrong because once the bullets start flying it can become increasingly difficult to keep all members of your squad alive and well
 The rating system also encourages multiple tries at levels, trying to get a better score or finish a challenge such as completing the level with only the one SWAT member
The game also offers a campaign mode, where the stakes are ramped up even further
As any of your team who die on campaign missions will stay dead until the end of the campaign
Adding another level of caution to your plans as the lives of your team become even more fragile
 It's through this harsh and sometimes punishing ruleset that moments of brilliance shine through as you manage to plan out an elaborate and well executed raid with all the considerations of a real SWAT leader

												I couldn't expect something amazing due to tons of mediocre indie-games nowdays, but this one, GOD


9
5/10Pros:- music is just brilliant = 40% of whole atmosphere (like Payday 1/2)- very rich tactics- really fast and smooth client- simultaneously shutting down 4 enemies by 4 troopers spawns huge 0rgasm
Sadly, this is not a joke :(- tons of missions and ways to complete them
I mean, TONS- slick and easy UI- mods support- mission generator + built-in mission maker + possibility to share it- this is how every Warhammer40k tactical game should look like, just change the skin and you got mindbreaking legendary crusadeCons:- lack of narrative briefing for missions like story, characters and intrigue (remembering Gunpoint), just short descriptions- when multiple troopers paths are crossed it is becomes too hard to micro-command like look there, step here- RNG sometimes looks weird, like one try you one-shot everything and another one you're wasting whole magazine for one guy- sometimes your troopers AI just stuck stopping your unit before some doors- I know this is not the core, but I guess with some gorgeous graphics engine it would look just marvellous
Anyway, these guys did so amazing game, it's just very good VS best
Verdict:It was long time ago since I was so satisfied with some game
For tactics genre this title has everything, this is how small team stomps most of AAA brands

												Doorkickers is a 2D, Top Down tactical strategy game with real-time and pause
This title has been on my radar for a very long time and I decided to pick it up during summersale
Now I have finally played it and I have to say that it's great!If you enjoy games like Xcom you will most likely have fun with doorkickers, or if you have an interest in swat games and tactics planning
This game have so many levels and challenges you can complete
Also there's a story, although it felt just like the normal quick games I would say
You can also create your own maps and download others for unlimited fun! Save hostages, kill bad guys and capture wanted criminals
Its intense at times but it's always fun to play!Doorkickers comes with all the neat steam features like achievement, steam cloud, etc
Game runs well and you have a good options menu
You level up your soldiers in game and unlock new classes and weapons
This game is great and I would strongly recommend everyone to at least try it out at some point
This is one of the only good games that came out of early access!

												* 5 Trooper Classes plus Sniper (Mission Dependent)* 70+ Weapons and Gear Items* Six Campaigns (Perma-death)* 80 Independent Missions* Viewable Replays* Global and Individual Stat Tracking* Cross Platform Import/Export Saves* Mission Generator* Level Editor* Steam Workshop* 43 Achievements* 8 Different Trading Cards* No SympathyDoor Kickers harks back to a time when gamers were thought to be intelligent
A little bit of information is given to the player about gameplay mechanics and the rest is left up to them to figure out through trial and error
This, in part, is why there's no "do it this way to win" approach to informing the player
Inspired by the planning stages of Rainbow Six, with a SWAT aesthetic, and turned into a feature length game, it all makes sense
A player must learn to play the game much like they must learn to understand how to deal with the situation in which their troopers find themselves
Or be left to suffer the consequences
Although it's possible to make arrests and to subdue assailants with a taser, that's not where the emphasis lies
The opponents you're dealing with are all presumed to be heavily armed and willing to kill you on site based on the knowledge that they most likely already have
Once you understand that, the gear and equipment options available in-game will make a lot more sense
That is why this game is more comparable to Rainbow Six than Swat 3 or 4
It's not about getting a conviction but dishing out the punishment because the verdict has already been made
I highly recommend this game
But that recommendation entirely depends on the type of gamer you are
This game is for the thinker
Sometimes you'll make a plan that will take a few seconds and so will the mission
Other times, you'll spend a few hours only for the mission to fail
It's not the game's fault, nor is it yours
That's just a harsh reality and simply a matter of learning from such mistakes
If you want mindless satisfaction, are looking for a game that plays itself, or were born yesterday, this is not the game for you
This game is a challenge, your enjoyment will entirely depend on whether or not you'll accept it as such and rise to the occasion
So the question is: do you accept the challenge?			
Posted: 3 December, 2014
												This game is top notch! If you loved the Rainbow Six series and SWAT 4, you'll probably love this even more
Fan of RTS and action games, you must give this one a shot
This is basically one of those games where it gets better and better as you get used to the mechanics and unlock new stuff
Door Kickers is a tactical RTS game where you take control of a SWAT team and save the day through hostage rescue missions, bomb defusal missions, VIP escorts and everything else a SWAT-based game should have
The game can be played either by planning everything at the start of a level and watch as the team executes your orders (Rainbow Six style) or by taking control of your units in real-time
You can also do both, since the action can be paused at any time (recommended for starters)
PROS+ Tactical SWAT gameplay at its finest
Assign equipment to each unit, plan and execute any way you want; easy to pick up and play
+ Many guns to choose from and different classes each with their own advantages and disadvantages
+ Very high replayability: lots of individual and varied missions, campaigns, map editor, random mission generator and great mod support
+ Awesome soundtrack and clean graphics that match the atmosphere of the game
+ Still gets updated with additional free content and bug fixes
CONS- Slightly frustrating at times- Some Workshop mods may be incompatible because of the new updates
Personal rating: 9/10 
Posted: 23 October, 2014
												Pros+solid gameplay+passable sound effects+good level design, and distinguishable terrain
You won't get confused as to what's what
Very useful for this type of game+Ability to plan out the execution of an entire mission, and watch your men methodically carry it out in seconds
+Ai works well at following said plan  +Customization: Lots of gear to choose from and unlock
+Level designer/randomizer: Unlimited replayabilityCons- A little bit pricey for my taste
I prefer $10-15 at most for an indie game of this quality- Still a few bugs to iron out- Can get hard to plan moves for your last member on your team, as the order lines stack up Techical issues-Can't seem to plan my men to swap their weapons twice during the planning phase
I can tell my men at a certain point to pull out their secondaries, but I'm unable to tell them to swap back
I have to wait till they actually change weapons to order them swap back at a later time
Can be annoying when trying to unlock achievements for each level
-Unable to hide other units command lines during planning phase
When you have commands issued for a large amount of soldiers, it looks like pasta all over the place
Can make it very hard to issue orders to the last soldier on your squad
-Sometimes I want to order a certain swat member to throw a flash bang through a door, but a nearby teamate stacked on the door recieves the order instead
The game needs a toggle function for ordering stacked teamates to do something instead of the default choice
-When cancelling a command, it sometimes does not dissapear, making you have to backtrack your soldiers moves a good bit to fix it, or restart them completely
Rating: 8

												it's pretty obvious that the best way to kill terrorists is by kicking doors down
they get real scared by that stuff
following on from that, door kickers is a game where you kick doors down and then save hostages/clear houses of terrorists
I am being unnecessarily facetious here, it's a really fun game but it's really difficult as well
if you like XCOM and stuff then you'll enjoy this game
also this game is better than real life because my mum and dad only let me open and close doors, not kick em or blow them up
life sucks huh

Product received for free
												I got this game as a birthday present from a distant friend
He knew my passion for strategy and planning
It is hard to add to the many other positive reviews
On the plus side, this game is well-thought, simple, and yet it allows for various degrees of sophistication
In particular, I like the opportunity to try different gaming styles (planner, aggressive, solo, non-lethal, etc
)
This adds to a high degree of replayability, with achievements that will satisfy all the min-maxers around the globe
Another praiseworthy feature is the possibilty to download further content, both official and user-generated
On the aesthetic side, scenarios are pleasing to the eye and graphics are detailed without overworking the engine (as it is expected in such 2D map games)
I didn't really like the star system, becaue it rewards timekeepers over perfectionists
Moreover, it makes it very easy to access powerful gear very early in the game, but apparently that's also true for real life: some of the most effective guns in the world are not the most expensive, and have been around for ages
Random mission generator is a bit boring, though, and this game's strength are the campaign and official missions, each of them with their own peculiarity (storming the embassy, freeing a cruise ship, boarding a plane, etc
)
In my version of the game I miss a "shuffle" button for randomly generated maps: this means I have to enter and exit the menu to generate new keys and new scenarios
Finally, although background audio effects are interesting at first, they become repetitive quite soon
Overall, my judgement is more than positive, because the pros clearly outweight the few cons of the game
My congratulations to all developers, artist, and producers for such a neat product
Also, a big thank you to Texisthelex for having sent me this gift

												This is entirely addictive
4 hours flies past like nothing
Can't sleep
Must Peggle
			
Posted: 23 December, 2013
												Peggle is a fun casual game
It's very straightforward
Aim for the orange pegs
Hit the green ones to get various power ups that change every few levels
The power ups are all very different and keep things interesting
Some are not as useful as others like the lobster claw flippers
Each power up makes you think differently about how to approach a level
As straightforward as the gameplay is, Peggle isn't simple
You only have 10 moves to clear all the orange pegs and it's difficult to predict just where your ball may bounce at times
Most of the time the results are what you aim for, but sometimes the judging an angle slightly wrong can turn into a wasted ball
Other times, you might just get a layout that works against you
While the design is always the same, the placement of orange pegs varies
But that's the challenge of Peggle
There are 55 levels in the game, so plenty to play through
You can always replay levels of your choice later outside of story mode to try your hand at clearing the entire playing field of all blocks
I wouldn't really consider Peggle a largely re-playable game
I played through story mode twice on a non-Steam version of the game, and playing through again on Steam didn't really hold my interest
But I would definitely consider this a great game for at least one or two playthroughs that is worth it's price point
The only negative aspect of this game is the resolution, which is low and doesn't stretch to fit widescreen monitors

												Wow!, what a colorful and  addicting game this is
 When I first played Peggle several years ago it took me back to the old arcade  games I used to play when I was a kid, standing on the pier spending all of my  money on those machines
 That game was called  Pachinko,  (where you send a metal ball bearing spinning around a series of peg like mazes, trying to  get your ball to drop into various cup like  recepticles on the board)  and it is  still all the rage  over in Japan where  whole arcades are devoted to the game
 Peggle has become one of   my favorite 'short term'  arcade games of the last decade barring Ricochet Infinity and Gish
 What I mean by short term, is the ability to play  for  just a few moments in between other games, or when  on a coffee break from more important  things
    With Peggle,  you have to  attempt to knock out all the orange pegs  from  various arrays of  blue and orange pegs  (55 levels in the adventure mode)  using a ball launcher/cannon  that fires a ball from the top of the  game board
 You get 10 balls  to clear the board of the orange pegs
 If you can clear the whole board of both orange and blue pegs plus any special pegs,  you get  extra bonus points
 There's a bucket like object that is constantly on the move at the bottom of the board
 If your ball falls into this you get your ball back which in turn makes it easier to complete the  round
There's also  more points gained depending where your ball finally comes to rest, with a jackpot score of 50K  from the central well, 25K from the two adjacent wells and 5K from the outer wells
 The first time  you fail to hit any pegs  you will get your ball back, but this only happens once on each board
 Each new board includes two green pegs that give you one of several special powers when you clear them away
 These can  help you clear  the orange pegs away easier, for example  you may get   a double ball that enables yopu to clear away  a lot more  pegs, especially if you get it early on in the level (as more pegs get in the way), or extend the length of the ball catcher to give you a greater chance of catching the ball and getting it returned to the ball launcher or  a marker that shows you where your ball will bounce
 Some of the powers come into effect immediately (like the double ball which only lasts for that turn) or on the next turm that last for the next three turns; (the latter power is very useful for  aiming your ball for maximum effect)
 Each of these specials  continues through several levels before changing to a new power, that are introduced   via Peggle Masters
  There's also a purple  peg that when hit  gives you bonus points
 Each time you flick a new ball, the  purple peg changes position
 Scoring over 250 000 on one board  gains you an extra ball as well
There's four different modes included with the PC version, Adventure mode with 55 levels spread over  10 stages,  quick play, which allows you to play any  board you've already unlocked, duel that  allows you to play against either the computer or a friend (with the X-Box version you can play online against up to 4 players) and finally theres the challenge mode, which has 75 harder levels and is locked until you've completed the adventure mode
 There's two different  versions of the game available on Steam,  Peggle Deluxe and Peggle Nights, both of which are well worth buying if you  like arcade games
 Sadly there's no  level editor, but Steam do have a free version  Called Peggle Extreme that features   levels dedicated to Half-Life 2, Portal and Team Fortress
 There's only  ten levels with one special (also known as Peggle Masters), and five Challenge levels, but it's enough to gives you   an introduction to the game
 It's more like a demo, but is different to  the two commercial versions, so is worth getting if you  like the game
  I think they also made a second free themed  version that's not available on steam, but I've forgotten what the theme was
The beauty of this game for me is that it never gets boring
 The levels are  vibrant and  enjoyable to play;  each time I replay the adventure mode or replay  levels via the quick play  mode   the game is  never the same and it's great  playing against friends or family, sadly it's only local play on the same computer and you share  the 10 balls
 If you play against the computer  you can select one of four difficulty modes
  The game is  only £4
99 on steam  in the UK  or $4
99 in the US (it's cheaper to get a freind in the US to buy it for you if you live in Europe)
 I oriignally paid $20 for each version   via Reflexive Arcade when it was first released seven years ago
You can see a video speed run of the whole game HERE  (it's 2hr 14mins in length), which gives you the opportunity to skip ahead and check out all of the various levels available in the deluxe version  or you can check out the free Peggle Extreme version HERE

												Amanita Design is one of those developers that I love to death, and in their case it's because all of their games are so unrelentingly joyful
From Samorost's kooky cosmic critters to the pleasant rustbuckets of Machinarium, their games exude pure happiness in the form of upbeat gibberish, uncomplicated puzzles, and positive themes no matter how dark individual moments may get
Botanicula is another notch in this merry belt, one that has no trouble juggling goofy vignettes with existential threats
Once upon a time there was a very nice tree, full of little bugs and sprouts and assorted critters
Some spidery thing showed up and started devouring it all with a sort of creeping darkness, and a small band of the aforementioned critters escape with the tree's last seed
Struggling to stay one step ahead of their monstrous adversary, the critters journey through a colorful arboreal world in search of a new home and a fresh start
What this actually means is you have five little dudes who roam around as a unit, following your clicks from screen to screen and interacting with the many living things of Botanicula's world
As an adventure game there's very little player input, relatively speaking
There's only left click (and on occasion mouse proximity has an effect) and only on specific points of interest like critters and items
You don't move your team directly, but rather click on arrows pointing to different areas
These limitations actually serve to benefit the game, especially as the scope of the gameplay expands
Botanicula's world is strange and alien, and most of the puzzles wouldn't work at all if they required more exact input
Instead, you can just click on little creatures to make them fly or yell or burp, and as long as you do it at the right time or in the right order or at all, you can make progress
The scenes your clicks produce are so funny and heartwarming I doubt anyone will have a problem with relinquishing control for them
And then later in the game you'll get to pick specific critters on your team to do things, collect items to use in puzzles, and work through a few more nifty gimmicks
The story is another strong point building on these basic mechanics, a remarkable feat given that it is told entirely without dialogue
The folks at Amanita have mastered the art of storytelling through action and expression and it does tremendous work here
All of the adorable denizens you meet speak in mumbly Sims-like chatter but get their points across through wild gesticulation and the occasional visual aid
This hands-off approach both heightens the impact of events (good and bad) when they occur, and also keeps the game feeling lighthearted and silly the rest of the time
You're also encouraged to experiment with everything you meet, because interacting with new critters earns you collectible cards that can score you extra scenes at the end of the game
You'll experience the world of Botanicula through a mix of vector art and photoshopped works, a finely-blended style that gives everything just enough weight to seem real, without losing its fanciful, dreamlike energy
The peppy soundtrack follows suit with all sorts of cutely and folksy tunes to keep you engaged
The artistry on display here is rare and unique, and makes the game feel like a real treasure from its simple beginning to its unexpectedly epic conclusion
Botanicula makes another excellent entry in Amanita Design's lineup, and an unforgettable title for any fan of point-and-click adventures
Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them at https://goldplatedgames

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Botanicula Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Point & Click; Adventure; Casual; Puzzle My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 4-7 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Novelty seekers; Casual gamers REVIEWBotanicula is an incredibly charming, short-and-sweet game which is frequently described as having a “happy” identity
 It is a point-and-click style, casual adventure game that takes you on a wondrous ride through a microcosmic fantasy world inhabited by bugs and critters
 Any fan of point-and-click, adventure-puzzle games will likely enjoy the experience
The best feature of this game is the overall charm inherent in its delivery
 The art style and the soundscape together create the alluring atmosphere of the game
 The simple story is told through animations and emotion-filled sounds rather than through text and dialogue
 Despite the simple storytelling mechanics, all the characters you play and those you meet are uniquely interesting and charming
The actual gameplay requires you to progress the story by solving puzzles via interaction with the world around you
 It will be mostly trial and error; but nothing is too daunting
 I felt the puzzles were a good balance of tricky and sensible; but they are not all necessarily logical
 You will have to think about the puzzles in terms of the wacky game-world dynamics
The game is rather short, even shorter if you rush through the main objectives
 It is more enjoyable (and still somewhat short) if you take the time to interact with everything and see what you can discover
 There are plenty of hidden “Easter eggs” and collectibles scattered throughout the game to cater to those who enjoy treasure hunts and achievements
Botanicula is definitely a well-designed game that was created with love and care
 I recommend that any point-and-click, adventure-puzzle gamer considering trying it
 Its charm will cater to fans of the genre both young and old

"MADE IN CZECH REPUBLIC"I can't really help myself, but when there's game that coming from Czech or Slovak Republic, I just want to get them 10/10 and 10/10 only
Nope, I'm certainly not patriot, but goddamn we can make some great games
Especially indie ones
Yes, Arma and Mafia is one thing, but Botanicula oh lord
Another great example of game that is indie and truly is indie
I guess you know what indie game is suppose to mean and also you know that some games are "indies" just to cover the lack of quality
Anyway, Botanicula is truly beautiful
Basically it's for everybody but also not for everybody
When you check the images, you might say that you'd sit your child in front of that and that's game for children but it's only beacause of visuals, that might give you cartoon atmosphere, or something you've watched when you was 4 years old
But guess what, that's indie genre dudes
You want to know how awesome Botanicula really is? Imagine some interactive picture of let's say forest
You can move your cursor whereever you want, and every object that you can see will act like that cursor is there and behave like it's there
So the leaves will move in the direction cursor went, small twigs too, nuts, chestnuts or other forest fruit
Simply said, like you was there
Audio is on whole another level
It was done just by two guys that goes by name DVA (Bara Kratochvil & Jan Kratochvil) and they just done their work perfectly

												Delightful surrealist art! Great use of the element of surprise, adorable humor, cute characters, bright and lively  visuals, very good soundtrack, clever puzzles


Botanicula explores themes of nature, cooperation and discovery; awe-inspiring and very charming

												Botanicula is a point & click adventure set into a strange microcosmic world
I got the game during a Steam sale due to the enticing visuals
And after watching the intro, I got immediately hooked into the storyline
Amazing that this game was created by such a small development team
Botanicula will not appeal to everyone, but if you like a creative adventure/puzzle game with a decent plot, this is highly recommended! An enjoyable experience!Pro:+ appealing visuals http://steamcommunity

A true delight!**Edit update 23
11
2016: Nominated for the 2016 Steam Awards "Game Within A Game" award**Botanicula is an Indie, point-and-click, puzzle adventure; brought to us by the Czech creators of Samorost 1&2 and Machinarium, Amanita Design – if you enjoy either of those games, you will take delight in this
The thoroughly organic world and its inhabitants are highly imaginative, some even bizarre-looking and -sounding
Some players may consider it too succinct, or even more attuned toward children
The simple story, though solid and sweet, does not require heavy ruminations – this is a game of the senses, pure and simple
You control a group of four friends on a mission to plant a seed
The main goal on each level progresses you to the next level; the puzzles are intuitive
The price of the game, whether regular or on sale, is appropriate
Yes, it is a Flash game
(Interesting to note that I cannot enjoy tBoI or Windosill on my current PC setup without gameplay becoming bogged down almost instantly; but with Botanicula, never any bogging or catching
) Summed up: the graphics, gameplay, sound and music - all superb, A+++
What more can I say to get you to try out this lovely gem?


There was a tremendous amount of heart put into this game, truly
Botanicula is a visual and (emphasis on) auditory indulgence: you may think you're just going to ease into it, test the waters with your big toe; but you will be swept away and never realise it till the ride comes to its satisfyingly, cyclical conclusion
It offers a kind of cleansing and respite, whether from the mundane of the outside world, or to just step away from frenetic and adrenaline-packed L4D2 runs
The sounds are sheer ear candy – you want to touch everything
The world is strange and wondrous: during first-time gameplay, you never know what manner of creature or environment alteration will manifest itself from your curiosity-driven touching; subsequent gameplays (for myself, anyway) do not fail to continually instill such positive feelings because the graphics, music, creatures and environment (plus their corresponding sounds) are just that sublime
While there are, sadly, no cards to obtain from playing this game toward earning badges, the 47 in-game, animated cards more than make up for it; and count toward the game's 53 achievements
It is rewarding to collect them all (and yes, you will aspire to collect each and every one of them in every gameplay you attempt, even the time-spent Svolavac
(Though, I think there should be a card for the 3 jingle-y leaves that tumble out around your feet - other gamers like myself may know what I'm alluding to
) The names of the creatures achievements are in Czech, and punching them up into Google translate will not only add to your enjoyment, but enlighten it, as well
The music steals you off from the word go, setting a pace perfectly harmonised to what is happening in the game, at that time
A previous reviewer here made mention of the burst of cheery song that erupts when you achieve a goal – it really does fill you with sheer happiness, no kidding


and lately, when playing L4D2, I've been thinking how cool (if a bit bizarre) it would be, hearing that tune after everyone's made it alive to the saferoom


Definitely give it a try, if only to experience the eye and ear candy


if it doesn't turn out to be your kind of game - or you can only enjoy one gameplay - you will know someone who'll love it

												This game right here is great
From it's simple story to it's great randomness, there's nothing i would complain about
 The art is amazing and the gameplay is awesome and intriguing
But most of what i loved about this was it's music and the sound effects, just brilliantly put and they even make you feel rewarded when you figure something out or stuff (though everything was pretty easy to figure out)

												Botanicula is now my favorite point-and-click adventure game, because it’s the only one I’ve ever managed to beat without a walkthrough! Well I lie, I had to use a walkthrough ONE time
But yeah, it’s quite easy compared to similar games I’ve played, and as a result, I found it much more enjoyable, because I wasn’t lost all the time
It’s also made in Flash, and shows that Flash games can look and sound really good
If you like games with unusual art styles, you should check it out

												Bejeweled 3 is probably one of the best Match 3 games available on Steam, or if not, then it's definitely the most complex one
It features various game styles, thus satisfying different gamer personalities
If you like to be under pressure, then there's the Lightning Mode, in which you have a timer that you can be increased by quickly match some special time gems
Diamond mine provides a similar tension: there's a timer too, but in this mode you dig in the stone and sand by matching 3 - 5 gems in order to uncover treasures
However the most stressful game mode is probably Ice Storm - in which you have to fight the climbing columns of ice that quickly threaten to cover the entire board; to prevent this you need to have quick reflexes and a very good perception of the available matches
In order to beat this game mode, I had to switch to mouse and keyboard controls (mouseovering the tile selects it and WASD moves it in the corresponding direction)
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=446286039On the contrary, for those that like a more relaxed approach, there's the Zen mode - the classic Match 3 in which you can enable/disable different relaxing background effects and positive affirmations
Another relaxed mode, but more suitable for those that have an analytical mind or love to strategically solve a puzzle, is the Butterfly mode, in which some of the gems are transformed into butterflies that automatically move one tile up whenever another match is made; having one of them reach the top of the board ends the game
This implies that you have to plan ahead your moves and optimize the matches so that they contain as many butterflies as possible
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=446286100I found Poker mode to be the least attractive of all these modes - you are required to build certain poker hands by having consecutive matches of the same colors
It's a game of chance, since your poker hands highly depend on the randomness of the current tiles
Lastly, there's the Quest mode that contains 40 variations of all these described above: finding a certain number of treasures or freeing a certain number of butterflies, or ticking bombs that need to be matched before the timer wears off etc
The game adapts itself to the game mode you're playing
For example, in Diamond Mine or Ice Storm mode the game will provide you with suitable gems to create matches or 4 or 5 which result in special gems that help clearing up the board faster
In Poker mode you’re more likely to have gems of the same color grouped together, thus facilitating the process of obtaining good poker hands
All-in-all, this is a good Match 3 game, if you enjoy the style
But it's quite addictive, so it will probably keep you entertained for hours
Even more so, going for 100% achievements requires a lot of time of grinding

												This is a lot more satisfying than I thought it would be
Eight game modes, achievements where some you can just let happen and some you gotta focus a lot and fitting music for each mode
Its something anyone can pick up and play and also attracts hardcore people considering stuff can get crazy
I'm great at this but not to where I can get all achievements, doesn't bother me
The ones I suck at are the  ice and lightning modes
The one I like but it makes me sad is the  butterfly mode because since you eventually lose, those butterflies die


I want to kill that ****ing spider damn it!! My favorite ones are  digging for gold and relics and the poker mode
Its so satisfying to get a Flush of 5 gems or clearing the entire screen when digging and get that 90 second mega bonus
So many clever ideas for a simple puzzle game, no wonder this puzzle game is advertised as the #1 puzzle game, its freaking crazy and clever

												Being based on the simple 'Match-3' principle, this game might be considered dull or boring by people who don't like the concept, but for people who do (including yours truly), such games can get really addicting
Ever since I got 4 Elements and beat it, I've been looking for a similar game to fall down to, when I'm not in the mood for anything involving a steep learning curve
I've had my eye on Bejeweled 3 for a while, but paying $20 for it just didn't feel justified
So I waited and waited



until it was finally 50% off during Steam's autumn sale, and then I snatched it
My greed told me to keep waiting, as I would've loved to pay even less, but I decided to shake off the greed, telling myself that for $10 it was a fair deal
As soon as I started playing, I realized this game was worth every cent of the $10 I paid, if not more
It manages to take this simplistic and supposedly "dull" concept of Match-3 and make it as much fun as it can get
It has quite a few game modes, including some with really funny twists (such as the 'Poker' or 'Butterflies' mini-games)
I won't keep on rambling, I'll just summerize it - if you like this type of games, Bejeweled 3 is as good as they come
If you're not up to paying $20, wait for it to go on sale or get a coupon or whatever, but either way - make sure you do get it

												Very addictive match-3-type casual puzzle game
It's really easy to learn
It has a few modes
My favorite are "lightning" and "ice storm"
It's fun to beat your own high scores and your Steam friend's high scores
Why is it better than other "match 3" games?1
It's absolutely responsive
This is very important in game modes that depend on reflexes
If you mess things up, it's always your fault, not because the graphics stutters ;)2
The music is quite cool

Really satisfying and entertaining
You get a full game
There are no microtransactions
Very good game to casually waste 10-20 minutes of evening and forget about the world!

												Bejeweled is actually one of my favourite "classic" games
It's one of the original Match-3 style games, with everything done right
From different modes, to combos, to the timers, the sounds, the graphics, everything is satisfying and it has none of the gated frustration of most match 3 games have these days, catering to the mobile in-app purchases crowd
Where candy crush makes me want to punch a baby in annoyance, Bejeweled makes me purr with happiness
And trust me, I'm not that easily pleased
I do think this game plays better on a touch screen device, I play it a lot on my iPad, but you can get extremely fast matches for high scores once you're used to the keyboard commands
Mouse clicking makes it kinda hard to beat some of the achievement / score timers but still fun
If you are wondering how to beat some of the achievement challenges and you're using the mouse - switch to keyboard matching
It'll be slower at first but once your fingers and brain catch on it's a LOT faster
If you don't enjoy mindless timewasting match 3 games then you will not enjoy this game - but if you like simple, satisfying puzzles, big combos and lots of challenges, this is one of the best match 3 games I've played - and I've put in hundreds of hours on my iPad that I don't even regret

												Long before there was Candy Crush, there was Bejeweled
This is a simple, casual game with a grid that requires you to shift colored jewels and match them into lines of 3 - 5
You can only shift 2 jewels if it will result in a line of 3+ matching colors
Very easy game, but where this game blossoms is all of the mini games / variations of it
Dozens of modes, all centered around making lines
There is classic mode that has you going through levels making lines, lightning rush, which has a very limited time and you need to collect time ups to keep going, diamond mine, where you need to match lines near the bottom rock to destroy the rock and progress further down
Bejeweled poker which every line is like a hand gains you something similar to a card in poker
Butterfly mode has you making lines with jewel butterflies to keep them from reaching the top of the screen where it will be an end of game
There is also a never ending zen mode, which is just like classic only without levels that break the flow of what you have going
Finally, there is an ice breaker mode which forces you to keep up with rising and freezing water
Once a line gets frozen enough its game over
In a way, I prefer Candy Crush, because they have focus on levels, rather than letting you free to pick modes to play
I just feel overwhelmed with all of the choices and just end up playing 'classic' mode for the most part
On a plus side, unlike Candy Crush, there are no micro transactions
You've bought the whole game and need to unlock the modes
Bejeweled 3 has a level system that keeps track of all of your points throughout all of your games and a high score amongst your friends
That seems to be my real driving force to play the game, just to beat my friend's high scores and since every time you play, you start with a random grid of jewels, its got something to do with luck as well as skill
I can recommend the game, but I could recommend it more on the phone
I just feel there are better games I could be playing on my PC than something as simple as this
Tetris sold Gameboys, not  Nintendo Entertainment Systems

												Pony Island is an interesting game
Levels are a bit repetitive at first
Eventually you get powerups
After that, it gets more interesting
Some of the levels get pretty tricky
Early on, all you can do is jump
Hovering is added a bit later
Enemies come at you every few seconds
Left mouse button to jump over obstacles
Push enemies away with right mouse button
Make it to the flagpole and you can advance
Every so often you get a "Puzzle Break"It's kind of like a programming puzzle
A butterfly is trying to get to its house
Moving arrows around defines a route
The butterfly follows the arrows
Reach the house to advance
Anybody can learn this game
Please give it a try

												I can't review this game without spoilering, so here is just a recommendation for it
Sorry, folks!I enjoyed it, but found it in parts a bit difficult
It's a great mix of brain-teaser and dexterity game, embedded in a plot you unveil during the game
You will spend a great deal of the game playing an increasingly difficult series of levels where you must jump over obstacles and shoot enemies in a 2D setting, going automatically from left to right
So if you enjoyed the Bit
Trip
Runner games you will enjoy this
Length of the game: 2-4 hours for 100 percent
Recommended: When on sale for 2
50€ or less

												Help
I'm 8161 puzzles in and i can't stop
This is like minesweeper, but better
No randomness, way better mechanics, unlimited replayability
It's all about logic and stuff
Just the right level of challenge for me
I'm way too hooked
Also each puzzles takes me 1-4 mins
Just woke up? Time to sneak in one puzzle
Queueing up for LoL and nothing to do? Sneak in another few puzzles
Some one save me
Edit 24/09/2016: 10 000 infinite puzzles finally
http://imgur
com/a/NiiFCEdit: Cons: After you've gotten the hang of the game, it's not challenging anymore
In the infinite puzzles you can make as many mistakes as you like, no penalties, and if you solved them it's still considered completed
It's up to you to challenge yourself to make no mistakes and/or speedrun
But it's still very addictive
Minesweeper kind of addiction

												The Hexcells series are my favorite puzzle games
 It's true that minesweeper is an easy comparison, but also unfair, as it would be to compare a modern car to a Model T
 A bit of math, much more logic, an infinite puzzle generator, and you've got yourself a puzzle game that will last forever!  Buy it now!DISCLAIMER:  Forever is a really, really long time, and you won't be around to see it
 Rest assured though, that whoever is around will be able to enjoy Hexcells forever!  Just not you

												Hexcells Infinite offers more of the same logic puzzle awesomeness that you find in the rest of the Hexcells series
If you were just going to get one of the trilogy, this would be the one I'd recoomend
The random and daily seed puzzles, plus the level editor and ability to download and share custom puzzles gives this third title in the series a replayability that the first two Hexcells games can't touch
I was a little hesitant in picking this up at first, since I found the difficulty jump between Hexcells and Hexcells Plus a bit daunting and couldn't imagine a similar jump in complexity between Plus and Infinite, but fortunately that wasn't the case
I found the difficulty level overall in Hexcells Infinite to be somewhere in between that of the first two titles
The game is a challenge, but not a frustration
I do still recommend the entire series, as it's one of the best puzzle games I've found on Steam (or elsewhere), but if your budget is limited, Hexcells Infinite offers the most for your money
			
Posted: 25 June
												10/10 I honestly can't think of any downsides other than maybe that you cannot make your own levels
It's got a random level generator and 36 dev made levels
Its like minesweeper but more complex
There is a lot of "if this then this" stuff
If you love to play old Windows XP minesweeper but want a bit more challenge, then you will likely enjoy this game

												Day 1: Just finished the game
Man, that was challenging
Hey, what's this? An infinite mode? Let me try it out


Day 2: These randomly generated puzzles are great, I'm having a blast
Day 5: Still playing this infinite mode
Maybe I should stop
Day 24: Had a nightmare where I couldn't figure out the solution to a Hexcells puzzle and had to guess
I woke up in a cold sweat
Day 57: Didn't


didn't I have a job and a life at some point? I think I did
Oh well, onto puzzle 1172
Day 133: I can solve forever


Day 376: My debate skills have dramatically improved
Every conversation now appears to me as a hex puzzle, with all the branching paths, dead ends and subtle nuances of social interaction reduced to pure rules and numbers
It's beautiful
Day 804: I have finished my prototype for four-dimensional Hexcells
Within this game will lie the answer to everything
Day 2755: My God, it's full of cells


Seriously though, buy this game

												This thing is intense and a marked improvement over its predecesor
 The packaged puzzles are mind-bendingly difficult
 I've played for six hours and I'm only 50% of the way through the game
However, there's also an "infinate" mode -- where you can use a random number generator (or today's date) to create a puzzle that is less imposing but still a lot of fun
 This adds the replayability that was missing from the first title
All told: I found it very enjoyable and recommended for anyone who likes Minesweeper, crosswords, and other such puzzles
			
Posted: 27 May
												Yes, it is similar to minesweeper, but it has many more dimensions of logic than minesweeper which make it significantly more interesting, challenging and rewarding
 I've completed like five out six levels so far, and I find it actually a little too challenging and often get stuck for longer than is fun
 It is, however, very rewarding when you complete a level
 One important thing to know: YOU NEVER HAVE TO GUESS
 There's always enough information to KNOW what is the right move
 If you think it's too arbitrary because you're guessing all the time, then there's another level of logic for you to discover
 If you enjoy hard puzzles, this is for you
 If you enjoy very casual games, this might be harder than you would like

												Simply the best number matching puzzle game of them all
The generated puzzles are inevitably not a patch on the hand-crafted ones, but even there you can find the occasional gem
 The main puzzles are brilliant, with a gradual (though much steeper than previous versions) difficulty progression
All three Hexcells games are excellent
 New players should definitely play them in order (Hexcells, Plus, Infinite) to get the most enjoyment out of them though

												The only game series I must 100% and my favorite puzzle series
Smart, clean, and it's got jokes
If you believe that hex grids and numbers can be jokes
(Jokes are usually in the form of ? hexes and are always on you
)The auto-generated puzzles are less tidy but great for quick <10 min breaks between whatever else your doing
A+			
Posted: 8 September, 2014
												The third and most likely final sibling in the Hexcells family, Hexcells Infinite, like its title suggests, provides an infinite game experience: in addition to another set of 36 hand-crafted levels, it includes a random puzzle generator!The hand-crafter levels are about as difficult as the ones in Hexcells Plus, or marginally easier (either that, or I'm just getting better at solving them
) I regret that only one of them provides special instructions (in this case "each column contains an odd number of blue cells") as I feel more of them would benefit the challenge variety
This absence is also partially responsible for the scarcity of satisfying "aha" moments, when several clues combine beautifully into a challenging part of the solution
Previous games had me complaining about the puzzles' less than perfect elegance: you usually have quite more clues than you really need
This is still a problem, even if it's now marginally less severe than it was
Another issue, especially for newcomers, is that nowhere in the instructions does the game direct your attention to the box at the top left corner, containing the number of yet undiscovered blue cells, even though it's an essential information for many of the puzzles
All of that didn't stop me from enjoying the 36 puzzles and feeling a real satisfaction each time I could perfect one
They are more missed opportunities than mortal sins
The real attraction of Hexcelles Infinite, of course, is the randomly generated levels
There are 100 millions of them, so there is no risk of running out before growing completely tired of Hexcells
You can let the computer choose or you can specify a seed yourself, so it's easy to share a level with your friends 
There is an option to use the date as a seed as well, and have a "puzzle of the day", but don't expect a leaderboard for it, à la Spelunky
The real question is this: "Are the randomly-generated puzzles as good as the hand-crafted one?" Predictably, the answer is no
Mainly because the elegance issue, that I mentioned above, is considerably worse
Random levels are chock-full of redundant clues, and lack any kind of the symmetry that makes a puzzle attractive
I find that a real shame, as it shouldn't be too difficult to devise an algorithm that gets rid of some of the redundancy, and maybe couple it with a difficulty setting
Are the random puzzles good enough to sustain interest? Your mileage may vary, depending on whether you play casually, or seriously
"Serious" players will lament the low difficulty
Most of them took me less than 4 minutes and I've yet to find one that I couldn't solve in less than 10
But that may be exactly what you're looking for, and as a way to relax and pass a bit of time, the random puzzle generator is serviceable
Nevertheless, my impression is that those that enjoy the kind of challenge offered by the 36 main levels, will find the random ones too trivial for their taste
Audio-visually, Hexcells Infinite is identical to its predecessors
You get the same white, blue and yellow colours, the same menu presentation, the same ambient soundscapes


It's all very nice and stylish, but a bit of variety, like selectable visual themes, for example, would have been welcome
Hexcells Infinite is the best Hexcells yet
It feature another 36 good, difficult puzzles and the random number generator has the potential to satisfy your need for casual puzzle solving during a great many hours

												This is what Minesweeper should have been
Basically, this game is six-sided Minesweeper, but with the guessing element completely removed
You never have to guess a single time in any of the puzzles, and you will always have enough information available to you to make the next move
It's a game of pure logic and deduction, and one that will truly test your skills in the later levels
My only complaint is that the game is pretty short, but there is also Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite to play
Highly recommended if you even remotely enjoyed Minesweeper

												This is probably the best puzzle game I have ever played
 The music and sound effects are spot-on fantastic, the puzzles are lovingly and painstakingly crafted, and the difficulty progression is just perfect from one puzzle to the next
The mechanics are similar to Minesweeper and if you find yourself clicking the wrong mouse button (like me), you can change the button configuration from the Input tab of the configuration menu when you first start the game
I have now bought this game twice at full price (I bought again when released on Steam) and I don't regret it in the slightest
 This game is worth well more than the $3 asking price

												Really enjoyable casual puzzle game; challenging without being frustrating, although seasoned puzzle enthusiasts might consider it to be a bit too easy
Common complaint is that it is short, but for the price I still see this as a good value title
There are around 30 logic puzzles, still offering several hours of challenges to exercise your mind
Concept is most like the classic Minesweeper that was included with Windows OS back in the day
You need to use logic to determine if there is a 'number' or 'vacant' hex in the adjacent cell from the already revealed hexes
The simple designs, grows in complexity as you progress through larger levels with new rules being added & for the purists there is also the challenge of completing each puzzle without any mistakes
Graphics are bright yet clean & basic, but suitable to the game
Sounds are relaxing & controls are easy (just left & right mouse buttons)
Other than the exceptional LYNE, this is one of the best puzzlers I have played in recent years & look forward to trying out the sequels (which I am told are a much harder challenge too!)

												Hexcells is the illegitimate love child of Minesweeper and Picross
Using a series of number clues, you must logically remove and mark hexagons in order to fill out the pattern hidden underneath
If you've played either of the two before mentioned games this will be entirely intuitive, with numbers within a hexagon corresponding to the number of blue tiles (ie
mines) surrounding said hexagon, and the numbers on top of a column signally the number of blue tiles within it (with a few special signals providing additional info)
What Hexcells adds over vanilla Minesweeper is the more puzzle oriented design of its levels, each being individually designed to test your skills of deduction with cleverly disguised patterns that are often far more obvious than they first appear
Solving them is abundantly satisfying, and makes it rather hard to go back to the randomly generated boards of its spiritual predecessor
But this is also the cause of my biggest complaint, that being the times when logic is thrown out the window and you are all but forced to guess in order to move forward
This is frustrating because you're allowed but one mistake before forfeiting your perfect rating, essentially requiring you to memorize patterns and replay levels or cheat and use screenshots of the completed puzzle to go back and perfect the stage
It's odd that a game essentially designed to entirely do away with the use of luck to solve puzzles falls into such a disappointing pitfall, but I can only assume it was an oversight by the developer as for the majority of the game it's entirely possible to intelligently complete stages, which I suppose is why these moments of guesswork stand out so strongly
Although it just barley misses the mark, the overwhelming opinion I took away from Hexcells is that of a strong new logic puzzle that has the potential to perfect itself in future iterations, and may one day sit beside the likes of Picross and Sudoku
If you have any appreciation for the games I've compared it to, I wouldn't hesitate to check Hexcells out
It's budget priced so you've got very little to lose, and may find yourself similarly enamored by what at first seemed but a cheap knockoff

												I won't go on and on with this one, but let me just say that before Frictional Games' Amnesia: The Dark Descent became synonymous with fear, they were perfecting their craft with the Penumbra series
Black Plague is the second of their three-part Penumbra series, but in this man's humble opinion it tops even their most successful of games
Yes, I said it
It's better than Amnesia
Now before you get to the hate let me just say that I adore Amnesia
It introduced me, as it did so many others, to Frictional Games' work
But once I finished it up I wanted more
I was lucky enough to see this package come up during one of Steam's classic Halloween sales and decided to snag it
For some reason or another, I started Black Plague first, and I couldn't have made a better choice
This game has it all
From the atmosphere that breathed down my neck, tingling my spine and darkening my thoughts to the gameplay immersing me into the world, this game hits all the right notes
But this one does what I hope Soma (Frictional Games' next title) will do again - make a great story
I won't spoil anything, but let me just say don't let the atypical setting of a mental asylum fool you
It's much more than that, and giving this game enough of your time to find out why is well worth the investment
I highly recommend this game
