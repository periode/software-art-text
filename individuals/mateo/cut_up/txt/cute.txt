I have always hesitated to use live wallpaper applications since they used to be very performance-draining
 When researching for perfomance-tests of "Wallpaper Engine" I didn't quite find a review that was useful for me so i decided to get the software and test it myself
 It should be noted that this review will ignore other apsects such as the content of the software
Hardware Specs: CPU
i5 6400 (no overclock with BCLK)CPU cooler
AIO watercooling loop from NZXTGPU
GTX 980TI (MSI - no manual overclock)RAM
16GB DDR4 (GSkill - 2133MHz - dual kit)Motherboard
ASUS ROG Maximus VIII RangerSSD
Samsung 850 Evo (Only for OS, Steam and apps on HDD)OS
Windows 10 ProfessionalTest: The software (run in non 64-bit mode) will be tested in two scenarios
 Arsenal wallpaper will be used for all tests
1) Hardware usage will be observed while the System sits idle for 10 minutes without any other applications running in the background
 The tool for HW monitoring is "OpenHardwareMonitor"
 This testing scenario will be repeated for the wallpaper presets Low, Medium and High and a standard windows desktop background as reference

Ram usage was always at about 2
2GB
2) This test will show the impact on gaming performance
 Again, Arsenal wallpaper is used, this time on preset High
 As there are different options to choose, which define how the wallpaper will react to an application being run in fullscreen (Keep Running, Stop, Pause) a benchmark will be done for every mode and as reference with a standard windows desktop background
I chose the Benchmark Scene from Rainbow Six Siege with the graphics on ultra preset
 Here are the results: FPS in RB6-Benchmark
RB6S MinFPS AvgFPS MaxFPS
None 102 173 327
Stop 93 172 264
Pause 100 172 296
Keep Running 58 171 299 Conclusion: As we have been able to see, there are slight differences in terms of hardware usage
 I was surprised that the software did much better than expected, but the results may differ, considering community-made wallpapers may use more resources
 The CPU temperature values may not be very reliable due to the CPU being watercooled thus these values are at the very low end of the scale
 Wallpaper Engine does also have an impact on gaming performance, which can be kept to a minimum using the "Pause" or "Stop" behaviour for fullscreen applications
With a hardware config as "enthusiast" as mine, i doubt that there will be serious performance issues with this application, but if you are gaming on a much weaker rig, i recommend turning down the settings of the live wallpapers a bit
 At the end of the day, you will have to decide yourself wether you want to sacrifice resources for cool a$$ (a$$ can be taken literally) wallpapers or not
I do not regret my 4 bucks on this software and will be using it from now on

Early Access Review
I purchased this software hoping it would return the same functionality Dream Scene (Live Wallaper) did in Windows Vista that was later removed for performance issues
 The truth is this software is what Dream Scene should have been and is far more complex and configurable then the official feature ever was
 I did a full review of this software at http://barnnerd
com that will be published on 3/9/2017 at 6AM PST
I am in no way affiliated with the company that makes this program and purchased the program for full price from Steam after discovering it
 I would however love it if the author of this program contacted me as I would love to speak to him/her about some other features moving forward since I come from a software development background myself

**NOTE: This review will constantly update to accomadate any new changes in my opinion, updates, etc
**INTRODUCTIONStardew Valley
I've heard a lot of things about this game
 A lot of extremely positive things
And I was doubtful
 Was Stardew Valley really that good
 I was afraid that people were just giving it attention because they didn't actually know what a good game was
 And as insulting as it may sound, in my defense, uhhm
 Before buying the game I hadn't really seen what it looked like, or knew what it was about
 I just knew that it was published by the same company, Chucklefish, that had developed Starbound
 I had loved Starbound
 So I was playing completely spoiler free
 Haven't watched any videos, no tips & tricks, just the information of a billion recommended reviews stuffed into my head
So I bought Stardew Valley, and had pretty high expectations
 If a game received THAT much popularity, it should be seriously good, right
WHAT STARDEW VALLEY ISPlop
 Into the world of Stardew Valley
 You completely start from the bottom, trailing after a tragedy and responsibility that's struck
 A farm, barely any money, and the mystery of a town left in your hands
 Whew
 That's really a lot when you think about it
 Boy, did I NOT know what I was getting myself into
At first,
it was kind of boring
 And any new game you buy will always be like that
 The beginning's all new and immersive, and the middle
 kind of leaves you stuck
 And that's one of the most challenging parts for a lot of people: getting through that middle
 When you begin, you spot all the challenges you'll face, which is daunting, because you can instantly tell: you're going to have to freaking work hard to be a master at this game
The thing with Stardew Valley, It's all about exploration and management
 Discovering and figuring out secrets and a beautiful story was amazing
 Creative mechanics and powerful creativity had combined to produce a fabulous well-formed game that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth, and I'm going to tell you right now
 it's totally addicting
 I bought the game a few days ago, and literally have played it all day since
 I've NEVER done that with a game before
 I found myself as a kid in a candy shop, gaping at all the different flavors, and being able to savor them all
 And now, in Year 3 of the game
 I still have a lot more to discover
 The creator, ConcernedApe, was brilliant when coding this game
 He created all the aspects of Stardew Valley, and it took him ONLY four years
 How
 I've seen games that took ten years to develop
 and they still had less than Stardew Valley
 (Thank you, commenters
)PLAYINGCompared to others, I've only played around 80 hours of the game thus far
 Buy Stardew Valley
 You really won't regret it
 This game is beautiful
 The music is whimsically lifting, and the soundtrack is wonderful
 It's a work of art
 You will find yourself falling in love with the characters, and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people, and who changes everyone for the better
Let me tell you this right now: the game rewards for the hard-working
And you might be thinking: "what in the world do I mean by that
"I literally mean what I say
 Stardew Valley is a game where you really have to manage things, yet, it allows you to explore the whole art of it
 Work hard as you play the game, and there are sweet rewards
 And I'm talking about rewards sweeter than all the candy in that candy shop
Here's the thing: you can take two routes with Stardew Valley
 You can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game, or you can immerse yourself in exploring the town and what the game has to offer, but with also missing the point that Stardew is a management farming game
Or, you can successfully find the balance between both
 But how
Stardew Valley allows you to store multiple accounts, which is fantastic
 I recommend exploring with your first account, and learning the ropes
 You seriously won't know anything yet, and will be like "OMFG" when you figure out there's a way that makes things one hundred times easier
 After that, create a second account, and start figuring out farm management and what the game has to offer
 I thought I was pretty boss with the second account, but I realized I could get a whole lot more with a third account since I now knew shortcuts and everything
 So I created a third account, and successfully balanced management and exploration
 Now I'm left in a spot where I can successfully thrive, and only continue to grow
THE PROS- Enchanting music that sings as you play- A simple yet fun art design that you can't help but fall in love with- Characters whom capture your heart- A shambled town that begins to thrive- Hidden secrets that you can't help but want to keep discovering- Amazing challenges that leave you wanting more- The awe of wandering through an amazingly formed game- Brilliant originality, which is incredibly difficult to find- A storyline that changes your perspective beautifully- Lots of fun, and I mean lots
- Mods created by the community to make your game more fun and immersive- however, I play without mods
THE CONS- As I said, the game rewards you for hard work
 But only for hard work
 It can be a grueling process, but it is extremely profitable
 Those who don't like putting effort into a game won't enjoy Stardew Valley as much as other games
- Time
 Stardew Valley takes a lot of time to play through
 It's a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on
- Repetitive
 The game can be grueling
 To reach certain goals you have to go through processes that you will SERIOUSLY hate
 But, in the end, it's definitely worth the labor
PLACES TO IMPROVE**NOTE: Some of these "improvements" may have spoilers, however, none of them reveal any actual information about the game and what happens, as it is common knowledge and will really not spoil anything
 This category talks about bugs and things that need to be fixed
 So if you haven't bought Stardew Valley, it's not too concerning, but you may read it if you wish
- According to MasterBlade's review, there was a crash that deleted all his/her's progress of 61 hours
 I haven't come across this problem, yet
- In the Egg Festival during the Egg Hunt, there is an egg in the right corner of a bush next to Mayor Lewis' house
 When you try to click on the egg, Jas' dialogue pops up, even though she has already walked off-screen
 I find this annoying, as the triggered text prevents you from moving, and thus, lose the Egg Hunt
 (I lost once because of that
 Not a big deal, but it may be for new players
)- In the Egg Festival there is also an out-of-bounds glitch
 If you go to the top area (where you would walk to the Community Center) and walk up to the very top barrier (to where you can't walk forward anymore)
 Then, go left, and you're out-of-bounds
WHY IT'S JUST STELLAR Stardew Valley offers a lot of things, and has changed the lives of many people
 Perhaps in peace, wonder, open-mindedness, the game gives a lot
 But I have one thing that's been bothering me for a long time
 How in the damn world did one single person spit out a freaking awesome game
Even though it's a farming game, which is commonly found everywhere, it's original with its own spins
 It's extremely difficult to find a game that has such a captivating message that's been developed so well
 Stardew Valley is a lot of fun and awe, and it really draws a blank in your mind
Buy Stardew Valley
 At first, it might seem boring
 but keep playing
 Trust me, the candies are still sweet
 And they really only get sweeter
Posted: 28 February, 2016
This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years
 I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory
 I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA
 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game
 Farming
 The farming is fantastic
 It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy
 Being able to design your farm any way you want it
 yes please
 Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold
 it's so enjoyable and addictive
 Fishing
 The fishing is outstanding
 From playing WoW and Runescape
 or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun
 At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time
Mining and combat
 Mining and combat is incredible
 Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard
 (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder
) Social
 Social interactions are great
 Being able to become friends with the people in the town,
and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them
 what's not to like about that
 And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses
 The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice
 Main story
 The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you "complete" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did
 Yes, I was a tester for the game
 Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours
 It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this
 However you have to remember, I was a tester
 I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes
 I still love this game
 I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them
 And that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too
 ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game
 And that's true
 The experience that you have with this game IS amazing
 Minutes playing turn into hours
 Hours turn into "oh no it's time to sleep"
You will forget about time
 You will forget about sleep
 You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back
 So yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to "escape" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016
Posted: 28 February, 2016
I'm genuinely impressed an indie game of this scale made by one guy isn't stuck in an eternal early access, but is instead provided as the full package right off the bat
 This is how it was done a decade ago, and this is how it should still be done
Posted: 29 September, 2016
Can I just say thankyou to the developer of this game I suffer with depression and stardew valley gives me a reason to do somethng other than sleep it makes me feel like I have an impact of peoples lives (even if its only in game people)
 I have played 200+ hours playing this game that's 200 hours distracted from my real life problems
 I have oped(SP) in to be a beta tester, this is the first game I've ever done this with thanks to the developer for saying how to do that I really admire him for creating such a good game and hope he goes far in his career and he never loses the magic, Thankyou
Posted: 26 February, 2016
I spent three years building up hype, and I was still blown away
If you enjoyed Harvest Moon, Rune Factory or Animal Crossing - then get this
 It captures all the same things that made those games great, and it's the perfect game to play either casually or seriously
 There are so many different ways to earn money and they're all developed and fun, the hardest part is choosing which one to spend your time doing
The progression curve in the game is fantastic too
 Every day you'll feel like you're making progress but there's still always something to work towards and you won't 'beat it' after a couple of hours earning as much money as possible, as there's always something to spend your money on
 Even after 20 hours of playing, I feel like I'm nowhere near the endgame, and I could easily see myself playing through again and doing things differently
 I'm even doing a playthrough on YouTube and the progress feels dramatically different even in its early stages
I'm easily disappointed by games, so you can imagine my surprise when I was so impressed by a game made by one person
 Congratulations, ConcernedApe, you've made one of the best games I've ever played
Posted: 8 March, 2016
Overview
Stardew Valley is a game that borrows heavily from similar titles in the Harvest Moon series
 You start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables
 The game is simple in its understanding: build a farm, make profits, live your life
 What the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered
 You're left with the freedom to explore the town, its residence, mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time
 Sure, there are events to attend, festivals to see, men/women to romance and marry, kids to have, buildings to construct, fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay (Dragon Warrior, anyone
), but how and when you do those things is up to you
 In essence, the game offers you very similar things to do as a Harvest Moon game does: Build and upgrade your farm, plant crops, upgrade tools, mine in the never-ending dungeon for precious ore, go fishing, romance and get married
etc
 While some of your old favorites are back, new aspects have been introduced as well, but I won't spoil those in this review
 Let's just say there's a nice story that evolves over time
The freedom to do as you please is what makes this game, and Harvest Moon in general, so enjoyable
 It's a chance to mellow out, play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer
 What Stardew Valley does, it does right
 It's charming, cute and feels rewarding, even when all you're doing is cuttings weeds
 It doesn't pull any punches or try to be something its not; the developer had a goal in mind and Stardew Valley is a reflection of just that
 You can feel the effort, the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years
 Stardew Valley is a gem and worth looking at
 If you loved Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley
To date, Stardew Valley is a single player game, though the developer as mentioned some form of co-op or multiplayer availability in the future
 Pros
Character Customization - Always good, always wanted
Visuals - In the style of the SNES
 They're colorful detailed and a delight
 Game Pace - Fast, slow, or somewhere in the middle
 It's your call to make
 Content - There is a lot more to do than I first imagined
 There are many hidden layers inside the game as you progress the storyline
Cons
Combat - It's a tad basic since that isn't the core of the gameplay
 A single hack/n slash mechanic Citizens - I'd love to see more citizens (even temporary ones during the year) come and go to make the town feel more "alive"Overall, Stardew Valley is a pleasure
 I haven't put a ton of time into it (yet), but I easily see that happening
 It's fun, lighthearted and addictive
 As I said earlier in this review, if you've ever played Harvest Moon, you'll enjoy Stardew Valley
 It's worth checking out and I highly recommend it
 This will easily become one of my most played games on my list
 You won't be disappointed, so check it out

The new update promises to improve the quality of your marriage
 Doesnt work, my wife is still pretty upset I play Stardew Valley so much
Posted: 15 June, 2016
Ok so far from my game this is what I got:> farming for first week> mayor tells me to socialize with the townfolk> decide to talk to random people> lots of talking> finally think i met everyone> try to interact with trashcan> find a salad in trash, untouched> girl sees me digging in trash> girl gets grossed out from me digging in the trash> get mad, decide to follow her> catch her walking towards lake> turns out shes pretty> want to know how to marry her> find out that i can gift people> dont know what to gift> remembered i had salad from the trash that she saw me grab> give salad to her> she loves it> advance a year or two later> me and girl are marriedI don't understand women, both in this game and in real life
10/10 would dig in trash again 
Posted: 4 December, 2016
I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories
 She would always buy me the new one for Christmas, and we would play it all day, filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry
 Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum
 Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed
 It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work
 Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created
 I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game
 I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten
Posted: 19 June
There is a character in this game that is suffering from depression, it has helped me see my own illness and I have learned to deal with it in a much healthier way soley because of how my character interacts and helps them
 The characters in this game are beautiful, and not just in their artwork
 Their stories and the cutscenes have drawn me in more than just a regular farming game
 I was truely excited to marry Leah and nervous that she would turn me down (Even though she was at 10 hearts and I knew she wouldn't)
I have spent 80 hours in this game so far and I am in spring of year 3 waiting on my first child
 This game has kept my attention and I am looking forward to many more hours
 I give this game 10/10 rating

Early Access Review
Another match-3 game from SakuraGame, mixed with short visual novel segments
 I assume it's similar to Hell Girls, although I don't have much time playing that one so I can't make good comparisons
 I'm writing this review after playing the first 2 1/2 chapters of Mirror (out of 8 total in the current build)
Bottom line: For a day-1 Early Access game, this is easily worth two bucks
 Even if development stopped today, I would have expected to pay between $5 and $10 for what's there now
The artwork is very high quality, both for the characters and the backgrounds, and there's a lot of variety for both
 The visuals overall are the best part of the game, on par with some of the more expensive VNs on Steam - Example (SFW)[steamuserimages-a
akamaihd
net]
 The only fault I could see is that the style isn't always consistent - some backgrounds have a watercolor-style appearance while others are crisp and CG-like, but it didn't bother me at all
 Music is okay - mostly unmemorable but it fits the game fine
 The title track is a standout
The English translation is not great, but it's better than most other games published by SG on Steam
 There seems to be at least some human involvement in it - not completely done by machine
 I didn't have any trouble understanding what was being said 80% of the time
 Hopefully they will make another pass or two and by the final release it could be relatively polished
Each chapter of the game appears to be a self-contained story, with unique characters and plot
 Although the gameplay is primarily match-3 in the style of Puzzle Quest and the like, there are also short visual novel vignettes before each battle
 They are a few minutes in length, and each one has a dialogue choice that results in gameplay modifier (e
g
 -10% enemy health, +20% enemy attack, etc)
The modifiers don't seem to have much impact so I wouldn't worry about making a bad choice
 This is because there isn't a lot of strategy involved in the battles
 There are only 4 primary icons on each 8x7 board, so you'll be getting a lot 5x and higher combo chains without really trying
 These battles are the weakest aspect of the game
 I hope they take the time to add some more variety and make them less luck-based, but I don't think that's likely to happen by the time the game is finished
There is an in-game shop where you can upgrade stats and get new abilities, but I haven't spent much time experimenting with it because I've only lost a single battle so far
 Again though I don't think it would make a difference
At the end of each chapter is a slightly longer VN section with a sex minigame with the opponent you defeated
 The sexual content appears to be mostly bondage-related - nothing unusual for these sorts of games
 The explicit portions are censored and there's no patch to undo it at the time I'm writing this, but pretty much every other SG release has one so I would expect it to appear before too long

Early Access Review
If you liked Huniepop but thought to yourself, man, I wish the scenes with the girls were slightly animated and more lewd
 This game is for you
 Since it is early access there are a few things I hope can be improved before the game offically comes out, mainly the dialouge/ translation, its a bit off here and there, but overall the art is beautiful and I love the 'intimate' scenes
 Not so patiently waiting for a patch so we can see more than flowers and rabbits
Overall 9/10

Early Access Review
First ImpressionMy first impression is that this game is that the games will be full of nudes, just a linear elimination games
 That's all
 I bought it since the early purchase will entitle customers to 2 more free gift games
 Maybe sooner or later will start having cards, so it is an investment
Playing Experience	But, I was wrong, not about the nudes things, yes there a lots of them
 Few of them are somehow a bit too much for me
 (maybe i am a bit conservative)
 I was wrong that this game is just a game that use sexy anime girl to attracts weebs
 They offer more than that
The animation is nicely done, story lines created are interesting and different for each of chapters/levels/girls
 The elimination gem games combined rpg character skills builds so that the gems eliminated will have difference effects
The music is pretty good
 It is enjoyable to play this game while listening to them
 Character voices are good and such and ear candy for me
Since it is just early access game, i hope they will add more contents, more characters, and more diversity in the game play
 I personally would recommend the game
 It is not a waste will worth every cents spent

Interesting puzzle game
 I thought the back story is rather interesting too
 You have a little choices matter sort of dialogue
 I have a few SakuraGame titles, lives up to their art style, to put it simply
 A little on the lewd side
 R rated but not completely full frontal, but then again its more echi than adult manga
 Honestly I'm very surprised they charge so little for this title
 And
with a promotion of 40% off at launch, its a no brainer

Early Access Review
This is one of the few games that are worth buying on early access unlike those that get ditched by the devs once they milk their product enough
 Slime Rancher will appeal to the audience that like to play and relax on their games
 With so many games out there that make us frustrated, angry and anxious, Slime Rancher tries to oppose those feelings, and to me, it succeeds easily
 My only complaint about this game is the lack of content, but considering it's early access, and that the devs are still updating the game, more content will be added in the future
Overall, I recommend this game to all my fellow gamers that are bored of being competitive and anxious all the time and that just want to have fun just like the old days

The game has a huge amount of potential
 The art and music are perfect for the setting and the gameplay is fun and addicting
 The only problem with this game is lack of content, which is to be expected since it just hit early access
 If your looking for a complete package i would reccomend waiting for a few more updates before buying
 If the developers stay on top of this game and release frequent meaningfull updates this game could become a real gem

You see, poop is an extremely valuable resource 
Slime Rancher [EARLY ACCESS] ReviewI caught a first glimpse of this game when one of my steam friends posted a link about it on the activity feed
 I checked the game out briefly, but quickly went back to other stuff as it did not really peek my interest
 The game seemed a little bit weird to me (as in: it looks boring and stupid) and I was about sure I wouldn't enjoy it
 About a week later, I saw one of my favourite youtubers play it and decided to eventually give it a watch
 The video was over before I knew it and I clicked on the next one
 And the next
 After a while it was clear to me: I want this game
 NOW
 There was just something about it that I can't really describe, but it drew me in
 And a lot of other people got drawn in too
 It's like a disease being spread, the only difference being that it's a good disease
 I admit I've been a little bit too quick in my (wrongful) judging of this game, and will therefore give it a (fair) second chance in this review
You play as Beatrix LeBeau who decides to leave earth and set out for the Far, Far Range; a magical and adorable planet filled with slimes
 Your goal
 Finding slimes to Suck up their plorts (aka slime poop) with your VAC to 
 sell them
 Yes, correct
 Plorts come in many forms and are used for various things on earth; mainly food and products (eww
)
 You sell these plorts on the plort market to earn some cash, which can then be spend on upgrades (for either yourself or the ranch)
 When slimes are fed, they'll leave one of these treasures behind for you, or two even if you are lucky
 As of now, there are 3 main categories of food: fruits, veggies and meat
 Each category has different types of food for you to find and feed to your slimes
 If you so desire, you can also plant your own food - you'll run out less slowly (and it's fun too
)
 Believe me, your slimey friends will be thankful if you do
 It is especially useful to plant your friends' favourite food; they'll love you for that and will definitely return the favour via plorts
 I hope it is now clear that plorts are extremely valuable and so is your task as slime rancher
The gameplay, however a bit unoriginal (find slimes --> feed slimes --> get plorts --> get money --> get upgrades etc) is very satisfying
 Finding new slimes is always exciting, especially since you can create mixed breeds that are more efficient for money making (and they are just so adorable too
)
 The game thus encourages you to explore the planet on your 'quest' to find more and different slimes, find food and start your own farms 
 and getting upgrades will make all of that easier
 Be careful though, not everything is peaceful on the Far, Far Range
 Under certain circumstances, a Tarr slime will come out and devour all the slimes in the vicinity - even you
 So be cautious and take good care of your 'pets'
The 'thing' that makes Slime Rancher so much fun for me, is the fact that there is so much freedom as to how you play
 You can approach this game in a very casual way, and just go on an adventure, enjoying the different and beautiful areas with their inhabitant slimes (I could see this game used for therapy so to speak)
 The total opposite would be finding the most profitable slimes, combining them, putting them in a corral and making a lot of money - a dream for people who want to create a very efficient farm (or ranch rather)
 Or you could go inbetween and do a little of both: enjoy the slimes in their natural surroundings, but take a few home to take care of because they're so darn cute
 The game is also suited for all ages, which is great
 I'm pretty sure both young and old will find a certain joy playing this game and I love it for that
 I could totally see a grandfather and his grandchild play this game together having a lot of fun
The game in its current state is already super fun and stable, with minimal bugs
 I estimate about 5-10 hours of content
 There is still a lot of content waiting to be added, like more slimes, more types of food, more areas 
 more everything
 I also hope that they will add different 'modes' besides the "do-whatever-you-want" experience
 I think it would make for much more replayability, which is what I'm looking for in the long run
 I want to be able to play this cute game for a long time, without it getting tedious, hence my idea for different modes
 (Ofcourse, this list is totally personal, and I will still love this game if it keeps up development like this - whether there be different modes or not)
 I'm thinking about: A story mode: right now there is a little bit of background in the form of mail that you receive, but I think playing through a real story would be pretty amazing
 Maybe one where you have to save the slimes from evil or something
 I don't know, maybe I'm just babbling nonsense, but I think some kind of story would make things even more interesting
Challenge mode: Think about having to complete certain objectives in a certain amount of days
 That way, players would have to make smart use of the day-night cycle
Sandbox mode: The current mode (aka do what you want)Pros and Cons+ Unique concept + Relaxing and/or challenging + Nice, soothing soundtrack+ Satisfying gameplay+ Excellent tutorial+ Gorgeous looking world+ Cuteness overload
+- (this is temporary): lack of content +- (this is temporary): some may find it a little bit too expensive in its current state- The gameplay is not very innovative (as in: get slimes -> get money -> get upgrades -- repeat)The VerdictI definitely recommend this game, but please keep in mind that it is still early access
 Not all the content is in the game yet, and weird stuff (buggs) may happen
 If you don't mind that, by all means, please support the devs
 Otherwise, just wait a couple of months for the game to be a little bit more polished
I will revisit this review when the game is fully released, as to edit it accordingly

First of all, you may look at this and see a kids game
 Cutesy characters, no BFG to frag tight corridors full of baddies
 But sit down and give this game 15 Minutes and you will see why I am recommending it
 Without giving anything away, you are a slime rancher on a distant planet and you collect plorps (which are slime poo) and trade it within the global economy
 You can coop and breed chickens as well as farm a wide variety of fruits and vegetables

How I feel about this game

24bWhen I saw it on the steam store I was like "Hmm
"After I got some money I thought about the game, I looked at Jacksepticeye's playthrough of it a bit, and it was awesome
 I really liked the way it looked so I bought it
 First few minutes i was getting used to the controls, doing the tutorial
 Seemed easy enough; Though the one thing is, is that having too many slimes in one carrol is hard to do/ hard to take care of them all at once
Knowing this, I take care of as many slimes as I can handle
 When I came across the cat slime, I was going so crazy over it; but then, it ate a pink slime's poop thingy [Plorts] (I can't believe I already forget it) and it turned into a big pink kitty
 There was also these rocky spike slimes; they are adorable
 but hurt you
 ;u; I took care of the kitty with my other slimes but kept it outside
 Then
 I discovered the tarr
 A really messed up slime that you cannot absorb or keep; well because it's evil
 I had to throw them into the sea so i could easily destroy them
 Then i found out i could take water and shoot it at them till they died or put them into water
 Where is when i found boom slimes
 Well they explode; that's pretty much it, but they have a good worth of newbucks(
)
There are different slimes and they can all combine into a largo which is a big slime that is both of the slimes through eating the [plorts] poop stuff

25Graphics and music update
The music transitions very nicely between areas keeping an alike theme, making it feel like you are actually going places
 Alot of lighting difference with slimes and the ground
 Water texture is a bit too blue but i get the point it's supposed to be fresh water
 Geysers look fantastic, slime sea has seaweeds now and a bit of a tint change

Definitely a great game
 This is great for my down time and I use my steam account for the entire household and allow younger kids to play it while I am babysitting, or I can just play it on the big TV screen and all the kids love it
 They are so happy to learn each new slime or area
 The bright colors to the strategy and monetary system helps the little ones learn
 10/10 would buy the game again

A Hat in Time is one of the best platformers you'll find on steam
Pros:+Colorful Artstyle+Easy to grab+Full Voice Acting+Funny/Cute Story Line+Funny/interesting characters+Gives Super Mario Sunshine/ Legend of Zelda: Windwaker feels
Cons:-I didn't support the kickstarter and now i'm sad
Overall a pecking good time
Posted: 5 October
this is one of the prime examples of a succesful kickstarter, i have pre-ordered this game in 2014 and i have no regrets in supporting it for so long
i have played the alpha, beta, speedrunning event, had fun in all of those, though they were only 6 levels of the game
the game as it is right now is a much more upgraded version from the beta (well duh, its released), it features many more interesting mechanics, improved graphics and well, its finished
 i definitely wont play through it only once, as it has a special spot in my heart, anticipating a game for so long cant be healthy :Pit is one of the best 3D platformers you can get on steam, if you are an enthusiast for this type of game just get it, and if you are interested in the genre, you will have no regrets
you will smile from pure fun, and actually funny writing
 it puts humour where it belongs, and in very precise moments just to get that chuckle out of you
characters are cheerful and memorable, they have great design, atleast i think they do, they look great for the art style the game points torward to, their voice acting is great (you will find exceptions for this, though
), and they are just all around loveable

I didn't know I could be this happy

I feel bad for devs to release this gem between Cuphead and Mario Odyssey

Absolutely one of my favorite games ever
 Probably the only game I've ever 100%'d
 I was a slacker backer for the Kickstarter, so I bought my copy like
 2 or 3 years ago
 And honestly, it was like a gift from my past self to my present self
This game made me feel like a kid again
 The absolute joy of taking control of Hat Kid for the first time, discovering what kind of jumps and leaps you can do onto platforms
 The controls are just so tight and responsive, and everything just works together so well
 The worlds are all so incredibly unique, and no mission is like any other
 The characters you interact with are well voice-acted and full of character
 The bosses you fight are unique and memorable
 The music is STELLAR
 There is not a single song in the game that I don't love
 One issue is that the game does not keep track of your progress on certain collectables such as the pages in Time Rifts (unless you're currently in said Time Rift), yarn, or tokens
 It's very difficult to tell if you've completely cleaned out a world of its things to do when there's no stats on the menus to tell you
 This is pretty minor, as it doesn't really detract of the general experience
 It'd just be icing on the cake if they fixed it
This game is getting workshop soon
 Which will involve custom hats as well as custom made levels with modding tools
 Meaning that when you're done with the game, you won't truly be done
 Even after I 100%'d this game I still want to play more
 Hopefully we can get some level ports of Super Mario 64 so we can play through them as Hat Kid
Overall, the entire game is fantastic
 It's unforgettable to me
 It made me genuinely feel like I was playing Mario Sunshine for the first time again
 It's truly unique, and a great result of a long time development cycle
Posted: 6 October
Here's some pretty extensive thoughts of A Hat in Time after playing it for 8-9 hours & completing about half of the game (my percentage on my main file is about 50% done right now, & I've completed 21/40 levels the game has so far
A Hat in Time's story follows a nameless girl (aka Hat Kid) who is an alien who's ship runs on hourglasses that store time, having the ability to rewind & freeze time
 Due to some silly shenanigans involving the mafia on a planet she's passing, her ship crashes and her 40 hourglasses spread across the planet
 She goes off to collect them all, meeting a colorful cast of characters along the way
 The game's story isn't going to win any awards, but I've been surprised how much I've enjoyed it thus far
 The characters are voice acted, & so far the voice acting is pretty good (there's also a badge you can equip which makes them to 'mumble' speak if you wish
 more on badges in a bit)
A few of the characters I've already come to love, plenty have time to let you come to know them & find them likable or not
 I also appreciate the game's villain angle, everything is kind of a gray area in the game
 The good guys aren't wholly good, the bad guys aren't wholly bad
 Hat Kid actually doesn't seem to care about good vs evil, there's a do-gooder who has a morale high-ground of sorts & can't understand why Hat Kid doesn't want to use her hourglases for good, but Hat Kid just wants her hourglasses back
 The bosses you face aren't strictly because they're the bad guys, just they're in your way to collect your hourglasses back
 Motives for the bosses so far often have to do with wanting the hourglasses to go back in time & undo a mistake in their past, something they'll do anything to change rather than because they're evil, which I find an interesting dynamic
 I don't know obviously if the story holds up all the way through yet, but I like it for what it is so far
Game has a hub world, which is Hat Kid's ship
 The ship loses power & needs the hourglasses to restore it
 Get more hourglasses, & more of the ship unlocks as well as access to a new world becomes available to play
 The hub world is fun to explore & gets more added to it over time, including patrons who decide to board & do small things for you (ranging from allowing you to switch music in stages to selling you something or just loitering with flavor text)
 Out of the many collectibles in the game are souvenirs you can find (split into pieces though), which you bring back to your ship & you organize on one of a few pedestals (you have to manually stack them though)
 If you complete a souvenir, you unlock a new bonus level in one of the stages you can then access, which includes a harder than usual level with collectible pictures that give you a picturebook story (no text, all pictures though) of the backgrounds of the characters who live there
Speaking of collectibles, the collectibles here are well done, which works well for a collectathon
 Every one is linked to something, there's no 'useless' collectible
 Green orbs you get everywhere is your main currency, which you can use at a shopkeeper to buy new badges, to buy some new missions in levels, & some other misc things
 There's different types of yarn you can collect, which gives you different hats
 The hats all give you different powers, & you can change them on the fly with the d-pad or choose one from a menu of hats that slows down times
 The hats abilities range from letting you speed forward, doing a statue-esque ground pound, an aura which makes certain transparent objects appear, & more
 You also can collect customizable looks for your hats, as well as different colors for your main character
There's also badges, which are kind of your power-ups in the game
 You buy them from the store mostly, but some you get from other means
 At the start of the game you can only equip one badge, but there's two upgrade slots you can buy from the shop to equip three badges total
 Badges do everything from giving you a grappling hook to decreasing hat ability charge time to a map showing you where nearby souvenirs are, among many other things
 You can change them on the fly in the middle of the level whenever you like, & they're fun to mess around with & think what's best for a situation
 And then of course, the main goal of the game is to collect back your 40 hourglasses
I feel the game's controls are going to have some mixed reactions, but I actually REALLY like them
 They're a bit floatier than some platformers, & some may have different preferences here to me, but once you begin to get a handle on them you can do some crazy stuff
 They can do a great job at making you kind of feel like you're parkouring, as you can run up walls for a short time, wall jump, slide to go faster, dash in the air, do a double jump, & you can begin combo-ing these things like jump, double jump while in the air, dash in the air ahead, hit a wall, wall jump off the wall, dash in the air again & do a double jump off that dash
 It also can combo well into the other abilities you begin to get, like the running ability can run up walls a bit higher (as faster), or the grappling hook can chain very well into things
 One ability I was not expecting at all is kind of a homing attack similar to Sonic, where if you're close enough to an enemy in the air you can press the attack button to dash towards them in the air as a homing strike
 It's not all very complex, but well handled in my opinion, I personally really like the movement & almost parkour element the game has sometimes
All of this wouldn't matter if the game wasn't fun, which at least I think it's insanely fun
 The missions are very creative with a lot of twists & turns
 I don't want to speak too much in-depth here, but there's a LOT of variety of what you're doing
 The game shows all sorts of inspirations everywhere in its worlds & missions, & has its own set of unique twists on each one
 The game is the sort of game where one level is a murder mystery on a train & you're collecting suspects while avoiding being caught, to a previously fine island level being loaded with lava and having to maneuver in a whole new way due to the change, to a sort of Luigi's Mansion/Resident Evil/Amnesia hybrid horror level, to a level where you rush to go from press meet to press meet trying to become a diva & get your reputation up by publicity stunts, or going behind the scenes of a studio in a segment that almost has tinges of something like Portal
 There's a lot that happens, & then in what happens there's a lot of twists within the twists, & a lot of cleverly timed and amusing jokes & surprises
The game never loses its identity through this, but you end up going through a large variety of scenarios, & different kinds of stages (the main kind of stages are kind of open-world playgrounds that Collectathoners may know, something akin to Mario 64/Sunshine esque style, but there's some very different other types of levels, including these challenge levels that heavily remind me of Mario Sunshine, more linear affairs or sub-areas in the levels with their own flavor & level design)
I've fought two bosses so far
 The bosses in this game are surprisingly not that easy, they take like 20-30 hits before they die & have multiple phases
 The second boss I fought I REALLY liked, so much so I won't spoil it
Music is fantastic, it has some stand-out tracks but all of it I've heard so far is quite good
 There's also several variations of most themes which kick in during different gameplay moments, which does amp up & do what's intended
I need to see if this game falls apart in the second half of the game, & I won't claim everyone will love it as much as I have so far, but this I think is going to be a top five Collectathon title for me
 It has made me smile on multiple occasions, I've had a lot of fun with its mechanics, surprises, level design, missions, characters, and collecting

Posted: 7 October
SCROLL DOWN FOR TL;DRThis is one of the best 3D platformers I've played in a long time
 Tight controls, great abilities and creative level design
"How does it stack up to Yooka Laylee
" you might ask
Well, in terms of level design, humor and characters, it surpasses Yooka Laylee in several points, or at the very least matches it
 The catch
 The game is WAY too short
 Only 5 levels and only 40 hourglasses to collect, 24 of which are needed to beat the game
 However, the sheer amount of mission variety is staggering, and the attention to detail in every level is marvelous
 You never seem to be doing the same thing twice
 If I had to compare it to an existing game, the overall mission structure is like a heavily abridged version of Super Mario Sunshine, complete with platforming levels in a void
The character cast has an incredible amount of heart and soul in it
 Even the bad guys are immensely likable
 The Cook Mafia has to be my favorite band of crooks in the history of video games
 Hat Kid herself doesn't have much personality beyond "cute and happy" during most of the gameplay, but her character becomes more apparent in her diary entires, relic descriptions and the way she comments on various world objects
The bosses are easily the most challenging aspect of the game
 They're fast, have a lot of attacks, and the fights can go on for ages with no midpoints if you die
 Some of them can even get you in a stunlock, which is quite infuriating
Overall, A Hat In Time is a solid little gem, with its biggest problem being that there isn't enough of it
PROS + Great level design + Great controls + Great characters and humorCONS - Way too short - Some bosses can stunlock youSCORE: 8

Have you ever noticed how, in a typical RPG (and, now that I think about it, most games in general) battles dont really mean anything
 How many times have you defeated a miniboss, only to have it stand back up and laugh at you, saying I have underestimated you
 You are a worthy opponent
 This is not the end
 We shall meet again
 and make a getaway
 Think about it
 How many times do you beat up Balrog in Cave Story only to have him fly away without a scratch
 How is Black Knight able to keep running away after Shovel Knight stabs the hell out of him
 How come you black out if you lose a Pokémon battle, but none of the other trainers do
 And how does the big bad villain always seem to get away, even if their HP hits zero, so they can reappear in the sequel
Undertale asks the question, What if defeating an enemy in battle always means that they die
This might seem quite inconsequential in random encounters, but Undertale will also pit you against several main characters
 If you defeat a main character in battle, theyre dead for good, and the whole story changes to reflect it
 Heavy stuff
But thankfully, as the game advertises, you dont actually have to kill anyone
 The game offers a second option to get out of battles: talking the enemy out of fighting
 This involves solving a simple puzzle, almost always involving the Act menu in battle
 The puzzle changes depending on what kind of enemy youre fighting; sometimes youll just need to give them a compliment, other times youll need to survive several of their attacks, and so on
 Once theyre not emotionally invested in the battle anymore, you can spare them, and the battle ends
 You wont get any EXP for it, but youll still get gold
 Its a very unique fighting mechanic
I admit, after my first playthrough of the game, I was disappointed in the storys presentation
 I thought that both the very beginning and the final area of the game were fantastic, dripping with shocking emotional dilemmas, but the middle 80% of the games content seemed like it relied too much on oddball humor and not much else
 The game hilariously plays with expectations and has no shortage of genuinely witty satire of its genre, and I found myself amused by nearly all of it, but after the first two hours as I was walking across long linear worlds and listening to dozens of characters try to tell me jokes, I started to wonder where the emotional gravity had gone
 Why is this game making me laugh, when I thought it was supposed to make me cry
 I asked myself
 Where are the feelings
 After such an excellent and powerful prologue, why is the game taking so long to show me more
Later that night, as I was lying awake in bed, the answer hit me: the game was quirky and lighthearted because I was sparing everyones life
 I wasnt playing as a murderer
 If you want this game to have drama, you have to cause it
 And I think thats where all the hype is coming from, all the talk about player choice
 This is a game about being a tree-hugging pacifist, or a murderous psychopath who kills anyone who gets in the way, or anything in between
 You only need to live with whomever you decide to be, because the game wont let you ignore what you have done
Though it isnt the most visually impressive game, and the stage design isnt always the best, Undertale has left me feeling that I have just witnessed a work of art
 It tried some new and ambitious things and isnt ashamed of what it wanted to be
 It's about 6 hours long; Id recommend anyone to play it at least twice, just to be able to say that they've made their own choices and seen what the game has to offer
 Its hard to imagine that anyone would regret the experience
Posted: 10 November, 2015
Ten dollars
 Only a few hours of gameplay
 16-bit graphics compared to the flashy 1080p stuff in standard games
But
 wow
 Undertale blew me away
 It doesn't need flashy graphics or even fanservice to falsify its enjoyment
 It just does things right, and boy that was one immensely enjoyable experience
I think most of the magic of this game comes from knowing absolutely nothing about it
 I got this game from a friend and just decided to play it since it looked very interesting and it was getting good responses
 So I went in completely blind, knowing nothing but the game's name
 And I'm glad I did, because everything the game presented to me was unexpected, notably dark in places, and very emotional, which would have been lost entirely if i watched someone else play it
 So, if you happened to have been flooded by everything Undertale on tumblr (god help us) and the entire story's already laid out for you, the magic has been lost and the game won't be as incredible of an experience
 I'm sorry
Of course, I call Undertale an "experience", not a game, only because it does such a fantastic job at it
 Following the motto on the store page, "the game where you don't have to destroy anyone", the game always tries to nudge you in that direction, taking a back seat in your mind and reminding you to "Spare them
"
 And of course, you answer with "Why
 Why should I do that when it offers me the option to kill anyone I want right in front of me
 What's in it for me
" And that's where the game literally turns into a personal experience, as everyone has a different response for the game's selling point
 And boy, does it turn to black or white pretty fast from here
Undertale's ability to completely turn the tables of its story depending on your actions is massive
 Upon your game's startup, every little thing you do will be set in stone in the game's story pathing
 If you're the type who immerses yourself into the game's charming music, laughs at the childish but hiliarious anctics, and is willing to hork down healing items just to prevent yourself from killing a monster just because a fight is difficult, the game rewards you
 It opens up a very character-developing and world-unfolding story, along with some of the most emotionally invested boss battles I have ever experienced
 You know a game is good when it breaks the fourth wall so well that you're shaking in your seat in true fear and can't stop the shivers, all while having to fight a hopelessly overpowered god of a boss
 The amazing writing only starts once you beat the final few bosses, and the story doesn't stop being good from there onwards
On the other hand, what makes this game different is that it keeps its dark side from you, and its entirely your choice to experience it
 If you scoff at the game's sparing choice since you're too cool or grown up to possibly be nice to people, you can go around and intentionally sink your weapon into a monster who just wants to be a friend
 And unlike many other games, this isn't just a simple moment of "Oops, I killed another unnamed enemy, let's reset the game and nothing changes"
 the weight of a dark choice is huge
 Nothing can be taken back, and it forever changes your playthrough
 Reset the game, and the characters know
 Events change
 And with each curious kill, you, in turn, turn from the only human in a land of monsters into the biggest monster in a land of innocents
 In the end, ignoring what Undertale sets out to do, which is to let you experience childlike innocence and fun, only makes it delibrately change the game into a quieter, more grim story
 Very little character development, and the world isn't explained to you, nothing
 There's very little reward for going through this route
 Yet it is a choice you can do
 Granted, you get two of the hardest boss battles by becoming the murderer and will be forced into Game Overs repeatedly from them, but even that is a message from the game
 It's trying to stop you from getting to the end of this route
 Before its too late
It's as if you're doing deeds in an actual living, breathing world
 And that's what makes it even more terrifying when you decide to become a murderer instead of a savior, because only you know that you're willingly going forward to obliterate every weakling in front of you
 It's a test of your willpower, and it's your choice
 The worst thing
 The damage cannot be repaired
 Go clean, or go home tainted
 The game even gives you the choice to completely delete everyone's happiness after the most satisfying happy ending
 The happiness you worked so hard to earn
 And you can even become the murderer after saving the world, which will only permanently taint your game and never let you have a satisfying ending again
 That's absolutely brutal, and yet that's still a choice
 Amazing
Yes, this game might not be for everyone
 The humour may become dry after a while for some people, and tons of gamers nowadays like to bash at popular games instead of trying it out, just because they feel accomplished by doing it
 But, if like me, you are willing to experience why everyone's been talking about this game, give it a shot
 Hell, even if you hate the game to bits and want to kill everyone, buy the game, do so, and at least have your own personal experience before refunding it
 This game does the morality concept so well that other games can only dream of doing the same, and it is one not to be forgotten
It is a sin to call Undertale a game
 Doing that would categorize Undertale into the bland and consequence-free "kill-em-all" genres that a lot of games are falling into now
Undertale is a story-driven, emotional experience
Posted: 22 October, 2015
This is one of those few games that come along when times are bleak, and games have become regularly bland and heartless
 Where you feel disenfranchised with the whole idea of video games
 And you begin to start ask "Why
"
 Like "Why should we play games
", "Why are games different from other media
", "Why should you use games as a form of expression
" and even "Why even play games at all
" Undertale come along and says, "This is why
"

(Mostly spoiler-free review)I hate turn-based RPGs
 This is my Game of the Year
 What
After becoming ULTRA-JADED about gaming with the cancellation of Silent Hills, this game re-established that games can be really, really frickin good
This thing was made with an incredible amount of love, and it shows in every nook and cranny, every joke, every secret conversation you never thought a game dev would have thought to include
 Tobyfox is the most thorough dev ever
 I'm continuously impressed with how many things he thought to include in this game, and how he managed to make it all extremely fun the entire way through
 You'd think you've seen everything in this game, but you haven't
 There's always another amazing thing, another way to turn the genre on its head, another great joke you didn't see coming
 And it stays engaging the entire time, supported by a cast of fantastic, endearing, hilarious characters
 Great puzzles too, imo
 It avoids all the things about (turn-based and non) RPGs that I despise: -There's no grinding (unless you want to)-Battles are a great length and never overstayed their welcome for me-There's no boring menu-navigation-only-based combat (bullet dodging/timing-based stuff really spices it up, as well as bossfights always having a new, really fun gameplay twist on them
)-There's no unlikable/unrelatable characters that go on and on about you being the "Chosen One" or whatever-No plot where you gotta go to the 7 temples and find the 7 sacred whatevers and then oh wait now that you've gotten those 7 sacred whatevers, you gotta go to 4 extra places and get 4 SUPER sacred whatevers
 -No backtracking (unless you want to
 Backtracking is actually usually rewarded with more fun conversations and such
)-No constant equipping and unequipping items because, oh, this one is +2 Def but -3 Speed but THIS one is +3 Speed and -2 Def but THIS one is immune to fire and this one is
-It actually has a way more complex, useful moral than "Evil is Bad, Good is Good
" Everyone has relateable motivations
-The writing doesn't suck like 90% of RPGs
 It has a wonderful sense of humor and a simple plot that is underlaid with complex emotions
-Has jokes about anime, doesn't take itself seriously
I could gush about it forever
 Undertale's not only made me less jaded about gaming, but also less jaded about real life
 It has a strong message about empathy that stays everpresent, while somehow not being cloying about it, or shoving the message down your throat
 It's simply a wonderful experience, please play this thing

I need Cold Steel II right now
Posted: 5 August
In the early hours of Cold Steel, I was worried
 worried that it couldn't live up to the lovely standards set by Trails in the Sky
 However, after my first year spent as a student of Class VII, I can confidently say that it has, and knowing that this is just the beginning of a new series fills me with great anticipation
 If you've played Trails in the Sky FC, SC and TC you'll know what to expect
 A great story, compared with wonderful Soundtrack, depth when it comes to characters and a wonderful Gameplay mechanic
 Cold Steel is a game in its own, you dont have to play FC, SC and TC to understand the story
 However if you HAVE played those Games, you'll get a better view at some point in the Story
My Specs:i7 7700k @ 4
2ghzGTX 1070 EVGA SC @ 8GB VRAM16GB DDR4 RAMI play on highest available Settings possible and on 1920x1080p and FPS unlocked to "Limitless"
I get 144 FPS constantly without any drops so far and it feels really good on my 144 Hertz Monitor
Performance-wise this is a Gamers Dream
I'm crying just because I'm able to play this on my PC without having to buy a "Console" for it
The Game has so much to offer and if you really wanna play this Game - take some time
 You have to invest around 60 Hours (Depends on your playstyle) to finish the Game
 *RECOMMENDED*
Posted: 17 August
I've never posted a game review in my entire life, however, this game made me feel things I haven't felt from a RPG in a very long time
 Not since FF7 have I felt a twist in a story this hard
I'd like to think that I am pretty savy when it comes to RPGs especially JRPGs, but, I geniunely felt surprised if not totally shcoked by what this game has presented me with
I talked to every character I could (after I got the hang of the social aspect of the game) and not only did the dialogue keep me interested, it made the game so much richer because of it
*Gives developers and designers a standing ovation with tears in his eyes* BRAVO I SAY, BRAVO

How can one game have so many best girls
Posted: 7 September
This game singlehandedly sets the standard for all future Japanese PC ports
 By recruiting optimization modder Durante to actually provide optimizations and post launch support, Xseed has proven that PC porting isn't as expensive or difficult as major publishers like Square Enix pretends it is
 On top of optimizations are PC exclusive features like Turbo Mode, an FOV slider, and autosaves
 Xseed and Falcom are proving to be the CD Projekt RED of JRPGs, and their games happen to be of that quality as well
As with every Trails game, this game is just as phenominal as the Trails in the Sky trilogy was
 It's one of the only JRPGs I could ever immediately start a NG+ on minutes after the credits roll
 The characters are well written and fleshed out, the world is meticulously handcrafted to be unique and interesting, and the major story beats sets up the incredible sequel very well
This is an excellent game to get into the Trails franchise
 It was designed with newcomers in mind, yet still retains everything veterans love about the franchise
 The amount of quality hours you can put into this game makes the full asking price worth it, and all purchases of this game is directly making a statement about what PC JRPG players want out of their ports
Posted: 2 August
I put many many hours into the PS VITA version of Trails of Cold Steel by XSeed when it originally came out in the UK last year
 As a fellow player of the previous two Trails in the Sky games, prior knowledge is not nessicary in order to start this game
 Those who have played the previous iterations will find a deeper meaning and some fun references through characters and mentions however, but nothing that will take awaty the experience for a newcomer
 This game, while an engine at fault, suffered frame issues on the VITA so being able to play this in a better quality, not only 60 FPS appeased me to get it once again
 Falcom themselves, the original developers of the game have something unique in the craft of their games in this series, as once finished, you'll be yearning for more
 That being said, first installments to a new adventure are usually slower than most
 However, unlike sky, Cold Steel has an argueably more hooking beginning
The battle system is one of the most refined in the Trails series yet
 We lose some features like Rush, but we also gain a different way to do battle in the way of Master Quartz, to furter augment the skillsets and stats of your characters and the ability to swap them lets you build your characters in interesting ways
Overall, a highly recommended title
 Please tell your friends so we might get Cold Steel 2 next
10/10
Posted: 20 August
Trails of Cold Steel is part of the Trails/Kiseki series, of which there is also Trails in the Sky on Steam
 Cold Steel is set on the same continent and 1½ years after the events of Trails in the Sky, but in a different country and with a new main cast
 Having played Trails in the Sky is not necessary (but highly recommended, they are awesome games after all
), it's fine starting with this one
Port: Ported by Durante (you might know him as the one responsible for DSFix if you played Dark Souls) the game runs on a toaster and offers a wealth of graphical options
 There is also a Turbo Mode, which allows you to speed up the game with the press of a button
So, what about the game itself
- GREAT story and writing
 It starts slow and steady as you get to know the world and its inhabitants and events slowly and slowly escalate and escalate until it culminates into an explosion of awesomeness that blasts your jaw to the ground while you scream internally (and externally) like a little child and then it's over and GIVE ME THAT SECOND GAME NOW
- Characters are pretty good
 Not as good as the Trails in the Sky cast, but still pretty good
 Some of them make a terrible first impression (looking at you Machias) but all of them get a ton of growth and character development over the course of the game
- NPCs: If you take the time and talk with them (all of them offer new unique dialog after every little story progression), you learn a lot about the world, their lives, relationships, problems,
 Many of them even have
their own little story arcs going on over the course of the game and at the end I knew the students of Thors Military Academy as good as the main cast
- Combat is turn-based with a maximum of 4 active party members
 It has elements of positioning and turn-order manipluation and the challenge level is pretty good
- Music: It's a Falcom game, of course it has an awesome soundtrack :P- Length: around 60-80 hours depending on how deliberate you are- Voice Acting: No Japanese voices included, but there is a mod for that if you want
 The english dub however is very good and has around 5000 more voiced lines than the japanese one
 
Posted: 3 August
Don't be fooled by my play time as I played this game and its sequel on ps3 and bought it again here to support this series on pc
The port is very good in terms of performance and graphical settings and launcher thanks to Durante
 I have a GTX 760 and I am playing the game at maximum settings @1080p
 I am getting between 50 and 60 fps unlike the 30 fps on consoles
 It has a turbo mode to boot to save plenty of your valuable time in battles, saving your game and traversing the fields
The following is my review of the game proper:This game is one of the best jrpg'sI played in recent memory; it's very long though and has huge replayability factor due to its game plus mode and the need to play it more than once to get all achievements for their hunters out there
Despite the above praise, this game presents no real innovations in the jrpg genre, but it excels at what it does
 It spends so much time in world building and making you so much attached to and invested in getting to know the characters
 The characters are, for the most part, unique, complex and have interesting back stories
 Even the countless NPC's are unique and have their own personalities and problems
 I was reminded of persona sometimes when I played it, which is a good thing, due to its social-link like mechanic with your fellow classmates and exams
The graphics are a slight letdown but this is more than compensated by its great gameplay, beautiful music, nice English dub, which isn't full but much more is English dubbed than many other Japanese games
The battle system is turn based in the tradition of classic Japanese rpgs like persona and the earlier final fantasies and utilising enemies weaknesses, delaying enemies' (particularly bosses' turns) and performing links with your party members play a crucial role in securing your victory in battles
 Also, despite spending a long time grinding for levels and items in this game, I never really got bored or annoyed by the battle system, which is a huge plus in a long game in my book
Despite being long and very detailed that it makes you feel part in its universe, the game ends on a cliffhanger, which prepares you for its sequel as it is part of a trilogy
This is the definitive edition of this game due to the excellent port and its various enhancements, which made me want to replay it despite my huge backlog

Welcome to "The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel" (ToCS)My review is based on my PS3 experiences (Cleared ToCS I and II twice), early PC insights and my personal opinion about this game
 Trails of Cold Steels:-J-RPG -Turn-Based -Flexible skillsystem with a lot of strategy-Not the hardest but really pleasant difficulty [Normal]
(Go hard if you would like more of a challenge) -Story rich (Can drag on a bit at the beginning but it's getting really epic and interesting once you are hooked)-It's quite linear but you have time to discover various places and towns (You have your freedoms) -No prior knowledge needed (Trails in the Sky or the other titles - Just light references) -Great and illustre characters and character development-Motivating to deepen the bonds (Similar to Persona) -Almost every character (NPCs included) has his/her own story -A lot to do (amsuing sidequests, minigames, discovering and collecting various stuff)-Average graphics in general-A lot of love put into details, characters and environment -Graphics are still way better compared to PS3
-A lot of improvements over the PS3 version like higher resolutions, higher frame rates (60 FPS), depth of field, shadows and so forth-Really great OST which is underlining situations and the mood greatly (Still listening to them from time to time)Playtime: Between at least 80 hours and 120+ (Average for my first time was around 110 - PS3)-It's the first game of a trilogy -ToCS II will come later to PCs and ToCS III will release in Japan this year +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ It's pretty difficult to recommend this to everyone depending on what you like
and if you have some experience from games like Trails in the Sky FC/SC/TC and Persona At best I would say it's a mix of the previous Trails in the Sky and "Persona" in general -It's a mix because like in Persona you have your everyday school life and mysterious battles/characters-You are deepening your bonds with the "main characters" and getting to know their personality
 This depends on the time you are giving each of them individually (Pretty similar to Persona)The rest of the game is how you know it from Trails in the Sky -A lot of text-based conversations with spoken dialogues (way above average RPGs)-A lot of details put into the story, the chraracters, background information and collectibles-A lot of different things to do (next to the main story) like fishing, playing cards, quests and so forth
The basic story (without spoilers) is best explained in the short wikipedia description I'm quoting here: "The game's plot is centered around the newly formed special class "Class VII" in Thors Military Academy, composed of both aristocrats and normal Erebonian citizens
 Class VII is the only class in the entire academy that does not segregate the two different social classes
The game follows Class VII throughout their school year, mainly around the times when Class VII receive special field training that takes them all over Erebonia
 Throughout their training across Erebonia, Class VII matures and casts aside their preconceptions of the two social classes and witness first hand the reality of the empire; The power struggle between the aristocracy led by the four noble houses, and the working class reformists led by Iron Blood Chancellor Osborne which threatens to lead to a civil war
" +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So who would I recommend it to
=> People who like Persona and are into spending time to develop bonds with various characters=> People who like to play turn-based games with deep strategy (You can abuse every system
)=> People who are into longer games (Average time = 90-100+ hours)=> People who are seaching for a great story where everything feels connected (Characters, Story, Backgrounds)=> People who don't dislike certain clichés +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++POSSIBLE LIGHT SPOILERS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Some random notes at the end (Just for me or maybe you even like it => (My Personal opinion)-Rean is a great chracter for me [Realistic - Intersting - Mysterious] -Rean is human/kind and may come across as your "typical" hero [He is not - but he tries]-His schoolmates come from various societies and families-They have all their traits and quirks -They don't get along too well at the beginning and even later-Problems will arise among themselves-They are at odds with themselves-The different reasons for their behaviour/quirks are explained well and make them loveable -The battles are fun and interesting-The characters for battle are changing depending on the school trips and where you are in the story-Even if you are not leveling you don't have to fear to be underleveled and to grind endlessly because you are getting more EXP the lower your average level is compared to the current monsters you are fighting-You are even getting less EXP when you are higher compared to the average level of the monsters you are fighting -It was a pleasure catching all kinds of fish (Fishing), to play Blade (Card Game), to collect certain books and read a novel from time to time and to get to know more about the society and the world around ToCS-A lot of German words mixed into the game (I'm from Germany so it's quite funny how they use different terms)-Fun scenes: School trips, schwimming, awkward/funny situations the characters are getting into, school festival
 One of the best J-RPGs in recent years
 ;o)

Ok
 the game
 oh gosh, my tears, I can't hold it
 Because THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
 Here are the pros and cons (or not) for this game
The pros:+ Well-written and touching story about love, forgiveness and sacrifice
+ Beautifully hand-drawing, from characters to every detail of the environments
 (Too much clear water :)) )
+ Ahhh, musics to my ears
 It made me cry
+ Responsive control
 Nice
+ The platforming section is really well-executed, tricky gameplay
+ As the upgrade version of the original game, with more contents, more balance, more secrets,
 more grinding for the ability poinits
+ Now it has 4 difficulties, from Easy to One-life
 I hate one-life mode :))
+ A huge map with lots of exploration
+ There are parts of the game when it requires you to escape from certain death
 Well, It's time to ultilize your skills to get you through danger
+ This game reminded me of the game named "Cat Mario", the game which makes you suffer from falling, dying, danger at every corners
 RAGE
 :))
+ The game now is more compatible than the original one
+ The game is best example of Unity Engine Games that can run smoothly on low-end pc
+ No FPS drops
+ First playthrough with 340 deaths for finding EVERY SINGLE SECRET in hard mode, how bad could it be
 :))
 I bet that i will die even more if the game were bigger
+ Can you make a speed run from beginning to the end without using ability points, no death, under 3 hours in one-life mode
How long you guys can endure it
 :))
A MUST-HAVE GAME for anyone who want solid (with some trolling and surprise moments :)) ) and challenging gameplay with pure story-telling
 And I am still waiting for the sequel "Will of the Wisps"
 Oh boy, I cried even more when i watched the sequel trailer
 Amazing game to the end
_Epic Final Score: 10/10

Every now and then there's a game that changes the way you look at all types of games in the same genre
Take Witcher 3 for example, good RPGs are now bad because we now know that is possible to do better, MUCH better
For many of you this game will fly under your radar, many of you might even ended up here by mistake
 Whatever the reason i don't care just BUY this game
This is a masterpiece, this is the Witcher 3 of metroidvania 2D plataformers
The story is beyond good, is beautiful, it'll break your heart and make you smile, it wont bore you and it has enough to keep you engaged
The MUSIC
 The music in this game has life, it tells a story in it self, without a word you can understand the world around you, it whispers in your ear, never yells, it tells you a secret for you to keep
The art style is stuff of dreams, the color palette is vybrant but also dull when it needs to be
 The hand drawn vistas and landscapes are worth the games price, just so you can bathe in how good this games looks
The controls are just good, and they have to be, because this game is HARD, it rewards acuracy and quick reflexes, have you got those
I died 422 times on my first playthrough and let me tell you, i'd die 422 more just hoping this game would be biggerThis IS the 2D plataformer to beat, this is more than a game is an EXPERIENCE
Posted: 12 June
This is an action platformer in the Metroid style
 As you explore areas you gain new abilities that allow access to previously unpassable ones
It plays as good as it looks - which, considering it looks phenomenally gorgeous, is no small feat
The controls are responsive, and the platforming gets nicely tricky (though not too frustrating)
 It also has several really cool "escape" setpieces that are just right for being challenging, and making great use of your skills
 You get the ability to slingshot yourself off of certain objects, which includes enemy projectiles, and these sequences make crazy use of that
 Mixed up also with various jumping / gliding / wall jumping bits that make them very exciting to do
 For a 2d platformer it really is quite thrilling when these setpieces kick off
It's an exceptional game mechanically, and hugely enjoyable - plus its also surprisingly hard on the highest difficulty, so represents a fairly big time to complete
There is a downside depending on your tastes - the story and music are pretty twee stuff, and the "voice acting" is just kiddyish gobbledygook
 But other than that its a very engaging, artistically stunning game, and I highly recommend it
Posted: 22 June
If anyone ever told me a video game cannot be a piece of art, I would show them Ori and the Blind Forest (soon to be the Ori franchise)
Ori and the Blind Forest is one of few games that recieves very little negative attention (only notable negativity come from those complaining about the Definite Edition release)
 There is very little wrong with the game itself in terms of gameplay, glitches, and music
 The story itself is known for making even the toughest of men cry as well
 Everything in the game itself seems to come together and forge a masterpiece
The main gameplay of Ori and the Blind Forest is the platforming
 It features a unique respawn system I have not seen in any other game (though someone else may be able to name one), utilizing an ability to create a respawn point anywhere at the cost of energy
 This energy can also be used for a blast charge that can break some walls
 Respawning by itself needs strategy, deciding whether the energy could be used for a better cause or not
 Platforming itself isn't frame perfect like many say, the game was very responsive with the jumping and was never frustrating at any time
 This is one of few games where I had not one issue with the movement and controls
As for glitches in Ori and the Blind Forest, they are so few that you are highly unlikely to experience any in the entire thing
 You aren't going to be coming across a Spore: Galactic Adventures experience here, where you have to be purposefully avoiding things in order to prevent glitches
 The lack of game-breaking glitches is actually rather impressive
 Yes, there are some, though it appeared to me you have to be purposefully trying to cause them to occur
The art and music in Ori and the Blind Forest is the most notable thing in the whole game
 The music score by Gareth is incredible
 Once you hear the songs, with how emotional and fitting they are for the game, you could easily see as to why they recieved such praise
 The art design is incredibly unique compared to similar games as well
 It is a 2D game that looks and feels as gorgeous as a 3D game
 The backgrounds and foregrounds are utilized to their greatest potential, being able to see the antagonist, Kuro, flying at you from a distance to Gumo hiding in the foreground behind tall grass
 The two combined, art and music, end up creating a visual masterpiece that is incredibly pleasing to look at
 Despite how simple Ori's sprite appears to be, it is at the same time very detailed with the animation and look
 Everything in the game looks and moves like something that is alive
The final part of the game, the story, is known to make grown men cry
 While it isn't the most unique story when you first start, with Naru perishing and Ori going on a quest for 3 elements, it ends up becoming apparent as to why it is unique later on
 Gumo, Kuro, and even Naru end up making the story incredibly unique for many, many reasons
 Each character has a lot of backstory, and it is incredible how it is told without words
 Gumo, Naru, and Kuro are incredibly detailed and interesting to learn about despite how simplistic they appear to be
 We learn all about Ori throught the whole game, similar to Kuro
 Every character, even the dead ones, have so much thought and effort put into them that it shows what Moon Studios is capable of
Gameplay: 8/10 - It could do with better combat, but since the platforming was nailed incredibly well with the platforming being the main focus as well, the combat can easily be looked over
Soundtrack: 10/10 - This is the only soundtrack I can say I have never enjoyed more in my entire life
 Every song fits the scenario and changes the mood drastically
 Without the work Gareth did, Ori and the Blind Forest would not be so amazing
Art Design: 9/10 - The game looks and feels exactly like you are playing a painting
 The characters move and look like they are alive as well
 There is very little I could say bad about the art of Ori and the Blind Forest
Story: 8/10 - Every single character has a massive amount of thought put into them and has their entire story told without the need of text
 Even the least interesting character, Sein, is still incredibly interesting to think of
 Every character in the game has incredible amounts of story put into them and the game tells it without saying it directly
 What happens to Kuro, you have to piece together
 Why the ending is sad, you have to tell yourself as to why
 The character's stories are incredible, and the game might have been even better if it was even more focused on them as opposed to the elements Ori and Sein were searching for
Bugs/Glitches: 9/10 - While there will always be bugs, I did not experience a single one during my entire time playing the game
 I thought this was incredible, considering how buggy many games are today
 The game still has some glitches as expected, but the lack of any glitches that occur during the playthrough of it is astonishing
 They seemingly have to be activated purposefully
Overall: 9/10 - Ori and the Blind Forest is perhaps one of the greatest games I have ever had the chance to play
 I highly urge anyone who hasn't play Ori and the Blind Forest to do so
 With Will of the Wisps coming out soon, now would be the time to play the original masterpiece that began my new favorite franchise
 
Posted: 27 April, 2016
(Already played the original game
 => skip the first few paragraphs)Ori and the Blind Forest is a very beautiful metroidvania platformer
 It has won several awards for it's art and music
 The entire world is handcrafted and every area has a unique feel to it
 You play as Ori, a tiny being in a huge forest
 Your task is to restore the elements and restore balance in the forest of Nibel
 During your adventure, you will gain abilities and skills that give you access to previously unaccesible locations
The game has a unique save-system where you can place a checkpoint ("Soul Link") almost everywhere
 Are you stuck
 Create more savepoints
 Forget to save and die
 -- Too bad, you're going to have to do that all over again
 Besides that, the game allows you to pick skills from a skill tree that give you more freedom in how you want to play
 Want to explore, pick some of the exploration skills
 Need more fire power, pick a damage increasing skill
This game is an extended and improved version of Ori and the Blind Forest and is a stand-alone experience
 You do not need to play the original game first (the core game is the same)
Why buy this if you already own Ori and the Blind Forest
- New abilities that both change how you move around and change combat in a new way
- A large, optional, beautifully crafted and varied new area which tells Naru's backstory
 You need to backtrack to find it
- No more closed-off areas; Spirit Wells can be used to warp across the map and you will have access to every location, even after you finish the main storyline
- Difficulty scaling
 Was the original game too hard (or too easy)
 Try the new 'Easy', 'Hard' and 'Single Life' modes, each with their own leaderboards
- Behind the scenes content and concept art
- 7 new achievements to get
Like the original; probably best played with a Xbox 360/One controller, although not impossible to play on kb/m

Ori and the Blind Forest is one of the most visually stunning games out there right now
 Not only that, the storyline touches the heart and makes you feel the want to keep on playing
 Though the game may be tricky at some points and you may have to use your brains to figure it out, the game is a masterful piece of art
Posted: 3 December, 2016
I'm not a platformer fan but this is something else
Ori and the Blind Forest is what you call a masterpiece
 Every essential aspect of this game is perfect or at least close to that
Posted: 27 April, 2016
This game was already good
 Insanely good
 Unbelievably good in fact
 But now it's perfectLet me try to explain how the new areas look, if i even can
 The new areas are definitive (heh) proof that video games are indeed art
 This isn't even a game anymore
 This is a painting
 You are literally playing a painting
 Seriously,
Moon Studios went to WORK on this game
 If you walk over a leaf, the leaf moves
 If you step on a single blade of grass, it waves along back
 If you run across the ground, it glows in response
 The environment, the atmosphere, it's all perfect
 You could set steam to take a screenshot every 10 seconds
 The soundtrack to this game is hands down the best soundtrack for any game i will ever play
 Gareth Coker, you take a bow
 Even if you don't play video games, or don't have a computer, or anything you owe it to youself to listen to the soundtrack at least
 The Definitive edition expansion to the soundtrack is name your price
 GO DOWNLOAD IT
 Listen bud, you had better go download this game
 Yes, you
 Right now
 You're missing what will likely be one of the best game's you'll ever play if you dont

I just finished my fist playthrough of this game, and I think it's become my favorite ever
I generally play action RPGs or just RPGs (souls series, witcher, elder scrolls, fallout etc
) and I've found some phenominal titles
But I've felt that every game I played up until now has been lacking something, for example, The Witcher 3's story and quests are fantastic, but the combat is sometimes clunky
The mechanics of the souls games are great, but you have to go out of your way and do research to figure out the story, which I've done, and still the stories haven't really grabbed me
Ori and the Blind Forest is as close to a perfect game as I have ever played
It has some really unique mechanics that all work beautifully, the story is bittersweet and wonderful, the music and artstyle are perfect for the game and its environments
In summary, this game is a work of art
I had one problem during the entirety of my 11 hour playthrough, which went through almost 100 percent of the map: I got stuck under a rock and had to quit out
That's it, that's the only thing approaching a glitch or a mistake I found
If this game is on sale, it's criminal not to buy it
If it's not on sale, it's still criminal not to buy it
This is the first game I've written a review for, because these developers deserve more attention for this masterpiece

I enjoyed this third title quite a lot and right now its my favorite from the whole franchise
 Maple and Cinnamon are adorable together, and it was cute to see them both pursuing their dream
 The VN is cute as always and theres a lot of adult scenes (which are censored in the Steam version, but you can buy the R18 patch at Denpasoft to unlock the interesting stuff lol)
9/10
 Even without the patch, it was cute as f*ck, I dont care
 Worth every cent

So Meta, Even This Acronym
OneShot is cute, imaginative and, at times, simply mind-blowingand blowing the jaded mind of a modern gamer is not an easy task
 The meta nature of the game is highlighted by its name: you only have one shot at it, and then the save file becomes corrupted
 There won't be a second journey
Only
 how is it fair
 Whatever you do, you will have to face a dilemma in the end, and choosing either of the cruel options is reductive and simply wrong
 Can you
 rebel against the whole thing, perhaps
These, however, are the thoughts you'll deal with by the end, but even before it the game is littered with charming meta-humor
 The main character needs to sleep, for example, and when she does, the game closes
 Some puzzles require thinking very much out of the box and using unexpected approaches
 All the while the touching and lovely story of a hero stranded in a strange land and carrying a lightbulb to light up the local sun continues to unfold
The game is at its most poignant during the moments when the hero interacts with you, the player, whom she considers to be a god
 You get to chat, encourage her, and fight your own enemyoften outside the game
The execution of OneShot leaves something to be desired: while very sweet in terms of visuals, it's often clunky and makes you do a lot of unnecessary walking back and forth solving various puzzles; coupled with imperfect location layouts, it gets frustrating sometimes
 However, I'd say the game itself is charming and unique enough for it to be easily forgivable
Posted: 11 June
I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam
I've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot
I don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context
 (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party
 Be warned
)Transistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life
 They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you
 They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously
However, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason
 In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters
 When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the "eyes" of the protagonist
OneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story
 Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all
 It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close
It was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game
It's really hard to put into words
 but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees
 :DAnyways, random game comparison tangent over
 It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended
 Extremely solid 10/10
If you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc
, this is basically a must-buy

Let's be honest
 When I played OneShot, I didn't expect much
 I got interested because of it's very pretty arstyle, but I didn't know what awaits me here
And, well
I was very suprised
 OneShot was the first game in many years that made me feel so immersed in the world and the story, and for the first time in a long time I felt really attached to the main character
But what is the game about
It takes place in a world where the Sun died, and people are living in darknes
 They only have a little bit of light left, and even that is starting to die out
 But
in this world there is a prophecy that says that a Messiah from another world guided by a God will travel to the Tower with a new Sun and will make the world like it once was
 Then the Messiah will return home, and everyone will live happily ever after
The Messiah is Niko, a small confused child
 And the role of the God belongs to you, the player
Which leads to one of the coolest things about this game - Niko knows about your presence and responds to your actions, asks for advice and even has little chit-chats with you
 And let me tell you something - it's such a sweet, precious kid that it won't be long before you will start really caring about this little kid and you will want them to return home safely
Sadly your journey is not a easy one
 Without the Sun, the world is dying
 While many people greet you with happiness and hope, others react differently
 They don't believe that just bringing back the Sun will be enough to save the world, and they question the point of your journey, and so will you
 Can the world REALLY be saved
What also doesn't help is the fact that Niko doesn't realise that you are as lost and confused as they are
 Luckily, someone will help you on your way
 But be careful - this world has many mysteries, and you will replay the game many times
 You will want to know the truth, and more importantly - you will want to know if you can really save both
But all of that will be answered in time
Maybe
Posted: 31 March
NOTE: This spoiler-free review is accurate as of the newest update (Solstice)
 Due to the content and ending added through this update, I highly recommend this game, and if you have finished the game before this, I implore you to replay it to experience the true ending
 I was introduced to this game by Markiplier's playthrough
 I only heard 10 seconds of what he said before I closed his playthrough and decided to get this game myself, feeling that this game is worth going in blind, and would be one with a lasting impression
It's True
 This is the most emotionally-invested game I've had the pleasure to experience
 Even after the end, it haunts me till today
 and my emotions are so messed up just thinking about my experience that it's difficult to even review it
 Even so
 I'll try
Oneshot is A story-driven puzzle-adventure game
 You play as a cat-like persona named Niko in a Mission to restore a world's lost sun, a large lightbulb
 You only have one chance to save the world
 It seems very straightforward
Except you're not playing as Niko
 You are considered a separate entity
 yourself
 By opening the game, you unwillingly become "god", in charge of a world that operates, exists and disappears at the click of your mouse
 Niko, meanwhile, is just dragged in as the "protagonist", waking up in a different, crumbling world
 a child trying to get back home, to the waiting arms of mommy
 You are essentially Niko's guiding voice, in a world both of you have no understanding of, and are in charge of leading Niko to bring light back to the lands
 and at the same time, bringing Niko back home
Of course, its not that simple
 The game is sentient, aware of how it's a program running on your computer, and will attempt throughout your journey to keep you from returning the sun
 But in the end, it is unable to control your final decision
 and yet, it still gives a last stand by denying you a perfect ending
 It's in control of the story and is hiding things, and without you thinking outside of the box to beat the game's coded "story"
 Niko, the world, and the game itself
 will never find peace
 The writing and story in and of itself is one of this game's strong points, as the amount of fourth-wall breaking and events that reveal the true nature of the world is extremely compelling, especially since its all addressed to who the ingame people think is "god"
 you
The biggest draw to this game, however, is simply How personal it makes the relationship between you and Niko
 Leading Niko feels like leading a younger sibling, in which Niko doesn't really understand what's going on, but will deal with events in their own childlike, innocent way
 During your advanture, Niko also comments on Every action you take and even questions you about our world all in your own name
 which further got me attached to Niko
 Standard game mechanics are also used to strengthen this bond, as when Niko is tired, you have to find a bed to let Niko rest in; this is the only way to save and close the game "naturally", and also initiates dream sequences along with more dialogue between you and Niko
 If you decide to close the window instead, Niko will be afraid and in a state of shock when you open the game again, as you brought darkness to the World Niko is in
 This happens often, to the point where you'll likely be afraid to hurt Niko by closing the game
Yet, despite your cluelessness and inability to explain how you can access things out-of-game
 Niko trusts you
 It's a sort of child-like trust towards an adult that's so innocent that you can't help but love Niko back
 When the game denied me the Opportunity to respond to Niko, who was frantically calling my name
 I Realised that I could do nothing but stare at the screen
 That feeling is horrid, accompanying a person almost all the time
 and then being denied the chance to say "I am here for you"
 Eventually, I wasn't playing for the sake of the world
 I was playing for Niko
 For Niko's happiness, and to hear Niko speak to me again
Niko felt real
 I wasn't ready to let my little cat-like child go, even though that's what I was fighting for this entire time
And that made the full game's ending all the more painful
 You wouldn't expect a person's happiness
 to hurt you so much
OneShot is initially a story of trust and moral decisions, but its true lesson is of attachment
 before Letting go
 The initial ending will make you think of your consequences
 The true ending will make you cry, reluctant to pass the credits
 You only have one shot, as once you complete the story
 you'll want it to stay completed
 And yet
 I Don't want it to end
I'll never forget you, Niko

Do you like a game with a story line
 Like to solve puzzles that makes you think twice
 Like games that make you feel soemthing
 Then this is a game that you've been missing out on since December 6, 2016
 As you might have noticed with all the comments, "trying to explain the game would spoil the game"
All I can say is that OneShot is an experience that you won't forget anytime soon
 Just a small note though, "Prepare yourself for a great OST, along with some pancakes
 We love pancakes

"The world knows you exists"I cannot describe just how amazing this game is
OneShot is a game where this game breaks the 4th wall and knows about your existance
You are guiding a character named Niko
Niko wakes up in another world that is "decaying"
This world is dying because its sun went out and your mission is to save the world
However
your choices will affect the gameplay
This game breaks the 4th wall by knowing that YOU exist
It has puzzles that you have to find out using your computer, and not the game itself
This game, is by far, the most amazing game I have played
I never know that I can grow attacthed to a cute character as Niko
The soundtrack is really good, the storyline is amazing, and the characters are well placed
This
is the first game that legit
made me cry
I would totally recommend this game to people, because its simply really good
Edit: I just completed
the "original" ending
I'm

Like Undertale, this game is about a young child trying to get home after falling into a land of strange creatures while being blessed with a "videogame" power
 However while Undertale is bright and cheery, OneShot is quiet and somber
 If you liked Undertale, give it a shot

Remember that part in Bambi
Remember that one scene in Lion King

Multiply by 9000 feels, pour into a bowl of Princess MononokeAdd a dash of Spirited AwayMix until a tidal wave of feels makes you cry like a little girl And thats just the main menuNow I get teary every time I see an apple
The music in this game is phenomenal, think Trine just 10 times more beautiful with added vocals
Controls and physics feel perfect, fluid and interesting
 You really do feel like a little cat spirit gliding through the forest, climbing walls and trees
Visually the game is beyond stunning, hands down the prettiest game I've ever seen
Storytelling is amazingly done through game mechanics and not just "passive" cutscenes
Next time someone tells you video games is not art, show them Ori

Truly one of the most gorgeous games ever
DISCLAIMER:- I bought this game on a whim after seeing it in the Steam Store for the first time
 I watched the promotional videos and was immediately interested in it
- I love this game, therefore this review is biased
 I am not some professional games journalist who makes a living off of reviewing games and tries to provide an objective and totally unbiased point of view on the subject material
 If you were expecting such a review from the average Steam user, then your standards might be a bit high
 No offense, high standards aren't really a bad thing
 My intention with this review is to convince others who might be interested in the game to take the leap and drop $20 on it
 That's all
- At the time of this review, I only had about two hours of playtime invested
 Overall the game isn't terribly complex, and the gameplay is what you'd expect from the average Metroidvania title (with more focus on platforming than combat)
 It's polished, the art is beautiful, and the story is engaging while not getting in the way of playing the game
 After two hours, I felt that I could wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who might show interest in it
REVIEW:If I had to briefly describe the game, I would say it's a very artistically-driven 2D platformer with common elements from both the Metroid and Castlevania series
 But that merely scratches the surface
I won't go in to excruciating detail regarding the gameplay
 It's a branching world with areas you can't access without certain abilities
 You progress naturally until you unlock a new ability, then more options open up and you can progressively explore more freely
 Naturally, the world is littered with hidden goodies like health and energy powerups (like energy tanks and missiles from Metroid)
 Platforming does become rather challenging, and the fact that the movement is very responsive and feels polished makes platforming a blast despite the difficulty
 However, a certain ability you are given right from the start can detract from the challenge by essentially removing the consequences of dying
 Combat is pretty simplistic (you basically just spam the attack button and it auto-locks to the nearest target), but it is clearly not the focal point of the gameplay
 The majority of the abilities you unlock cater towards more efficient and complex platforming maneuvers
 There is a simple experience system which rewards you with skill points that allow you to unlock an assortment of abilities that are split off in to three different skill trees
 These abilities are either unique passives, or augment the main abilities that you acquire through progression in the game
As far as visuals go, this game is in my humble opinion at the very apex of gorgeous
 The art style is surreal and brimming with color and personality
 I'm not exaggerating when I say you could take a screenshot anywhere in the game and it would make for a great picture
 There are certain areas in the game where you just have to stop and marvel at how downright beautiful the art is
 Not many games these days are capable of that (the last one that comes to mind is probably The Vanishing of Ethan Carter)
 People might say that gameplay is all that matters, but this game is a prime example of why that's simply just not true anymore
 I believe that in regards to modern games, visuals will always play an important role in making the game what it is
 Games are a from of art now, not just pure entertainment
 Anyone who plays this game and says otherwise is probably insane
The musical score is just as good as the visuals
 There's heavy use of woodwind instruments and a touch of harmonic female vocals that really set the mood
 There are overaching themes throughout the score that gives the whole soundtrack real cohesion
 The best part is that the music doesn't overplay itself during cutscenes to create a sappy, melodramatic mood
 During general gameplay, the music is calmer and more relaxed
 In turn, it helps to keep the player feeling the same even during the tougher platforming areas
The story, while somewhat simple in nature, does a great job of presenting the game's gorgeous world and giving you a solid sense of pace
 It's not a really big RPG story with tons of lore or anything, but you can still easily be enveloped by its provocative and charming nature
 The game can even be surprisingly emotional and deep when you least expect it
 Think of the art as a painting and the story as a frame
 The frame may be simplistic, but it just goes great with the painting
Moon Studios have made a strong debut with this game, and I can't wait to see what else they have in store for us in the future
 If you have the money to spare, I highly recommend you pick this up; or wait until the next big sales event and maybe you will find it for cheap
 Either way, it's worth every penny
Posted: 26 December, 2015
Everyone should play this game
I've never written a review of a Steam game, so take the existence of this one as a testament to the impact it had on me
The gameplay is fantastic, sort of like Metroid, sort of like Donkey Kong, sort of like so many other classics
 And yet Ori stands on its own
 Ori is intuitive; it's inventive; it's surprisingly challenging (I died over 200 times in the 10 hours it took me to complete it
) But damn, is it fun
 Everything is seamless
 And I mean everything
 From the minimalist interface, to the controls, to the microsecond load time between dying and respawning - the latter of which you, like me, will come to know well
 And equally well the fact that you can save, more or less, wherever you want
Power ups and ability trees keep things fresh, and like a good piece of Zelda equipment, every addition to your platforming repertoire opens up a whole new mechanic to the gameplay
The story is as flawless as the game
 (And the opening is as memorable as the ending
 Have ready a bucket for your tears
)Few action platformers have a decent story to accompany it
 Ori is different
 No, the game doesnt play itself; it isnt one of those
 Rather, like a player to respawn points (see: this game), gameplay and narrative are intimately connected; character actions are justified, and power ups serve the story and the player
 The result is that each accomplishment you make is both rewarding and intensely satisfying
I testify to what others have said: the game looks beautiful, sounds beautiful, plays beautifully
 Everything about it is stunning
 But don't be fooled: it's beautiful *and* hard
 If you aren't a skilled platformer now, play Ori and the Blind Forest
 You will be
10/10
Posted: 13 March, 2015
This game
it's damn near perfect
 The art direction and animation are really tight and well executed, the controls are something to be envied and are incredibly well done, the music is captivating and remains in my head well after I've put the controller down
I am completely and utterly head over heels for this game
 I look forward to exploring more in this game
 The sense of accomplishment you feel from gaining a new ability to reach a part of the map that was previously unavailable is particularly satisfying
 I wish I had more time for this amazing experience
I can't recommend this game enough
 Anyone considering this game, don't consider
 Just buy
 Install
 Play
 You won't be sorry
Posted: 24 March, 2015
TL;DR --> vmdflgnsdjgnvk lkdfj gvbjk 11/10---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------From time to time a game appears that gives a lesson to every developer and company about how to make games properly
 Well, Ori is one of those games
Even though perfection will never exist in videogames IMO, I find it really hard to search for cons into this game
 Just notice that I was very hyped about Hotline Miami 2 for almost a year and I honestly admit that this hype banished once I purchased Ori
 Ori and the Blind Forest brings something new, something fresh, something NEEDED
 I can't imagine the amount of work required to build a game like this but trust me people, devs can be hugely proud of it
 Visuals are the closest to perfection I've ever seen in a videogame
 Just see it for yourselves and get stunned about what a 2D platformer can give you
 Seriously, you don't need to go to an art museum anymore
 This game is well enough
 From beginning to end it'll be impossible for you not to stare at every single detail, every singe hand-made background
The tag "Great Soundtrack" is not one of the most voted without a reason
 Such a great visuals strongly need a great soundtrack too, and that's what you'll find
 Tracks add so much feeling and emotion into this game that together with the visuals it becomes one of the greatest combinations of the WHOLE industry
Controls are tight and super fair
 Mind this words: the game is challenging and every single death will be of your fault
 This is the regular metroidvania where you get more movement skills as soon as you progress into the story
 I found quite some similarities to the experience I got with Guacamelee (in terms of gameplay)
The story
 OMG
 Just when I thought I saw everything a 2D platformer could give (mostly soft and simple plots), this game appears
 20 minutes were enough for me to start clapping in front of the screen
 This game has one of the strongest prologues I've ever played
 AND IT'S IN 2D
 SO MANY LIMITATIONS, YET SUCH AN INCREDIBLE EXECUTION
 The length is also good enough
 Not too long, but not too short either
 Map is extremely well planned, together with collectibles and secrets
 Getting everything can perfectly give you 8-10h, which is more than the average platformer can offer
Finally, achievements are very well written too
 This sounds stupid but it's sad to see some nice games where the achievements are completely senseless or wrongly directed
 This game has every kind of achievement I like: storyline achievements, collectible achievements, movement achievements, and hardcore achievements
 I think that the only con I can find to this game is that sometimes there are so many glowing things together that you can't really distinguish the friendly ones against the enemy bullets
 But this mainly applies to one particular enemy and I'm partially colorblind so I can't say it's a con at all
Overall, just stop buying mediocre bundles nor triple A games
 Do yourself a favor and pay 20 for this game
 We're in front of one of the best games of the year, and we're still on March
 But seriously, this game is something I've never seen before (and I've played more games than I can count) and probably no one will dislike this game (aside from fake haters and people pretending to be funny)
 Final Mark: 9
75/10 this is one of the best 2D platformers you'll play in a very long time

So I was skeptical about this game but I kept hearing good things so I picked it up one steam sale and forgot about it
A year and a half later I see it in my unplayed favorties list and decide what the hey lets give it a shot
OMG from the intro I was hooked it really punches you right in the feels im a grown man and I had tears in my eyes during several parts of this game
The Visuals are amazing
The Game play is fun but can be old NES hudsons adventure island dont mess up once difficulty but remained fun and a challange
Those escape sequiences good lord I was on edge and of course yelled at the monitor a few times
 ok more the a few times
The soundtrack well it was so good I bought it which is rare
If this is any indication I have never seriously NEVER reviewed a game before on steam and I felt compelled to write up on this one
Truely one of the best games I have played in years

I very, very rarely review games, so I'm doing this out of sheer respect and thankfulness for the developer, Moon Studios
Ori is easily
one of the best games
I have bought on a whim (in 8 years of Steam), and had I had any idea of that
 well, it wouldn't have been on a whim
 The art is probably what stands out the most, but that's only because the controls are so well implemented, they never really took me out of this immersive - and touching - story
 Not for a second, honestly
It was sufficiently challenging for me as a seasoned gamer, but I'm more than sure it shouldn't be frustrating for any casual gamer who doesn't possess a really, really short temper
 In fact, I cannot think of another game that made me care so little about dying and having to repeat the same difficult scenes
 To the opposite: I was so excited by them (in no small part thanks to the amazing soundtrack and artwork that surely accompanied), that I sometimes died on purpose at the end of a tough part to try to play it again more perfectly
 I feel like this is a really big deal and I hope you believe me
I can honestly think of only one con: you cannot (as of yet at least) continue playing your save after you finish the game
 I wish I had known this before, because I truly wanted to go back and finish it 100% - something I'm not at all used to - but I'm sure I'll play through it again
 By the way, I makes me happy that the Ori has TEN different slots for you and your family/friends to start a game on
 I don't understand why so many games lack that
In short, I HIGHLY recommend playing Ori, and I can see no contraindications to warn buyers of
 Gameplay, art and soundtrack are truly remarkable, and the story is surprising and nothing short of beautiful
 This is a game that stands out, and one to remember for a long, long time
 Thank you and congratulations to the developers for making such a brilliant game, and selling it for such fair price
Things Ori reminded me of, while playing: Studio Ghibli, Rayman, Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons, Guacamelee, Disney, The Lion King
I'll finish by quoting another reviewer: "Oh how I wish there were more games like this one, especially when they come out of nowhere like this one did
" One of the best things I've played
Posted: 10 March, 2015
I have been waiting for this game since E3 2014 and boy does it deliver
 Absolutely breathtaking visuals, wonderful ambient soundtrack, and an emotional story that brought me to tears less than 5 minutes into the game
 It's also a pretty challenging platformer with some light RPG elements, so there's plenty to like about it
Do yourself a favor and buy this game
 You won't regret it

I wanted to wait until I beat it to write a review but at 60 hours in, the game is already so good I feel compelled to
This is probably one of the best action JRPGs you will find on PC, and certainly the height of the Tales series (disclaimer: I've played a handful, but not nearly all of them)
 Let's dive right into what makes Berseria great, and where it's a bit lacking:- The story is engrossing
 Yes, it's JRPG, and it's Tales, so there's bound to be clichés and tropes, but Berseria strikes the perfect balance of not taking itself too seriously while presenting you with relatable characters in genuinely compelling scenarios
 You can have fun, but still feel invested, and there's enough sub-plots to keep you interested in ALL of the main cast
- The combat is bleeding edge, joyous, chaotic mayhem
 It's super fast paced, and between juggling enemy types to trigger status effects to fill your Soul Gauge to use Break Souls to feed your Mystic Artes (which you'll want to properly time to get grade bonuses, among other things), there is always a strategy to be refined on the battlefield if you are a grinder, min-maxer, or whatever
 That isn't to say mastering the mechanics is a necessity
 There are plenty of tools and difficulty settings to tweak the combat difficulty to your liking
 Me
 I crank that **** up to Intense ASAP and get to work melting wave after wave of demons in Dangerous Encounters (and all the better if you get a Dire Foe afterwards - seriously, these are some of the best, most heated moments of the game
)
- The cast is fantastic and the writing is strong
 This is hands down the biggest strength for me
 Despite being yet another title in a genre as saturated as JRPG (in a series as dense as Tales, no less), the main characters manage to have very distinct personalities and motivations, and are just the right amount of "morally grey" to be likable without being obnoxious
 They start off as somewhat standoffish misfits, cooperating only to pursue their personal opportunistic goals, but over time you will see them grow together in a way that is believable
 There's also something deeply satisfying about being able to play as a team of blatant criminals, as opposed to the white knights, royalty, and chosen ones we've grown so tired of
 And beyond that, even the side cast of characters does a great job of complementing and bouncing off of the main cast
 The villains do seem a bit one dimensional, and I fear the "big bad" twist is going to end up being predictable, but it's a small bump on an otherwise fantastic journey
 Final note on this - the themes and the tones are appropriately adult
 The language feels natural and there is swearing and innuendo in all the right places, never beating you over the head with it
- The pacing is good
 The intro/tutorial segment is the perfect length (some Tales games have ones that drag on ENTIRELY too long, not the case here), and you will periodically unlock new mechanics to keep the gameplay fresh
 You will actually acquire all the party members pretty early on in the game, although this is preferable due to how the equipment mastery system works
- Great customization options
 The arte pools are huge, and the trees are fully customizable
 I've used Velvet almost exclusively for the first 60 hours, but I can tell there is still plenty to unlock for her and the rest of the cast seems to have their own fun, unique playstyles as well
 Because of how fast paced the combat is, I don't find myself switching primary fighters as much as previous Tales games, but Berseria actually makes it even easier by allowing you to swap mid-battle, mid-combo
 Lots of fashion options, lots of equipment flavors, and a mastery system that makes it fairly compelling to keep different sets of equipment around (and tweak until your playstyle is content)
- The world map is expansive, but the areas can be a bit samey, and the puzzles are definitely nothing groundbreaking
 Pretty middle of the road for JRPG, so just don't expect anything impressive there
 I find myself constantly looking back to Symphonia as the holy grail of Tales world maps, as I've yet to see that one be outdone
- The voice acting is good
 I've only listened to the dub, as the English VAs are more than serviceable
 The main cast are all great
 The NPCs are not as varied as I'd like or as I have seen in previous Tales games, but again a pretty small nitpick
 Nearly all cutscenes and skits are fully voiced, though, so there is a truly dense amount of lore and worldbuilding going on, if you are into it (I am)
- The visuals are aesthetically pleasing
 Watch some videos
 It should be clear that Berseria is not pushing next gen graphic fidelity
 Instead it goes for a colorful, eye-popping art style that does the game justice
- The music is good
 The tracks set the appropriate moods, and have enough depth to be enjoyable from moment to moment, but I honestly didn't find much in the way of "holy **** I need to go download this right NOW" kind of songs
 Still, I would say a bit above average in terms of video game music
In summary, this is a must-buy for Tales fans, but still a heavily encouraged purchase for JRPG fans, action RPG fans, or someone looking to try out the genre
 If you haven't tried the series before, don't worry about needing to start at the beginning
 You can jump right into this without any issues and you'll find yourself getting giddy with glee as you literally hack through swaths of demons like they were hot butter in no time: I guarantee it
Posted: 24 June
I think the only bad thing I can say about this game is that a lot of the environments just seem pretty bland and the dungeon layouts can be irritating at times
 I also wish that it looked nicer overall
 Velvet could also use some better costume options :sThat aside, the game has a wonderful story and the entire group of characters are all lovable
 The combat is somewhat deep and also quite fun
 You can definitely tell that a lot of care and love was put into this game
This was my first Tales of game and now I'm definitely going to be looking to play more
 Easily my favorite game of all time
Posted: 10 February
Once every few years, a JRPG arrives that blends together good world-building, a story that is both fascinating and thought-provoking, challenging your own worldview, philosophy and beliefs and a combat system that, while simple at first, makes you feel like a glorious badass having fun killing hordes after hordes of enemies
This is Tales of Berseria
 Review is spoiler-free, minus the intro stuff
The game puts you in the boots of Velvet - an average village girl that one day gets to see her little brother being murdered right in front of her by her own brother-in-law, she turns into a daemon and then she gets thrown in prison to feast on other daemons for 3 years
 As she manages to escape with someone's help, she learns that her brother-in-law now is mankind's greatest hope against daemons, and the whole world praises him as a saviour
 Filled with rage for the injustice she and her brother tasted, she embarks on a journey to kill him
Let me start off with the world-building
 I was having a discussion with a few friends over how games stopped bothering with giving attention to details due to how gamers nowadays tend not to care much about information that gives you a clue on how X village works, how they survive in Y conditions etc
 For that I'm glad that Berseria doesn't do that
 Here, in the form of completely optional NPC's, you'll find stuff like a father looking for his lost son, a group of teenagers who become interested in music and decide to start their own band and dogs that are criticizing humanity
 For that I praise the creators of the game who decided to not restrict themselves to "what information is useful" but also to "what information makes you immerse"
 I found myself returning to a city wondering whether a couple of NPC's got married
 I can't criticize the English voice acting because I play the game in Japanese voice acting, and there's some great quality to be found there
 One of the characters in the group, for example, is the same voice actor behind Jojo's bizarre adventure part 4 antagonist, Yoshikage Kira, and he's doing a glorious job here, too
Combat system time
 People will bash the game for having "button-mashing combat"
 And they are right, combat is button mashy, BUT
 It would be wrong to stop here
 See, this is first and foremost a JRPG that has an "exploit weakness system"
 Your typical dungeon/area visit will be
to first identify the enemy population's weaknesses, compile combos that hit every weakness they have then mash that button against them
 For example (oversimplified), if an area has worms, knights and bats I end up identifying and crafting 3 different combos so I'll mash Y for bats, X for knights and B for worms (Xbox controller)
 This is the equivalent of scrolling through menus in a turn-based JRPG to find the ice spell versus enemies that are weak to ice, the armor penetration move for armored enemies etc
 Later in the game the enemy variety becomes large enough that not only you craft combos for each but you make sure you can weave them
 So you'll start with X for the first move of the X-combo then Y because the second move of the Y-combo works not only for bats but for armored, etc
 Then you get moves called mystic artes that make your characters go full blown crazy killing machines
 All in silky smooth 60 frames per second, even for my poverty rig (there's a demo on Steam that you can check out if you're not sure about your PC's performance)
 Add to that the amazing A
I
 behind your teammates, which is also one of the best, if not the best in a Tales game ever and can easily play better than 70% of the players
 I can even put everyone on "auto" and go to the bathroom knowing that we will almost certainly win a fight
Now for the downsides: So far, I find the game quite linear - on rails, so to speak, and the optional areas that I have unlocked so far (I haven't finished the game yet, have mercy) are simple arenas that lack in the difficulty and satisfaction department, compared to the rest of the content
 I found myself visiting them once, go "is that it
" then leave in disappointment
 Maybe this will change as the game goes on
 I heard very good things about the post-game content
 There are also the occasional sidequests and mini games that (thankfully) are so many and diverse that you can "play favorites" without losing the rewards (you win coins that let you buy stuff, but its shared across mini-games, thanks Namco)
The difficulty settings are Simple - Normal - Moderate - Hard, with Intense and Chaos being unlocked after you do something in the game
 On the other hand, there's a way to make fights so hard you'll almost always get a couple of party members or everyone dead
 To give you a clue, my winrate in normal fights is around 90% but for dangerous fights it's at 10%, but that's just me not accepting winning a fight with people being knocked out left and right (the game rewards you with in-game score, called Grade, if you win fights without deaths and without using items, who would say no to that
)
 Maybe it's also me being used to JRPG's throughout the years
 Someone can also play the game with the combat system in full automatic mode - AI doing everything - in case you just want to experience the story without bothering with learning how the combat works (I wouldn't do that but some people could)
 NINJA EDIT: Something else that I noticed and I gotta say: Contrary to most JRPG's, on higher difficulties the enemies not only get the usual stat increases but also different attack frequency and in bosses it can be a change of movesets and spells
Overall, this isn't simply one of the top Tales games ever (and easily the best modern Tales game - RIP Zestiria) but a great JRPG
 I said it on my Zestiria review and I'll say it again: "Tales of" games are the only JRPG series on Steam that combines fast-paced flashy combat system with immersive storytelling
 Does it worth paying full price
 For me that's a resounding yes
 But I hope that my review was informative enough to draw your own decision
 Meanwhile, I'll be finishing my playthrough and prepare for my next one
 And if you choose to get into it, I would advise you to take it slow and savor every minute, instead of speed through it
 JRPG's like this one deserve to be enjoyed like good wine or chocolate

Do you like great story telling
Do you like JRPG's
Well, there's a reason you see "Overwhemingly positive" on the reviews
Treat yourself

A JRPG in which your starting party is an angry vengeful demon, a psychopath with a sword, a merciless pirate and a brainwashed child you literally kidnap and take on dangerous adventures with for endgoal to kill King Arthur because he made the world a better place and you just can't accept saving the world was worth one life
Also the battle system is majorly improved over Zestiria and Xillia/Xillia2

So after about 70 hours i finished the story of Tales of Berseria
 I did not download any item packs and played on normal difficulty
 I´ll just jump right into the review
GraphicsIt fullfills its purpose
 It is not espeacially good or bad
 The characters are well designed and the animated scenes are beautiful
 But tbh, i don´t really care about the graphic quality in this game
SoundFirst of all the soundtrack is amazing
 No other than Motoi Sakuraba composed the soundtrack
 It really has a big role in the atmosphere of the game
 This is what i call art
 Every scene is accompanied by a track, that fits perfectly
 Joy, happiness or sadness, even the funny parts feel authentic
Now the dub
 Everything in this game is dubbed
 The dubbing actors did an amazingly good job
 I have no reason to play the Newgame+ with japanese dub
 The english dub is by far better than expected and i´ll stick to that
 BUT this game has a bug
 Many people cannot hear certain sounds when using 5
1 surround sound
 In this case you also cannot hear the dub
 Using the stereo mode fixes this problem, but can cause other sound issues
 I recommend using a fix for that (just google it and you will find it)
GameplayThe battle system is in realtime and pretty good, but not well explained
 You have to figure out some stuff on your own
 Tbh, i liked figuring stuff out, but i can see people being annoyed, because certain actions/skills don´t work they way they expected it
 The items and ability system is easy to understand and the game is beatable without focussing too much on optimization
 If you want to master every equipment or make very effective combos in battles it becomes a little bit more complex
Outside from fights in dungeons you have to walk a bit until you unlock certain teleportation points
 Outside from dungeons there is a quick travel system that is bound to a consumeable item
 Since you should have absolutely no money problems, it is no problem to buy nearly endless of this stuff
At a certain point ingame i nearly stopped caring about anything that has to do with gameplay, because the story gets such a strong peak, you could have given me 2d jump´n´run gameplay and i would have enjoyed this game
AtmosphereNow some of the more important parts
 The atmosphere in this game is convincing
 I felt like i was part of the world ingame
 This is achieved by the amazing soundtrack and also by many other little things
 For example small conversations between characters (which are also dubbed) or even some background noises
The characters all have their motivations to do whatever they do and no one feels out of place
 There are many scenes where i thought: "Oh god no, why did you say that
" The first time was the point where my mindset changed
 These characters HAVE a personality
 Each of them
 And the game is not afraid of showing this
The characters develop while progressing in game
 Everything happens for a reason
 To fully understand what happened with some characters i had to rewatch scenes or let whatever happened rewind in my head
 I paused the game many times, just being stunned, waiting for my brain to comprehend the situation
StoryWow, what can i say about the story
 I don´t know, i am speechless
 The story in itself is kind of sinister and gets darker, especially when you understand why certain things happend
 While the game starts a bit slow it quickly gets to a point where i stopped thinking this is a game
 I stopped "playing" it and started "experiencing" it
 My emotional state was decided by the happenings in game
 I felt joy, i laughed, i was angry, i even cried a few times
 This story hits you hard with emotions
 And this is coming from a guy who stopped playing story focused game long ago and thought he was more of a cold, emotionless guy
tl;dr: All i can say is i am absolutely overwhelmed by this masterpiece
 Don´t get scared away if you think the beginning is slow or boring
 If you are only interested a little bit in JRPGs or just want want to experience a great stroy, because most of the animes released nowadays are boring, i definetly recommend this game
 I also recommend watching the trailer "The Calamity and The Blade", which is english dubbed, since steam only has the "The Flame" trailer
This is the best game i have ever played

Pros-Fast paced intuitive combat
-Solid visuals and animations
 Cutscenes are nice
 Character models and expressions are great
-Interesting story theme
-A lot of content, very long game even when you're moving through it at a fast pace
-Great HUD for finding points of interest and next plot point
-Tag switch mechanic is fun
 Soul Break mechanic is fun
-A good amount of side content with interesting rewards
 Unlocking some costumes felt rewarding
Cons-Bloated and repetitive dungeon design as you progress in the game-Arena is beyond average-Weakness/Resistance/Stagger system is really wacky
 Combos feel super RNG unless you heavily spec yourself with stats and hitstun modifiers-Lack of good ways to enjoy the combat system post game-Combat is fun, but becomes very mashy at times-decent songs in the soundtrackNeutral-Minigames range from simple and fun to grindy-Game is long and packed
-A lot of the recycling, but that's a tales standard at this point
-Difficulty is average overallNote:this may seem like a backstory for Tales Of Zesteria if you ever finish the game till the end and do every side quest to know the full content of the story
 Should You get this game, only if you are Tales Fans and i certainly this game will be worth your time and money and pack full of content than the previous Tales installment beside my Favorite Tales Of Symphonia

A game I wish I could forget entirely so I can go back and play again for the first time
 The world is large, the quests are plentiful, and the story reads like a top teir play
 The usual archetypes are introduced but as the game marches on they're abandoned and the depth of each character shines through
Pros:-Story-Combat (Insanity is level to shoot for, if it's too easy, you're on the wrong difficulty)-Playtime-MusicCons:-JRPG Dialogue, prepare for the grunts and cheesy emotions-Weapon system feels abritrary at times, no reason to give up certain gear for a long time

Story: 9
5/10Characters: 8/10Combat: 9
5/10FPS : 60/60---------------------Overall: 9
5/10Pros:+ The story is not your average save-the-world heroic stuff, instead it's dark and twisted
+ The combat system is the best among all Tales' games and is easy to understand
+ There are strong enemies if you like a good challenge (such as "Dire" foes)
+ New Game+ is filled with interesting options, so starting another run is worth it
+ 60 FPS
+ New battle camera
+ Quick save option
Cons:- Some characters may be annoying
- Music is not as good as other Tales' games
- Dungeons look better than in Zestiria, but some require a lot of time and running around to finish
Note:You don't need to play Zestiria before this one to understand the story, but doing so will make Berseria much more enjoyable since it will show how Zestiria came to be
 Alternatively, you can play Zestiria after Berseria
 Whichever you choose will make you experience the story in a slightly different way

Plant vs
 Zombies is a cute,addictive and fun game for all ages
 I play it a lot of my old school laptop, and it runs completely fine even on that
 The game has a lengthy story with various challenges to overcome
 There's many plants, zombies and maps to play around with
 The story is very simple, but fun
 Crazy Dave is quite hillarious
Plant vs
 Zombies is a defense game
 Your task is to defend the garden against waves of enemies and upgrade the garden
 It starts of easy, but new zombies and plants are added throughout the story
 You will earn coins and other rewards which you use to buy new items from the store and upgrade your Zen Garden
 The game is really simple when it comes to graphics, but it's adorable
 All the plants and zombies have unique abillites and funny looks
 The game is really small, but there's so much content here
 Challenge mode, survival, story, Zen Garden, water park, mini-games,tree-challenge and a store full of important and fun upgrades
 The fun simply never ends
 This is a must own

Plants vs
 Zombies is one of the best tower defense games on the market
The added bonus of an enjoyable zombie theme just adds to the games value
If you enjoy tower defense games, this is a must-have, especially for the price
Posted: 29 October, 2016
I played pirated version when I was a kid
And to redeem my sin,
I decided to buy this
Sadly, this game doesn't support widescreen
Posted: 7 June
After playing the very disappointing DS version of Plants vs
 Zombies, this PC version feels and plays great
When I heard about PvZ the very first time when I was like 8, I watched ZackScottGames play it, and loved it
 A tower defense game that I was really looking forward to play when I realized it's on the DS, and got it on Christmas
 When I started playing, I was really disappointed, but I forced myself to finish it since I got it
 I finished it in about a week, and it was hell
 The graphics did look good for the DS, and using a touchscreen made it easy to place plants and collect sun/money
 Other than that, the framerate was awful when Waves happen (Can go from decent to like 5 fps), a good amount of small bugs, the Multiplayer was a bust, and the funny zombie animations weren't there (Like for example: when a zombie gets blown up on the PC version, they turn black and turn to dust
 On the DS version, they just turn black and disappear
)
 So much was so downgraded in the DS version it wasn't even funny, and for 40 dollars
 No thanks
8-9 years after that train-wreak, I got the PC version when it was on sale, and it's so much better and more enjoyable
Okay, on to the real review:Plants vs
 Zombies is a Tower-Defense game where you need to use plants in order to defend your home from zombies
 In order to plant your plants, you need Sun
 In order to get Sun, you can plant Sunflowers to increase the amount of Sun you can get, or just wait (planting Sunflowers is the best idea at the start
)
 Once you get enough Sun for a plant you want to plant (Example: Peashooter), you can select that plant, and place it into an available spot on the lawn
It's simplistic, yes, but it gets challenging as eff in later levels
At level 1-# and 2-#, you are at your lawn
 The lawn is the easiest, since it's only 5 lanes, and you don't need a special plant in order to fully secure all the lanes (exept on 2-#)
 Level 3-# and 4-# is the backyard
 The backyard is harder, since you have 6 lanes, and the 2 lanes in the middle are water lanes
 You need Lily Pads in order to place plants on the water
 Level 3-# isn't all that bad, and does take a bit to get use to, but on Level 4-#, you need to know what you are doing
 Fog takes up half of the right of the screen, and you need a special plant in order to get rid of some of the fog
 You don't know where a zombie is at or what lane it's in, because the fog blocks the view
Level 5-# and 6-# are the hardest levels of them all
 It all takes place on your bloody roof, which means there is no ground for your plants
 You need a special plant, which is the Flower Pot
 Flower Pots can be placed on the roof, and you can plant a plant on it
 What makes it so hard
 Flower Pots cost Sun in order to place down, and there is 7 lanes, so it will take a lot of time to save up a lot of Sun for Flower Pots and plants
 Not only that, but in Level 5-# and 6-#, they use the strongest zombies in the game
 It makes things much more challenging
 You have to be fast, and you need to know what you are doing
 The final level in the game is the final boss, which I won't spoil at all
 At level 1/3/5-#, it's daylight, which means you can get Sun from the sky, but at 2/4/6-#, you don't get Sun from the sky, meaning that you can only get Sun from your plants
There is a ton of different zombies in the game
 There is the normal one, which are easy as hell, Conehead Zombies, which take two Peashooters to kill, Ironbucket Zombies, which takes 3 Peashooters, Football Zombies, which needs some really good defense to kill, Disco Zombies, which summons zombies when he poses and just as strong as the Coneheads, and much, much more
 It keeps the game fresh and doesn't make it dull after the very first Levels
There is a ton of different plants to choose in the game as well
 There is over 25 different plants to choose, and you unlock one at the end on almost every level
 Sunflowers are your friend, and will always be in this game
 Even though there is a lot of plants to choose from, the game doesn't really hold your hand when it comes to choosing at the start at almost every level
 You can only hold up 6 plants to choose from, and you can buy more at Crazy Dave's store
 So that means you need to think when you do your choices, as it can backfire
Speaking of Crazy Dave's store, you can buy upgrades and other things when you are in Levels
 In order to buy items, you need to get Crazy Dave's keys (which is in 3-5, I think), and you need to save up money for the items (coins are dropped sometimes when zombies are killed
)
 If you have enough money, you can buy that item, and can use it in the Level
 It's quite useful
I know there is more to the game, but I want you to try it out, and see what the game has to offer
 For 5 dollars, it's worth it
But I did have some flaws with the PC version:It needs Co-op, like on the console versions
 Playing alone by yourself is fun, but playing the game with a friend makes it a blast to play
 If it was Vs
 Multiplayer (like the DS version
), then no thanks
Wish you can skip the tutorial at the start of the game, because the tutorial is just boring to play
TL;DR, I really recommend it
 If you love Tower-Defense games, or a game that will give good entertainment or a good laugh, this is for you
 The gameplay is great stuff
 Get it on PC, not on the DS
Final Scores:DS: 3/10PC: 9/10

After a little tinkering got R18 version up and running, so i will spend holidays shagging drawn virtual anthropomorphic cats, and only God can judge me
Now let's get serious
 If you're on this game's store page, you already know what you're looking for
 If by mistake you stumbled upon this and don't know what to do, i will explain:1)This is an eroge, which means it's a picture book with music and drawn porn disguised as a game, where you "play" as self-insert main dude and swim in pussie
2)Steam version have porn removed
 Apparently game about having your own bakery with harem of submissive catgirls made by hentai artist is also suitable for children, so god forbid they see any adult content
3)With a clever use of hands and internet you can still enable it4)There's a slider that regulates how bouncy boobs can be: from "british royal guard" to "screw physics, full Gainax" mode
5)There's 3 languages avaliable: english and two types of extraterrestial doodles
6)You get Steam achiviements if you play it with extraterrestial doodles
7)Art looks good if you're a fan of generic anniemays
8)Actually animated
9)In Russia it's possible to end up doing time for playing this
10)Music is upbeat and voice acting is
 ugh
11)There's also apparently some kind of story
12)Stuff like this stops me from reading serious vns
13)There's nothing wrong and shameful in playing this
14)Really
If you ask me why should you buy something like this on Steam - hell if i know
 I have no idea why its here in the first place
 I will, hovewer, give this game 100 boob bounces out of 100
Posted: 3 January, 2015
The only game on Steam that has a "Chest Bounciness" slider in the options menu
Absolutely revolutionary

This is the story of Marsh, the kid who played it as cool as possible until the bittersweet end
 Obviously, as an American, my study habits are different than that of a Chinese student
 Comparing Gaokao to something like the SAT test is a world of difference
 So for my playthrough of the game, I played it exactly like I do school in real life
 In the beginning, I had it all
 The girlfriend, Muxin, friends, and generally nothing to worry about except the first Simulation test, which was about 30 days away
 There were a surprisingly large amount of activities to choose from when free time was available, so I thought that the game likely wanted me to see what it had to offer
 How wrong I was
 After about 30 days of a happy, cute, almost relaxing little game of high-school antics, I screwed up on the first Simulation test
 After all, I had barely studied at all during my free time
The tone shift after messing up that test was jarring
 The music pretty much ceased altogether, except for this haunting song that played rather frequently when I would have arguments with my dissapointed parents
 Muxin wasn't the same either, as her score was rather low as well
 Marsh used to be a nice kid, after all, I was the one making his decisions for the most part
 After the arguments got more and more intense (to the point where coming home was dreaded), I was no longer able to study
 It wasn't my decision any more, it was my character, Marsh, taking the wheel
 The arguments got worse
 Marsh needed to bring up the test scores, and after talking with Muxin and deciding that the RELATIONSHIP was likely the reason for the low scores, Marsh dumped Muxin after screaming at her about his feelings
 I (the player obviously) had no say in this
 And the arguments kept getting worse
 Marsh's father eventually smacked him a few times
 The game was now very depressing
 After sleeping outside under a bridge, he finally slipped from all that I had made him
 If China wanted him to focus on the test and nothing else, it succeeded
 Marsh snapped
 Test problems became his entire life for the next 50 days
 Grades sky-rocketed, but all of the old characters were nowhere to be seen and health was declining
Eventually, after not eating for days, Marsh collapsed
 And I was given a decision after a LONG time
 Whatever I did, I picked the right thing, because Muxin, Xiaohan, and Stom saved him, and Marsh was back where he belonged
 In the end, I got a decent score and had no girlfriend
This game was an emotional rollercoaster, and it's not just an "anime game", it's WAY more than that
 I HIGHLY recommend it, and I'll be playing through it again very soon
Posted: 4 June, 2015
So basically, I paid $10 for my own biography
Over the course of the visual novel, I broke up with my girlfriend, failed all the important tests that would determine my future and became a video-game addict
 All that's missing is a sub-plot about killing tourists and burying them in the Blue Mountains

As a Chinese student who experienced "ZhongKao", the entrance exam for Chinese high schools, I had similar experience
I could still recall those days when we had endless practice tests, papers, teachers getting crazy and try to raise our score (because they get more bonus
)
 Parents getting worried on us, believing in nonsense extra classes, useless lectures even fake nutrients, is there gonna be an end
And back to GaoKao, a much more serious situation than ever (however I didn't experienced this, but I could imagine)
 How are the students doing
 Endless hell, again
 This is the truth
"You have so many chances to change your destiny, but GaoKao is the only time when your destiny gets decided
" (I played in Chinese so maybe this is not the actual translation) - Ms
 MeiI mostly care about the storyline instead of animation or style
 GaoKao
Love
100Days is reflecting the truth of a typical Chinese high school senior (with girlfriend)
 This might be one of the few games that could actually bring myself into deep meditation
 Masterpiece
Presentation: 9/10Easy to catch up, easy to play
 Although the tutorial was given in-game by his classmate which seems to be a little bit awkward, cookie let the player to speak out his name loud in the beginning of the game is quite interesting actually, especially when you put a funny name in
 Graphics: 9/10Great adapting Japanese's drawing style, however in China everyone wear stupid school uniform
 Umm I said too much
Music: 10/10The only way to judge is to listen
Gameplay: 10/10Not too complicated, not too easy
 But this game offers much more choices than a typical gal-game
Story/Background: 10/10The school, parents, the ambition, so much reality
 Can I give more than 10 points
Overall: 48/50

I've recently finished my first playthrough of this game, and was compelled to write a review
 I've played several Dating sims/Galgames, but it's never been my cup of tea, so to speak
 The whole idea felt interesting yet impractical, I didn't expect much from this game when my friend recommended it me
 This game however, is a whole another deal
Currently a college student, the feelings of being a high schooler still lingers inside, and this game has brought it all back
 Once again it hit me: the insecurities, the increasing pressure of schoolwork, the overwhelming want for some love, the struggles, and the urge to be live up to your parents' expectations, your peers' expectations, and perhaps most importantly, your own expectations
 Throughout the game there come times where it was too emotionally difficult for me to continue playing and I had to pull myself away for a minute or two
 You might be skeptical about how I can be so immersed into a seemingly simple game, and yes, I was skeptical about it afterwards
 But if there are teenage memories that you still held dear, play this game and all those will come alive again
 Ive played countless Galgames that are simply made to give the player pleasure out of playing them
 You start the game for 30 minutes and suddenly all 25 girls in the game are devoted to you
 Of course, that is an exaggeration, but you get my point
 This game is an entirely different ballpark: its realistic
 Consequences come when you least expect them, and you have to work hard to pull off anything
 Sometimes there can, and will be times where you just cant do anything about the horrible situation no matter how hard you work, and thats just the way it is
 Yes, it is extremely frustrating and stressful, but isnt that just like real life
Never have I in the course of only a few hours, experienced so many emotions
 I was so ecstatic and overjoyed during the good times that I caught myself smiling at the screen like an idiot several times
 But multiple times my head ached and stomach churned from stress that applied onto me through the main characters words
 When Muxin broke up with me (Sorry, spoiler alert, but this is only one out of 50 ways that the story could go), even though its temporary, I couldnt stop tears from trickling down my cheeks when all these pressure from teachers/parents/myself that Ive been enduring was for her
 Heck, there are so many times when I said something in response to the situation, and the me Im playing as in the game says the exact same thing right as I clicked through the text
 This game really digs deep inside, and I can testify to that
Of course, there are still flaws to this game
 In my opinion, I was able to be so immersed in the game because I understood Chinese
 The voice acting was spectacular (even though could be cringeworthy at times, yes Im talking about Stom), but if you couldnt understand what people are talking about, it really takes you away from the experience
 Also, multiple translation problems are still present in game
 From what I remember (which is not much, since I was so absorbed), the use of auxiliary verbs felt funny, even awkward to me
 For example:Why she do that
 or Why I need to go to school today
Should be something like Why would she do that
 or Why do I need to go to school today

Notice without those auxiliary verbs, the meaning can change drastically
 Why would she do that
 does not equal Why did she do that

 I dont have the Chinese manuscript so I wouldnt know the real intention, but this is something I would like to see fixed, because without these little details, we arent getting the complete meaning behind each line here
In the end, this game blew me away
 Id dare say this game made me actually fell in love with Muxin for the duration of the game, and several days after that, even right now as I type up this review
 This game definitely separates itself from the genre and stands as one of the best, if not the best
 I cant wait to play more and see whats to come, since Ive heard theres a total of 50 ways that the story could go, but Im not sure if I want to experience the emotional trauma of preparing for Gaokao again
 Plus, I love Muxin and Muxin only, so the storylines that doesnt involve heryeah
 Now, because this game is so well made, I guess Id like to recommend the game for you, whoevers reading this
The thing is, Muxin is mine and mine only, so dont do it
 Please

"if brought back to the past,which way would you choose
"I was ever a senior high school student in China ,same as the characters in this game, 1 year ago
i cried when i finished the game and got the end 10,the warmth of Xiaohan
Do you know
There was ever a girl in my life,a little similar to Xiaohan
 Oh,but she was not my neighbor
She appeared in front of me,like a godness,She made me know, what is the feeling when you fall in love with a girl
She made me know, if you love a girl,how happy will you feel when you see her smile
But,she also made me know, what is "pain"and what is "regret"
I lost her 
Both of us were under the control of our parents,teachers and the Chinese education systerm
And i feared being refused by her,even i knew,she wouldn't
I am a coward
I hate myself forever
Xiaohan is her,it is my first idea when i saw the Xiaohan in screen,then I made the decisions opposed to the reality
But Xiaohan isn't her
I have lost forever
Every day without she is like a book without pages
I don't know how she is now
I lost in touch with her
But I always recall her at night
 I always worry if there is a boy who will dash away her tears when she cry
 I always worry if there is a boy who wil
make her laugh when she is bored
 I always worry if there is a boy who will remind her of
dressing more when the winter comes
I really hope there is a boy besides her,who can look after her and give her happiness instead of me,though he is not me
To be honest,my English is not good
But I insist on setting down it by English,because I want you to know something
I don't know where you come from
Maybe US,UK or Australia
Millions of Chinese boys envy the freedom you have
So ,don't waste the freedom
When you see the girl sent to you by god
Put her hand in your hand,and say"I love you"
Don't be a coward like me

Positive:- # of endings (over 60
)- A relatively short dating simulator/time simulator with about 6 hours of gameplay
- Great story- Great character designs- Great music- Great characters- Lots of Achievements- Low priceCons:- The 100 days, of which you have to play through every single one, can seem long at times
- You can only do one choice/action a day (besides phone calls, changing
your helping items, etc
)- You can only increase one subject per day- The English translation was off because whoever translated it into English from Chinese did not have a strong enough grasp of English or proof readers
 It detracted from the experience and immersion a bit
 There were misspelled words, words in the wrong order, missing articles, etc
- The music drowned out the voices a bit
 (At default setting)- You can feel helpless at times going through the game (especially going trough it blind)
- Lack of default names except for one
 I would like to name my character something other than "Lee"
 And I don't know if that's his first name or last name
- Flashing bug ((The screen flashes sometimes during cutscenes))- The game affects Steam broadcasting, making it hard to live stream the game
- I can't figure out how to play the DLC Gaokao
Love
100 Days - Yes Monitress
Overall:I really enjoyed the game and thought it was lovely
 I've reached one ending at the time of writing this (Ending 39), and will definitely go back and play some more
 Another good thing is after you beat the game once you can skip read dialogue (default setting)
 I look forward to diving back into the world and
playing it through blind a few more times
 If China really has to go through Gaokao like this, then it's quite harsh
 All I have to compare it to the SAT, which doesn't hold a candle to it

This game is exceptionally entertaining and engaging for Asians that had stressful public exams
People studying in the West may not feel that stress during the exam preparation period due to different education system , family and society conditions
The game well protrayed the what if you have a girl friend before public exam situation and the tricky thing is how do you spend your time
 All in for studying 
 All for dating
 Just like those harsh choices in real life
The game content is quite rich and consists of many endings
 It worths a lot more than 9 USD
The soundtrack ,artwork and character design is quite good
 The only thing i hate about this game is the poor CV for certain supporting characters and not all the characters got their voice
Sometimes the game crashes and i have to play all over again
 So, save the game constantly
It is a good try from Chinese developer
 Good Job
 You have set a new standard for the industry

This game made me cry, made me sad, made me depressed, and made me happy
 This game is such a feel twister and mood twister
 This game will make you tear and happy at times
 This game is great, this was the best 10$ I spent on steam so far
 This game has so many endings and routes to take that it never gets old
 If you're looking for a game to keep you hooked this game is for you, just do me a favor
 Don't cry waterfalls like I did
 *Sigh*
Posted: 7 September, 2015
First, I'd just like to say that this game makes me really thankful that I didn't grow up in China
 Gaokao seems like the SATs put on steroids
 Anyway, I have so far completed 12 endings out of the 57 (
) in the game, in 40 hours of gameplay
 As a result, I definitely recommend this game to people who are looking for a game that will take a long time to complete, and will provide many hours of entertainment
 The storyline in the game is absolutely amazing, and so is the character developments of Muxin and Xiaohan
 There are quite a few translation errors in this game, so I wouldn't recommend it for those who care so much about grammar
 Completing all the routes in this game will take a lot of help from game guides, and the only really good one is pretty vague in its descriptions
 If you're looking for a story-rich game that will give many hours of entertainment, or even if you just want to complete only a few routes, I would definitely recommend this game

I am a pretty, pretty princess
When trying to become Queen I got stabbed, shot, poisoned, burned to a crisp, and rule 34ed Japan style
10 out of 10, would die again
Long Live the Queen is a Visual Novel game that, instead of trying to simply win the hearts of others and fall in love, you try to survive the horrors of royal life with your head intact
Of course, it doesn't help when everyone is a bloodthirsty murderer who's only desire is to bring forth the death of a fourteen year-old girl
Seriously, what the hell is wrong with them
You take the role of Princess Elodie, who needs to be trained to be a proper queen because Disney dictates that no princess is allowed to have a living mother
You end up making all the decisions because your father is a lazy bum who's shirked off all of his responsibilities, but for some reason won't let you have your mother's keepsake
The kingdom is a mess, everyone is evil, and no matter what you do you just can't seem to save this poor little traumatized girl
The mechanics of the game play on themselves in a bit of a cycle
You can upgrade Elodie's stats; which can increase slowly or rapidly based on her mood; which is based on events that have happened; which are based on your choices as well as her stats; which are upgraded accordingly based on her mood; which is ba-- ah you get the idea
This means that every decision, even the first one, can drastically affect how the story unfolds
No two games are alike, unless you purposefully do everything in the exact same way every time
But that's boring
Because of the above mentioned do-it-all-the-same concept, you can technically beat the game as many times as you like after you find out how to do it once
But beating the game is not where this game shines
Sure, acquiring the crown and becoming Queen Elodie is a grand event in itself; only if you get there (because you will die, and die a lot)
But one of the greatest things about this game is the ability to make different choices every time and see where it leads you
Find out what is down each path and discover what you can and can't get away with
And more importantly, unlock all the outfits because they're cute
Proper wardrobe is the pinnacle detail between ratty princesses and pristine queens
All in all, it is a great game and I'd recommend it to anyone
Wait
 you can learn magic
HELLZ YEAH

The first time I played this game I died fairly deep into it because I had not properly leveled decorating like a good princess
It only got better from there
I tried a perfect princess, died
I tried a warrior queen, died
I tried a mix, a little Sansa a little Aria, I died
By the time I finally won the game I had sunk invading fleets, executed half my family and awoken something evil in the dark and deep, and I was beloved by all those still alive
Simply put the game is amazing and you should get it

ELODIE WHY WOULD YOU PUSH AN ARROW DEEPER INTO THE WOUND TO REMOVE IT I KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BATTLEFIELD MEDICINE BUT RAMMING SOMETHING POINTY INTO YOUR ORGANS DOES NOT MAKE THE WOUND BETTER IT MAKES YOU DIE FASTER

Despite its girly appearances, the game involves a lot of strategy, and thinking to help the princess live, gain reputation, and overall being a great queen
 You make choices that effect the story and various paths to discover and explore (Its possible to complete the game with nothing in combat)
 However, one event at the end can not be changed no matter what choices you choose which causes the game to be somewhat linear
 The music was diverse and amazing in my opinion and helped set the tone of the game depending on the situation
 Gameplay could have been better for example more scenes, and backgrounds
 If you enjoy visual novels, this is a great game for you
 However, I feel the price of the game is a bit too much for the amount of gameplay and would recommend waiting till it goes on sale if you plan on purchasing the game

This is a game of trial and error, educated guesses, and mood management
 If any of those three things sound unappealing to you, you may want to stay away from this game
Have you ever played a visual novel
 This game resembles one
 Half of the game is background images with text boxes on top of them, and the other half is menus
 However, this is not a visual novel
 The story is very light in this game, and forgettable
 This leaves the gameplay to keep you interested:Your princess has a large number of stats, ranging from singing, decoration and dancing, to swords, polearms and archery
 You increase these stats by assigning two classes each day
 At the end of a day, you choose from several different activities, which alter your mood
Her mood is important because it directly affects how quickly you increase skills during the daily classes
 The "depression" mood happens to increase the "decoration" skill faster
 Increasing skills is everything in this game, because it runs on a set schedule of story events
 These happen at the same time and start off exactly the same, but the way your princess reacts to them depends entirely on how you've chosen to raise her skills
 This is the mood management I mentioned
 You are often asked to choose an action during story segments, and these can alter the story greatly - or instantly kill you
The educated guesses and trial and error come from that, and of the fact that you cannot possibly predict when you will need a particular skill
 Your princess will randomly be stabbed, poisoned, etc
 and if you don't have the right skill high enough, that's all folks
 The fun of this game is from starting a fresh game after each death, and planning how you will raise your princesses' skills this time to accomodate the story event you just died on
If this doesn't sound like something you would enjoy, I would have to advise you to avoid this game, as it is ALL it has to offer
 I personally got about ten hours out of it, and I'll probably go back for more someday, but this kind of experience may just not appeal to you

I'm gonna start saying that I bought Lucy just for the sake of buy something and 3 months went away before I decided to finally play it
 Now that I've finished the game I can safely say that I want to punch myself in the face for not playing this earlier because Lucy ended being one of my favorite Visual Novels, this is coming from someone who has read a whole lot of them
Okay so, what's Lucy about
 Trying to not spoil anything (because the story is the main focus of this VN), the game is set in a distant future where Androids are a normal thing to have in every house mostly to help in household chores, you are a 18 year old boy that the game refers as to "You" (yes for 99% of the game we don't know the Main Protagonist name, but luckily that's not a problem because the game is written in a way that the MC's name isn't important until the very very end) who absolutely hates those Androids for reasons that the game eventually explains, one day coming back from school you decide to cross a junkyard to save some time and you find an Android on the middle of this junkyard that was going to be destroyed in a matter of minutes if you don't "save" it, obviously you saved it because reasons and repair it, this Android who calls herself Lucy Valentine ends up being one if not the most advanced Android ever created who can mimick a person even better than a real person, with this premise we start to live our daily lifes with Lucy at our side who suddenly changes everything on it
The game starts slow by creating the scenario that will make the reader eventually ask himself questions like "Does a machine can ever have feelings
", "Does her feelings are even real
", "Do androids are really inferior to humans
", "It even matters if she is an android or a human
"
 What comes next is a story about morale and ethics, a story that made me feel anger to some characters, sadness as to what was happening and nerviousness to think what could possibly happen next, and at the end of everything when I finally reached the ending (which the game has two) it gave me a plot twist that no way in hell I was expecting that made me cry so much but also made me incredibly happy
The fact that this 5 hour visual novel made me feel the things that I mentioned in the last paragraph when I didn't have a single expectations when I first started the game is the reason why I 100% recommend this game at full price if you are both interested in starting in the world of Visual Novels or if you are already a veteran
To end this review I want to mention that I usually don't make reviews like this but after finishing the game I had the urge to write one as a thanks to the developers for making this game
Posted: 7 October
-Spoiler Free-I started out really disliking this Visual Novel
 As someone who has played many, many Visual Novels over the past few years, several things really stood out to me as incredibly irritating about this one
 On the surface, this visual novel gets everything right that most VNs can't, and gets everything wrong that even nukiges manage to do decently
Until you get towards the end, that is
The protagonist comes off as an angsty, brooding teenager that is incapable of any kind of reasonable decision making or conflict-resolution
 This isn't the case

Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- developed by Modern Visual Arts Laboratory or "Mvizlab" in short and published by Modern Visual Arts Laboratory themselves they are an indie game development team made in Korea and is very new but to my surprise their first visual novel is surprisingly good I was not expecting this quality at all
 In Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- players are given choices to make in the game and depending on your choices it will change the outcome of the story
 It features 2 or 3 endings
 1 of them being a Bad end and the other being a Good end
 Relevant links will be can be found below
The StoryLucy ~The eternity she wished for~ is a Visual Novel, about a boy and an android
 You play as the boy, who faces decisions and moral dilemmas that he struggles constantly in this near-future world
In the near future, androids have become the way of the norm they can be found everywhere in human daily lives
 Emotionless husks of metal have become a part of human society, much to the dismay of the boy because he had always preferred the "old methods"
 The robot he found at the dump site though, this one was different
 It laughed, it cried, it smiled, just like a human It has emotions
Audio and Visual elementsBackground, CGs
art  Backgrounds are generally average nothing too fancy to talk about the background art, but as for the CGs I felt it is a little wasted not saying that it is bad in anyway but the CGs they tend to use glares to cover up the background which makes it bright which is good, but at the same time taking away the atmosphere that it could have been created with backgrounds to add more to the game as a whole
 Something which caught my attention is that the UI or menu is very beautifully done I love the direction off the VN that it makes the menu and UI looks very realistic which contributes greatly to the overall atmosphere
Audio Elements  Nothing really stand out for the audio elements except for the fact that it cues in nicely and properly to fit in with the mood of the characters in turn manages to set the atmosphere perfectly every time
 There is also voice acting for Lucy available both in Korean and Japanese voice
To sum upTo sum up will I recommend Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- 
 Simple answer yes, it is well worth your time and money for sure and for people who likes a sad story or maybe Sci-Fi be sure to get this game

The steady advance of technological progress has brought us many unforeseen challenges
 With robotics and AI slowly but surely encroaching on what we used to think of as uniquely human, we are confronted with the question of what makes us so special and on what basis we deem ourselves superior to the intelligent beings we create
 Take this cerebral topic and intermingle it with some comedy, drama and romance, and what you get is one of the most promising indie VN releases of the year
Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- is a short visual novel developed and published by Modern Visual Arts Laboratory
 Set in a mostly contemporary world where robots and AI are ubiquitous and have almost reached the point where they are difficult to distinguish from humans, it tells the story of how a prototype android upsets the fickle balance in a conservative family critical of such technology
 A chance encounter has the teenaged main character take "Lucy" from the junkyard, pitting her exuberance against his cynicism and ensuring comedy hijinks as well as drama and tragedy
 While his struggles to integrate Lucy into his daily life play out on one timeline, the story intersperses snippets from the android research laboratory about the man (referred to as "Doctor") who pours all of his energy into assembling Lucy and protecting her from government interference, leaving the reader to hypothesize early on about how Lucy ended up at the junkyard
In terms of visual novel mechanics, Lucy packs few surprises
 The above average amount of choices packed into its three to five hour main story leads to many of them feeling a bit railroad-y, even though there are multiple endings to be conquered
 The visual presentation is crisp and polished, the backgrounds and CGs are of a high quality
 While there is nothing wrong with any one character sprite by itself, at times their visual styles are noticeably different, which can make scenes look incoherent (some more than others)
 The soundtrack is fitting but not particularly memorable
 Korean and Japanese voiceovers are provided
 The lack of multiplatform support (the VN is available for Windows only) is regrettable
 Something that is definitely worth pointing out is the absurd amount of post-game content and alternate endings that bumped my own reading time from just three hours all the way up to five  I am a quick reader though, and looking at the reviews, playtimes of anywhere between 7 to 10 hours seem within the norm
 The post-game content also provided the story with some much-needed rounding out, so you will most definitely want to keep reading after the credits roll for the first time
Thematically the VN attempts to cover a lot of ground
 At face value there is the "cute robot girl" story, which would have been easy to turn into clichéd "fated love" schlock, but thankfully the story stays very light on the romance elements and delivers its tender budding affection so subtly that you could almost miss it
 Lucy's character itself is less immune to clichés, seeing as she is rooted firmly in the "clumsy, ditzy, caring but naive" tradition of robot girls, and her characterization is at least consistent and believable even if it's not innovative
 Most of the situational humor falls in line with what you would expect from this part of anime culture, with Lucy being oblivious of her surroundings and the main character having to clean up behind her
More interestingly, the story also makes a more than solid effort at tackling the philosophical questions that arise when robots become almost indistinguishable from humans
 For example, part of the story's tension is derived from the question of what grants one's identity if memories as well as body parts can be replicated and replaced as needed (the Ship of Theseus is even mentioned by name)
 As a narrative theme, the idea of artificially created humans has a long literary tradition
 VN aficionados will of course tend to notice the many parallels to planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~, both overt and more abstract, but in the broader cultural world the concept dates back at least to the story of Pygmalion and Galatea of Ancient Greece and the golem from Jewish folklore, and has had one of its major spotlight moments in the form of Shelley's Frankenstein, which Lucy's story also reflects in many ways
 Now, like then, the question is posed what it is that supposedly makes us humans more deserving of a self-determined life than the ones we create as our servants
 The VN is not shy about exploring these questions even at the expense of subverting its own characters (such as when the protagonist shows a
knowledge of Schopenhauer uncharacteristic for a teenager who claims to have no interest in formal education)
Another topic that Lucy tackles is the question of labor automation
 Androids capable of sophisticated reasoning are pushing humans out of the workforce because electricity is much cheaper than minimum wage
 In the world of the VN, this seems to be just as much of an open question still as it is in ours
 This topic manifests itself very clearly in the character of the protagonist's father, who I suspect is hostile to the point of belligerence towards androids because he identifies so deeply with his work and considers his role as a productive employee the central aspect of his own sense of purpose
For all its interesting thematic points, there are also aspects of Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- that I had to grapple with, the biggest one being the general unlikability of the main character
 A lot of this can be explained away by his age and familial situation, but with as many external sources of tension as the story possesses, I wish they had relied less on the protagonist's egotism and carelessness as a source of drama, since it tends to strain the immersion
 In terms of minor nitpicks, I didn't care for how the screen showing Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics was used as a scene transition, since clicking through it every time quickly became tedious
Overall, Lucy is a very well-written story that profits especially from the aforementioned post-game content
 Even though this review is, as always, as free of spoilers as I can manage, I absolutely cannot avoid highlighting the brilliance of the final reveal during the true ending that astonishingly weaves everything together and tempts the reader to start the story over again right away
 It's just one moment out of many, but I appreciate the careful construction of the story leading up to it immensely
Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- stands on the shoulders of giants and it knows it
 Its themes have been explored in other works before and the VN has references aplenty
 However, it is still a worthwhile story on its own that is sharp and polished and has everything a good visual novel would need
 If you absolutely cannot stand ditzy anime girls, this may be too much to stomach, but if you're up for a cutesy tale about existentialism and sociotechnical progress, you can't go wrong here
Posted: 28 February, 2016
Straight to the point:Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- is definitely a Visual Novel worth experiencing
Simply stated:Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- is a thought provoking and emotional tale
The art is lovely and gives the characters life in the story
The music of the soundtrack is spot on,
both provoking and enhancing the experience
Production values are high and quality immediately apparent
What it's about:A coming of age story for a young man almost completely at odds with his world and his relationship with Lucy, an android he came to know by chance
Through his eyes we examine the role of technology in human society and effects upon that society
Through his experiences, we question aspects of "nature vs
 nurture" with regard to individual beliefs
Within the experiences surrounding his fateful discovery, we question what it is that makes a human "real"
From his experiences, we question values, what is love and what it is to love
My impression:One will smile, laugh, scowl, grimace and possibly cry during the course of the tale
The overall atmosphere of the story has elements reminiscent of Planetarian and Narcissu, while the story touches issues in a manner that reminds me of scifi films A
I and Bicentennial Man
The tales journey, as with life, is not always an easy one, but is worth the effort
Judgement:Recommended
Notes:
1- In addition to Steam, I have 10 hrs of play on my Playism copy
2- My review was made after achieving a couple ends prior to finding the True End
 Having now finished the True End (11
5 hrs in), like I said initially, this is a Visual Novel worth experiencing
3- With achievements and
extras to unlock, replay value is also good with this lovely work
Ahhh, the smiles
Posted: 11 December, 2016
TL;DR - Buy this
 You won't regret it
 [Don't read if you don't like UI related spoilers]I've never been a fan of visual novels
 None of them managed to hold me long enough to make it to the end
 Then came along Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For-This game showed up in my recommendations list one day and I saw the "Overwhelmingly Positive" response
 Then I started reading the reviews and thought, can a visual novel really make that big an impact
 So I decided to pick it up and try for myself
The story started out strong but then started to drag and I started feeling bored
 I dropped the game about 3 hours of playing (spread over 2 days)
 4 days later I came back because I really wanted to see what the fuss was all about
Then the ending came along and the credits rolled and it didn't have that much of an impact on me
 Once the credits finished and the main menu showed up, there were some jumbled letters instead of the "Start" button
 I thought it a bug and restarted the game, but they were still jumbled
 So I clicked on them
Then the REAL ending played
 And boy-oh-boy did I gush like a baby at the impact this sequence had on me
 I buried my face in my pillow and cried until I could cry no more
I've not been hit so hard by emotions for a long time and I thank the developers for bringing such an experience

Beautiful StorylineBeautiful SoundtracksBeautiful ScenesA true masterpiece
10/10
Posted: 3 March, 2016
Funny, Heart Warming, Gut Wrenching, Sadness, Anger , thought provoking and REAL are all things I felt or thought when reading this Visual Novel
As someone who has read many visual novels , graphic novels and comics, this is one of the finest things I have ever read
 PERIOD
I laughed, I cried tears of sadness, tears of joy,
I bit my tongue in anger, Questioned what defines life truly and most importantly I was touched inside and began to question some of my own demons in my life
 I will say that the people who wrote this were not your run of the mill writers, but were both very articulate and intelligent
 I won't state my reason for believing this due to possible spoilers but I must say they certainly must have pondered the very topic of this Visual Novel themselves, such as
using
Asimov ((who is one of my favorite writers)), and a few other thinkers and writers as an inspiration as well
Now I will get to the pros and cons
Pros
Great Artwork
 9/10Good Mood setting music
 7/10Not a lot of Characters but the ones in the Game are meaningful and all are key to the entire plot
 Quality over Quanity
 10/10Main Protaginist Feels very real, as do his supporting cast
 10/10Plot Twist with true ending that was very emotional and well done ((not to mention the very meaningful and Emotional Epilogues too)) Thought provoking, morally and spritually
Good Customer support after I had issues starting the Application
No forced romance , friendships or plot, things developed in time and all are meaningful when they do
Cons
Had an error starting the game, but that has been fixed
Predictible in some ways to a veteran of visual novels of what the "right choices" are to get the true ending
Wish the game went on longer just because I got attached to the characters ((not really a con just me whining it had to end
 :( ))Would I recommend Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For
 Yes, but see Below
I would recommend it for those who are looking for a thought provoking, emotional roller coaster of a visual novel, But for those that want a visual novel with the main plot being sex, or nudity
look elsewhere this one isn't for you
Once again thank you for taking the time to read my poorly written review but I can not express enough of how impressed I was with this little Visual Novel
I would like to say excellent work to the team that put this together and made it all possible as well
Kind regards

I'm not crying, you're crying
 
 
 
 SHUT UP
In all seriousness, if you like a touching story (and can forgive a little over-the-top melodrama), give Lucy a chance
I got it on sale, and it was well worth the $5
 Nice production values including gorgeous sprites, beautiful (and plentiful) CGs, some voice over work (Lucy is the only one with VOs, albeit not in English) and excellent sound design
Has in game achievements as well, though they aren't actual Steam achievements
Posted: 7 April, 2016
Never has any piece of media made me experience so many emotions in such a short span of time
 I went from mildly interested, to completely invested in virtually no time since the writing in this VN was so spectacular
Then, once Lucy had her claws in me, the feels trip didn't stop
 I flew between the emotions of happiness, anger, and sadness faster than I even knew I could
Then, when I finally achieved the true ending, I couldn't have been more satisfied
 And just as a side note, I will never forgive that prick of a father

Notable features:Infinite combo prevention system (so combos are more complex and ironically less escapable)Asshats on motorcyclesStrong female characters (if you're into that)Sexually suggestive clothing (if you're into that)A whopping eight people to play online withController supportA boat made entirely out of bloodYou may have heard there is glorious anime cleavage in this game
 You have not been misinformed
 Just go ahead and buy it now if that's what you're here for
 I'll be here, making disapproving faces at my computer and pretending you can see me
I've been told Skullgirls is one of the most technical fighting games to exist
 A goodly few of the mechanics were designed in part by fighter champion Mike "Mike Z" Zaimont
 As a salty casual who can't beat the tutorial but still makes a ham-fisted attempt at playing anyway, I know I've only scratched the surface of what can be done with this game (a process akin to scratching the surface of the moon)
 I've seen videos of high-level play, and it is astonishing
 So if you're somebody who can decipher the phrase "qc
P+P -> a
HK -> dp" you'll find a lot to love here
 If you can't, that's no reason not to buy this game
 The combat is fun and engaging even if you can't explain to your friends what's happening in absurdly small acronyms
Skullgirls has 13 playable characters, each with their own engrossing story modes and unique playstyles (up from 9 in the wake of a devastatingly successful Indiegogo campaign)
 At least 2 more characters are still on the way
 If you grab them fresh out of the oven, they're free, too
 But don't burn your hand
 Then you won't be able to play Skullgirls, and that would be unfortunate

Review For Skullgirls PC Review by : Joell Joelly & Meguca 2
0Pros : - Great animations- Incredible artstyle- Lovely music- Very good value for the money- Mechanically impressiveCons : - Weak keyboard controls (Gamepad recommended)- Multiplayer is unforgiving for newcomers- Really hard to masterReview :Skullgirls is a game full of things to love, which can all be appreciated on their own, which all come together to make a unique experience
 First, the visuals: Skullgirls is easily one of the most visually impressive games you'll ever play
 Every single animation is drawn in incredible detail, everything looking extremely smooth and natural
 It is worth playing almost for the visuals alone
Next, the controls: Keyboard controls are done well, but a controller is highly recommended for anyone who wants to fully explore this game, and the abundant movelists, combos, and other features
 The tutorials are also far better suited for preparing a player using a controller, rather than a keyboard
If you're a veteran at fighting games, you'll be pleased at how 'technically' impressive Skullgirls is, allowing for a ton of ways to chain attacks, get massive combos and feel in control
 Players who are newer to fighters don't have to worry, there is a tutorial covering a massive amount of game mechanics, and the movelists are easy to understand
 As always with fighter games, it can be quite relentless to try and get to high skill levels and pull off every move and mechanic with ease, it does take a lot of practice
For casual players and veterans alike, there's a ton to enjoy
 Story mode covers a pretty cool plot, each character's story really helps to flesh them out and make them feel a bit more alive
 You fight your way through a series of matches, a few adding a bit to the story through pre-fight dialog, until you reach a pretty challening final boss where you conclude that character's story
 There is a variety of difficulty options available, making it accessible to both beginner and hardcore players
The character roster is relatively limited, with 8 Fighters being available in the base game, and 4 added DLC fighters (and a Hidden one) available through DLC
 It is worth mentioning that if you own the base game upon a DLC's release, it is available for free for a significantly long time
 Otherwise, you have to buy the DLCs separately
 This can be quite a turn-off for some players, but given the depth of each character it is more than enough to get a ton of enjoyment out of Skullgirls
Gameplay wise, every character has a variety of moves
 There are light, medium and heavy punches and kicks (varying in range, damage, speed, etc on each character) as well as specials, crouched attacks, jumping attacks, and all the other things common to all fighters
 Every character has varying difficulties, making them better or worse for less skilled players
 A newcomer can likely buttonmash their way through a few PVP matches or the story mode, but on higher difficulties or vs someone who is skilled at fighters will be a brick wall to that strategy
 For many players, the multiplayer is the most important part
 From a technical standpoint, the multiplayer was done well and can provide a lag-free environment to anyone who wants to get into it
 The community isn't HUGE, but there's always players to face, but as a word of warning, most players you encounter online are very skilled
 It can be near impossible to get into as a newcomer to fighters or to Skullgirls
 For this reason I do recommend playing this game locally if possible
In conclusion :Every moment is enjoyable with the beautiful animation and artstyle, there's a challenge to be found if you're looking for one, and there's a casual, enjoyable experience for those who just want to appreciate the art, voice acting and story
And for those reaons I'm giving this game a recommendation

Everything about Skullgirls is perfect
 The devs clearly spent a lot of time crafting this game to be as polished as humanly possible, and it shows
 The art is gorgeous, the soundtrack is amazing, and most importantly, the game is fun
 This is the most balanced fighting game I've ever played, and the fact that every character is viable in some way means that there's plently of variety when it comes to teams
 The game also goes out of it's way to teach newcomers, with insanely in-depth tutorial and training modes
 Whether you're a fighting game veteran or looking for your first pick, Skullgirls is a fantastic game to add to your repertoire
Posted: 23 April, 2014
It's a very solid fighting game, it's not 3rd strike or Tekken 3 or another fighting game with 3 in title but it's good nonetheless, and here's why
Character roster is not robust but it still covers a variety of playstyles, all rounders, zoners, grapplers and speed characters
 To put it shortly, despite the lack in numbers every character feels different from one another
This game has best tutorial I've ever seen in a fighting game
 It doesn't just show you which buttons do what, this tutorial will explain you every little thing about how this game works and how each character plays and when you're done, there's still a lot of space for creativity and improvement
Story mode is
 fine
 I'm honestly not a big fan of it, story itself is quite predictable and largely based on one or two standard tropes that many fighting games use
 Final boss felt a bit disappointing for me but it's kind of a hit or miss situation
 Some will like that there's a special character that is very different from anyone else in a very fundamental way but I personally prefer when at the end you face just a character from the roster like everyone else you've been fighting before
 Also at the time I was beating the game it seemed like the only way to beat the boss on higher difficulties was to just cheese her out and that's not really fun in my opinion but it was some time ago and by now people probably got much better at the game and found out other, more interesting ways to beat the boss
Multiplayer
 I wish I could say something about it but I only managed to play it once with some guy from Australia (and I live on the edge between Europe and Asia) with both of us having ping over 150 or something like that
 not exactly enjoyable expirience (though i have to say lag compensation was rather nice even in that dire situation) but it was the only expirience avaliable at the time
 I recommend you check out something like steam charts if you buy this game for multiplayer, and check if you have some sort of community for this game in your area
 Visuals and sound are very good
 Background music is not distracting and yet very charming, reminds me of something Yoko Kanno would've composed but it still sound quite unique and recognisable
 Animation and art is beautiful and smooth, yeah there are boobs and butts but they offend as much as Switzerland
 There are plently of stages and all of them look amazing
 Game looks and sounds very good, period
And to finish it off, gameplay and controls
 They are both very, very solid
 I use a fight stick and it works like a charm, as it should,
obviously
 Keyboard is also fine though, it's much harder for me to play on keyboard, but I don't see why you wouldn't be able to get good results with it after some practice, though I have to say fight stick is real sweet
 Game mechanics are way beyond what you would expect from an indie dev, gameplay feels very polished and refined, every time I lost I knew that it was my fault and what that fault was and that's a big deal in any game
 So yeah, this game is good, I liked it, pros overwhelm cons and I wish this game sells even better so there would be more people to play with

Every now and then, a game comes along that truly deserves to be called capital-g Great
 I dont mean a game thats merely fun, or entertaining, or even aesthetically beautiful  all great things, but no single aspect of which would nudge a title beyond the level of good
 Im talking about a game that manages to mix a creative, imaginative world filled with original, memorable characters, equipped with polished gameplay, and to pull it all off with an expert craftsmans level of skill and attention to detail  including literally thousands of frames of character animation
 Skullgirls is a traditional close-combat fighting game that manages to bring all of this to the table
 If you are a fan of 2D fighting games who has yet to add Skullgirls to your library, you owe it to yourself to rectify this situation as soon as possible
 It would be a deal at twice the price
Now, Ive enjoyed fighting games since the days of King of Fighters and Street Fighter II  but outside of casually decking friends in Soul Calibur, the fact is Ive never been particularly enamored with the genre for the gameplays sake, or even very good at the games
 Whats always drawn me in, believe it or not, is the story and the personalities
 Sure, the actual plots are typically paper-thin, cotton candy fluff  the Heihachi familys internal squabbles in Tekken, the Orochi power in King of Fighters its all silly stuff even (perhaps especially) when it tries to be serious, and it mostly serves as a backdrop to create fun, creative characters and personalities
 The setting of Skullgirls stands out even alongside the crazier, Guilty Gear variety of bizarre worlds, setting itself in the fictional Canopy Kingdom  a cartoony environment most reminiscent of the art deco designed 1940s, dominated by crime, strange creatures, and hybrids of technology and magic
 Even before you get to the actual character storylines in Skullgirls, the visuals it presents you with  a mix of black, gold, neon and film reel decorations  is enough to make it incredibly distinct, as if someone took the setting of the original Bioshock and decided to make it all ten times more cartoony, and about a quarter as serious
As for the plot itself, Skullgirls provides a situation reminiscent of most fighting game contexts: every seven years, a living artifact known as the Skull Heart offers to grant the wish of one woman
 But if the wisher has an impure soul, shell instead be transformed into a powerful, monstrous Skullgirl  leading her to terrorize and wreak havoc over the world
 A young girl named Marie has made her wish and apparently been found unworthy, leading various characters to set their sights on her, each with their own motives  some seeking to simply bring her assault to an end, while others are after the power of the Skull Heart for themselves
Posted: 24 October, 2014
I've been beaten senselessly by half the characters on normal or higher
The boss has wiped the floor with me more times than I can count
I can barely pull off 15 hit combos while the AI can seamlessly pull off 30-hit comboes ending in a Blockbuster every other attack
And yet I still keep coming back to this game
Why, you ask
Simply because it's the greatest fighter game I've ever played
You will find yourself playing this game over and over with its easy to learn, difficult to master playstyle, with anything from a ridiculously easy Sleepwalk mode for the starters to a downright nasty Nightmare mode for those who know what they're doing and do it well
You will fall in love with the playstyles of each and every one of these characters, from Filia, the girl with a fanged monster for hair, to Peacock, the living cartoon character, to Ms
 Fortune, the zombie catgirl who can decapitate herself at will, and everyone in between
You will find yourself in awe at the amazing background scenery and music of every last stage, from Maplecrest's calming "The Lives We Left Behind" to the techno beats of Lab 8's "Paved With Good Intentions" to the rocking jazz of Under the Bridge's "Unfinished Business"
You will laugh at every single one of these characters' lines, from Big Band's constant musical references, to Ms
 Fortune's terrible as crud puns, to Valentine's dark nurse humor, and all of the others as well
And once this is all said and done, you'll agree with me when I say - this is the best 2D fighter that there ever was
 and, believe it or not, with two more DLC characters planned for release soon, the ride is only just beginning

Probably best looking 2d fighter i have played, everything is hand drawn and looks really good
The gameplay is a bit like marvel vs capcom series, but still different
It also have the best tutorial i have seen in a fighting game, it teach you every little aspect of the game, great for beginners
 If you are new to fighting games, this is a good fighter to start with
Posted: 26 November, 2013
Good:+ plays like Mahvel, but doesn't at the same time+ ratio teams and custom assists are ballin'+ neato tutorial for scrubs+ fancy graphics and coolio music+ wow ggpo netplayLame:- reset-heavy gameplay might ruin your Christmas- combo video with every hitConclusion: Don't get SFxT-----Speaking more seriously, SG is a good game
 If you like fighting games or are simply interested in them, consider SG

Giving fairly racist items to the appropriate race is "sexy"
Asking for a person's cup size makes them attracted to you

Oranges cost $600
Being asked "What the hell are you playing

CLANNAD is one of the most well-regarded visual novels in the world, boasting an epic 80-120 hours of content; about twice the size of the Lord of the Rings trilogy
 It starts off at a very slow pace with lots of light-hearted comedy, but once you begin getting involved with each of the characters' individual conflicts, the story ramps up into some gripping emotional storytelling, sometimes sprinkled with a tinge of supernatural intrigue
 The character routes are very worthwhile in their own right, but the true value of CLANNAD is to be found in its final route: After Story
 It doesn't matter how emotionally hardened you think you are; After Story will hit you like a sledgehammer with its relentless emotional impact, and you won't come out unscathed
So, yeah, CLANNAD is kinda cool

Posted: 29 May
When I first looked at this game, I thought "Typical anime high school girl nonsense"
 How wrong I was
 What I found was far and away the most engaging and heartfelt story I have ever experienced
 I absolutely love Clannad and cannot recommend it highly enough
Clannad is a visual novel originally released in Japan in 2004
 Voices were added in a 2008 rerelease
 In 2015 it was given an official English release
 It is regarded by the visual novel community as a paragon of the genre and one of the greatest ever
Clannad has several different plotlines which can be read in almost any order
 These plotlines are mostly love stories
 The content and quality of these are what make Clannad a legend
 Rather than pander to sexual fantasies, Clannad's stories aim straight at the reader's heart
 Some of these hit really close to home for me
 At multiple points, I had to stop reading for a few minutes to collect myself before I could continue
 Some were so good that I had to go back and reread them again just a couple of days later
If you complete Clannad, you will cry at least once
 Accept this going in
 If someone tells you they completed it without crying, they're a liar
If you're still on the fence, then consider that I was once in your position
 I was unsure of if I should even give this game a shot
 I took the chance based on word of mouth
 Now here I am gushing over it
 One of the best works of fiction I have ever experienced

Simply put, if you aren't in tears after playing this visual novel,
you're not human
Clannad is the best visual novel of all time, a roller-coaster ride of emotions that will change your life
The popular question of, "Is it really worth $50
"
Yes, in fact, it is worth infinitely more
 You can't monetize a life changing experience, and playing through Clannad will provide exactly that
Posted: 23 November, 2015
Finally, the wait is over
 After a year of anticipation and throwing almost all my money at the Kickstarter campaign, our beloved Clannad is here
 All you VN lovers should already know that Clannad is a universally-acclaimed masterpiece
 But for those who don't know much (or anything) about it, know this: it's one hell of a rollercoaster ride
 Clannad will have you laughing, crying, happy, angry, and a whole slew of other emotions
 In fact, Clannad (both the anime series and the VN) is the only story that has truly made me empathize with the characters and relate to it in my own life
 I dare say it to be a life-changing experience if you open your heart
While Clannad is almost always described as a romance game, there is so much more than that
 While there is a lot of romantic material, Clannad offers an endless ocean of life lessons around family, friends, overcoming hardship, making excruciating decisions, dealing with change, and much more
 Clannad really made me take a deep look into my own life and helped me overcome many personal barriers relating to my own family and friends
 It has positively influenced my outlook in many areas of my life and I will forever be grateful for it
Even if you don't think you would enjoy it much, do yourself a favor and pick it up
 And if you already previously played it, buy it on Steam
 Compared to the original Full Voice version, it has so many new enhancements that warrant playing it again (as if the story alone wasn't enough
)
 The HD assets, Steam achievements, and Dangopedia are all big bonuses to me
 The only things missing are trading cards and emoticons
And lastly, join the Clannad steam group for all your Clannad needs
 We're active and very friendly and love discussing all things Clannad (as well as other games, anime, etc
)
 You could say we're Steam's very own Big Dango Family
 Also, if you ever want to talk about Clannad, feel free to friend/message me

Great game, very high quality and the most important part - fluffy eared girls
+Visuals - beautiful animated
 girls, plenty of various dresses and my favorite type of eye coloring <3
+Soundwork: Amazing OST, everyone fully voiced
 great seiyuu work and other sounds are nice too
+Gameplay: This novel is huge, seriously multiple routes for 4 different girls, each long AF
 But all the current game problems are hidden here:1-No language except Chinese or Japanese
 (well it's been said that English translation is coming as soon as possible), you can try to use an atlas or some kind of that
2-No Rx content at all (Srsly this game is full of ecchi scenes, but all of them cut, and there is no available patch yet, which could be paid addition :\ )+Cool steam cards
-No steam achievements - yet

How much is a smile worth
LiEat is a non-linear title with mild horror themes
 It's a "story-based" game, which is to say, the "game" aspect is merely a vehicle for literally everything else
 It's technically a Japanese-style RPG, but the battles are a mere formality; combat rarely amounts to more than holding down the Confirm key until they end, with very little strategy except in rare situations, and even those can be circumvented entirely if you're of the mind and find the right items
 I'm normally averse to these sorts of titles, a firm believer that a game that doesn't focus at least in part on its gameplay is a waste of a game, but LiEat appropriately made a liar out of me, and my annoyance with that fact is matched only by my gladness at being wrong
I didn't quite know what to expect when getting into this one, but I can say that whatever I could have guessed it was would've been wrong with room to spare; LiEat is surreal, strange, sometimes creepy, sometimes silly, yet consistently, if I have to admit it, charming
 Developer Miwashiba uses each "game" to tell a tale of the ongoing travels of a humanoid dragon child who subsists off of the lies of the others, and her cynical, conniving, big fat liar of a caretaker, as they travel the land in search of the world's most valuable commodity: information
 Our liar's muddy morality and views on the world are intriguing, and his foil is one of the most legitimately delightful child characters in any work of fiction I've encountered; rather than being smarter or tougher than you could legitimately expect her to be, she's reactive, naive, and even a little dense, yet without being grating, and while she's hyper-idealized, I'm willing to bet you're not going to care
 I swear that if I didn't know my own kid wouldn't be the most insufferable thing ever just to spite me, I'd want one just for the off chance it turned out something like her
This is all conveyed well by translator and localizer vgperson's mostly enjoyable interpretation of the games' quirky dialogue, the writing of which is consistently engaging and thematic
 Like its plot, the original score is unusual, yet enjoyable, the setting is foreboding, yet inviting, the characters are mysterious and enigmatic -- save for one mentioned above
--
and the plot isn't fully explained
 Rather than fall prey to being confusing as a result, though, the whole thing ends up interesting, and every interaction teaches you more about LiEat's strange world and its inhabitants, which is impressive given that each of the three extremely short games take place in one area each
 There's little exploration, no adventuring, and no questing; you're presented with a self-contained mystery to solve, and the game is over as soon as the case is closed
 Each game features at least one bad ending, and one "real" ending, and after the latter, you either move onto the next game after a visit to a gallery room, or run out of games
The result is probably unlike anything you've come across, even among the independent scene
 There's no soapbox for it to climb upon, no deep, hidden meaning for people to form a cult around and talk down to others over, no quirky fetishes to pander to, and no nerd culture to propagate; it's just a story of two people and the people they run into, but it was enough to get a couple legitimate laughs out joy out of this grouchy old fart, and again, this isn't even my kind of game
So how much is a smile worth
 Turns out the best ones are free, but three dollars was a fair price, too
I'd be lying if I said I didn't think that if you've read this far, you'll agree

Three short, qaint little rpg vignettes
 It's got some unique art, and for what it is, this is interesting in its own right
 That's not to say that its mindblowing or anything
 Gameplay wise, its standard
 The narrative in general reminds me a lot of Saturday morning cartoons; but this time with more of a gothic victorian asthetic
 The creator clearly had a vision in mind for these characters, which is more than I can say for a lot of games I've played
The concept of litterally eating the physical manifestation of lies is a novel one
 I'd say it could be developed a bit more, but after playing all three episodes it looks like the creator wanted some closure on the story
 Fair enough
 Would I reccomend this game, sure
 But just be aware of what you're getting into
 Of the three episodes, I had most trouble with the last one, as it was the most trigger heavy; meaning things needed to be done in a specific order
 But with that said, this game has personality
 Functionally, it may be basic, but at least it tries to set itself apart from the mound of other rpg maker games out there
 And I think that alone warrants some kudos

The best $3
29 (CDN) I ever spent
 Seriously, LiEat is one hell of a bargain
Basically you're a wandering vagabond with a loli dragon girl who can eats lies
 Using this power they solve mysteries and find out more about themselves along the way
 Game is seperated into 3 short parts or "chapters" and can take a good 8-10 hours if you interact with everything and aim for most of the achivements
Pros+ Fast, smooth, responsive gameplay & controls+ Music & Ambiance really fits and sets the mood (Bonus: Soundtrack included in Steam>Library>Music)+ Well crafted story and lore+ The pixels, CGs, cutscenes & character portraits all fit together well and create a unique and charming style+ Lots of hidden dialogue and stuff to interact with + achievementsCons- Combat can be a little repetitive at times- The hidden Legendary weapons are super OPOverall, I'd definitely recommend LiEat, it's short, unique, charming and sweet

id=667351001NOTE: With my reviews, I tend to do the pros/cons thing, because it's simple and straight to the point rather than paragraphs which someone might not have the time to read
Posted: 29 August, 2016
I feel like most reviews don't actually focus on balancing this game's ups and downs properly, both the positive and the negative ones
 The positive ones overvalue what people perceive as "cute" while the negative ones bash the game too much
 There are a few reviews that make a justified description or review of the game
 Obviously I'm not doing any side a favor with this
 I'll explain why I can't recommend this game after stating a few facts about it
 Keep in mind I'll be taking in consideration the price of the game and what the game offers for that value
The TLDR pros/cons version:PROS- Cutscenes and Artworks for some in game events
- Movement is fluid
- The overall style is cute
- Small optional interactions you can do in the game to make yourself feel more involved with the story (such as poking Leo when he sleeps because why not)
- Multiple endings
CONS- Lack of consequence if you do certain mistakes;- The lack of actual places to explore per chapter makes the game feel repetitive and boring on the long run
- No combat depth despite being advertised as a JRPG
 Additionally, if you grind some levels you can actually become immune to damage, including boss damage
- Despite being advertised as "A fantastic JRPG focused on storytelling
" the storyline is very short and doesn't hold up to that statement
 The story is appropriate for the price of the game
 Don't get your hopes up
- Some in-game designs for characters are poorly made (especially the artwork of characters on the right of the dialogue)
- The in-game money you acquire is useless
For those interested in more details, I'll start off with the pros:1
 I didn't expect any type of cutscenes at all
 I thought it's just some trailer animation
 It was a nice surprise
 It makes it easier to imagine what's depicted or how the characters actually look in an RPG viewed from the top
2
 For this price I had some feelings that movement speed or the FPS cap would be an issue
 Good thing I was wrong
 The movement is fluid and fast enough for the size of each map
3
 While it doesn't captivate me as much as others, the style is chibi-oriented and cute
4
 The small and sometimes meaningless optional interactions you can do does make it, at least for me, a better way of appreciating the game, rather than not having them at all
5
 It's great to have multiple endings to slightly personalize the story depending on some actions you do
 Some might argue that a linear great ending would be better rather than branching out
Now for the cons:1
 The moment I saw Lies that you can battle I immediately thought of "hey, this looks like a nice detective game
 Maybe if I pick the wrong choice, it's gonna affect the case or make me redo it
or at least lose a certain amount of HP"
 Sadly it doesn't expand on it and there's no consequence with failing to find the lie(s) (unless you count the fact that you waste some time on some battles)2
 Being used to JRPGs, I expected more zones than what it has
 There really isn't too much to explore
 But for the game's price I can't really complain that much
3
 If a game has "JRPG" or even "RPG" as its genre, I expect some combat depth and some grinding
 Sadly the only part where I had to "think" was in the first chapter where I used an AoE attack to get rid of a line of mobs
 Overall, you can just keep mashing the Attack option and still win
 And if you reach a certain level with your characters you become immune to damage
4
 The storyline is okay for the price attached
 I really wish there were more scenes and more character development because I wanted to get to know some characters more than the game allows me to
 I spent some time in RPG Maker
 Adding text is not that hard (And yes, I do imply this game was made in RPG Maker or something similar)
 But like I said before, for the price I paid, it's not a big issue
5
 There's a lot of pixelation done with the characters in the artwork shown on the right of the dialogue, such as Leo looking way too low quality compared to others and not too appealing to the eye
 Maybe that's just me, I don't know
Why do I not recommend this game
 Because it could have been something awesome like "To the Moon" or "Ib" with enough hardwork and patience
 I would buy the game at a 5-10 euro price tag if the game was focused on the following:- More places to explore- More optional dialogue and interactions with the characters- Expand the combat by adding some strategy to it- Most importantly: Make it a detective JRPG game where I interrogate people and find the truth about the case
This game had the potential to be a JRPG focused on finding the culprit and solving mysteries
 Not to the lengths of "Danganronpa" or "Ace Attorney" series, but at least give more player input and consequences related to uncovering who done what they did
 It has a dragon loli who can detect lies, for crying out loud
I'm not gonna go into details on how this could be made as everybody has their own ideas of how to improve the game
 However, I really wanted some negative effects if I'm doing something wrong with finding lies, make me find who the culprit it according to clues and then give me the option to accuse someone
 Heck, maybe use in-game money you acquire to buy hints
Conclusion:The artwork is okay, the BGM is okay, the story is okay, overall this game is average
 And that's the problem
 I really wanted to recommend this game but I can't
 And it's not because of the value of the game, it is for what is worth
 It's because it could have been something awesome and unforgettable giving the right time, patience, hardwork, and price
 Yes, I'm not recommending this game only because it wasn't polished to its fullest potential
 I wanted this game to be awesome (with an appropriate price for its greatness), but the dev team decided to stop and deliver an okay game for its current price
 I am aware that the reason for not recommending it isn't truly justifiable
 From an objective standpoint I'd recommend this game
 But this is a review with my own personal opinion
 Thus, a subjective point of view is more appropriate
A message to all reviewers who keep saying stuff like "omg that girl is so cute and you should buy the game because of that
": You are overvaluing the "cute" aspect of the game way too much
 Is it really that big of a thing for a dragon loli that discovers life to be this game's selling point
 Or the artstyle
 Because I don't think so
 Maybe that's just me
 Who knows
A message to all reviewers who say this game is "horrible" or bash certain aspects of the game in an exaggerated manner: don't forget you spent 2 to 3 euros/dollars on it
 For that value, don't expect too much out of it
 It's not gonna be Final Fantasy
 As mentioned above, the game is neither good or bad
 It's average
 If you're that disappointed, just sell the Trading Cards you get from it and compensate some of the money you spent
 If you're lucky enough to get a Foil type of Trading Card, you can sell that for at least the amount of money you spent on the game
Posted: 20 June, 2016
I bought this game because my friend had recently, and he said it was good
 3 dollars was a low price, so I bought it, and didn't expect it to be a good game because of the price
 It then sat there for several months, until today, June 20th, 2016, I downloaded it and played it
 It was unbelieveably good
 It was not what I was expecting at all, I expected a semi-long JRPG with flashy anime characters
 What I got was a short, amazing filled story that I immediately fell in love with
 The gameplay might be a little bit on the underdeveloped side, but the story beats the hell out of that
 I would go into detail explaining the two amazingly crafted main characters, but I don't want to spoil this experience for you
 Pick this game up for yourself and give it a play, you won't regret your decision
 it only took me about 4 hours to 100% percent it, but it is one of my favorite Steam games I've ever played
Posted: 27 February, 2016
Don't let the "Loli" Steam banner fool you
 This isn't a JRPG that panders to the Loli-crowd
 Instead, I'll hazard to say that LiEat (I, II, and III) doesn't pander at all
 Instead, the developer focused on bringing us a solid and well written story
 The story itself isn't anything amazing, and often, the mysteries solve themselves in the first act
 However, what really kept it interesting were the characters
 The characters are endearing, mysterious, and funny
The game includes 3 Chapters
 Each has multiple endings
 The first two chapters each took me about 1
5 hours, and the last one stumped me for a bit when I couldn't get the Good Ending
The BGM are great and sets the mood as well
 I highly recommend this to anyone looking to play a short game with memorable characters
 Just don't expect this game to last you any more than 5 hours tops
EDIT: Also, any achievement that includes Ranma 1/2 is gold in my book: Happosai~
Posted: 24 May, 2016
LiEat is comprised of 3 short JRPGs
 Each story is extremely well written
 Dialog between characters is clever and interesting
 I lost count of how many times I laughed outloud
 I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoil a thing
 If you can look past the fact you'll have to play within a little windowed box and with graphics a bit blurry, you can find plenty else to love
 Even with the graphics the way they are, there is a lot of charm in them
 My ending remark will be - if another LieEat comes to Steam, I'm buying it in a heartbeat
P
S
 I'm adding to the review for the steam awards badge
 Let me just say, the creators of LiEat just came out with Alicemare and I DID buy it in a heartbeat
 :D

After beating this game and each of his 3 chapters, I can say that this is the most splendid and beautiful game I have played in a long while
It sent me back to the era when I used to download and play RPG maker games like Misao, Ao oni or Mad Father
The art style is beautiful, the soundtrack is perfect and the story is just magnificent
This game is so good that I wish that one day everyone will be able to play a sequel, I know this game is great and that a lot of people would play it
Okay
 now to the serious stuff; the game itself is about 5 hours long, or 6 if you want to get every achievement
The game has a simple fighting system that but it's really entertaining, there might not be many enemies to fight beside lies and some bosses, but the fighting system it's not that important, what's important here is the wonderful and gorgeous story, the story is very interesting and sometimes it hits you hard in the feels
If I had to rate this game it would be a solid 10/10Pros: The art style is amazing
  The fighting system is very basic but entertaining
 Soundtrack is very relaxing and totally well made The price is perfect, basically, 1$ for each 3 of the games
 The animations are short but really great
 The puzzles are really good even if there's about one per game
 The characters are pretty interesting and beautiful
 The game is pretty light, you can install it in about 5 to 10 minutes and you will be rewarded with 5-6 hours of gameplay
 The facial expressions are very cute and well made
 Very funny achievements with great references
 CuteSpoilers Ahead, you have been warned: These spoilers will be about the game's endings so I really warn you, the endings are so beautiful that if you haven't beaten the game yet you should definitely not read the cons, I am just trying to say that the endings are way too good and you should not get spoiled, go discover it yourself, its really worth it
Cons: I don't think this is a con but rather more of a wish;The game leaves you a massive cliffhanger on the good ending, by now the bad ending already shows us that Leo is taken by the lies and becomes evil, Efina still follows him and promises him that one day she will become powerful enough to eat his lies
The neutral ending wich is even sadder than the bad one ends up with Efina being way too weak (Under or at level 11) to eat Leo's lies, thus having to use all of her power to protect him thus making her perish but saving the life of Leo, wich made her happy
The good ending is just heartwarming, Efina is strong enough ( level 12 or higher ) to eat all of Leo's lies and Leo is capable of talking to Cyril to confess that everything he did was to protect them
 Cyril proceeds to leave with his brothers ( Not counting Leo ) and takes off via helicopter thus leaving Leopold and Efina in the rooftop, they both move on together to the next adventure
Final Note:This game is amazing and worth every single penny, I give it a solid 10/10 coming very very deep from my heart
Even if the game's ending is a massive cliffhanger that probably left some people in despair for a sequel, I guess it's not a bad idea to wait and have some patience, personally, I wish that this game gets a sequel anytime soon

Lieat is a very good story
 Isn't much of a game
 I recomend it
Short story long, Lieat is a peice by peice story that entales the "Current off the past" Story of a Con man who cares for a young girl
 THe what and the why is for you to find out, as this game lives and, dare I say, dies by it's story
 This is not a game, it is a story with game elements
 A cut ahead of visual novels but a cut behind an RPG horror game
 I think it wears its place well
The game has a nice style
 Everything is original to the game, and it's all well done for it's miniscual scale
 It has it's own artwork for each character, and even some small animated scenes
 The music sets the stage alright enough, and is something I like to listen to casually
 I'd like to empisise miniscual though
 This game is a very small game, easily completed in 2 hours for a first run for a normal player
 The game is made even smaller by being cut up into 3 peices, each a labled "game" You'll pick from once you start up the game
 Each one is self contained, but they all add up into a complete plot of the main characters
 I like how it was handled, too
 It gives it a sense of progression within each of the chapters without having to ellate farther down the road
 Ultimately, this game a bit sized story broken up into bite sized senarios
 It's handled well through and through, but do not expect a ton from it
Posted: 29 February, 2016
LiEat was without a doubt one of the few games I have bought which did not disappoint me, LiEat is an RPG / Pixelated indie game which is based around a girl who can eat lies travelling with her a man whom she calls "papa"This game does have its secret little quirks and the crazy little fun things you do and the achievements you get from them
 There is no voice acting and the resolution of the game is pretty small which is a little difficult at first, the characters you meet and find will captivate you and the conversations they have always leave you wanting to know more of "why" "how" and "what"
 The combat system is really easy and simple so you don't need much experience or any experience as a matter of fact
 I've never enjoyed a game like this in such a long time and its great to break off from the ultra violent toxic fps shooting games and just have a relaxing and cute playthrough a game like this
Considering its only £1
99 , you should get it, this game has already made me laugh, intrigued and fascinated by the story and all the things to discover, I may also be in love with this game
Nominate this game for the villain in most need for a hug, i mean
 come on
 the villain does need one

It's like Nekopara Vol
 1, except you've got more catgirls and less money in your wallet and the dirty sock pile is starting become a mountain by the washing machine and your parents are wondering what you're still doing living at home when you're 26 and the only valuable item you own is a Chun-Li figurine and a bodypillow and your whole life has been a miserable walk of shame being bullied through childhood and never finding your place in the world until you've come to the realization that the only way out might be to commit suicide and leave all the pain on the weight of friends and family who you never bothered to reach out to nor took the time the understand what you meant to them
And then you experience this and all the worries in the world become silent

(Acutal Review BELOW)Showed my parent some gameplay
Dad is proud of me
 Mom is not letting me come closer to my little sisters and the cats anymore
10/10 - would make dad proud again
UPDATE: My dad increased my allowance after i patched the game
11/10 - would make mom love me again
Edit: Since most of you want an actual review, I'll give you one
 I'm not a professional reviewer or anything, just a simple closet weeb :^)Nekopara is a VN that sets apart other VN on steam, due to it's animation mostly
 To me, Nekopara is a nukige because the plots are pretty decent, but the H-scene are what we are here for
 So lets break it down part by part
CG/Graphic - This is what makes this game a bit different than other VNs
 You don't see many VNs that animates the sprites during conversation, let you pet them and make their "coconuts" bounce
 I also love the E-MOTES system in Nekopara
 The backgrounds and the colours are really lively and heartwarming in a way
 So it's a plus in my book
Plot - If you like the plot from Nekopara Vol
 1, you should be fine with this plot but it's a bit shorter
 One thing I find lacking in Nekopara are the plot
 I understand making a harem + ecchi plot can be difficult because there's a ALOT of VNs out there have the same genre with the same-kind plot
 My kind of plot that is to my likings are the Clannad, Grisaia type of plot etc, where they have proper routes and different ending
 I think Nekopara is the nukige kind of plot c: 
 Anyway, I'm pretty sure you guys bought it for the "plot" am I right
Voice/Music - I'm the type of person who will go on youtube and search "Anime OST that will make you cry" while reading his manga
 Yes, I think OST/background songs plays an important role to VNs
 This is because the purpose for OST is to make the VNs to be alive, make you want to be part of the story
 And Nekopara OST are pretty good
 Not gonna lie, I like some of the OST from this game
 The voice actor are all great and lovely, if you play Imouto Paradise or any loli VNs, you should be okay with some of the high pitch voice (Some of my friends don't like high pitch loli voice lol)H-Scene - All scenes are fap-licious c: You got to thanks Neko Works for making this game and releasing the patch straight after the game launchs
 Animated H-Scene are my kind of game, like Ultimate Boobs War
 I know some of you will get the patch without paying, but if possible do continue to SUPPORT the content creator <3Overall -
I have no complains for this game
 Just another VNs added to my collection
 I enjoy the VNs especially the H-Scene :^)

The devs would have you believe you play this game by buying it and launching it and clicking your way through a cute and sometimes racey story about a guy who can't get a bunch of cat-human hybrid girls to leave him alone
 Here's the real way to play:STEP 1: Buy the game
 STEP 2: Download and install the 18+ patch from somewhere reliable
STEP 3: If you live with your parents, lock your bedroom door
STEP 4: Get a big wad of toilet paper or a box of kleenex
 You'll need more than you think
STEP 5: Boot up the game, speed through it but read just enough story to know what's happening when you eventually reach the H-Scenes
STEP 6: Beat the Bishop, Polish your Mustang, Manage the Glue Factory, etc
STEP 7: Sit there like the pathetic waste of matter that you are, droplets of baby batter running down your stomach
STEP 8: Regret everything, put in a refund request for the game
STEP 9: Try to rekindle a relationship with a past love interest IRL and fail miserablySTEP 10: Out of frustration, flirt with multiple girls who remind you of the original one
 STEP 11: Ruin your reputation with any and all females you were friends with
STEP 12: Go home and feel bad for yourself
STEP 13: Go on Steam and see Nekopara on the front page
STEP 14: Repeat from Step 1

Nekopara is the story of a dude that runs away to open up a cake shop using his rich parents' money
 Two "catgirls" sneak their way into the luggage and surprise their owner in a "we're too far from home so you can't get rid of us" way
In the first part, you take advantage of legalized slavery to get Chocola and Vanilla to dress up as cute maids, which brings a lot of creeps and virgins customers to the shop
 It's pretty obvious that you wouldn't have any customers without them, yet you find the MC constantly complaining about them

Pros:- cute graphics- quite positive atmosphere- tutorial is super short and clear- loot system (finding the same item multiple times upgrades it)Cons:- Several minutes into the game and everything will be clear about the AI- Gets repetitive fast- Not immersive- Lack of settings (audio, difficulty, controls, etc
)- If you do side quests then the main quest might appear way too easyThis game is like a popcorn movie, can be 100% finished in a single evening
Posted: 8 August
From playing it for about 4-5 hours, I've found it to be fun
 The combat is smooth and easy to learn and get used to; while allowing skill in movement, timing, and attacks to actually play a large role in single-target fights, large-group fights, and even bosses
 The story, of which I've gotten a little under halfway done, is great (though I get heavily distracted with side quests, which are pawsome
)
 And you're actually encouraged to complete side quests in order to level-up for the main storyline
 The dungeons are relatively short between the level 1-35 range that I've entered and conquered
 The dungeons do respawn with enemies and coins/xp pickups, though the chests do not; helps with the level grinding
All-in-all, from a first look the game is great

You can just chill playing this game, so relaxing but at the same time has a bit tension (3
5 out of 10 difficulty)
Full of cats, funny conversation, classic artstyle, smooth controller, fine music, your typical indie game
So far didn't find any glitches in the gameplay, achievements bug has been fixed
Cat Quest is a really really enjoyable game both for kids and adults
I suggest to buy this game when on sale because the story is very short and not worth full price at all
Anyway cat lovers, let's do some Catventure

Review subject to change
So far Cat Quest is a very cute (oops
 don't call them cute
 lol), fun and relaxing game with excellent realtime combat and controller support
I am not that far into the game, but I wanted to write something so people know that this is a fun and well thought out game
I am playing with keyboard and mouse and will try my PS4 wireless controller as soon as it charges
 The gameplay is really fun
If using keyboard and mouse, you melee attack with the left mouse button and can use number keys or the right mouse button to cast spells
 You use WASD to move and you can roll using the spacebar
Combat is really fun and I have no complaints in this department
It feels like playing Diablo 3 using the keyboard & mouse
 Great writing with a purrrfectly catastic story and great one-liner's
It has made me laugh out load a few times
PROS+Great melee combat with dodge & spell casting+Can completely heal and save your game is towns+There are different schools of magic to learn+Huge game world with lots of dungeons to explore+Very cute (oops) graphics and good animations+Wonderful sound track and great sounds (meow
)+Polished game with fun references to kittens & cats+Well written dialog and fun storyline+Character sprite reflects weapons, armor & items equipped+Enemies respawn so you can grind if you want or not+Dungeons can be replayed again for more loot & experience+Ability to bypass or run away from battles (so far, lol)+Kittens, Cats & Dragons
 Oh My
 lolCONS-Cannot name your character-Only one save slot that I can see-Cannot rebind keys on keyboard-Characters HATE to be called cute
 LOLNone of these cons matter at all in this game
Everything has been thought out very well and the game seems very polished
Try the demo if you want before purchasing
For a three person development team, I think they did a superb job

Product received for free
At its core, Cat Quest is a game that ditches unnecessay frills and features and instead has a polished core gameplay that works exactly the way you want it to
 Though combat is simplistic (with a button for attacking, one for spells, and another for rolling), there is a great amount of enjoyment to be had with this title
 It's back to basics, the fundamentals that make other action RPGs so much fun: fighting, looting, and fashion
 GameplayCombat is boiled down to the bare essentials
 You have one button for swinging your melee weapon, a selection of up to four spells to cast, and a dodge button
 All of these are used with equal frequency
 It's not enough to just whack an enemy, more often you will need to slow them with ice or weaken their defenses with fire
 You can't just stand there and wail on the baddies, you will need to watch for their attack warning and roll out of danger
 You're given a lot of warning when danger approaches, and in exchange you are punished greatly if you do get hit
 Cat-like agility will be needed
Loot is comprised of armor, helmets, and weapons
 Every chainmail helm has the same stat distribution as the next
 However, every time you get a new chainmail helm, the one you already have goes up in level, and thus in stats
 This means you might be mixing and matching sets rather than sticking to one for the entirety of your playthrough
 Side quests are sadly tedious, all falling under the umbrella of Kill X or Fetch Y
 There is some variety thrown in, in the form of tracking and chasing, but those moments are just a game of follow the dotted line
 Avoiding side quests isn't really an option, either, as they're the best way to level up
 Simply killing monsters won't be enough, unless you go after those of a much higher level than you
Balancing is an issue, in terms of leveling
 Starting off, you'll see a lot of quests above your paygrade, though you're free to attempt them
 After awhile, you'll find yourself rocketing past the level recommendations for the main quest and going back to find side quests you're now 20 levels too big for
 Eventually you'll want to tackle quests that are deemed too high a level for you, but with the right gear and magic, you will do just fine
Final ThoughtsHeading straight for the end of the game, ignoring any side content you don't have to touch, you'll likely finish the game in 3~ hours
 Factoring in all the side quests and dungeons, expect to get about ~6 hours out of this game
 There's promise for future content, though it's hard to tell if it's hinting at a sequel or DLC
 If you're looking for a fun and simple (but not too simple) game to relax with, this would be a great fit for any veteran or newcomer to the gaming scene
 It's accessible and charming, and while the content isn't as substantial as some may like, what is there is better polished than in most other games for its cost
 Quality over quantity is the name of the game
PROS+ Charming art style and orchestral soundtrack blend for a simplistic but enjoyable gameworld
+ Decently sized selection of gear, some original and some referential
+ Simple combat, but more depth there to be found if you look
CONS- Very boring side quests that lead to mashing through dialogue just to get it over with

This is the first steam game I've purchased for myself
 I played the demo today after seeing the reviews and figured that if it was easy enough for me to play, I'd get it
 And it was - and still is
 This game is EVERYTHING for me after my surgery
 It's not that complicated with the controls and actions, and it's really cute and fun
 The creators did such a good job with the can puns
 Honestly
 this game is purrfect if you're looking for simple, fun, and adventure - and if you just so happen to have a love for cat things
Posted: 28 August
It's fun at first, probably the first half, it doesn't really fall off much, it's an overall neat game, However, the dialog and the overload of puns all over the place and the childish dialog
 can get quite cringy
Buy at your own risk
was plenty of fun to play, sadly was pretty short </3

The meowment Cat Quest loaded, I was pawsitive I was in for a grrreat time
Okay, got that out of my system we can move along now
 If there is anything that the internet doesnt get bored of its cats
 I cant exactly explain it, but an obsession that goes back to Egyptian times cant necessarily be overrated
 Cats invading video games isnt exactly new either, with games such as Cat Goes Fishing, Catlateral Damage, Fort Meow and many more
 Maybe I have been fortunate, but I have enjoyed them all and never been left with a fishy taste in my mouth
 When I heard about Cat Quest, an open world RPG, I knew I had to check it out
Needless to say guys, its pretty pawsome
(I swear thats the last one
)Right off the bat, I do recommend Cat Quest
 Not just because its adorable and over the top, akin to something like Slime Rancher
 I recommend it because I genuinely had a blast and couldnt stop playing the game until it was all over
 If Cat Quest accomplishes anything, it is that it is super simple and fun to play
 This game is going to attract a wide age group and its got something for all of them
As soon as you start the game and get past some story tidbits, the first thing I noticed was this huge vivid over-world map
 Felingard is the name of this huge continent and you will explore all of it
 This map isnt just a means of getting from place to place
 This map is the game
 Monsters, towns, and events play out on this screen or one of the fifty two dungeons
 You begin your epic quest to defeat a mysterious figure named Drakosh and his dragons
The combat itself is all real time from an isometric view
 The beautiful part is that the combat is super simple but manages to stay complex enough to keep you on your toes
 You can slash with your equipped weapon, dodge roll, or cast one of the many spells in the game
 This is one game I highly recommend you play with a controller
 The enemies telegraph their attacks with either a red circle or symbol to represent a spell they are about to cast
 Some enemies are faster than others and using different spells/tactics to overcome them is required
The problem I found with Cat Quests combat is that it tends to have extremes
 The combat is either far too easy or youre going to die very fast
 It never quite hits that sweet spot in the middle
 Cat Quest does however have a good pace as the dungeons themselves range from level 1 to 99
 If you find it to be too easy then just hop into a dungeon five or six levels higher than you and feel the pain
 The dungeons themselves are rather simplistic in design and more about combat and loot
Loot in this game I felt a bit divided on
 Cat Quest has a stat system with the usual suspects, e
g
 health, magic, damage, armor
 You can mix and match armor pieces to create your own play style
 If you dont like physical attacks, then wear magic armor
 Some armors even go to extremes giving huge benefits to one stat and taking away from others
 Also some armors just suck in general, guess they are there to keep the game challenging maybe
 The problem lies in Golden Chests
Sometime in the middle of the game you will get access to these beauties
 Golden chests contain rare loot
 These rare items can break the game quite easily
 I stumbled upon an item called Courage that gave me vast amounts of health
 This item made bosses seem like they were tickling me and I just stood there whacking away at them
 Now I couldve not used that item, true, but I didnt know any better
 Plus if its in the game, why not use it
 Cat Quest respects your time as a player and for that I appreciate it
 However, the games combat just loses some of its enjoyment once you gain access to these golden chests
 Its like the game gave up and handed me the win
That isnt to say I didnt love the combat in Cat Quest, I just wanted the last boss to actually be a challenge instead of dead in five seconds
 I think the combat system had great potential to keep things fresh and fun all the way until the end
 Cat Quest didnt need to hand me the keys to the kingdom, proverbially
Side quests and story galore
One of the main highlights of Cat Quest is by far is its dialogue/story
 Side quests are filled to the brim with cat puns, and hilarity
 There are times where I found myself genuinely laughing and that isnt an easy task for a game when it comes to me
 On top of that, there is actually a pretty intense lore here that I found myself being wrapped up in as the game progressed
 Drakoths story and the birth of the Dragonbloods is very interesting and far from what I expected
The story isnt one dimensional, despite appearing that way
 The reason behind dragons tearing up the place is rather sad
 When I finally reached the end of my Cat Quest I was left with far more questions than answers
 Which also left me with a bit of a gripe
 The end feels like its baiting for a sequel or DLC
 While I dont want to give any spoilers, Cat Quest comes to a climax with a threat looming, but the game just ends abruptly
 It felt odd
 Queens Bay an area that has one quest and no follow ups, more or less confirms this suspicion
 Then again, more Cat Quest is hardly a bad thing
In all, the side-quests were fun and enjoyable
 They brought a life and personality to the world that left me wanting more
 I cant wait to see the Mice Pirates and the Lupus Empire
 There was one side quest though that annoyed me to no end
 One which had you traveling back and forth from opposite ends of the continent
 Silly Chef cats
Another obvious statement is that Cat Quest is very family friendly and pleasing to the eyes
 This game is candy wrapped up in kittens
 One fear I had was that the huge over world map would be one tone but Cat Quest does manage to keep things varied
 You will venture on islands, snow caps, plagued lands and more
 The art is very well done and mixes seamlessly with the combat and magic effects
 The monsters, and sprites themselves are cute and I couldnt help but chuckle when I put a big metal helmet on my cat
 Item design is one area that I was also impressed with
 It added plenty of personality on its own
 An area that didnt hit the mark for me was the menus
 They were very bare-bones
 Cat Quest is also available on mobile devices, and it shows in the menus especially
The music and sound effects are as equally pleasing to the ears as the graphics are to the eyes
 Every time I heard a meow when I got hit, it made me smile
 There were times people nearby thought an actual cat was meowing, if that tells you anything
 The music is as fun and adventurous as is required for this type of game
 You can expect an orchestral soundtrack and if you keep moving in the game, no one track over stays its welcome
I guess you could say I had a purrfect time
Sorry I lied, I couldnt help meowself
I finished the game out at about nine hours and that was getting all the current Steam Achievements
 Including all the outfits, and clearing all the dungeons
 Youre looking at anywhere between six to ten hours total playtime
 The game doesnt have much in the way of replay
 There is no new game+ and its basically a get done and go type of deal
 Keep an eye out though for future DLC or an update
 Aside from the achievements across all platforms, there are also Steam Cards
 Obviously thats computer only
To wrap up, I found Cat Quest to be a highly enjoyable popcorn style game
 You eat it, you love it, its bad for you chances are, but hey life is short and there is cats
 Its not going to rock the boat for innovation or expand your mind on new levels of philosophy
 What it is going to do is give plenty of entertainment that you or your kid can enjoy together
 I personally think its a good homage to the ARPG genre and worthy of your attention
 Did I mention the cats

My sister on my steam account"Matt whats NEKOPARA
""My friend gave it to me, its just some weird weeaboo thing
""Can I play it
""Ummmm ok
"We play through the game, mostly making fun of how annoying all the characters are
The bath scene starts
Posted: 17 August, 2015
Nekopara Vol
 0 is the prequel to the events that occur in Nekopara Vol
 1
StoryThe story is pretty much outlined in the description on the steam store
"The eldest daughter of the Minaduki household and their 6 catgirls go to wake up their master; prepare breakfast; clean up the house; go out on a walk; make dinner; take a bath; sleep together; et cetera, et cetera
 "Sadly it outlines the majority of what this visual novel has to offer, which can be a bit of a spoiler, but the interactions and personality of the catgirls does offer some light comedy
 Their differing personalities, as well as their curuiosity, does lead to them to sometimes being more troublesome than helpful
 This being said, the visual novel is a bit short, and can be fully read in about 30 to 50 minutes, depending on your reading speed
Notable features-As you all may have noticed, there is a hand on the top right of the screen while playing the game, pressing it engages in a petting "minigame"
 This minigame pauses the game's dialogue, allowing you to pet the characters on screen
 This is not limited to the catgirls, you can even pet shigure
 The petting feature goes a bit further, making the characters react differently; based on where you choose to pet them
-Trading cards with more cute backgrounds and emoticons
-Artwork is similar to that of its predecessor, having some scenes played out in their adorable chibi form, and many other scenes in their normal form
 Art is a bit more lewd, as it has a shower scene with shigure as well as the catgirls
(use your imagination)Verdict 7/10At the time of this review, there is a small typo, in which Maple asks Coconut if she is sure she can finish all the food she wanted, but refers to her as cinnamon

This game has eaten up all my time
 I lost my job and got kicked out of my house because of these girls
Worth
Posted: 7 June
A game that revolves heavily on the fact that the player either owns a cat, a sister, or a computer
 The second reliance is upon the player to be the kind of person that would willingly purchase a VN, on steam, and remain completely unashamed playing it for all his friends on his roster to see
 As a man that makes his own money and uses that to build a $700 PC, I can say that somehow I fit into one of the previously stated categories
 The core of the VN surrounds several catgirls going through an entire day without their master/owner
 Much like real cats they tend to be complete dumb-asses that make a mess and fight causing you to watch their shenanigans as well as their breasts bounce around the screen significant something; possibly violence, maybe sexual perversion brought about from Hiroshima and Nagasaki
You, the player are not the master; even though at certain parts you see though his eyes
 No, you are a disembodied spirit the stalks the girls around their house and town respectively
 During certain parts you can use your ghost powers to pat these girls on their head, poke their bellies and grab their boobs
 Similar to real life these girls react positively to being fondled, but unlike real life they never sit you down in an interrogation room, show you the video of you fondling a girl and force you to sign a mutual release because you didn't know she had a boyfriend and that man was a lieutenant for the state police

Not the game

This game is a hidden gem
If you like metroidvania or souls like games, then for $10 you won't be disappointed
Posted: 18 June
Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a 2D platformer so solid and lovely to control i wanna kiss it
like, imagine Dark Souls and Metroid had a little 16-bit baby, and then that baby made a game called Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight for his preschool project
 thats this game
Momo borrows its core mechanics from games like Metroid and Dark Souls, which i heard are pretty good
 main gameplay really only includes jumping on platforms and slashing/shooting bad dudes, but Momodora likes to get a little deeper than that
 your main weapon is a leaf, which attacks slowly and leaves you vulnerable between slashes, but you have a roll that gives you invincibility frames if things are dicey
 your other weapon is a bow that's pretty quick but forces you to stand still, again leaving you vulnerable
 this means you cant be strolling along willy nilly and you gotta take each group of enemies on with care and strategy
 as a result you get combat that's pretty gosh darn fun and challenging (hey this kinda reminds me of Dark Souls)
the map that you explore is linear for about 2 seconds while the game teaches you how to play it, and then immedietely opens up, branhing into paths leading to the game's several areas (which all look damn beautiful btw) that you can explore
 along the way you can buy/find abilities and upgrades that help you kill baddies faster or move around faster or use the power of wind or whatever, and its real neato (huh kinda like that Metroid game hmm)
 the map is also sprinkled with a lot of hidden goodies, hints toward lore, easter eggs, and a secret boss if any of that scratches your itch
 overall its a treat to explore and discover
speaking of bosses, the few that pop in during the game are pretty good
 the average boss battle is a lot like Dark Souls, bosses hit hard, but their attacks are predictable and telepathed, and leave them vulnerable to a few swings from your leaf if you execute correctly
 each boss looks, plays and acts different from the others, adding to the world experience as you come across them
 their rarity, combined witht the bangin' soundtrack, makes each boss intense to fight
the death system in this game is also a lot like Dank Souls, in that you have several bells (bonfires) sprinkled about the map that serve as save points
 hitting the bell (resting at the bonfire) heals the player, refills active item charges, and sets that location to be the respawn point, yadda yadda classic game stuff
 save points are definetelypresentation-wise, this thing is so damn delicious to experience
 animations feel like they have some weight, and scenery looks pretty dang pretty on this one
 im no artist, though, so i cant say much else
 also the soundtrack gets soooooo good at times
 my favorite track is "Pardoner's Dance", which plays when you fight Fennel (that hot gal in the white dress and the red sword)
uh, story, right
 you get a vague idea of what's going on via talking to npc's or pre-boss banter, but i had a lot of trouble putting together the whole pie, and there's a lot of reading between the lines on this one
 i ended up filling some info with my imagination, which was okay, but left something to be desired
 maybe it's cause i haven't played the other 3 Momo games, but i dont know
 you should ask someone else about this to be honest
overall, yeah this one's pretty dang good
 and definitely worth two $5 footlongs

Great metroidvania game, with a lot of depth
 Good map, good gameplay, really a nice surprise
 It took me about 7 hours to reveal 100% of the map on normal difficulty (which I think is actually a nice thing, I prefer a short but intesne experience over a long but boring game)
 Good job devs, I had a great time

Best 2D Souls game I've ever played
Posted: 23 December, 2016
This is a very short game with a mountain of untapped potential that could have been one of the greatest metroidvania games ever created
 As it is, it's still a phenomenal appetizer for the genre with shades of Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Shovel Knight
Just don't overthink it or get too invested in any of the characters, because they're little more than interesting signposts and the journey is over just as suddenly as it begins
I can see it being a good speed run game
Posted: 29 May
Momodora: RUtM is basically a 2D, 16-bit Bloodborne clone
 If that sounds appealing, buy it
 If that sounds confusing, continue reading and I'll elaborate
The game is dark, gothic, and brimming with psychological horror and depressing themes
 The godly mellow soundtrack just improves on this even further
Combat is centered around dodging and stunlocking enemies, there's no way to block attacks
 You have an incredibly fast ranged attack in your longbow, but using it makes you stationary, so you need to time using it well
 Same thing with healing: it's very fast, but it will lock you in place long enough for enemies to hit you unless you time it properly
There's a lot of hidden secrets, including shortcuts, HP upgrades, equipment that can change your playstyle considerably, and hidden Ivory Bugs that are 1 pixel big and traded in with a collector for various rewards
The game is incredibly free, once you reach a certain point you can take on all areas in any order
There's a lot of missable optional content, and that coupled with the freeform structure adds a lot of replay value
The game has gotten a lot of updates with things most other devs wouldn't even consider, like tweaks to reduce photosensitivity epilepsy trigger rate in some effects and a danish localization
It's a bit short, but considering the amount of hidden stuff to find it can give you way more playtime than it initially seems
 And I've seriously spent more time with some of these bosses than it took to get past some bosses in Dark Souls 2 and 3
Overall this game is definitely worth getting if you're into soulslikes, metroidvanias or bullet hell games: it has reasonable chunks of each and is a huge step up from its (already amazing) predecessors Modora I - III
Posted: 9 December, 2016
Great MetroidvaniaPROS+Nice soundtrack+Great Bosses+Big game world(way bigger than 1,2 or 3 parts of the game)+Nice difficulty+Good replayablity+New Game++Various endingsCONS-Final Boss is easy as pieGreat Metroidvania
Boss battles are great,exploration is really great
This game really offers a challenge and after first walkthrough you will get even harder difficulty
Buy it and play it
Posted: 14 June, 2016
Go, buy this game at full price now, if you find yourself even remotely interested in metroidvania-type games
It's just beautifulColors, backgrounds, character sprites, animations and music: everything flawlessly blends into a stunningly atmospheric and coherent 2D game world
 Seriously, Momodora knows its aesthetics
 I absolutely loved this aspect of the game
 (Bonus points for playing as a kawaii priestess with a maple leaf as main weapon and being able to turn into a cat)Gameplay is simple, yet effectiveYou won't find a ton of useless items, spells or use one of many gazillion button input combos
 Nope
 You've got your basic melee 3-hit combo, a chargeable bow, 3 active and 2 passive items
 Combat works and feels just right
Movement is also tight and responsive: running, jumping, rolling and dashing through the world is a real pleasure
DifficultyI played on normal difficulty
 The game is challenging (especially in boss fights which require you to learn their patterns) but not too unforgiving
 Weirdly enough it gets a lot easier towards the end since you find tons of HP upgrades and more powerful items
 Looking back I'd recommend starting out on Hard
The only downsideAfter roughly 5 hours playtime I'm standing before the final boss, 99% of the map is cleared and I don't want the game to end yet
Seriously, it's too short :(

Homestuck has ruined my life
Posted: 14 September
Oh my god the references
 There's so much nostalgia here for me
 I grew up in the period this game is set, so there's so many toys and other junk that I recognize
 That aside, this game is, SO FAR, fantastic
 If it keeps this level of quality that I've had in the first hour, then it's going to be one of my all-time favourite point/click adventure games
The music, the visuals, the humor
 And the hidden achievements
 I just got an achievement for trying to feed the Bubsy poster a pet treat
 The result was hilarious
EDIT: I've just finished ACT 1, which is currently all that's available
 Here's my thoughts on my experience:I'm sure if you only spent your time solving puzzles, you could beat it in about 20 minutes
 But that's not what I did
 I spent as much time as possible using every object and action on everything else even to the point where I got an achievement for trying to use a pigeon on 30 different objects
3 hours later, I was very satisfied with the experience, and I will probably play through it again tomorrow to try different object interactions
 I hope ACT 2 doesn't take too long to release
If you're looking for reviews of specific things or whatever, then here you go
Visuals: Very familiar to Homestuck fans
 Some camera errors that don't impede gameplay that I'm sure will be fixed soon
Audio: The soundtrack is stuck in my head
UI: The top bar can get in the way of some puzzles, so if you're stuck, maybe try minimizing it while you look around
 On the subject, there is no highlight on the interactable objects (aside from your cursor changing when hovering over), which I feel was actually a good choice
 When you discover some funny writing by doing something like, as a previous example, feeding a pet treat to a Bubsy poster, it feels all the more special by the knowledge that the game didn't explicitly try to tell you there was stuff you could do with it at all
Stability: Well, in all the time I played it, it didn't crash
 That's something
Story/Writing: Top quality writing
 The story definitely seems to be accessible to people who have never read Homestuck
 In fact, I think it will make those people go and start reading it
If you've got any specific questions, leave a comment on this review
 I don't write reviews often so maybe I've missed something you want to know

[S] Fandom: Wake Up
Posted: 14 September
Now you can sell your soul to Hussie on Steam
Posted: 14 September
I can't, in good faith, recommend the game in its current state due to constant visual artifacts that slowly lead the game to be borderline unplayable (primarily that the entire view of the game will be shifted too far to the left or right)
 As soon as it gets patched I've got a strong feeling this will change to a positive review
EDIT:Just had confirmation that these issues happen due to the wrong resolution being set when you first launch the game
 If you immediately restart the game after changing resolution you wont run into any of these issues
 What I didn't realize was also an issue is that if you dont restart the game not only do you get a displaced window but extreme letterboxing
Posted: 14 September
Alright, I've been waiting for this game for a LONG and arduous time, so you know it's gotta be good for me to recommend it
 Pros:- Really good humor and writing(I would say it's as good as Homestuck's Andrew Hussie's, if not as eclectic)
- Excellent soundtrack
- Amazing art, tons of unique animations and cutscenes for even tiny stuff
 - Attention to detail, both in gameplay and text
 However, I feel like this might have harmed the game's length, check below for what I mean
- Vast breadth and depth of references that are subtle enough to not be cringey (and in fact would go over most players' heads, there were even humanimals references), but recognizable enough to still make you smirk
- Good worldbuilding and setup, I can see future acts having a really good plot
- Very, very good characters
 I wish Jude could have been fleshed out more, but I guess that's for Hauntswitch so I can't complain
Cons:- Music transitions are buggy, especially around strifes
 Volume is also extremely inconsistent across rooms, even compared to sound effects
 Seems more of a programming issue than anything related to sound design, however
- Weird "hitboxes" for items, and a few "conflicts" between movement and interaction
 Particularly, having to use an item on a door was unexpected, considering the icon didn't change from the regular movement icon when you hovered over it with the item, and the fact using items on transitions was unprecedented
- ANY button skips stuff, even the screenshot button
 A nitpick, but an annoying one
- Relatively short, took me three hours while taking my time
 I would have vastly preferred a bigger amount of interactions between the characters over item combination/interaction text, which I enjoyed, but wouldn't deliberately seek out
 That said, this is no big deal: I have to remember it's only Act 1
- It's just too easy
 I got stuck one time, and that was with the door incident I mentioned above
 I definitely don't want an obscurely frustrating experience like with some old adventure games, but I feel like the only times the game made you use your head were ruined by the fact you got unasked hints for them right afterwards
 Maybe make the hints optional in future acts
Conclusion: 8
5/10
 A very fun adventure game, and a great Homestuck experience (if you're into that), but a bit too easy and too short to be perfect
 I hope future acts make you think a bit more often
 I can recommend it to everyone who enjoys adventure games, and it's definitely a must-play for Homestuck fans
Posted: 17 September
Alright, so here's the deal
 Most of the reviews you'll read on here are going to be people who either just found this game and are wondering what all the fuss is about, or people who've been waiting for this game to come out ever since the Kickstarter launched in 2012, and are just overjoyed to finally play it
 I will admit, I belong to the latter group
But if you want an honest review of this game, it's fantastic

This game, man
 This game is just absolutely fantastic
 If you like metroidvania-type games and bullet hells, you will most likely love this game
 It's by far the best action-platformer that I've ever played, and that's not just in gameplay
 Ignoring the story itself (which is probably mediocre at best, but charming nonetheless), there are so many ways that you can play and explore this colorful world
 Want to complete the entire game without collecting any item whatsoever
 You can do that
 Want to break the order of which the story progresses
 Well, you can do that too
Rabi-Ribi is the very definition of non-linear
 You can do what you want, when you want, and in any order that you want
 There's a plethora of hidden passageways and secrets
 Some of these things also only appear depending on how you're currently playing
 For example: if you are going through the game without collecting items, there is a part where you normally would not be able to progress without some specific items (e
g
 double jump), but upon reaching this area on a 0% item run, a spring will appear and you'll be able to move forward
 And to be crystal clear, this spring will not appear if you have collected any item at all (except rainbow eggs and three other things that are forced onto you), so you wouldn't be able to abuse this
 In that aspect, it's appearent that the developers really put a lot of thought into the game's structure, and I think that that should be respected because, nowadays, you just don't see things like this in games
The game has eight (six + two DLC) different difficulty levels
 Hard and above are there to provide a challenge to those that want it, but those that don't can opt to play on an easier difficulty that is closer to their own skill level
CasualNoviceNormalHardHell (Unlocked after clearing Hard)Bunny Extinction (Unlocked after clearing Hell)Unknown (DLC)Impossible (DLC)Now, going back to the word 'colorful': Rabi-Ribi is beautiful for a pixelated world
 It's very eye-catching and relaxing to look at
 Not to mention that the soundtrack is quite fitting for the overall atmosphere of the game
 But although the soundtrack is nice, I don't think that it's anything mindblowing and I can see it being repetitive for some people after a while
 There could stand to be more tracks for boss fights, as well, because as of right now it's very limited
 But that's just a minor complaint for me, as after the 80 hours that I've played so far, I am still enjoying it
Actually, I think that words cannot accurately express how much I am enjoying this game as a whole
 I'm not even good enough at it to do things like True Boss Rush on Hell difficulty or above
 In fact, I had some trouble just completing the game on Hard (though, to be fair, I didn't use buffs or consumables)
 But that doesn't, and never did, take away from the fun that I am having with the game
 There are plenty of other things for me to do, and if I ever feel like hating myself, I can just practice until I'm good enough to complete Impossible mode
Also, to be honest, I feel like the $17
99 price tag is pretty low (I'd gladly pay at least $40) for how many hours one can get out of it
 The game itself is not that long and can be beaten in just a few hours or less (if you know what you're doing), but its replay value is off the charts
 I mean, just check out those achievements
 And although it's not terribly long, the first playthrough for most people, on average, will probably take 15-20 hours
 Personally, it took me between 40-50 hours for my first playthrough because I played on Hard and went around collecting all items without using a guide
 Anyway
 TLDR; Rabi-Ribi provides a challenge for players of all skill levels in a way that almost no other game does, and that's letting you, the player, go at your own discretion
 It's also pretty spectacular, and if you love the metroidvania/bullet hell genres, you owe it to yourself to buy this game
 Don't even think about it--just do it
 I can guarantee that you won't regret it
(Also, the art is very cute and has some ecchi bits to it
 If you're not into that, please don't let it turn you off of buying the game
 You'll be missing out, greatly
)
Posted: 4 May, 2016
First of all let me just say; Do NOT pass this game up just because you think it's some fanservice ecchi eroge hentai thing
 The only thing you'll see is some slightly revealing outfits and some minor yuri undertones
 If you pass it up because of that, you're missing out on a ton of fun, trust me
 (I think the game is a little underrated because of people thinking that
) Now then with that out of the way, Rabi-Ribi is a 2D bullet hell metroidvania platformer where you play as Erina; a Bunny Girl who is accompanied by Ribbon; a Fairy
 Erina focuses on close range combat and Ribbon with long range
The story essentially revolves around Erina finding her master then finding helpers to help find her Master's sister
 While the story isn't too strong, the bullet hell boss battles & metroidvania aspects are definitely the biggest & best parts of the game
 It's also non-linear (after prologue) so you can go and tackle the bosses in any order you want, it makes speedruns very interesting
Pros+ Gameplay is very smooth & combat is satisfying+ Cute & well done pixel graphics, sprites and CGs+ Amazing soundtrack that fits very well with areas/boss fights+ Lots of different difficulties (from Casual to Bunny Extinction)+ Tons of boss battles (40+)+ Different badges to pick from which encourage different types of gameplay+ Many different areas & locations to explore and items to find & upgrade+ Non-linear+ Speedrun + Boss Rush+ Offers help (with buffs) when you get game over repeatedly (Normal or below)+ Lots of Steam integration (Cloud saving, trading cards, achievements, leaderboards) which I personally, really appreciate+ It has lots of replay value going for it with achievement hunting+ Developer is really nice and active in the Steam discussions+ BunnyCons (I had trouble actually finding reasons to dislike Rabi-Ribi)- Story wasn't too strong and was a little repetitive, but it works out- It had not too good optimization at first, but it's getting better- A few bugs here and there, mostly ironed out now (Nothing too major)- Boss battles get re-used a several times in the story (slightly annoying)- Slightly overpriced (If you go for all achievements, you get your money's worth for sure)All in all, you can tell alot of work was put into the game and i'd definitely recommend giving Rabi-Ribi a try, it's easily my game of 2016
 I hope you can take my word for it with all my achievements and hours in it
 Thanks for reading my review, hope it helped you

Do not be fooled by all the weeb anime visuals, this game is an amazing metroidvania
The explorable game world is giant, and is mostly non-linear
There are literally dozens of bosses, many of which can be tackled in any order you want with few exceptions
There is fast travel to minimize some back tracking, a shop where you can buy upgrades, and a ton of hidden secrets and items scattered all over the map
The gameplay handles surprisingly well, and the music is top notch through the entire game
The story is sort of meh, and there's a lot of dialogue that is painful at times to read through
It doesn't detract enough from the game though
Boss battles seem to be at the heart of the game since there are so many
They are bullet hell Touhou style fights with creative and insane barrage patterns
Playing through blind on Hard right out of the gate, I found it to have the perfect level of challenge
It's hard enough that you feel motivated to hunt down hidden power-ups, but fair enough to not discourage you
After all if you get stuck on a boss there's always a few others you can try your luck on
After you beat the main final boss, which is a doozy of a fight that I won't forget soon, the game keeps plowing onwards after the credits roll into overtime with more challenges and extra content for those willing to see how deep the rabbit hole really goes
 (See what I did there
)Overall highly recommended for fans of metroidvanias, the game is very lengthy for the price and the replay value is there as well

Went for the bunny girlsStayed for the wonderful gameplay and musicWhen I got this I was shocked just how good of a game this really was
 It's a Metroidvania mixed with a bullet hell, but don't let the name "bullet hell" discourage you
 It has the right difficulty for any kind of player, new or veteran
Please, please try this game

Most deceiving hardcore game on steam
Story:You're a bunny waifu who tags along with a fairy waifu, murdering a diversity of waifus
Gamplay:- Bullet hell
- Smooth combat, plenty of ways dealing with enemies and bosses so it never gets stale
 - During boss fights you get rewarded for performance with a ranking system that improves your damage
- The game has quite a bunch of difficulty modes, while the final one will provide a very nice challenge for those who seek it among you
- Big world with plenty of areas to explore and find secrets
 Almost every non-transition screen has a secret in it
Art:Weeb stuff, either you like it or you don't
World design is simple and easy on the eyes
Music:10/10, you might even find yourself listening to the OST outside the game
It's that good
Overall I had a great experience playing Rabi-Ribi
I would recommend this game to those who enjoy hardcore gaming (and are decent / good at it)
 If you're here for achievements then turn away from this game, as you will fail miserably to complete it

From CreSpirit comes a exploration platformer, bullet-hell, RPG, developed by CreSpirit and Published by Sekai Project
[Note - I have been provided a copy of this game by its publisher but it and has no effect on this review outcome]Introduction/ StoryRabi-Ribi is a 2D exploration platformer that focuses on non-linear gameplay
 There will be hints to guide the player along, but theyre never required to follow them, which allows for much greater freedom toyou guessed itexplore
 I absolutely love this game as a whole mainly reason is that there is full freedom of exploration, you could easily spend your time not following the story and just hunting for hidden treasures or objects
Rabi-Ribi follows the mishop adventure of Erina, whose routine life as a rabbit is turned upside down and inside out when she awakens to discover that, not only is she in an unfamiliar new world, but she has been transformed into a human girlwith rabbit ears and a fuzzy lil tail to match
 As Erina ventures out into this magical new world in search of her Master, she meets the spunky pink-haired fairy, Ribbon, who mysteriously chooses to stick by Erinas side
 Together, these unwitting heroes embark on their quest to restore Erinas life to normalcy, unbeknownst to the troubles that await them
Gameplay ElementsOnto the gameplay elements , I absolutely adore the customization that you can do to the game like making it a whole lot easier or simply by making the game harder as a whole
Badges  Provably 1 of the biggest thing that you would use in Rabi Ribi, as you can see in the above screenshot I took a full offense badge setup
 Basically it allows me to kill enemies relatively fast but if i were to take a hit, it would be a very very huge blow to my HP in Rabi Ribi
In Rabi-Ribi you could do almost anything you want without following the story at all, for my case what I did was i spent an approx 10 hours exploring and trying to find power-ups mainly Max health power ups because my health is low since I took a full offense badge setup
Controls  I am playing Rabi-Ribi on PC with a keyboard and the controls are good
 The default settings are are well thought out and it can be fully customize allowing you to bind any buttons you want on the keyboard
 [no cramping of 2 hands onto 1 side of the keyboard] I think having a good controls are very important because who wants to play a game with 2 hands overlapping each other
 Using a gamepad is recommended for Rabi Ribi but it all comes down to personal preference as for me I prefer keyboard but it is up to you too choose
Power ups  These can can be bought each time for a set amount of [EN] a currency used in Rabi-Ribi and they can be bought ONLY after you defeat bosses and they agreed to go to Rabi-Ribi town as seen in the above screenshots and you can buy power ups from them
 But do note these power ups do not last forever but can be repurchased again once it expires after a set amount of time
Difficulty level  A important factor people will look out for in bullet hell games, generally speaking from my experience for Rabi-Ribi it is very forgiving to new players, at the start on a new game you will be asked to choose a difficulty level
 As for me I went for novice first because I do not have much experience in bullet hell games but I found it way to easy so I decided to go for hard mode which is challenging and not too hard for me
 Well different people have different skill set
 Novice is too easy because each time you die you will respawn, but with a damage reduction buff but as for hard mode there is none
Enemy attack patterns  For hard mode it is manageable and challenging at the same time but as for novice it is way too easy but if you do plan to play casually do go for a novice difficulty
Audio and Visual Elements and FeaturesThey are STUNNING I love the artwork of the CGs they are all extremely detailed
 Soundtracks, the soundtracks are really great they fit into the battle that is happening in your screen it just makes the whole game feel more immersive and cool like you are really part of the fight, I absolutely love the soundtracks
To sum up Do I recommend this game
Definitely a BIG, Yes I definitely recommend you to pick it up if you are a fan off bullet hell and great soundtracks and love treasure hunting with RPG elements
 Last but not least bunnies

Okay, where should I start
 I saw this game quite a few times in my Steam recommendations before actually buying it
 And well, not wanting to sound rude towards other "anime games" you usually read stuff like "It has anime boobs 10/10" so I didn't check the reviews when it said "Overwhelmingly positive
" Until that one day: and all reviews came up with: "Ignore the super cutesy appeal, it's a great platformer"And this is simply what I can only fully agree with: the game is a 2D platformer - combined with Touhou like bullet hell battles - and those battles get extremely hard over time
 I just saw the credits for the first time (apparently there will be quite a bit of post game content which I haven't explored yet) and boy - I was playing on "Novice" difficulty and the bosses were giving me a really hard time
 I'm not saying the game's unfair:it never is
 The controls work perfectly fine, they're super responsive - just make sure to get a controller to play this - in my case I remapped the buttons
 But yeah, the controls and everything working just great made me never blame the game if I died (and it happened quite often)
Other than that: If the cutesy appeal would turn you off - then you'll be certainly missing out on a great and challenging platformer
 The story might be a bit absurd to be frank - a bunny gets transformed into a girl and she searches for her master
 And as the story progresses she searches for her master's younger sister
Sounds simple
 Well, maybe
 But all the characters in the game have a little trait - there are very many so don't expect them to be super deep but they're very charming
So
well: I recommend it

I have over 300 games and this is one of the few that actually makes me happy
Posted: 12 October, 2014
I'm a sad man
 I'm late-40s and I still like cute things
 I also love RPGs, so you can see why I looked at Recettear and liked the look of it
The game wasn't quite what I thought it was though
 but in a good way
 I was pleasantly surprised
You'd probably be forgiven for thinking as I did - this is a typical JRPG with the theme being centred somehow around a shop
 Well, yes it is
 and it isn't
 The game essentially has two parts to it
 The RPG part takes the form of a fairly typical top-down dungeon crawler a la Chocobo's Dungeon, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and a host of other similar ones
 That's about as standard as it gets though
Recettear does things rather differently - you are a young girl who has inherited her father's item shop which serves the local townsfolk with equipment for their day-to-day use and more importantly, stuff to go a-dungeon-crawling with
 You also have a guardian of sorts (who also turns out to be a debt collector too) who's a fairy
 Well, this is a Japanese game - 'nuff said
 The relevance of this is that Recette (you) have also inherted some burden of debt too, who naturally you owe to your ward
 So, the crux of the game is to run the shop, and earn enough each day to enable you to pay off your monthly debt payment
I know, that might sound a little boring, but it isn't
 It's actually where the game really shines
 Your day is divided up into a maximum of 4 sections, which you can "spend" by either visiting town for certain things, visit the adventurer's guild (more on that later), or open the shop
 Your shop has certain shelf spaces laid out, and arranging the stock so your best stuff is visible from the window is an essential trick
 Put the boring, common and cheap items in the window and you'll attract less passers-by
 Put the really expensive stuff in the window and you'll also attract less passers-by
 It's a balancing act
Once customers come in, they'll flit around looking, and approach you with items they want to buy from the shelves
 As with any real-world store, the trick is to maximize profit, while retaining custom
 So, sell higher than you bought it, but low enough so they don't get annoyed and never return - another balancing act
 Some customers will ask for certain special orders in advance, which you almost always never have the stock at the time to fulfil, so you make a gamble on whether you can acquire the stock they're asking for - accept and fail, and they'll get annoyed, but refuse and they'll get annoyed too
 You can't please everyone
So where does the stock come from
 This is where the adventurer's guild and the dungeon crawling comes in
 Instead of opening the store, you can toddle off to the adventurer's guild where all the adventurers hang out
 You can recruit them, for a fee to go and dungeon crawl with you
There's a great element of risk/reward here, as at the end of each level, you can choose to duck out with the loot, or proceed onwards with the chance of more and better loot, but with the added risk of costly failure
 As Recette, doesn't fight (well, she's only a girl), you take the role of the adventurer here
 Her role is to tag along and store your part of the loot
So, you fight, you level up your adventurers, you gain better loot to sell for better prices, you get money to pay off your increasing debt, and so on
There's also some added little nuances such as it being wise to look after the adventurers you are hiring by selling them stuff cheap when they visit your store, as they'll use that stuff when crawling the not-so-murky depths
 As the game progresses, you'll need to get a bit inventive in how you manage your stock and customers, but I won't elaborate on that as that would be spoiling things
It's not an easy game to describe, and it probably sounds a bit dry on the face of it, but if you like the straight up old-school action-RPG dungeon crawler, I wouldn't hesitate to grab this - it does that part of it very well, but the light startegy side of shop management and how it dovetails so very, very nicely is what makes this game utterly unique
 I can't recommend it highly enough
So I have no hesitation in saying this is easily worth £15 on my value-for-money scale
Posted: 25 November, 2013
You think this is a cute little game about running an item shop and having fun, but it's not
 It's a game about crippling debt and trying your hardest to claw your way out of it
 The bank comes to your house and tells you that your dumb deadbeat dad is probably dead, and that they're going to repo your house
 Instead of making you homeless, the bank fairy just turns you into a slave and turns your house into an item shop (because zoning regulations and child labor laws don't exist here) and you spend the rest of the game trying to make payments to buy your freedom
 Fun game, but god help you if your hustle isn't strong enough
 Would not recommend to the capitalistically weak

Finally a game where I can live out my fantasies of becoming a merchant who crushes hearts and dreams under the weight of his fat profit margin
Posted: 20 October, 2014
Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is, without exaggeration, my favorite game of all time
 The art and characters are absolutely adorable, the protagonist is even more so, and the gameplay is incredibly addictive
 You not only get to spend plenty of time squeezing every last possible cent out of your customers, you get enormous dungeons to go adventuring through and plenty of amazing spoils to bring back to the surface, craft into amazing items, and sell right back to the adventurer who helped you acquire them
 And once you pay off your loan, you unlock Endless Mode and get to finish exploring those dungeons and becoming a billionaire
 I have 225 hours of this game under my belt, and I STILL haven't finished finding every item in the game
 The plot(that is, the plot that isn't related to your loan - yes, there's more
) is definitely fun, although you won't be able to see the whole thing during your first story mode, but since Endless Mode allows you to pick up right where you left off, it's not a problem
Basically, what I'm getting at is that Recettear is an amazing game, I love it, and you probably will too
 Base price for hours of entertainment
 It's a bargain
 Capitalism, ho

Montaro is the best game i have ever played The concept of the game is very realistic
 These struggles are what doges go through on a daily basis
 This game raises important awareness for those poor doggos who have it hard
I can't remember exactly when I bought Montaro, but it was the best decision I ever made
 I saw the adorable shiba as the mascot, and saw it was only $0
99 and decided to try it out
 I got all of the achevements within about three days of hardcore gameplay and passion
 I've now got this game for at least eight of my friends so that they could enjoy it too
The Gameplay is simple, yet immersive
 The machanics of the environment and other characters never fail to be perfect
 the different skins, which i've unlocked all, are beautiful and I cannot pick a favorite
 Everything gameplay wise flows perfectly, and the graphics are stellar
 With everything you can interact with, it gets really challenging at some points, and may be rage inducing, but is always fun
The music within the game is the best thing i've ever heard
 When loading up the game, I wait for that iconic start, and it fills me with so many feelings every time
 I get an overwelming sense of pride, joy, inspiration, warmth, comfort, and compassion
 I wish you could buy the soundtrack
Sadly, there isn't multiplayer, but to be able to play Montaro at the same time as my friends, and hear their feedback is fantastic
 I've talked to all of them while playing, and some of them don't fully appreciate the artistic masterpiece which is Montaro, they do love it
 They all think its a good stress relieaver and wutld be great to have on the go
 As an aspiring game designer, this title has taught me so much
 I will forever hold Montaro in my heart
Overall, this game does everything perfectly
 There is very little anyone could do to make this beautiful experience better
 Montaro is well worth the $0
99, and more

TL;DR: A fairly simple endless runner game, just enough complexity to show the effort that went into it and make it worth the super-cheap price
Not going to be a super long review, but also likely far more serious than the other meme-based reviews on this game's page
In essence, Montaro is an endless runner game where you are auto-scrolling along the screen from left to right
 Your goal is to collect Doge coins, which usually are on the upper level of the screen
 After you collect enough, you can purchase new costumes for the dog you are playing as
 Ostensibly, the game is based around getting high scores, but notably to 100% complete it, you don't need to be anywhere near good at it, which is a positive if you worry about games ruining your completion percentage
The strategy (and there is a bit of one) of the game revolves around getting to the upper level of the screen, usually by bouncing off of certain objects
 Banana peels are the most common and allow you to keep on the upper levels by bouncing between platforms, but each one you bounce on takes a half-panty off your lifebar
 If you lose all health, you lose control of the dog for a while, usually leading to death
 So the best strategy is to stay up top as long as possible, drop down to refill by flipping up skirts (yes), and then get back up
 It is usually safer up top as well, but not always
The hazards in the game come in two forms, instant death and delayed hazard
 Instant death is pretty normal for these sorts of games, and in this game comes in the form of sewer holes, flying crows (which you can knock out if you hit them from the bottom while spinning), and angry cats
 The delayed hazards come in two forms, chickens and birds
 If you hit a chicken, it won't kill you, but instead a certain amount of time later, it will spawn a horde of them along the bottom, which runs left to right, pauses, then comes back
 The birds are perched up top, and if you hit them, they'll fly behind the screen, then come at you from the right, adjusting to try and hit your level
 Both of these are avoidable initially (just don't touch them), and when they come back, but you are easily screwed by them
The levels do change after a good bit of distance, adding more height, more ways to get up and down the levels, but in essence the game stays the same, with more complexity as you go
 Other than costumes and the achievements, there really is nothing more to the game
In summation, Montaro is a exceptionally cheap endless runner game, not a lot of investment in it, but not a lot of substance
 Enough effort was put into the game that it doesn't feel purely like a joke though, and that is appreciated

 Look at those shiba inus, they keep looking cute all the way
PROS:+ Nice art+ Good music+ A light game for casual occassion+ Provides nice emoticons, nice backgrounds, profitable trading cards, and cute badges+ Uses a simple one keyfig control (left-click mouse)++ Cats+++ Cute++++ Much doge+ Now with interesting achievementsCONS:- Repetitive- No checkpoint- Costumes not including special power or special feature- The price of the game differs in some of country (some say this cheap, some say this a bit pricey)- Schoolgirls wearing same pattern and colors of pantsu

I recommend the game, I do not however recommend buying off steam, buy from denpasoft website and you will get the H scenes, which are missing in the steam version, I bought the steam version and the H scenes have a lot of character development in them and some are completely cut from the steam version, there is also no way to patch it in
 Ultimately by the time I discovered this I had played over the 2 hours that warrant a refund so I had to spend 80$ just to play the full game
 Don't make my mistake just get it from denpasoft

Grisaia no Kajitsu
 It's my favorite visual novel
The interface is great and comfortable, there is a good selection of Extras, like CGI and even Windows soundpacks and even icons
 On a technical standpoint, it's a great game
I may not have many hours on this (Unless a R-18 patch is released, or created by the users) - but I have played it
Now with the story, it has its fair share of funny moments, and its fair share of dramatic moments
as well as those moments that had me on the brink of tears, or just depressed for multiple days
Amane's route is outstanding
 One issue in this version is that you're missing out on the adult content, which is coincidentally a large focus of her route
 Though, there is also a lot of humor and fun in this version without any adult content
 I will not spoil Amane's route at all because it's something that you truly have to experience for yourself
 When I first played through her route, I only got 2 hours of sleep for 2 nights in a row, just because of how interested I was
 It's amazing
 Sachi's route is very good, it's interesting finding out exactly what drives her to act as she does, just make sure that you are ready for the reason
 Try not to get the bad ending for her, though
truly horrifying
 I don't know fully how to put how I feel about her route into words, but I assure you that it's great
 The R-18 content here does not matter as much, I believe- though in general I do believe that not having it is a general issue
Yumiko's route is nice, she's sort of like a tsundere/kuudere mix in personality, and her route is generally good, but not exceptionally remarkable overall
 I enjoyed her route a lot, especially in seeing how she slowly becomes close to you, or Yuuji
 Nearing the end a lot of unexpected things happen, and it is all played out pretty well, but once again, when you compare it to something like Amane's route, it's hard to stand out
 However, I still enjoyed it a lot
I have not yet completed Makina's route, though it is pretty good so far
 Lots of humor, and a lot of dark stuff as well
 Each route has two sides, and they are all generally played out well
 R-18 content here as far as I have gone doesn't matter at all, but I can't say for sure since I have not yet completed it
I have not started Michiru's route, but some people argue that it is the best route in the entire game
 Others argue that Amane's route is the best
 They're generally the two most acclaimed in this game
Overall, there was not a single moment in which I wanted to just get through a certain part to get to the good stuff so to speak
 The entire experience was perfect, from the comedy to the pure horror at some points in time, everything was great
 I do not have a single complaint for this game, but it goes without saying that the R-18 version is the definitive version to get
If you're looking for an outstanding visual novel that will last you over 50 hours of gameplay-(Yes, even with quick reading)look no further than Grisaia no Kajitsu, or "The Fruit of Grisaia"
Posted: 31 May, 2015
I've played the uncensored version of this game, so ill just summarize this version and the uncensored version while giving a honest reviewPros--A deep DEEP storyline involving each girl-Very beautifal CG's and animation quality throughout the entire game-Common route is enjoyable and a fresh slice of life introduction before you make your choices-Lolis (Need I say more)-Tsunderes (Need I say more)-Kuuderes (Need I say more -
-)-Many HNNNNNNG moments throughout each route-Yuuji's wisecracks-Yuuji's philisophical input throughout the game-Lotta sass, LOOOOOOTTA sass-Over 50+ hours worth of content to play, and its so good that you'll replay the routes over again, guarenteed
-Great voice actors-The skip buttonCon--Its censored, so for those of you who are expecting the gratious amount of 18+ content the original version offered (Especially in Amane's route) Forget it
-The common route is LOOOONG, I mean 5-6+ hours alone long if you can stand watching it-Some routes aren't exactly the most realistic of scenarios (COUGH MICHIRU COUGH)-Unless you are a diehard fan of the series, sitting thourghout the monologue that is the common route may reduce you to rubble and dust
Posted: 7 June
Contains all the details you missed from the Anime
 What a great VN
 Lots of paths to choose from, and the writing style that Yuuji had really appealed to me
 If you want to avoid spoilers (if you watched the Anime first) then theres a great guide here, but I played this first so I chose with my heart ;) I can't think of any faults - the OST was also amazing

*I played through all of the game with an offline version of the game*Fruit of Grisaia is a visual NOVEL not a dating sim; you will be reading for hours before you make your first choice and another hour before you make your second choice
 The story is a long and rambling account of a strange guy going to an obscure school of only five weird female students
 Yes the setup is absurd, but Fruit of Grisaia knows it and goes with it
As a novel I have to say how good the writing is since it is often thought provoking and emotionally touching
 The problem is that those good moments are amongst a sea of silly-stupid encounters with those girls
 That sillyness is fine if you like over-the-top Japanese cutesy schtick, but it's incredibly annoying if you don't
 All the girls are to some degree frustrating-annoying with the Micharu girl being way off the scale
 Michiru is so bad she is obnoxious
 Makina is annoying but you later learn about her inner demons and why she is who she is
 In fact, all of the main characters have their backstories developed wonderfully
 Every character has their own genuine motives, wow
Posted: 14 June, 2015
My friends hyped this visual novel to me to the point where it could no longer live up to my expectations
 I was expecting writing up with the likes of Clannad and Little Busters
That being said, it's still very good
 I would say the character routes are, in fact, more intriguing and in-depth than the character routes from aforementioned visual novels by far
First off, this visual novel does not have a true ending
 The story leads somewhere entirely different based on which girl's route you choose
 This is a very character-oriented visual novel
 Second, this visual novel does not have a lot of choice-making
 The choices you have to make are pretty much limited to route branches and good/bad endings
 While this is not a negative thing during the characters' routes, it could possibly have some impact on the very long common route if you are a person who would like to branch off into a character's route as soon as possible, or like to re-read parts of the common route and see what would happen if you made a different choice
Third, the soundtrack is very good
 Some visual novels tend to have a pretty forgettable soundtrack with the exception of a few major tracks (I'm looking at you, Sharin no Kuni, Himawari no Shoujo), but that is not the case with this one
 It's one of those soundtracks where it's easy to hear that it belongs to The Fruit of Grisaia
Fourth and last, the artwork is very pretty
 The backgrounds and the CG are top quality
 Couldn't ask for any improvements on those
 After you complete a girls route you even unlock system voices, icons, and desktop wallpapers related to that character

Review - The Fruit of Grisaia"One of the best visual novels in Steam
 Definitely a great mix of comedy, drama and romance
"
The Fruit of Grisaia is the first of the Grisaia Trilogy
 The Fruit of Grisaia is a visual novel where you take the role of transfer student, Kazami Yuuji as he enters Mihama Academy and hopes for an "ordinary" school life
 As the story progresses, you will come upon the 5 heroines of the novel namely: Sakaki Yumiko, Suou Amane, Komine Sachi, Matsushima Michiru and Irisu Makina
 Each heroine has their own unique story and personality
As said by most players, this is a very long visual novel with a lineup of up to 32 scenes/chapters on the common route alone excluding the around 17+ scenes/chapters for the heroine's actual arc
 The price of the game is well worth it because aside from its very long content, it also features the whole CG Gallery, Scene Replay and Music Collection unlike other Visual Novels in Steam where the CG Gallery and other features are removed from the actual VN
 I finished this Visual Novel by around 50+ hours
 After finishing one of the 5 arcs, you'll also unlock a Secret feature but I'll let you see it for yourself once you get your own copy of The Fruit of Grisaia
I recommend this game to big fans of visual novels
 This ain't for you if you can't stand to read a lot of content because this is really a very long novel
 The content of the novel is very well written and packs quite a lot of humor
 Each chapter/scene, whether its a common route or a heroine's arc, is very much worth every minute of your time
 From the cuteness of Yumiko to Michiru's clumsiness, the novel will give you quite a feel of watching an actual anime episode
 If you're looking for some humor with a mix of drama and feels, this is one of Steam's best Visual Novel available
 If you don't believe me, then see and feel it for yourself
My Personal Rating:Story/Plot: 10/10Music: 10/10Graphics: 9/10Characters: 9/10Overall: 9

Sachi: If it is the fate of the tsundere never to yield in battle for seduction
 If you must overcome the allure of Amane-san's breasts
 I believe only one path lies open for you
 The temptation of the hole
Michiru: 
 The hole
Sachi: Yes, the hole
 To be more precise, I am referring to the female genitalia
Michiru: 
What
 Did you just say
 genitalia
Sachi: Allow me to explain
Sachi: I will construct a heap of sand above your groin to emphasize your current inability to move, then dig a tunnel offering direct access to your genitals
 We shall use this suggestive and convenient "hole" to tempt Kazami-kun
Michiru: 
Uhm
 Sachi
 What
 are you saying
Sachi: The plan has a solid theoretical basis, I assure you
 I read this in a book the other day
Sachi: To conceal a flaw in your security system, it's wise to make an obvious "hole" to draw focus away from the true weak point
 In other words, we attract attention to this hole in order to distract from your undeniably inferior breasts
Michiru: 
What
 are you talking about
 huh
 is it the heat
 has heat gone to your head
Sachi: Please don't say such things
 I'm thinking quite clearly
 Everything is perfectly normal
Michiru: What part of this is normal
10/10 best scriptIn all seriousness though this game is amazing
 I bought all three of vns from kickstarter and now i just bought the digital copy
 You should really buy this, the feels are real and it can get pretty damn funny
Once the 18+ version comes out you should think about getting it
 It adds to the story, manly amanes route imo
btw michiru is best girl"you've got to be blond and have twintails
 otherwise, you won't be recognized as a genuine tsundere
"over all the game is a 10\10

Deep inside the old sarcophagus city, while searching for food, weapons, or resellable scraps, you make an unlikely discovery: What you'd assumed to be an abandoned military facility is actually a pre-war planetarium
 And as it turns out, the custodian robot is still welcoming customers after all these years
Let's talk about planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~
It's a kinetic novel (a visual novel without any choices or other interactive game elements), so the only thing that the player/reader controls is the pace of the story
 Do what you will with that information
Originally developed by Key in 2004 and recently published on Steam by Sekai Project, this is widely considered a classic in the VN community, and a very worthwhile addition to the still meager selection of good visual novels on Steam
 It's a short story about a world full of desolation, hopelessness, cynicism and resignation, and about a little robot girl who's immune to all of it
 It's also about going stargazing in a world without stars
The backgrounds and character sprites in planetarian are somewhat sparse in direct comparison to some of the more visually bombastic VNs out there
 It is however very evocative, and with that it falls in line with the writing
 The whole novel follows a slow pace -- never dragged out, but certainly deliberate
 It leaves plenty of time for you and your own thoughts, and I urge you to take advantage of this invitation
 I ended up with just over three hours of total playtime, which included some breathing room for the fantastic voice acting
Any good visual novel swings in tune with its soundtrack, and planetarian is no exception
 Opening with the music box lullaby "The World of the Stars" it immediately offers you a glimpse of its gentle mood
 Tracks like "Song of Starflight" accentuate the day-to-day interactions of the main characters with a lax and childish air, while the perhaps most iconic song of the roster, "Gentle Jena", cushions some of the more tender scenes in an aura of warmth and belonging (and I would encourage you to keep that last one playing in the background while you read the rest of this review)
Visual novels as a medium don't lend themselves especially well to twitchy action stories, and despite the occasional surprise in that regard, the bulk of planetarian is about its characters and their interactions
 Of the two main characters, only one actually appears on screen, and it would be a fair assessment to say that the story is about her, in several ways
Yumemi (translated as "Reverie" in some localizations) is not the kind of quasi-human A
I
 that we're used to from the likes of Cortana or EDI
 She is a robot programmed for a very straightforward purpose
 She oscillates between toddler-like naiveté at best, and robotic-algorithmic behavior at worst
 So why do you entertain her thoughts of repairing the old projector
 Why do you, a looter perpetually on the verge of starvation, end up tacking another night onto your stay at the old planetarium
This story isn't about what Yumemi is, but about what she represents
Spending valuable time and energy on a planetarium of all things should feel frivolous, yes, downright sacrilegious
 But there is something peculiar inside you, easy to explain away as idle curiosity about the starry night sky that you only know from old people's stories
 Something you probably didn't think you still had
 They say there was a time before the war, before the planet was shrouded by a thick layer of acid clouds, when people were able to look at the stars whenever they wanted
 When there was still a notion of mankind eventually travelling to, and settling on, foreign worlds
Back when people still had hope for the future
Yumemi was left behind at the beginning of the war, and despite not having had any sort of human contact in years, she diligently awaits the day's customers
 There's only one thing she wants out of this existence, one thing she wants to do more than anything else in the world: to show you the stars
The little robot girl, once built for the simple goal of caring for the planetarium's customers, ends up fulfilling a much grander purpose
 Tucked away in her own little corner of a gray world inhabited by people who have forgotten what it means to be human, Yumemi is a shining beacon, a time capsule, a reminder that there is a star-filled sky right behind the acid clouds
 Yumemi is the child, the lamb
 She embodies innocence, childlike wonder, relentless optimism
 Looking into her eyes, you cannot help but feel deeply ashamed for what the world has become
What was it, then, that made you stay at the planetarium
 Was it really just idle curiosity
 Or is there more to this little thought in the back of your head after all
 Do you feel in your stomach what the place emanates
 Does Yumemi give you the strength to dare to form the words, that maybe, just maybe
 there is some hope left in this world
 That there is such a thing as "the future"
You should read planetarian if you have any interest in visual novels, if you haven't experienced a good story in a while, if you like looking up at the stars and wondering what the future holds, or if that little spark deep inside you that is almost drowned by cynicism needs a little bit of nourishment
 Wholeheartedly recommended

It's a nice & sweet short story I've read
 Planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~ is made by the legendary company "Key", well known for creating Angel Beats
, Clannad and Little Busters
 anime series
 This game will guaranteed to touch you with the feels and make you cry
Good points- Fantastic character development & interactions between the two unique characters - The junker guy & Yumemi the gentle robot
- Very well presented that will easily set your mind into the wonderful world of Planetarian
 - Delightful soundtrack & story
 I love the soundtrack especially Gentle Jena, one of my favorite songs
 The melody is so touching and charming
 Listen to this piece & you'll be blown away https://www

v=lR4dw_B423E- Beautiful illustrations
 Yumemi looks pretty adorable & I like how it's suits her personally well

planetarian may be a short story, but it is one that sticks with you in the back of your mind for a very long time
 I still remember when I first finished planetarian years ago
 It is as soul-crushing as it is beautiful, and the impact still holds up against the best of Key's catalogue critically acclaimed visual novels
 Thematically, it shares many ties to Key's most recent game Rewrite, which could be interpreted as an attempt at expanding upon the themes introduced in this game in a grander narrative
 With that in mind, I would definitely recommend the two as complimentary to each other
 If you're perhaps new to visual novels in general, then planetarian is definitely a good place to start
 It demonstrates some of the very best of what visual novels have to offer in a tiny package; a small taste of what you can look forward to in the world of visual novels
 It's also serves as a great appetiser to Key's brand, something to prepare your palate for the main course of Key's much larger games
 I'd recommend this game to anybody who appreciates a good story that touches on some really powerful themes
 It's not for the faint of heart, but once you've managed to overcome the pain it's bound to put you through, you might come out with something you didn't have before

A Kinetic Novel by Key
On Steam
And you're reading reviews instead of insta-purchasing
For shame
Posted: 25 October, 2015
-Finished the game
-Immediately search for Planetarium within the city
-Can't find one
 -Looked up into the night sky
-Saw 2 stars
-Start crying
Thanks Key, not only I can't eat dango and watch baseball without feeling sad
Now I can't even look at the night sky the same way
P
S: Buy this game on Steam if it's 75% off sale, unless you want to support the publisher/developer
The game is only 5 hours long at most, and you can get it much cheaper on Itune store (It seems that not all Itune Store has the English ver, I know for sure that the Canadian Itune store has the English ver)

A VN by 'key' and one of the leading VN developers in the world makes a VN that will make you cry at the end, assuming you actually cry because this is VN are by the same people who made Clannad, Air, Kanon, Little Busters (All great VNs and animes)
 It does show its age (this VN was made 10 years ago) when you play the game and the 'save' function isn't great either, you only get 5 save slots, so you have to overwrite your saves quite a lot
 The story is set in the future after the "failure of the Space Colonization Program"
 It is a post-apocalyptic novel involving only 2 main characters "Mr
 Customer" aka "The Junker" and Yumemi Hoshino aka the robot
 There is no "choose your on route/story" in this VN, its a direct story with no choices
 GraphicsAs you'd expect, this a pretty old VN, so graphics isn't its strong point here
 It has basic drawn images and the animation is limited
 Though the visuals are not the great part, you can still enjoy the VN with what is offers
 Final Score: 5/10StorylineThis is a VN by 'key' we are talking about, of course its going to tell you a great story
 I have never read a VN by 'key' and said "I was disappointed with it"
 All their VNs are nicely told, it often gives you tears, but thats part of the experience
 Expect to cry in every VN that 'key' makes
Final Score: 10/10SoundAnother strong factor here
 The music and soundtracks are possibly the most satisfying thing you will love about this VN, considering that it is over 10 years old
 I still have a hard time trying to figure out how they managed to make all these soundtracks, they are absolutely fantastic, even though half of them where very sad to listen to
 The only downside is that there is only a few of these soundtracks
Final Score: 9/10Gameplay/Features/LayoutThe VN offers simple controls, press "Enter" to read another line, press "Spacebar" to hide the text box etc
nothing complicated there
 The features are also very simple, since the VN is pretty old
 It goes the same with the overall layout
 Here's and great tip, tilt your head left or right in the title screen and be amazedFinal Score: 6/10PriceProbably the most common question when buying anything is "Is it worth buying it
"
 If you like light romance and sad stories
 This is your best bet
 You won't regret your choice, it was made by 'key', so you know it's worth it
 At £7, this is a pretty cheap VN already, considering there are other VNs out there that cost more and has less stuff to offer
 This is definitely worth your time and you shouldn't worry about spending too much on this
 Final Score: 10/10Overall Score : 40/50Percentage Score: 80%

Amanita Design is one of those developers that I love to death, and in their case it's because all of their games are so unrelentingly joyful
 From Samorost's kooky cosmic critters to the pleasant rustbuckets of Machinarium, their games exude pure happiness in the form of upbeat gibberish, uncomplicated puzzles, and positive themes no matter how dark individual moments may get
 Botanicula is another notch in this merry belt, one that has no trouble juggling goofy vignettes with existential threats
Once upon a time there was a very nice tree, full of little bugs and sprouts and assorted critters
 Some spidery thing showed up and started devouring it all with a sort of creeping darkness, and a small band of the aforementioned critters escape with the tree's last seed
 Struggling to stay one step ahead of their monstrous adversary, the critters journey through a colorful arboreal world in search of a new home and a fresh start
What this actually means is you have five little dudes who roam around as a unit, following your clicks from screen to screen and interacting with the many living things of Botanicula's world
 As an adventure game there's very little player input, relatively speaking
 There's only left click (and on occasion mouse proximity has an effect) and only on specific points of interest like critters and items
 You don't move your team directly, but rather click on arrows pointing to different areas
These limitations actually serve to benefit the game, especially as the scope of the gameplay expands
 Botanicula's world is strange and alien, and most of the puzzles wouldn't work at all if they required more exact input
 Instead, you can just click on little creatures to make them fly or yell or burp, and as long as you do it at the right time or in the right order or at all, you can make progress
 The scenes your clicks produce are so funny and heartwarming I doubt anyone will have a problem with relinquishing control for them
 And then later in the game you'll get to pick specific critters on your team to do things, collect items to use in puzzles, and work through a few more nifty gimmicks
The story is another strong point building on these basic mechanics, a remarkable feat given that it is told entirely without dialogue
 The folks at Amanita have mastered the art of storytelling through action and expression and it does tremendous work here
 All of the adorable denizens you meet speak in mumbly Sims-like chatter but get their points across through wild gesticulation and the occasional visual aid
 This hands-off approach both heightens the impact of events (good and bad) when they occur, and also keeps the game feeling lighthearted and silly the rest of the time
 You're also encouraged to experiment with everything you meet, because interacting with new critters earns you collectible cards that can score you extra scenes at the end of the game
You'll experience the world of Botanicula through a mix of vector art and photoshopped works, a finely-blended style that gives everything just enough weight to seem real, without losing its fanciful, dreamlike energy
 The peppy soundtrack follows suit with all sorts of cutely and folksy tunes to keep you engaged
 The artistry on display here is rare and unique, and makes the game feel like a real treasure from its simple beginning to its unexpectedly epic conclusion
 Botanicula makes another excellent entry in Amanita Design's lineup, and an unforgettable title for any fan of point-and-click adventures

Do you like to have fun
Do you enjoy videogames
Do you like wonder, magic and amazement
Botanicula is a work of love, wonder at every screen, laugh at every surprise, sure its not for everyone, but if you believe that modern videogames are the ultimate form of entertainment, then Botanicula will undoubtedly leave you wanting more, few games have heart and even fewer magic
Botanicula has both
Enjoy this "simple" gem for what it is, a true modern masterpiece in every sense, in its simplicity lies its wonder, playing it makes you feel like a child again, full of amazement, full of joy

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Botanicula Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Point & Click; Adventure; Casual; Puzzle My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 4-7 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Novelty seekers; Casual gamers REVIEWBotanicula is an incredibly charming, short-and-sweet game which is frequently described as having a happy identity
It is a point-and-click style, casual adventure game that takes you on a wondrous ride through a microcosmic fantasy world inhabited by bugs and critters
Any fan of point-and-click, adventure-puzzle games will likely enjoy the experience
 The best feature of this game is the overall charm inherent in its delivery
The art style and the soundscape together create the alluring atmosphere of the game
The simple story is told through animations and emotion-filled sounds rather than through text and dialogue
Despite the simple storytelling mechanics, all the characters you play and those you meet are uniquely interesting and charming
The actual gameplay requires you to progress the story by solving puzzles via interaction with the world around you
It will be mostly trial and error; but nothing is too daunting
I felt the puzzles were a good balance of tricky and sensible; but they are not all necessarily logical
You will have to think about the puzzles in terms of the wacky game-world dynamics
 The game is rather short, even shorter if you rush through the main objectives
It is more enjoyable (and still somewhat short) if you take the time to interact with everything and see what you can discover
There are plenty of hidden Easter eggs and collectibles scattered throughout the game to cater to those who enjoy treasure hunts and achievements
Botanicula is definitely a well-designed game that was created with love and care
I recommend that any point-and-click, adventure-puzzle gamer considering trying it
Its charm will cater to fans of the genre both young and old

"MADE IN CZECH REPUBLIC"I can't really help myself, but when there's game that coming from Czech or Slovak Republic, I just want to get them 10/10 and 10/10 only
 Nope, I'm certainly not patriot, but goddamn we can make some great games
 Especially indie ones
 Yes, Arma and Mafia is one thing, but Botanicula oh lord
 Another great example of game that is indie and truly is indie
 I guess you know what indie game is suppose to mean and also you know that some games are "indies" just to cover the lack of quality
Anyway, Botanicula is truly beautiful
 Basically it's for everybody but also not for everybody
 When you check the images, you might say that you'd sit your child in front of that and that's game for children but it's only beacause of visuals, that might give you cartoon atmosphere, or something you've watched when you was 4 years old
 But guess what, that's indie genre dudes
You want to know how awesome Botanicula really is
 Imagine some interactive picture of let's say forest
 You can move your cursor whereever you want, and every object that you can see will act like that cursor is there and behave like it's there
 So the leaves will move in the direction cursor went, small twigs too, nuts, chestnuts or other forest fruit
 Simply said, like you was there
Audio is on whole another level
 It was done just by two guys that goes by name DVA (Bara Kratochvil & Jan Kratochvil) and they just done their work perfectly
 Amanita Designs, small czech independent studio lead by Jakub Dvorsky didn't just made Botanicula, they made their impact with Machinarium and Samorost series
 With their skills, DVA duo and highly highly highly interactive enviroment they have created truly great indie gem
(Demo available - another bonus point)Bonus Point: Czech FeelingRating: 9/10

Delightful surrealist art
 Great use of the element of surprise, adorable humor, cute characters, bright and lively

Botanicula explores themes of nature, cooperation and discovery; awe-inspiring and very charming

Botanicula is a point & click adventure set into a strange microcosmic world
 I got the game during a Steam sale due to the enticing visuals
 And after watching the intro, I got immediately hooked into the storyline
 Amazing that this game was created by such a small development team
 Botanicula will not appeal to everyone, but if you like a creative adventure/puzzle game with a decent plot, this is highly recommended
 An enjoyable experience

A true delight
**Edit update 23
11
2016: Nominated for the 2016 Steam Awards "Game Within A Game" award**Botanicula is an Indie, point-and-click, puzzle adventure; brought to us by the Czech creators of Samorost 1&2 and Machinarium, Amanita Design  if you enjoy either of those games, you will take delight in this
 The thoroughly organic world and its inhabitants are highly imaginative, some even bizarre-looking and -sounding
 Some players may consider it too succinct, or even more attuned toward children
 The simple story, though solid and sweet, does not require heavy ruminations  this is a game of the senses, pure and simple
 You control a group of four friends on a mission to plant a seed
 The main goal on each level progresses you to the next level; the puzzles are intuitive
 The price of the game, whether regular or on sale, is appropriate
 Yes, it is a Flash game
 (Interesting to note that I cannot enjoy tBoI or Windosill on my current PC setup without gameplay becoming bogged down almost instantly; but with Botanicula, never any bogging or catching
) Summed up: the graphics, gameplay, sound and music - all superb, A+++
 What more can I say to get you to try out this lovely gem
There was a tremendous amount of heart put into this game, truly
Botanicula is a visual and (emphasis on) auditory indulgence: you may think you're just going to ease into it, test the waters with your big toe; but you will be swept away and never realise it till the ride comes to its satisfyingly, cyclical conclusion
 It offers a kind of cleansing and respite, whether from the mundane of the outside world, or to just step away from frenetic and adrenaline-packed L4D2 runs
 The sounds are sheer ear candy  you want to touch everything
 The world is strange and wondrous: during first-time gameplay, you never know what manner of creature or environment alteration will manifest itself from your curiosity-driven touching; subsequent gameplays (for myself, anyway) do not fail to continually instill such positive feelings because the graphics, music, creatures and environment (plus their corresponding sounds) are just that sublime
 While there are, sadly, no cards to obtain from playing this game toward earning badges, the 47 in-game, animated cards more than make up for it; and count toward the game's 53 achievements
 It is rewarding to collect them all (and yes, you will aspire to collect each and every one of them in every gameplay you attempt, even the time-spent Svolavac
 (Though, I think there should be a card for the 3 jingle-y leaves that tumble out around your feet - other gamers like myself may know what I'm alluding to
) The names of the creatures achievements are in Czech, and punching them up into Google translate will not only add to your enjoyment, but enlighten it, as well
 The music steals you off from the word go, setting a pace perfectly harmonised to what is happening in the game, at that time
 A previous reviewer here made mention of the burst of cheery song that erupts when you achieve a goal  it really does fill you with sheer happiness, no kidding
 and lately, when playing L4D2, I've been thinking how cool (if a bit bizarre) it would be, hearing that tune after everyone's made it alive to the saferoom
Definitely give it a try, if only to experience the eye and ear candy
 if it doesn't turn out to be your kind of game - or you can only enjoy one gameplay - you will know someone who'll love it
11/10

This game right here is great
 From it's simple story to it's great randomness, there's nothing i would complain about
The art is amazing and the gameplay is awesome and intriguing
 But most of what i loved about this was it's music and the sound effects, just brilliantly put and they even make you feel rewarded when you figure something out or stuff (though everything was pretty easy to figure out)
Posted: 24 June, 2014
Botanicula is now my favorite point-and-click adventure game, because its the only one Ive ever managed to beat without a walkthrough
 Well I lie, I had to use a walkthrough ONE time
 But yeah, its quite easy compared to similar games Ive played, and as a result, I found it much more enjoyable, because I wasnt lost all the time
Its also made in Flash, and shows that Flash games can look and sound really good
 If you like games with unusual art styles, you should check it out
Posted: 30 May
today i will tell you why you should Buy this game
1
 Because its not like rebirth 1 with all of that grinding
2
 Its not like rebirth 2 and with a short story and a hour worth of nep's
3
 Its not like rebirth 3 with the over powered dlc weapons and characters
Megadimension VII offers a whole new way of playing like investment in citys and route building ill explain
investment is 3 different types of ways to spend money to help you inprove your Megadimension life
1
Commerse is, each level you upgrade will enable you to buy more items form the shop
2
industrial is, the items you will be able to develop will increase's3
puplic relations is, the higher the level the better the stuff you get from your country, such as processer units, healing items, other usefull items, and of course the nepquiz and walletcrusher on of the best shows on television
The route building is a much better way of travelling instead on instant teleportation like on the rebirth series
 at first you have to use credits to purchase the route that you want to build too
 and in the route building you can encounter random enemies when travelling, but if you have a new game+ you can disable that, but whats the fun in a quick and easy playthrough
Megadimension VII starts in 1 part of 3 stories, Zero dimension, hyperdimension, heartdimension
with all these storys you would expect this to be a long game, well your right there is about 40-50hours if gameplay in all 3 storys and you will never be bored there is new areas and Finally a better villan, well a few awesome villans
 (not gonna spoil anything) no offence to Arbore, pop-up purple had, arsnore what ever her name was
The 1 bad thing about this game is that if you play this for countless hours, you will love the way the game looks and then when you go back too the rebirth series you feel a bit
 odd
now lets talk about the Gold Third even thought there are 4 members
C-Sha (the Leader): She's more of a glutton than her looks may suggest, and she can't do so much as lift a finger on an empty stomach
 S-Sha:
A young woman who's reserved and seems very cool, but has a considerably aggravated case of chuunibyou
 She has two Dogoo-like monsters who serve under her
 B-Sha: she likes to build robots, collect hero toys and serve as a hero of justice
 However, her phobia of monsters prevents her from doing this job efficiently
 Because of this, she transforms into the mysterious hero known as Presto Mask to give herself confidence
K-Sha: K-Sha is a yandere when it comes to Noire
 She's very protective and cares passionately about her, though in a somewhat romantic way which annoys Noire occasionally
 when holding a gun however, K-Sha's personality changes drastically
 Rather then being shy, she becomes dead serious and will complete her missions without question
 Much like Uni, K-Sha is skilled with guns
Now we go with uzume Tennoboshi: Uzume is the type of girl who is obsessed with being cool so that she comes off as reliable
 Uzume is exceptionally loyal and honest to her friends, Very rarely will you see her relax unless she is around friends
 However, this is a very strong willed facade made to help cope with her position as Zero Dimension's sole remaining CPU
This game has to be one of the best Neptunia Games, because its a 2016 game the graphics are amazing, the new systems inplemented into the game are cool too, and of course new characters, and remodel'ed characters
 its a very facinating game that deserves to be called a Neptunia Game
This game is like 3 games in one
 and deserves to be $39
99 + DLC costs
at first when i bought this, i thought was that you can build a country from the ground up from one of the acheivements that was listed, but thats alright this game was a really good one anyway
 cant wait for future Nep Games, Especially 4GO,Im gonna Rate this a 9
5/10the -
5 is becasue i had to but game in windowed mode for it not to crash suddenly
Overall Best Game 2016

Lets start by saying that this game is funny and worth playing if you like anime rpg; now we can go a bit more into details with pro and cons:pros:-the game still use the same turn based strategy as the other games from the main series, a very fast turn based strategy with movement and positioning;-even bigger cast of cute girl only;-inproved combo system;-new dungeons added to the classic one; -new monsters;-city management system;-a few trick in the plot that i will not spoiler;-very nice CG
cons:-Nepnep trolling can be a bit annoing;-city management is not deep;-new monster and dungeon are few in number;-heavely reuse of the older enties of the series game system
so yeah more or less every entry in the list above explain itself but not the last one, which is why you're still reading
what i mean with reuse of the old game system is exactly that, having played all neptunia games i can totally see that the developer have used the old game asset to create this one: graphic engine, model, textures, some music, ecc
 Now while it can actually be fine since this game is totally anime graphic (meaning it doesn't really grow old), after so many years from the first entry of this series i would have expected at least a graphic improvement
This last point is the only one that really bother me but, even still, this is a very good anime game

In all brutal honesty, I wasn't enthused about making yet another trip to Gamindustri
 Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth was a pleasant surprise due to its colorful cast and amusing storyline
 The second Re;Birth game was a solid improvement
 The third game was even better, but it was also more of the same
 At the time, I thought that this RPG series was long overdue for a fresh take, but I started to worry that it would never happen
 I envisioned that Compile Heart had grown complacent
 They would continue to hammer these Neptunia RPGs out, all with slightly different storylines, five or twenty additional characters, and memes more "dank" than ever thought possible
 With the release of Megadimension Neptunia V2, Compile Heart has put my worries to rest
 This is, without a doubt, the best entry in the series thus far
 The Story and CharactersDespite having "V2" in the title, this entry in the saga has very little in common with "V1" aka Re;Birth 3
 In fact, if you have at least some familiarity with the CPUs and the Candidates, then you could probably approach V2 as its own self-contained story
 Without giving too much away, this game is divided into three separate acts
 Each act focuses on a handful of characters, and their efforts to protect Gamindustri from a mysterious threat
 The storyline is darker than in previous games, but it never becomes overbearing, or gritty just for the sake of it
 The truly serious moments feel earned
 Even accounting for the franchise's penchant for farce, the villains are well-written, and the heroines deal with the problems facing them in a convincing fashion
 Alongside the improved story-telling is a very strong cast
 With Re;Birth 2 and especially 3, CPU Candidate Nepgear went from mediocre to almost unsalvageable
 This is her best role yet
 Big sister Neptune has also improved
 Well, she's still as ridiculous as ever, but at least she's not completely irritating
 Noire, Blanc, Vert, and Uni also have more involved roles in the storyline, which is a huge plus
 As far as new characters go, Uzume is exceptional
 Her story is well thought-out, and her quirks are endearing rather than grating
 The Golden Third represents the "developer" characters that are common in Neptunia games (Cave, Red, Mages, etc)
 Again, I have nothing but praise for them
 Rather than being a mere excuse to include several references and in-jokes, each of these four characters has their own arc
While it would have been nice to see a few characters from the previous Neptunia trilogy make an appearance, I believe that sticking with just the main heroines and the handful of newcomers, was a very wise decision
 There aren't as many meaningless skits, and conversations don't get buried by dozens of people voicing their thoughts at once
 The three-act storyline neatly ties everything together
The GameCompile Heart has made changes to nearly every element of its bread & butter RPG
 The dungeons are slightly larger, house more secrets, and can involve a little platforming
 This provides another incentive for players to jump around, aside from the stat-boosting challenges and the ability to loudly exclaim "I'm a kangaroo
" The structure of this game has also undergone a massive overhaul
 In the previous games, it was easy to unlock optional dungeons, defeat the side-bosses, and enter a cycle of constant level-ups that removed any semblance of challenge from the main story
 There's still more than enough side-content in V2, but unless you're really determined, you won't reach a "kill-all-bosses-in-one-hit" level of experience
 At least until new game+
The remake system has been removed from Gamindustri
 While you can still gather monster materials to craft some items or enhance gear, you won't need gamefaqs the entire time you're playing
 Most gear acquisitions are handled the old fashioned way; via store purchases, or finding them in dungeons
 Other unlockables, like the "cheat" abilities (higher jump, faster run speed, etc) are discovered simply by playing through the game
 Furthermore, by employing scouts, you can discover additional treasures and new dungeons
 So, if you disliked Stella as much as any normal person, you'll be happy to know that she was kicked to the curb
 While these changes might disappoint some Re;Birth fans, overall they improve the pacing and atmosphere
 Your play-through of the game isn't under constant risk of being halted, just so you can look up how to find a "old dragon ball", an "old dragon horn", or the all-important "old dragon's 
" However, some of the other changes & additions are a little undercooked
 The overworld no longer functions as a "click on the location to instantly travel" map
 Now you have to selection your destination, and the protagonist will run to wherever that is
 The reason I don't like this setup is because there are random encounters
 While they aren't too annoying, I really have to wonder why they exist
 Random encounters can be turned off after beating the game
 This is equal parts welcome and perplexing
 A number of other unlockables such as scouts, clothes, and weapon modifications are awarded by investing in all of the major lands (Planeptune, Lastation, etc)
 It's a neat idea, but you're liable to spend most of the game dirt-poor
 In fact, by the time you have the opportunity to do any serious investing, your first play-through is about to end
The battle system has also undergone some slight modifications
 The EXE meter resets after every battle, and overall isn't nearly the "win" button it was in the past
 To balance this out, all of the playable characters have recieved more moves and abilities
 The combo system has also been revamped
 Certain combination attacks can result in longer waits, which effects the heroine's turn order
 Combo attacks can also do more damage if certain conditions are satisfied (such as performing a rush attack just before a power attack)
 The differences aren't dramatic, but if you're attempting to play through the game at low levels of experience, they can be pretty important
 Positioning is also more tactical than ever, since enemies (and playable characters
) take more damage, when attacked from the sides or back
While this game is harder than its predecessors, most of the challenge is going to come from early on
 The first half of the game is spent with less than four party-members
 These limitations alongside a lack of primo grinding points make for a decently balanced level of difficulty
 Once you recruit everyone, the battles devolve into the typical attack/special move/sometimes heal doldrums that plague most RPGs
 Still, it's nice while it lasts, and players can opt out of carrying over their experience levels and equipment in new game+
 In ConclusionWith Megadimension Neptunia V2, Compile Heart has proven that they aren't averse to taking risks with an established series
 Taking these risks not only requires a lot of confidence in the game-designers, but also the writers
 Yes, there are still times where Neptune acts the fool, or Vert jokes about Blanc's lack of "plot" development
 These moments are what keep the adventure grounded
 More importantly, the writing goes above and beyond to give everyone a purpose beyond the cheap laughs, and this leads to a more compelling story
 While I've enjoyed all of the previous Neptunia games, V2 is a necessary evolution
 The improvements to both the combat systems and exploration help round out this superb RPG

Thank you,Person soon to be living under a bridge
Posted: 29 June
43 hours for a single playthrough
60 hours for two playthroughs
108
3 hours for all achievements
And I would play through this game again and again
The story and characters are the main selling points while the combat becomes secondary (still really good though)
 Oh yeah, the soundtrack is amazing aswell
I could go on but i'm too lazy

I think Megadimension Neptunia V-II marks something of a watershed moment for the Neptunia series in that it's no longer "good, but
[insert caveat of your choice here]", it's just plain good
 Actually, great, even
Finishing my first playthrough of the game took me roughly 55 hours; that was taking it fairly leisurely, unlocking this and that that wasn't absolutely necessary for the first playthrough and goofing around now and then
 After that, there's still the "true" ending, which leads to a post-game segments during which you can clean up any bits and pieces you didn't finish off first time around - Or trophy hunt
 Well, at first, I want to say that I think this is Compile Heart's finest work to date
 While there are some technical issues regarding frame drops in a few places, most of them are not really all that significant
 Ignoring some typos, the script and translation are both excellent, the gameplay is enjoyable, smooth and well-balanced
 The first and last points there adress two of the biggest criticism the Neptunia series has had ever since its release - technical issues regarding atrocious framerates that weren't really justifiable for the kind of game they were, and balancing issues regarding inconsistent or just way too easy difficulty
 MegaNep counters both of these problems: It runs at pretty consistent 60fps pretty much all of the time, only dropping in particularly busy scenes, and has a very well-paced progression with no point in the game that felt too easy or too difficult
 The revamped game systems work extremly well: Skills feel neither under- nor overpowered, characters feel unique and pretty much any party combination can work perfectly fine
Now, narrative and characterisation has never been an issue for the Neptunia series, but, pleasingly, MegaNep even improves this, making up a story that is spectaclar, dramatic and even emotional at some points in the end
 Additionally, it keeps the humorful atmosphere, with Neptune being the goofy, likeable, forth-wall-breaking protagonist that we all know and love
 In other words, it's not just a great Neptunia game - It's a great RPG, period
 The only thing that saddens me is the fact that so many people will write it off without even giving it a shot for themselves; still, I guess that makes it all the more special for those of us in the know who can enjoy and appreciate it, both on its own merits and as, to date, the absolute pinnacle of the series

BEST NEPTUNIA GAME EVER
I have owned the previous games, Nep1, 2 and 3
And I must say this version is x10 better because: (NO SPOILERS)1- Alot of new features2- Actually has a story, and not just about puddings
 3- Lots of new maps, and maps got bigger
4- Less recycling
5- New characters with fun personalities
6- Better artwork7- x10 Better music
 8- More BOOBIES
 Bigger and bouncier than before, too
Buy it in a heartbeat
 Amazing
Recommend
 10/10TIP: Buy all the DLCs except the ones which give armor or weapons, because those will take the fun out of the game
 Maybe buy them when you reach end game
 I love the new characters

IM A SIMPLE MANI SEE BOOBI THROW MY MONEY

I'm not sure what prompted me to get HNR;B1
 Yes I play Japanese videogames, yes I watch a little Annie May, and hell I even listen to Hatsune Miku
 However, I'll be deep-fried in damnation before I tolerate uguu moeblobs crying over baka oniichan and the lack of senpai-noticing
 That's not what this game is about though
 The art might give you that impression, and there is some fan-service, but I dare say the best qualities about HN are the characters and writing
HN is broken up into 8 chapters
 Typically there's plot, then shopping, more dialogue, random people handing you "plans", dungeons (both forced & optional), and then more plot
 It's a standard setup and if you know what you're doing and/or skipping dialogue this game can be quite short
 I wouldn't recommend it though, because the actual game portions aren't the greatest
 From what I've read, this edition of HN is a massive improvement over the original in terms of exploration and combat
 This must mean the first version was really dire
Getting around is handled via a map-screen, with dungeons representing the only "on-foot" portions
 While the dungeons include various niceties like no random encounters, the lay-outs tend to repeat quite often
 We're talking the exact same lay-out, and the enemies that populate them tend to be the same creatures you already fought, except stronger
 There's no other way to say it, the dungeons in this game are weak
 At least they're short, and they aren't bogged down by elevators, lots of stairs, and mind-numbing puzzles
The combat fares a bit better
 It's turn-based and over-time you develop combos
 There are three types: rush for building EXE meter (super moves), power for straight damage, and break for taking down shields
 There are a variety of other skills like healing, buffs, and so on
 The roster of playable characters eventually blossoms to over a dozen as well
 It sounds like a lot to take in, but for the most part this is not a difficult RPG
 There's very little strategy aside from "use a lot of super moves" and the ever-important "heal when you're low on HP"
 If you're getting slapped to heck and back, it's probably because your level isn't high enough
 Late-game grinding isn't really a hassle either
 A lot of optional super-enemies drop enough exp to level multiple times in a single battle
 I suppose the level of difficulty can vary greatly, depending on how much leveling you do
 Some players might find more entertainment in avoiding optional fights, so that every regular encounter is hard-fought
 Eventually though you're going to become OP, you can't resist it
Most of the grind in this game is in finding all of the materials
 Those plans I mentioned earlier add things to the game
 New equipment, new abilities, more dungeons, and so on
 They require materials stripped from the cold dead flesh of the monsters that you kill
 This is best tackled with a guide
 The in-game "Nepedia" is nice, but it pales in comparison to a guide from good ol' gamefaqs and the always handy CTRL-F
 Materials (along with corpses) can also be turned in for quest rewards (if applicable)
 Quests are interesting in that completing them can raise & lower shares
 The gals of HN are always talking about shares and their importance in the console war
 This never really becomes a factor until 1) the ending and 2) the acquisition of hidden characters
 It's something to keep in mind
 I guess I should mention that aside from the ridiculous "millionaire" achievement, HNR;B1 isn't bad if you're a completionist
 Doing everything (aside from some DLC) in the game took me less than 30 hours
 I have played through the Vita game as well
 That first play-through took about 30-35
 If you don't skip cut-scenes, the length is more than reasonable
Notice the lack of character discussion in this review
 Yeah, I'm not going to spoil the best aspect of the game
 The cast of Neptunia is great, and the voice-acting (both ENG & JPN) is very well-done
 I mean okay yeah, it's cute girls, some of whom transform into something exceptionally form-fitting, but the dialogue is rarely dull
 Aside from a couple (expected) interactions, the cast doesn't get too hung up on the standard Annie May tropes either
 Call me shallow, but I also got a kick out of all of the videogame references
 The most amusing one to me is Neptunia herself
 The other goddesses are Leanbox, Lastation, and Lowee
 Since the plot of this game involves a console war, you can guess what those names refer to
 So what's the deal with Neptunia
 Back in the mid 90s, Sega was planning a console that combined the Genesis & the 32X
 It was called Neptune
 Honestly, I can't think of a better system that represents Nep-Nep, she is quite a random character
So yeah, I recommend HNR;B1
 As far as J-RPGs go it's not particularly great, but it has so much charm I can overlook its faults
 Also, it's appropriately-paced and the port isn't too bad (although I had to switch to XP compatibility due to constant after-battle crashes)
 Don't write this game off simply because you visited the community hub and saw a few questionable images

tl;dr: An extremely basic and grindy RPG with cute characters, funny dialogue, impressive English dub, and a pretty depth lore
 Give this one a go if you're very patient and have a few days to burn
 Gameplay: The Gameplay is a turn-based system where you and your enemies take turns beating each other up and magical or physical attacks, sometimes both at the same time
 The higher your combo, the more abilities you can use
 There's a shop in every city that's indentical (The shop that is) and sells gear for your Party Members
 There's also plans, which are basically upgrades you can get which will change the game or different characters, but you need materials for said plans
 To get plans you have to visit through dungeons and collect loot, kill enemies, and explore
 There's roughly 7 or so dungeons that are all very different, but they get copy-pasted for roughly 40 or something dungeons
 Same with enemies, so it can get repetitive very quickly
 Some Dungeons such as the Snow-related ones are also too big and don't have enough enemies
 Plus, lots of treasure can go un-noticed due to the painful amounts of white everywhere
 Characters: The characters in Neptunia are so good and likeable that there's even fans who pretend to be them, kinda odd, but kinda charming in it's own unique way
 The Characters themselves are also charming, it's very silly with dialogue
 You don't get to pick who you send out to talk, or the words which they say
 Instead you're pretty much just watching them talk to each other, sometimes with voice to go along, other times just text
 To move on to the next text box, you need to press Enter on your Keyboard
 I found myself pressing Space by accident and ended up skipping tons of important dialogue, the skip is just so fast that it literally skips all of it within just 2 seconds
 Kinda annoying, but it's a habbit that you can break easily
Dungeons: The Dungeons are the classic turn-based RPG game, they look really pretty and large, but only a small portion is where you can play
 Enemies are randomly strewn about in the dungeon, who will sometimes follow you and attempt to take you down, or you can sneak up on them and get the first-turn of combat, which is very useful against those stronger boss-like enemies
 As I noted earlier, the dungeons are very limited and are copy-pasted a ton throughout the game, same with the enemies who are just retextured with different colours
 The enemiy choice for some of the Dungeons make no sense
 Like, a flower in a dystopia Tron-setting

As someone who played this game to platinum three times on the Vita (thanks, stacking region trophy lists
), I find it to be the best Neptunia released in the West yet
 The gameplay is simple to grasp and fun to play and the script is the best yet with quite a few funny moments, which is a huge step up from the very first game's cringe-worthy reference overdosing every few seconds
 The English dub is also very good
Just one note: the cutscene portraits weren't scaled up, which is quite noticeable during cutscenes, particularly against the much crisper backgrounds
 It's not a dealbreaker, but it may bother some people

Don't waste your time

Let's start with a note: Neptunia saga is not for all, that's a fact
As far as you can try if you don't like these "breaking the fourth wall", other games references and the fact the characters (at least the main ones) are girls you are not going to enjoy it
Now let's talk about the game:HDNRB1 is not just a remake of HDN, infact much is changed between story and mechanics
The game is a quite hard JRPG, at least at the begin, sadly later you will probably going to spam these EXE (super like moves) destroying everything in your path but still the game gives out quite a challenge
There's not actuall grinding like other JRPGs but still you can't go around ignoring enemies or you'll be in trouble against these End chapter bosses
Graphically the game is not that bad but not everyone like the "anime style"
Musics are good even if not that many
Dungeons are
 well there's many dungeons but not many types, you will find yourself unlocking many dungeons sure but in the same times many of them are just the same one with some differences and nothing more, same for the enemies, so be aware, if you want to see differences at every corner you are not going to like it
As port is not perfect but still this is the very first port made by IFI and, in my opinion, they made a good job in the end
Should you buy it then
 Yes, you should
Still, like i've said at the begin, this game is not for everyone but who knows, you may find yourself having more fun than you think

Lighthearted & self-aware // Recommended for JRPG gamers*A controller/gamepad is highly recommended for this title+ Dialogue is rife with self-aware humor and myriad cheeky references+ Gameplay is solid and straightforward+ Can create battle advantages by sneaking up on and hitting enemies first; pre-emptive strikes can pay dividends+ 'Order of Action' bar helps to plan turns in advance; injects a bit of strategy into the gameplay+ Multiple endings offer a fair amount of replay incentive+ Voice-acting, both English and Japanese, is competent and well-implemented (there are some issues with mouth syncronization, however)+ Detailed character models and applaudable attack animations+ Excellent soundtrack; fits the game like a glove and is often quite catchy+ Character customization is a refined facet of the game, and this offers many opportunities in regards to character performances in battle+ Offers a plethora of items and gear that does wonders to allow the player freedom of choice in combat- Visuals are underwhelming to say the least; textures, in particular, seem overly dated, likely as a result of the game being a port from the PS Vita- Camera is a bit restrictive and often feels clunky, particularly when traversing dungeons- Battles quickly become very reptitive; the player soon falls into a routine, following a formula that takes one down the path of least resistance- Quite a bit of grinding required at certain points in the narrativeLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit

Certainly one of the better Hyperdimension games this series has great potential it still hasn't quite lived up to
 still as is - a great JRPG Experience
 This first installment feels
 shorter than the game its remaking but that may have less to do with the game and my own experence with Victory knowing exactly what to do
As a remake it takes the entire combat system from the first game and chucks it in a bin, replacing it with the more enjoyable combat system seen in later installements
For those not familiar the combat system usually involves a party of three(Four in later games) being placed inside a circular area - characters are able to move freely and you're encouraged to keep them spaced apart as enemies can and will hit multiple targets cluster together - and you're free to do the same
 A usual array of special attacks, skills and ultimates are there to fill the standard kit - however your normal attacks are broken up into "Combos" which can be fiddled with and swapped around to your liking
Neptunia also keeps its notable game references and forth wall breaking humor
 I personally enjoy the campness of the story and chracters, its what kept me with the franchise so far
 Its lighthearded tone and utter refusal to take itself - or indeed anything else seriously is closer to a breath of freash air than most of the dower affairs I've seen on the release list lately
Take it as a bit of unchallening junk food - like the JRPG equivelent of Dynasty Warriors
-Port Report-The ports is
 okay
 I supposeIts a Vita Port so its not the least bit demanding - The astetic carries it fineResolution Caps at 1600x900
 Er
 okay - its not 1920x1080 but I'll take it
Locked at 60FPS - (some cutscenes are at 30
)It is a turn based game so maybe that doesn't matter so much
Rebindable Keys and Gamepad Support
 YES
Doesn't use the buttons its dispaying - you should play around with the settings - but it plays fine with a gamepad
Mouse Control in the Menus
 YES
I'd say B+ on the port
 Cerainly seen worse handheld ports

I enjoyed Costume Quest quite a bit, until I reached a game-breaking bug, two hours in
 More on that in a bit
Costume Quest is a streamlined RPG
 It's a fun game, but not particularly difficult
 The combat is a simplistic timing game, and the quests have a way of fulfilling themselves as you wander around the map
 But that's OK, because Costume Quest doesn't present itself as a serious RPG
I's a breezy, light RPG with a sense of humor, that begs to be played straight through in a sitting
 Truely, it's an RPG/Platformer hybrid, in that there are environmental puzzles that must be worked out to advance the map and the story
 It's a mix that works
until you come to the Autumn Haven shopping mall
 There's a game-breaking bug in the camping equipment store: If you walk between the sleeping bag and the tent, your companion will follow you into that wedge, and block you in
 None of your special skills will get you out of this position
 If this happens to you, don't exit to the menu
 Crash the game manually, so it doesn't have a chance to autosave your position
 If it saves your position, you'll be stuck there when you start again, and you'll have to start over from the beginning of the game
 Seriously
 Check the Steam forums, I'm not the only one with this problem
So, yes
 I like Costume Quest, and I think you will, too
 I want to complete this game, but I don't want to replay the first two hours again
 I give Costume Quest a thumbs up, but be careful in the mall so you don't lose your game like I did

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Costume Quest Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: RPG; Casual; Adventure; Lighthearted
My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-10 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Casual gamersREVIEWCostume Quest has a lot of good things going on for it
The game takes you on a journey of the imagination as some childrens quest for candy on one Halloween night quickly turns into something much more
Ultimately, this game is just very well done and has a soul that should easily appeal to a vast audience
The level design is charming and exploring the maps is fun
The whole concept of trick-or-treating being a fundamental part of the gameplay is brilliantly done
The story is basically one giant trope, but the way it is told is delightful
The characters are likeable and the humor is clean but entertaining
Even the style in which you warp into old-school, turn-based battles is executed well and synergizes perfectly with the atmosphere of the game
This game is a quintessential example of how several good things can work together to create something great
As I alluded to, one of the most charming aspects of Costume Quest is the way trick-or-treating in the game world is a central part of progressing the game
You knock on doors and are either given candy (treat) or have to fight a battle (trick)
This leads to another splendidly charming feature of the game, which I also alluded to earlier: the battle warp-ins
Depending on what costumes your characters are wearing, they change from little kids into various gallant warriors with nothing but the power of their imagination
From there, the battles play out in the old-school, turn-based RPG style that was prevalent in the 90s
Aside from that, you may also want to explore the levels, find secret areas, meet characters, and do side-quests and mini-games to gather more candy and collect the trading cards
There is plenty to do
Costume Quest is a charming little game that makes for quite an enjoyable experience
As I said, I feel it can appeal to a wide audience
I would posit: if it sounds like the type of game you may enjoy, it will probably be a specific game you do enjoy if you decide to get it

Really cute and fun little game
 Its pretty short as rpg, but youll have a fun time playing it
 Its simple and pretty easy
 You play as the kids, form your party and collect candies and costume parts made of cardborad
 When the fight starts youre being transformed into your costumes (robot, ninja, knight etc
) and the fight begins
 Fight system is generic turn based rpg system but it doesnt need to be different
 Seriously go and buy it, its really really good game i promise you will fall in love with this little cute gem :)

In short, is the game good
Yes, the game is really good
Is it worth my time and money
Depends
 While the game is very fun to play, it is kind of short
 You can breeze through the main game in about 4 hours
 The add-on story is about 2 hours
 I'd suggest waiting for at least a small price drop or sale
Is this game for anyone
Yes
 The game doesn't require any specific gaming skills and can be enjoyed by anyone
Linear, open-world or something else
While the world of Costume Quest is technically open-world (that is, you are not restricted to a "rail", moving from A to B), the world itself is so small, it still forces the player to simply move on when the player finishes up quests in the area
Gameplay mechanics, gimmicks
It's basically Halloween meets Final Fantasy meets Persona meets Super Mario RPG meets Tim Schafer
 It sounds weird on paper but it works
 When in battle, your Halloween costume changes into the real thing (i
e
 a cardboard robot costume changes into a real giant mecha)
 Additionally, each costume grants the person wearing it special attacks
 Battles are turn-based, which are usually pretty slow-paced, but thanks to pretty good animation design, attack animations are fast, fluid, and don't leave the player bored while waiting for the enemy attacks to end
Graphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design
Even though the world in Costume Quest is pretty small, it is crafted with much attention to detail
 The cartoony look only adds charm to the whole aesthetic
Audio design and soundtrack
Audio design is impressive
 The soundtrack consists of generic Halloween-ish songs but with a few twists
 Sometimes the music will actually take a sinister turn, bringing forth really creepy humming, drones, etc
 A nice touch that hits the player off-guard
Plot, story
Brother and sister go trick-or-treating
 One of them gets kidnapped
 Sounds generic
 It isn't - that's all I can say without spoilers
How does the game run
Runs perfectly fine on my 5 year old PC (Dual-Core 2
66GHz, GeForce 9600GT, 2GB RAM)
 No stuttering, no framerate issues, everything turned on except for SSAO (which is known to be a resource hog on older machines)
Any details, character, motif, etc
 you particularly liked
The costumes in battle form and their special attacks
 No other game will let you have a yeti, a giant black cat and the Statue of Liberty as your party
 Anything you didn't like
Yes, a few things
 The music in the add-on story is of lower quality for some reason
 The Battle Stamp system could be a bit more complex
 Finally, the static camera can be annoying at times (especially in the early part of the game where you're navigating through suburbs)
 Final score
I give Costume Quest a coffin with candy in it out of 5
 
Posted: 25 September, 2014
Costume Quest is a cute, creative, charming, simple to play, easy to master RPG set in Halloween
 There is definitely a sense of atmosphere that is set with the colors, lighting and art style
 You'll wander through a neighborhood, a mall and a carnival
 Everything is beautiful and charming with a slight spooky edge to some places, but its a charming spooky not a horrific kind
 After you select a gender, you are quickly thrown into the story
 Your sibling has been kidnapped by goblins that need candy and since the sibling is wearing a giant candy corn costume you understand how mistakes can be made
Speaking of candy, you'll find it everywhere, because its the currency of the game
 In the map there is an attack button to knock candy out of objects
 You'll find candy after battles, in treasure coffins, completing quests and you'll trick-or-treat for it going door to door
 Of course there's not always a stranger giving candy, sometimes it a goblin that results in a battle
In battles, you're not just kids in costumes, you become giants
 Your little cardboard robot costume turns into a towering robot, a french-fry costume becomes a mega fry crab, a statue of liberty costume becomes the statue of liberty
 So its a little pretend, and thankfully the game lets you skip transformation animations to start each battle
The combat is really simple and very well animated
 First your entire team completes a turn, from the leader of the party to the last member
 Then the enemies will each take a turn
 You have a limited selection of what to do, attack or a special power every 3 turns
 Different costumes have different basic attacks, each with its own way of getting a critical hit
 Timing, to press a button or key at a specific moment, others have you wiggling the analog stick, others have you button mashing the same button or key
 It keeps you watching the battles and make the long animations feel like less tedious to watch
 The special skills range from damaging all enemies, healing all allies, majorly damaging one enemy, hiding an ally and other things depending which costume you're wearing
When the enemies attack, you'll be given a chance to lessen the attack with a quick button press
 These button presses are different each time, which is nice, but I feel like even timed correctly, there's still a chance the block won't be successful
 Some enemies really telegraph their attacks, such as jumping into the air with a strike
 Enemies don't just attack, they'll cast heal, shield, strength and fire
 Everything you've seen in RPGs before, but this is just simple
The enemies don't have too much variety, goblins, big goblins and ravens, but each 'race' can have a 'class
' The graphics look great and they are in full 3D, its just there aren't that many of them
 Each enemy has a level, which is good, but early on in the game enemies feel far too overpowered when you have a party of 2 characters
 You'll never have a party more than 3, but neither will the enemy party
When you are on the map, you can see enemies march around, so there really aren't any random battles other than the trick-or-treat battles
 You can even sneak up behind map enemies and attack them so when the battle begins, all enemies take a small amount of damage
 Its a nice feature in what can be tedious, thoughtless battles
 Every battle seems to play out the same no matter what enemy classes you face
 You just need to time everything correctly and sit through your special ability animations
You can also buy stamps that you can equip to each of your characters that will give them added benefits such as dodging, more HP, regenerating HP, counter attacks, higher attack damage, higher critical damage, a stun skill, the ability to poison a foe or damage all foes next to the target
 These simple stamps do a lot to really personalize the game and I feel like you need the stamps to succeed in the game
When party members fall in battle, they're back after the battle
 Everyone gets full health after every battle
 In fact, when your party gets wiped out
 You just respawn back on the map next to the enemy that killed you
 There is no consequence for failure in the game and I feel the game is smoother because of it
Every battle gives you experience points, but so does completing quests
 Since the enemies are limited, so is the experience
 So that's why I had to turn to stamps in order to win battles and even then a lot of battles seemed like only luck got me through the first two hours of battles
 There is also a level cap on your party and you don't level up individual characters, but rather the entire party
On the map you'll talk with NPCs and read their little text boxes
 The town, mall, carnival and village feel alive
 There are plenty of NPCs to give you quests, such as find this or do that
 Other costumed kids want non usable items that you'll find from winning battles and some quests have you finding kids that are playing hide and seek
 There is even a well done apple bobbing minigame where red apples count as one point to your score and green apples count as 3 points
 Its a nice deviation from goblin slaying monotony
Every costume doesn't just have its own special and basic attack, most of them have a practical use on maps
 As a robot, you can speed around on your rocket skates to jump off ramps
 These rocket skates are the game's run and its so much faster than just walking
 The ninja costume can vanish, the fries costume baits people into following you, the knight has a shield to protect you from things overhead and other costumes help too
 There is a big variety of costumes and you can find pieces to make new costumes
 It adds to the game variety, even if I ended up using the robot for the skates and the statue of liberty for her healing power
In all this is a 5 or 6 hour game that is easy to play and easy to finish after the first two hours
 There is even DLC that keeps the game going in a different setting
 If it wasn't for the cute charm and the extras like costumes and stamps, I'm not sure I could recommend it because of how dull and mindless the fights became

Excellent trick ot treating play style
 Cartoony and light hearted but very challenging

Yet again Double Fine surprises me and yet again they manage to make another rather unique and great game
 Costume Quest puts you in the role of a young boy who's trying to save his little sister from monsters that invaded their neighborhood on Halloween
 You find friends along the way and unlock and craft new costumes
 Each costume grants you with a different ability and diferent abilities to use in combat
 The combat in Costume Quest it's turn based, very similar to the way Final Fantasy games handle
 There's also some perks which you can buy with candy that grant you certain passive abilities such as extra damage or health points recovery after each turn
 You'll probably spend alot of your time going around the place smashing stuff and the more fun, knocking on people's doors (Trick or Treat) and sometimes you'll get candies from the people that live on those houses and sometimes a monster will open the door for you and you'll jump into combat, that's pretty much how you collect candy which is used as a currency in Costume Quest
 Visually, I think the game looks pretty neat, a rather unique cartoony looking which I really like, I also found the monster design to be rather funny
 Other than that, the game has no voice acting, it's all text based and the story is certainly entertaining
 In the end, Costume Quest was made by Double Fine and that alone puts it up on a great position, per say
 You'll definitely get both your time and money worth on this
 Just one last thing, the Steam version of Costume Quest also includes the DLC Grubbins on Ice which takes place, and continues, the plot of the base game
Posted: 21 May, 2015
Costume Quest is a simple but well put together party based RPG game
 You play the role of a child who is obsessed with halloween, and spends the night going around the neighborhood trick or treating to get his candy
 At the beginning of the game, your twin sister is kidnapped and you embark on your journey to rescue her
 Along the way you make friends with other trick or treaters who join your party
 While you are walking around the world, you are able to pick up extra candy, talk to the residents of the town and start battles with the bad guys
 The combat system in Costume Quest is turn based, each of your characters will have their own costume which all have different powers
 The combat is also primarily quick time events, which is normally not something I am a fan of, but it works quite well here
 The graphics are nothing special, but they do look pleasing and the cartoon style is something which fits the story and setting nicely
 Sadly the audio in Costume Quest lets it down, there isn't any voice acting, and very little sound effects when you are walking around the world
The game is set across four different levels, each of them has their own theme and style, with lots of different items and hidden locations to find in each of the levels, they feel plumped out and interesting to explore
 I didn't find there to be any difficulty, you can complete the game without being beaten once, so maybe a New Game+ mode would of fixed that
 I'm not sure why Steam has counted me having sixteen hours, as the game took me about five hours to complete along with the majority of all the side missions and achievements
 I only really ran into one technical issue, and that was frame rate, the Steam in game counter shows it running at 30 fps while walking around the world, while in the combat phases, this jumps up to 60 fps
 I noticed some screen tearing with v-sync off, but this also may be an issue with my rig (I don't think it is considering the specs I run), but it was nothing major
 I can recommend Costume Quest, because I had a really good time playing, and it has a different take on the party based games, and for the full price of £6,99, you can't go wrong with the amount of content that is included
 If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up

In the glorious words of the immortal Ernest P
 Worrell I bring you these words of advice
 "Pretty soon the kids won't have to worry about eating their Brussel sprouts because the Brussel sprouts will be eating them
"Exchange the word Brussel sprouts with candy corn and you'll understand the game of Costume quest, a cute Halloween themed adventure game from the wonderful team at Double Fine entertainment
The same group responsible for such classics as Psychonauts and Brutal Legend (Jack Black playing a rock and roll roadie
 YES PLEASE)
In this game you play as Reynold and Wren a pair of twins who have recently moved to a new neighborhood, it's Halloween night and they are planning on going trick or treating
After selecting which sibling you want to control, either Wren, the 10 minute older sister or Reynold the 10 pound heavier member of the dynamite duo, you are shipped off into the world
The selected sibling gets a Robot custom, the other gets dressed as a piece of Candy Corn
Social norms be damned if you pick the female character
who says females aren't into Robots :-D
certainly not me
(It was here where the first bit of disbelief struck me, the parents allowed their twin children to leave the house unaccompanied to go trick or treating in a new neighborhood
These are two children who appear to be 8 - 9 years old, wandering the streets of a new neighborhood on Halloween night which is a night when child predators are normally tremendously on the prowl looking for victims
Furthermore, after the sibling you didn't pick gets literally kidnapped, instead of running home, or screaming for help
or literally anything we've been teaching children to do for the last 30 years, they decide to go on a crazy adventure to find the sister to avoid punishment
Just a quick note, a police officer is literally a twenty or thirty feet away away from the abduction site
)
soap box offAfter trick or treating at the first house, the pair try a second, only this time the candy corn gets abducted by a candy stealing grubbin monster
OH MY
So off we go on an adventure to rescue our sister/brother from the clutches of a nasty candy stealing evil corporation, I'm talking a really dirty nasty organization we haven't seen in video games since Umbrella corporation
Along the way to rescue your sibling you meet new friends, discover a sinister plot to steal candy, and defeat some monsters making for an amazing Halloween adventure which can be enjoyed at any time of year
 The Story I pretty much described the story above, siblings, candy, stealing, adventure
The story takes place in three locations, Auburn Pines, which is the starting neighborhood, Autumn Haven Mall (easy enough it's a Mall), and Fall Valley carnival, each area offers up the chance to explore, trick or treat, bob for candy apples, defeat monsters and oh yeah
 get that sweet, sweet candy baby
 nuff said
 The Gameplay The first aspect the gamer is introduced to is trick or treating, which is just as it sounds, you go up to a house, knock on the door and wait for a trick (battle) or a trick (candy)
It's as simplistic as that
Knocking on doors isn't the only way to collect candy, numerous interactive objects in the environment such as mailboxes, trashcans, shrubs, etc etc etc, can be pounded on by your candy pail in an attempt to wriggle loose a few extra pieces of candy, also numerous areas have candy thrown about on the ground
I personally wouldn't pick up candy off the ground and eat it, but hey whatever floats my characters boat
The game features three types of collectibles, the first is Costumes, you start with the Robot costume, and soon after acquire a knight outfit, others you can collect are the statue of liberty, a unicorn, french fries and many more
Many of the costumes have two special benefits, the first being an extra ability you can use while out of combat, like the Robot which can travel faster, or the Knight, that can shield from falling items
The second ability is a special battle ability, whether it's rockets, a shield of protection or a powerful group heal
The second type of collectible in the game are battle cards, these cards can be used to further enhance your character, give them additional HP, defense, a stun, etc etc etc, you can buy the cards from Sadie using the candy you collect during your adventure
With each new area, additional cards are added for you to buy, the new cards offer upgrades over the older cards
These are very useful in helping to gain the advantage in your battles to come
The final collectibles are called treat cards, these resemble trading cards, they really serve no purpose, outside of being necessary to complete a few quest and unlocking a costume for collecting all of them
You gain treat cards by defeating enemies and completing quest
The Combat The combat in Costume Quest is rather unique, upon starting the battle your given one option to select basic attack (unless you have a battle card which gives you a secondary option like a stun)
after selecting that option you're taken into a quick time event
If you succeed in the quicktime event your character does extra damage, if you fail, your character does quite a bit less damage
During the enemy phase of combat, when an enemy attacks one of your characters, you're given another quick time event, if you are successful you defend some of the damage and minimize the damage you receive, if you fail the quick time event the enemy a significant amount of extra damage
Special ability's
-
those special abilities each costume has I mentioned above are useful here, after three combat turns each of your character unlocks their costumes special ability, this can be anything from from protection, heals, massive damage to a single or all enemies
It's a good idea to mix and match your party to ensure you have all your bases covered in terms of combat, defense and healing
A good defense is a good offense makes sense in this case
It's especially important to include some type of healing for your party, as no healing exist outside of special ability or battle cards
The combat sounds simplistic and it is, but the quick time events keep the gamer engaged and on their seat with each successive battle, letting your guard down can and probably will result in you suffering a defeat
 Pro's Good story,interesting charactersunique combat systemvery fun to playeasy to 100% if you're into achievementscontroller support Con's Can be a bit too easy with the right combination of costumes/battle cardsSlightly repetitive enemiesoccasionally controls can glitch out Recommendation I'd highly recommend this game, on paper it looks rather simplistic, it seems to have many strikes against it from a gamer's perspective prior to even installing it, but trust me on this one, once you start playing and get into the story you'll be thoroughly entertained as I was
A fun game to play and enjoy, once you start to play you'll want to keep playing until you finish the the story
It can be a bit difficult to get into, especially when you realize you'll be playing with children as characters, but that's part of the charm, a person of any age can kick back and enjoy the thrills and exciting of going trick or treating once again

There's nothing about Costume Quest that makes it extremely impressive
 It's not the sort of game to end up on a game of the year list, and it's not the sort of game you show off to all your friends
 Unlike most games i play, there isn't any super unique or innovative mechanic that really makes the game stand out from other rpg's, but it does enough to be above average
The story is that on Holloween night you are a boy/girl who goes trick or treating with your brother/sister until he/she is kidnapped by monsters
 Goblins not only want to eat your family member, but they want ALL OF THE CANDY
 However you can stand up to them, thanks to the powers given to you by your Holloween costumes
 Your goal is to go on an adventure meeting new kids and going all around town in order to chase down the monsters and save your sibling
The actual combat is the classic turn based combat formula
 You take to the field using the power of whatever costume your wearing to tear down those ruthless baddies
 This time it has been has been given a twist, badges and quick time events
 This reminded me a lot of Paper Mario TTYD (like my #1 game of all time), but the quick time events are less precise than paper marios and if you don't use more than the basic moveset it becomes extremely repetetive
 This is where badges come in to add variety to your game, except the badges are mostly uninteresting stat boosts that do very little to change up how you play (unlike Paper Mario where the badges completely defined your playstyle)
 I found the combat engaging enough to hold my interest throughout the game; it falls into the same pitfall most turn based combat does where all your abilities feeling too similar and achieve the same goal
 Combat is not Costume Quest's strong suit
The atmosphere of the game is fantastic
 There's this childrens bedtime story vibe to the whole game that i found really fitting because the entire story feels like a kid playing pretend
 From the costumes giving you powers to the adults not seeing monsters, the game has this make-believe quality where you half think the whole game is a facade but you're caught up in sillyness of it all so you don't care
 What i enjoyed most in the game was just exploring the world
 Throughout the multiple zones you have a costumes and candy (and monsters) to discover through exploration and use of your super powers
 The game makes good use of the Holloween setting
 Every zone has houses to trick or treat at, and each house can either give you a candy giving adult or an evil monster who will want to fight
 If you pick this game up pay attention to the dialog and talk to as many NPC's as you can because it'll give you a good chuckle
 There's all sorts of cute characters to talk to, all of whom set a contrast to the spooky monsters
The game isn't going to do anything to blow your mind, and that's ok
 With everyone running around the indie market trying to be the next Bastion, i enjoy these games that focus on being cute and fun
 If what i've written sounds pleasent, give Costume Quest a try and see if you'll like it

Possibly one of the best western visual novels Ive played so far, even tho I didnt liked the ending too much
 Im going to be honest, at first I thought it was going to be an okay title with pretty art, but ACE Academy is actually really good
 And one of the keys of success is the MC: hes funny, kind of a jerk sometimes, can be a sweetheart I loved him
 Its a slice of life with mecha action
 I was interested more because of the giant robots at first, but the comedy and character interaction were surprisingly good
 Theres a lot of mentions of other famous games (such as Persona 4), the amount of choices and the way that they change the story is awesome, and the voice acting is great
 All VAs did an excellent job on this game, seriously
 About the routes, I enjoyed Kaoris a lot
 Im not so fond of the tsundere type and yet I liked that character a lot
 Her voice fitted her so well that I think thats one of the reasons why I liked Kaori: the girl is stubborn as hell, but you can feel that deep down she does have a good heart, and shes not simply grumpy for no reason
 Also, I liked Mayu
 (Yes, the madwoman
 Yandere is my guilty pleasure, Im sorry
 lol9/10
 If you want a good and light comedy to read, youll enjoy this VN
 But if you dont like games with no closure or with cliffhangers, you might get annoyed
 But honestly, the character interaction and the scenarios are so good and enjoyable that I feel like forgiving the ending
 I really hope that there will be a sequel someday

Early Access Review
Do I recommend it, even though this is only the first episode
 Yes I do
The scores below are from 1 to 10, 1 being terrible, 5 being average and 10 being excellent
 I am confident in this Visual Novel and I think it can be one of the best Western Visual Novels
 Keep in mind that the scale I am using is the same that I use to evaluate japanese visual novels (like Grisaia no Kajitsu):Story: Not rated at the moment (episode 1)Since this is only the first episode and was pretty much about introductions (and there's still another girl to be introduced in the next episode), I can't rate the story
 My personal thoughts are that this is going to be a straightforward comedy slice of life romantic visual novel, so I don't expect any serious developments or mind blows
There's not really much I can say about writing
 It focuses on the dialogue and the protag thoughts, and doesn't waste time in detailing objects/sceneries
 It's an easy to read writing and direct to the point
There are some references and easter eggs
 One of the best scenes in this visual novel is a small battle between the MC, Kaori and a Tech Gosu
 Their battle is a little parody between Android, Apple and Microsoft
 Another is when choosing a movie, you get to choose a movie of a list of movies that all are based off real movies, and the characters leave their comment on it
Visuals: 7The backgrounds are just too good
 The artist makes such a good job of using lightning to give more life to the backgrounds
The characters also look good in my opinion
 The big drawback here is that, probably due to financial limits, secondary characters don't have fully drawn sprites
 Meaning that their sprites are just black figures
Gameplay: 9This visual novel, just like many others, is about making choices
 Difference is that this one has tons of choices that drastically change the story, while the others only have a few
 If you need a comparison, compare it to Walking Dead videogame from Telltalles games
 Some choices only change a few lines, while others change a lot of what happens
 For example, earlier in the game, you can choose to go to school by bus or with the bike
 Depending on what you choose, it will change what characters you meet first and what will happen in the next day
 Not only that, but if you decide to be an A hole with someone, that someone will remember it later and act accordingly
There's also the rollback feature
 Rollback is the feature that allows you to rollback to your previous choice and choose another option
 In this VN, you are asked in the begginning if you want to disable it
 If you do, you will get achievements and "other possible goodies"
You can also name your protagonist and choose his background trait: athletic, intelligent and intuitive
 If you choose to be athletic, you will have no problem carrying luggage, if you choose to be intelligent, other characters might ask for your help with the studies, etc
 This also sometimes highlights the best options in some choices, for example, if the teacher asks a question, the correct answer will be highlighted if you chose the intelligent trait
This visual novel also features mini games
 In the first episode, there are two type of mini games, if there will be more or not in the future I don't know
 One is a simple press the right combination of 5 buttons scattered around the screen
 In this episode, it appears only once to callibrate the MC's mech
 To be honest that minigame feels unnecessary (especially because your penalty for failing is just repeating the mini game), however one of the devs said that he plans to use it again later, so I assume that this one can serve as a tutorial kind of thing
The other mini game is the combat
 I am pleased that they improved it a lot since the alpha
 Now it's a lot better and it feels like I am actually doing some damage
 This mini game is simple: Just press WASD according to what appears on the screen
 If it appears W, press W and your combo will go up
 You have limited energy and the enemy has HP
 Depending on how well you do in the combat, the other characters will react to it (if you did well, they will praise you, etc)
 However, the bad side is that the mini game is too easy (for me at least)
Sound: 7They really did a good job here
 The music is good and one of the tracks even got stuck in my ear (it's one that plays when riding the bike if we choose to go to school with it)
 That's a lot more than I can say for many visual novels
 You see, I am like this: if I like the music that is playing, I continue to play the VN with it on, if I don't, I turn off the music and play my own
 I didn't turn off the music in this VN
The voice acting is also good
 The voices match very well with the characters (Shou especially)
 Obviously, we are talking about low budget voice acting, so don't expect voice acting on Morgan Freeman level (aka God level)
 It's good, but not something that will blow you away
 But considering that one can count english voice acted visual novels with just one hand, this is a really good effort from the devs
However, there are at least two moments where secondary characters don't have voice
 Considering that I reported this in the last alpha, I am going to assume that their lack of voice is intentional and not a bug
 This is weird because everyone else is voiced
 I will update this if they add voices later
Characters: Not going to rate yetSome of the characters are inspired by your usual japanese anime stereotypes, like tsundere
 However, they don't shamessly try to imitate them to the letter, which is good, because english voice acting + japanese stereotypes = usually not a good idea
 It's not by chance that "Idiot
" doesn't sound as good as "baka
" at the end of "I didn't do it because I like you, baka
"In the first episode, you are introduced to an uncle (Kaito), sister (Nikki), friend (Shou) and the romantic options: Mayu, Yuuna and Kaori
 There's also a french girl appearing in the next episode, Belle (Ooh là là)
 And there's also other guy that you may or may not meet in this episode depending on your choices, Akira (I got my eye on you, you white haired *insert swear here*)Because we are only in the first episode, and also because I'm lazy, I will refrain for now from talking of each one individually, but what I can say is that they feel compeling and I want to know more about them
Enjoyment: 9I am a sucker for choices
 I am a sucker for consequences
 So I had a blast replaying it multiple times and roleplay differently each time
The only complaint I have is that this episode felt a bit shorter compared with the original demo, but other than that, it was fun
Final rating: 8 (episode 1)TL;DR:Just buy it
 I kid
 You should buy it if:- You like light hearted stories;- You like mechas;- You like tons of choices;- You like easter eggs/references;- You want to support western VN's
You shouldn't buy it if:- You want a serious story (again, this is based off of the first episode, it might get serious moments later on for all I know);- You don't like any kind of mini games in visual novels;- You prefer more linear stories
If you have any questions or you want to point out something, feel free to comment
 I will reply as soon I notice it

ACE Academy is a story-rich visual novel developed and published by PixelFade Inc
 Following your little sister as she begins her studies in a new country, you find yourself transferring to ACE Academy which is a premier school for Cenorobotic studies in Japan
 "Cenorobotics" is a new academic field dealing with the study and use of GEARs which are giant mechanized robots originally developed for military applications
 The popularity of arena GEAR combat has enveloped a number of different areas with engineering, sponsorship, entertainment and weapons development just to name a few
 How will you and your sister adjust to life in a different nation, will you be able to make friends or possibly find love and most importantly will your piloting skills position you and your GEAR at the top of the Cenorobotics program
 Welcome to Japan
Usually I skip the gameplay portion of a visual novel review because it's a visual novel and there is no gameplay
until now that is
sort of
 Strangely enough, there actually is some gameplay involved in ACE Academy whenever there is combat with the mechs or GEARs as they are properly refered to
 On the battlefield, as advances are made by you and your opponents you are quickly given a list of actions to make with your GEAR and you only have a very limited time, seconds at best as a countdown timer initiates, to make a choice which really adds to the tension of the battles
 Do you block, evade, fire weapons or go in for a melee attack
it's all very well executed into the story quite nicely with animations during the battles
 In summary, this additional dynamic really had me even more intrigued with the narrative in ACE Academy as I found myself eagerly looking forward to the next engagements with the GEARs
Visually, this novel is really stunning with it's top notch illustration and professional presentation
 The manga inspired artwork is some of the best I've seen in any V
N
 and is filled with bright cheerful colors and terrific shading
 Even the menu screens are beautifully done which shows the commitment that this development team really put into this title
 One very eye-catching feature is the animation of the characters in this story
 They certainly aren't the static 2D figures that you see in most visual novels no
 The people in ACE Academy are wonderfully animated
 Their mouths move when they speak, their eyes blink, they even show different emotions with their facial features like blushing and getting upset or angry
 Sometimes even cute little speech bubbles with different animations in them like a heart or a tear pop up over the characters heads depending on what they just said or what they're feeling it's all very manga-like and fun to observe as you read the engrossing narrative
 They also change clothing on a regular basis, whenever you meet someone outside of the Academy for a social engagement they are always wearing something different
 I found this to be a wonderful little detail and something that you don't often see in most visual novels
 On another note, the sound is of the upmost quality
 It's truly immersive as the development team has managed to include ambient noises such as doors opening/closing, phones ringing, birds chirping, vehicles etc
, basically all the sounds you would hear as the characters interact with each other and their environments as the story progresses
 I really love it when these sounds are incorporated into the V
N
 because it truly immmerses me within the story
 ACE Academy has voiced dialogue and typically I like my V
N
's without it but I must admit that the voice actors in this title have done an impressive job with the script
 I find them all endearing and quite believable in what they say and how they say it
 Also, your little sister Nikki has the cutest voice ever
 In conclusion, with all the effort put forth in just the visuals and sound quality of ACE Academy you would be hard pressed to find another visual novel with as outstanding a presentation as this
To date, ACE Academy has been without a doubt the best and one of the longest visual novel experiences that I've had on Steam
 The story is extremely well written and quite entertaining and some of the more emotional scenes will even bring a tear or two to your eyes
 There are many unique characters to interact with and an abundance of choices to make throughout the branching narrative and let's not forget the fun GEAR combat
 There is also a ton of "pop culture" references thrown at you in this V
N
 so that was an added bonus as well
 As far as options go, there are the basics for audio, video and text speed
 Also included is an unlockable CG gallery and a very memorable original soundtrack with a few homage bonus tracks thrown in for good measure
 Sadly there are no Steam Achievements or Steam Trading Cards to collect which is a shame because those would go over nicely with this title
 As most of the V
N
's that I've tried on Steam have been fantasy based or occuring in present day, it was very refreshing to finally get a quality title that was purely science fiction
 In conclusion, featuring a truly intriguing story in which you actually get to pilot a mech, amazing artwork, a rich cast of memorable characters and a terrific O

, ACE Academy is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to visual novel fans, anyone wanting to experience a great sci-fi story and definitely to anyone wanting to try a visual novel for the very first time
Posted: 24 September, 2016
If you ever wanted a visual novel where you can troll the hell out of everyone in it, look no further
 ACE Academy is a western VN with a lot of humor and English voice acting (that manages to not be terrible)
 I have to be honest, the first playthrough I wasn't that impressed
 I chose the sensible, serious dialog options and found it to be an average slice-of-life story with a pretty disappointing ending
Then for the next playthrough I went full-on troll mode and it got way better
 Humor is the biggest reason you should pick up ACE Academy
 It had me laughing out loud many times, and that's enough to forgive it for its flaws (lackluster ending, some unvoiced dialog, minor characters are represented by silhouettes, etc
)
In summary, there is a dialog choice that says "Swiggity swooty, I'm coming for that booty
" I think that says it all

+ Main cast are standard anime tropes, but likeable+ Several girls to get your dating sim on, and thus replay value+ You are not the center of the universe (see below)+ Number of enjoyable, selectable scenes to get to know the characters+ Quality of CGs and sprites, it's a "cute" game+ Interesting setting and good world-buildingo Combat is infrequent and bland enough to be unnecessaryo Reused backgrounds and silhouettes for many side characterso Forgettable but passable soundtrack- Many story elements feel rushed and half-baked (see below)- Voice acting, particularly for secondary characters, is weak- Far too many pop culture references that will age the game terriblyACE Academy is tough for me to review
 There's plenty to like about it, but it's clear that it's PixelFade's first effort, and suffers from its original episodic release
 I assume the latter was a budgetary requirement to raise more funds through Early Access, but it's probably responsible for some pacing and focus issues
First, I will elaborate on the "pro" above: you are not the center of the universe
 You can pursue a variety of romance options, and beyond that choose which friends you spend free time with
 I was pleasantly surprised to find that characters I didn't pursue still clearly had a life outside of the game's scenes
 Girl who hit on me constantly that I rebuffed
 She got another boyfriend
 Standoffish teammate that I avoided until the end
 All the while she was working at a daycare and has a heart of gold
Now, the "con," which ties into my point about PixelFade and the episodic release
 Story elements, like a big, brewing conspiracy and the fate of your family, are repeatedly teased and then tied up far too quickly and cleanly
 There's some build up, but no climax, no payoff
 So why include them at all, really
 I suspect as they released episodes the game expanded in ways PixelFade didn't plan, and came to a point where their limited resources required they call it finished
 So they did
 but it's not satisfying
 This seems to happen even with bigger-name episodic games, like Life is Strange
 It is simply hard to maintain quality and cohesion this way
Steam tags call this an "RPG," but ACE isn't and by trying to be (with a kind-of "story arc" and characters "classes"), it dilutes itself
 In actuality it is "slice of life" and should have embraced that
 Drop the abortive mystery and rivalry and just be about a schoolboy and his friends
 As written, this practically begs for a continuation or sequel that seems unlikely
 That's too bad, because the bones of a really compelling VN are here
 I would love to learn more about GEARs and how they define people's lives
 I would love to keep following these characters and their relationships beyond the beginning stage (but that's a general gripe for too many VNs)
But still, I do recommend ACE Academy, maybe with the caveat of waiting for a sale
 If you like VNs (and if you're reading this, you very likely do), I believe this game will be enjoyable, but not mind-blowing, for you
 It was good enough on its own merits, and has me interested in PixelFade's further work
 Apparently in their next game, Crystalline, there is only one love interest for the main character that will be relatively complicated and fleshed-out
 That's a very promising direction in today's mile-wide, inch-deep world of dating sims

Wow
 So, this one came in as a complete surprise
 I didnt expect much when i bought it, but boy was I wrong
TL;DR:Pros:
Intriguing Story
Good, genuinly funny writing
Tons of choices, that also have an impact
Unique and likeable characters
Fully voice-acted
Decent length
Nice Artstyle & SoundtrackCons:
Abrupt, unsatisfying ending
Minor: Artwork occasionally gets re-usedIn Detail:Pixelfade
 Never heard of that Developer before, nor about the game itself
 So I expected a pretty run-of-the-mill Visual Novel
This was not what I got
 The CharactersThe character cast in ACE Academy was great across the board for me
 The romancable characters are unique and differ heavily from each other, but all of them are very likeable
Other characters such as your best friend, or your little sister etc
 are just as loveable
 The Dynamic between them is great and the game manages to convey a real sense of belonging
 You feel like a real part of the group
 The StoryThe Story is what I would probably classify as mildly interesting
 That doesnt mean it's bad, far from it
 For a VN it's actually rather intriguing and does the job well enough
 It's nothing revolutionary, but compared to a lot of other VN I would say it is above average
 RomancesNow as mentioned before there are 4 romancable characters
Each of them has unique traits but all of them have very rewarding and heartwarming moments in their respective routes
Through the excellent writing the progression of these romantic relationships also feels pretty natural and not forced
 Game Length & Choices After doing all the routes I capped at roughly 20 hours
 Now, I will not lie, I didnt really check my playtime after I first reached the ending , but it should last you a good 10 hours
However that is only if you play through it once, there are a lot of reason to play through it several times
At the start of the game you name your MC and select 1 out of 3 personality types
 Depending on your type you will get unique dialogue choices as well as different outcomes in some events
In additon to that you also have the above mentioned different romances that I encourage you to explore
Lastly this game throws a ton of choices at you from the get go
 Some may just slightly alter a dialogue, but there are also a lot that affect the story and that have actual impact

Early Access Review
Firstly Id just like to say as this is the early access and still has a lot more to come I thought it was extremely good
 The story was enticing and kept me very interested in the characters throughout the first part of the game
 I also enjoyed little mini games within this visual novel which kept things interesting
 Secondly the music to this game is very good and fits the rhythm of what is happening and the mood that goes with it
 I was very surprised at how well it was done for a companys first work
Finally all the characters to this game have a lot to them and are all very likeable
 This made me enjoy the story so much more and felt more connected with each character
 The voice acting is also good and fits the characters all very well giving them all their own great personalities
 There are also many different choices you can make which help keep the game fresh and mean there is much more replay ability
 In all I feel ACE Academy is definitely worth a buy
 Its a lot better than most other visual novels I have played on steam
 Especially seeing as the first part is longer than most of them, it is defiantly worth the money
 If visual novels are your thing I think you will enjoy it as much or maybe more than I did

So I was looking for Visual Novels on Steam which are on sale (Everyone wants sales) then I came across this VN
 I didn't deem it as something good because it was on sale and probably because I never heard of it before add to that it was made in the west
 So my expectations were set to low and I played the game to basically laugh at how terrible it might be
 Then it happened 2 hours in and I can't get the game off of my mind
 The characters are too damn good, the interactions are superb, there are a plethora of choices and scenarios to see and of course the protagonist is realistic
 I'm not a fan of Mech and the future but this is an exception
 An exceptionaly, wonderful VN for those lost in the dangerous seas that is called VN hell
 I finally found something I'd read 'til the end
 Simply amazing, no amount of praise can amount to the light I saw yesterday

Early Access Review
As one of the earliest and largest supporters of the project, back when it was known as Kendo Crush, I have to say, that I had a great deal of fun with the original demo
 However, I have since given up support for the project, through no reason other than the unfortunate issues the development staff encountered at many steps
 What was originally intended to come out fully in June of this year, is now still in early access
However, this is to be expected
 They have changed the game considerably, and picked up new staff, despite the issues encountered
 As a mid-tier backer of the project, I was given early access to builds of the new Ace Academy game
 All I can say is I found the quality of the writing to be greatly diminished from that of the original demo
 Without spoiling anything, certain character interactions with a girl named Kaori
 Shes quite temperamental, and I was originally satisfied with how much you were able to tease her
 From what I played of the current game, there have been far less options to do this
 In general, I found the comedy of the original to be much more prominent
 There are some improvements over the redo
 The art is much better, and Im sure the futuristic appeal of the game will be more enjoyable to some, over the original Kendo focus, which some might have seen as boring
 I must admit, that it was probably a better move for the game to be redesigned, but that doesnt change my opinion on the matter
While I can guarantee the game is worth the price, it just isnt there for me

I wasn't entirely sure about a VN priced at $20
00, but after about ten minutes in, I realized why
 It should be noted that I'm fairly new to VN games in general, having only played six or seven personally
 That being said, compared to those, this blows them out of the water
 First off, the story is not only moving and impactful, but long
 You don't actuall come across the intro until about 30~ minutes in
 That's just a estimate, but it honestly felt the opening came in where other VN closing credits would start rolling
Secondly, the entire VN is voice acted
 Voice acted tremendously well, for that matter
 Even the main protagonist has not only a voice, but a face as well
Not only that, but the art in this game is amazing
 At first I thought I was delusional, but every character's eyes and mouths move
 Every character and background scene really immerse you into the story the developer wanted to portray
 10/10, only regret regarding this game is the fact that I didn't buy it sooner

A short review with no story details
eden* is a wonderful visual novel with brilliant art and a soundtrack that enhances the reading experience without being too overpowering
 Simple details like having the characters blink add a nice touch to an already high quality work
 This is by far my favorite visual novel currently (this review was created March 22, 2015) on Steam
 The $20 price tag is quite steep, so I would wait for it to go on sale (mine was 50% off)
 If you're looking for a serious visual novel to start reading, I recommend this
Notes:- Length ~15 hours (assuming you listen to the voice acting)- There IS voice acting- There are NO choices/routes in eden* (Kinetic Novel)- There is VERY LITTLE TO NO fan service- This is the regular version of eden
 The eden Plus+Mosaic version (not available on Steam) includes added blood to certain scenes and less censoring for certain scenes
 It also includes an extra eroge side story that is not part of the main story
 In my opinion I would have liked the added blood, but an eroge side story sounds incredibly out of place for this VN
- I consider this a serious/emotional visual novel, unlike a VN such as Sakura Spirit
 It tries to BE something and succeeds instead of appealing to absurd fan service
- Originally released September 18, 2009

Excelent kinetic novel, very much recomended

If you knew that the world was going to end soon, how would you want to spend your remaining time
 What would change for you, how would your priorities shift
 Assuming you'd find an opportunity to escape, would you choose a future of perpetual narrow walls and cramped spaces over a short time of ultimate freedom followed by certain doom
For the people living in the world of eden*, these questions are no longer abstract
MangaGamer delivers the English release of this 2009 title by minori to Steam
 eden* is a kinetic novel (a story without choices or gameplay) about the last few people on a dying planet
 Its most unique selling point compared to similar titles is its visual presentation: Instead of the waist-up character sprites positioned in front of static backgrounds that we are used to from most modern visual novels, it relies almost entirely on scene-by-scene custom images, each one carefully designed to take character positions and camera perspectives into account
 This gives the experience a very cinematic feel, quite literally reminiscent of movies, compared to other titles of its kind
 Most scenes also features blinking eyes and lip syncing with the Japanese voices, which makes it impressively lively
Needless to say, the asset quality is excellent throughout, starting with the backgrounds ranging from the painterly to the borderline naturalistic
 The same attention to detail extends to the characters who, despite the multitude of poses and perspectives, always appear consistent, unique, and alive
 From what I can tell as someone who does not speak Japanese, the voices really fit well, and coupled with the competent sound design and the soundtrack by Tenmon (if you happen to enjoy Makoto Shinkai's movies: yes, that Tenmon), which expands a small number of recurring motifs into a gripping soundscape, this is an aural experience that you are unlikely to forget
The story revolves around Warrant officer Ryou Haruna and his assignment to guard a remote research facility during the planet's final moments
 A peculiar (but largely unspecified) astronomical phenomenon is going to wipe out all life on Earth, and humanity is putting the finishing touches on a centennial plan to migrate into space and search for a new home
 One component of this plan are the felixes, genetically engineered superhumans whose intellect propels scientific progress far beyond its normal pace
 However, there are dissenting voices claiming that humanity should face its ultimate fate head-on instead of trying to escape, so military protection is granted to essential actors within the plan  in particular to Sion, the supreme felix, mastermind behind the giant starships and humanity's savior
The central themes of eden* include destiny and free will as well as the morality of living one's life for someone else
 Ryou, as the self-described "military's attack dog," and Sion, as the people's only hope to keep on living, are both so devoted to their duties that they have fallen out of touch with their own humanity
 Circumstances force them to confront their deeply buried sense of self and be thrust before the most pivotal decision of their lives: to keep on living in the narrow golden cages of their own design, or to choose the ultimate act of defiance and experience the freedom and joy that they had always denied themselves, living life to the fullest until the curtain falls
The writing tends to focus on character interaction and personal growth over story complexity  eden* is all about the human condition, not about hard sci-fi
 In fact, even the scientific details of the end of the world are almost completely glossed over
 If you are looking for an apocalyptic sci-fi story with cool technology, this isn't it
 Rather, the focus on the characters is so strong that it could be described as downright melodramatic in parts, insofar as that can be a good thing
 It features countless goosebumps-inducing, memorable, quotable moments that easily smooth over the fact that some of the tension maybe could have been resolved in easier ways, or that there's a certain degree of plot convenience constructing the situations that are most interesting for the characters
 It all ends up feeling very complete and satisfying
All in all, I can recommend eden* without much in the way of caveats
 If you dislike visual novels or anime-style art, odds are you have not read this far down
 If you like visual novels but you're not sure if this one is worth your time, my answer is that it is
 I also recommend avoiding playtime estimates
 Reading speed varies from person to person anyway, but the later parts of this story work best if you can empathize with the sense of impending dread that the characters are feeling
 For them, any day, any moment, could be the last one
 It'll be more fun for you if you can get lost in that feeling as well, instead of calculating how many hours you might have left
 Even if you have little to no experience with visual novels, this one is probably a better one to get started than most titles currently on Steam
 With the above-mentioned reservations in mind, eden* easily gets a positive recommendation from me

Almost as good as Clannad

"The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion
" ~ Albert CamusI haven't been playing visual novels for years now
 Around the time that I got involved with adult responsibilities a couple year back, I involuntarily stopped sparing time for the genre
 Thanks to a friend's insistent screenshot sharing of many beautiful VNs, I noticed that I've been missing pretty artwork and superficial stories in a very girly manner
 I gave up and decided to give the genre a go after a long time
 My first pick though, being anything but superficial, left me thoughtful and shaken
eden* is a tale of compassion, free will and tomorrow
 It is the tale of a world coming to its end
 It all started with the appearance of an ominous red star on the sky
 After through research, scientists agreed that it is the first warning sign of the end
 It took a hundred years for mankind to prepare themselves for a major immigration project to evacuate the planet and search for its destiny elsewhere
 During these final moments of the worn planet earth, there are yet things to wonder and chains to break
 Between a stoic soldier, a secluded genius, a kind maid, a broken warrior, a regretful commander and a loud journalist; eden* is the tale of breaking chains
The game is designed to be a kinetic novel - which means a visual novel without any choice options
 You only keep reading and watching the story as it unfolds
 In this manner, it cannot wholly be defined as a game
 The quality of CGs and the labor put into artwork are far beyond your casual visual novel though
 Characters present a full selection of animations, including moving eyes and lip synch with Japanese voice acting
 Voice acting is also beyond the par, as if taken out of an A+ anime series
 Translation from Japanese to English is great - which is a rare case in any media - and manages to deepen the mood furthermore
 The game is quite long so to say; if you'll be waiting for voice acting you can expect an average game time of 13-15 hours
I'd love to share some character details, but any relevant information about identities or backgrounds would be downright spoilers
 Have you ever watched Clannad
 With After Story part of course
 If your answer is no, it is a huge recommendation
 If yes, you already know what kind of soul wrecking experience that you are getting yourself into
 You'll remember Sion and Ryou's story for a long while

Ryo is not interested in Maids*camera pans to boobs*Ryo watches the scenery outside the window*camera pans to skirt*Pros-High quality animation and scenesI'm used to seeing standard sprites in visual novel but this one was really made with dedication
It has animated mouth and eyes, plus the poses are not limited to just standing
-Main protagonist has voice-Cute girls with flushed cheeks
(99
99% of the time)-It's not a loli game
She's 100 years oldCons-Small Resolution-Clunky settings menu-Some shortcut keys like Full Screen and Window Mode are not working-Can't access to CG gallery unless you finished at least one route
-Sometimes the art seems off

Geometry Wars has company
Assault Android Cactus is quite the score based twin stick arena shooter
The game also supports mouse and keyboard
I've tried both controller and keyboard and each method of control is more than precise enough for this genre
Multiple characters are available, four initially and five unlock-able, each with different load outs and each requiring their own strategy for you to perfect, and I do mean perfect
Every little detail in Assault Android Cactus has been methodically thought out and implemented by the veteran developers and it is up to the player to not only play but observe and learn the characters and arenas in order to maximize scores
The Austrailian developer team's lineage has roots in Midway, Electronic Arts, Sega and Professional Gaming Leagues
The ranking system is of the D to S / S+ variety
In AAC, to maximize scores, it is not only about dispatching enemies as quickly as possible but how you dispatch them
Maintaining chains is paramount
Strategy is important and seeing players with 100+ hours in the game speaks volumes of depth and replay-ability
AAC features a battery mechanic, essentially an energy charging pickup that prevents death
In simple terms, your battery runs out and it's the scrap heap for you
Hits alone will not explicitly kill you but will make your demise imminent if you accrue too many
The player character has a limited number of recharging hit points of which a count of zero will render the player incapacitated requiring resuscitation by mashing the fire button
When rendered incapacitated you will lose some of the energy pellets you've been accumulating to power level your weapons resulting in a powered down weapon and ruining any chance for leader board supremacy
The game spawns not only batteries but a power-up, one of three types
Speed, companion orbs to accelerate weapon discharge and stasis
Not all types are optimal for every situation or every character in every arena
The three types will rotate in place until the type you desire is picked up
 AAC features a twenty five stage campaign encompassing five themed levels made of five arenas with difficulty increasing with progression
AAC is high intensity, very challenging and will require a degree of dedication in order to maximize efficiency
Arenas may contain environmental obstacles and will on occasion morph
Each of the themed levels is capped with a very challenging boss battle
Boss battles are typically multi layered and require advanced pattern recognition
In addition to the campaign, there are additional modes such as survival, daily and local coop with up to four players
Coop games are also recorded on the leader-boards
Locally, game pads and mouse / keyboard combinations may be mixed on the same computer
I mentioned Geometry Wars
The spawns in the AAC, both battery and power-ups are designed to encourage aggressive game-play
Having played my share of Geometry Wars, obsessively battling for score dominance with a lovely friend of mine, I'm reminded of a similar design
Baiting the player to take risks to maximize scores but yet encourage mastery by rewarding success with ascension up the leader boards
From experience in both games you might think that you've achieved your score goal only to stare in disbelief at the final total
One more time 
and so it goes

My first playthrough of the game was with my 7 year old daughter and from start to finish, we had a great time
 At first, it felt brutal and maybe too hard for a 7 year old but it felt rewarding with every attempt as we both got better at the game with every try
 About 15 minutes in, we knew how to play and started dying less and making more progress
 We faced our first boss together and it took a few tries but we beat him and it was satisfyingly hard
I'm rating this up because not only is the game style cute and over the top action packed for my taste but my 7 year old enjoys it and it got us some pretty good time together
 We're taking a break because we have company coming over but we both look forward to playing more Assault Android Cactus either with them or alone after they leave
 It's hard to find a game both parents and children can enjoy together and this might be one of them
Thanks

Early Access Review
Nearly two years ago, my then-managing editor Jaz Rignall pointed me in the direction of an intriguing-looking Early Access game on Steam called Assault Android Cactus
 After taking a peek at the pre-alpha build, I began corresponding with Mr Sanatana Mishra from developer Witch Beam Games, and it transpired that the game would be on show at the then-new Eurogamer Expo (now known as EGX)
 Since I was heading to EGX anyway, I made an appointment to meet with Mishra and have a chat about the game, and in the meantime I familiarised myself a little more with the early build
When I first heard about Assault Android Cactus, I wasnt sure what to think
 On paper, it sounds like any number of games that bloat Steams marketplace daily  its an arcade-style twin-stick shooter inspired by retro classics  but it quickly became apparent from playing through the limited number of levels in the early build that there was actually something quite special taking shape here
 This feeling was further compounded when I eventually made it to the Eurogamer Expo and had a thoroughly enjoyable chat with Mishra about the game and the teams plans for it in the long-term  to cut a long story short, it was apparent that Witch Beam was a small team who were absolutely dedicated to making Cactus the best experience it could possibly be, and to creating a truly authentic Dreamcast-style experience heavily inspired by the masters of Japanese shoot em ups like Treasure, Cave and their ilk
Since I first gave Cactus its glowing write-up on USgamer, Ive checked in on the Early Access build numerous times as its developed, and regularly talked about how much I like it
 Ive also kept in touch with Mishra and the rest of the team at Witch Beam via Twitter, and its been a genuine pleasure to witness the passion theyve been pouring into their project
 Its been a long and slow road to release for the game, but it's finally here
A couple of weeks ago, I received an email from Mishra containing a beta code for the full review build of Assault Android Cactus full version as a thank you for the support Ive shown them over the last couple of years
 Touched by this thoroughly nice gesture of appreciation, I made a point of immediately downloading the new build and playing it for a good few hours
 And it seems my early impressions were very much correct: Assault Android Cactus is something very special indeed, and if it doesnt end up taking its rightful place of honour alongside modern arcade classics like Ikaruga, DoDonPachi, Geometry Wars and their ilk, something is very, very wrong
For the unfamiliar, Assault Android Cactus is, as previously mentioned, a twin-stick shooter
 Theres a few twists on the usual formula, though: the right stick just aims rather than shoots, for one, so you have to actually pull the trigger to fire, while the left trigger swaps between your chosen characters main and secondary weapon
 Main weapons have unlimited ammunition; secondary weapons have a cooldown before they can be used again, but tend to be considerably more powerful
Another major twist on the formula is the fact that theres no lives system, with the challenge factor instead coming from a time limit represented by the characters declining battery charge
 Blowing up a wave of enemies allows you to collect a recharge item, while getting knocked down wastes time and battery charge as well as costing you some points, so avoiding getting hit is a very important part of going for high scores
 The battery system proved to be a controversial addition to the game when it was first put in place, but its now such an integral part of the game structure that its difficult to imagine Assault Android Cactus without it
 It ensures the game strikes a good balance between accessibility for casual players and rewarding skilful play from the people who know what 1CC stands for
One of the most noteworthy aspects of Cactus gameplay is its selectable characters, who are gradually unlocked as you progress through the main series of levels
 Far from just being different skins, each of the playable android characters handles uniquely, with very different main and secondary weapons allowing you to play in different ways
 Title character Cactus is the most straightforward, boasting a simple machine gun and short-range flamethrower combination, while Aubergine is one of the more peculiar offerings due to her main weapon being an independently controlled helicopter drone and her secondary weapon being the ability to summon a quantum singularity and suck everything into it
 The way the different characters play is one area where Witch Beam has clearly taken inspiration from classic Japanese shoot em ups, since many of these have selectable ships with different weapon setups
 Theres a huge amount of creativity in the way the characters play, though, and its a real pleasure to get a handle on how some of the more outlandish characters work
 (I still have no idea how to use Aubergine effectively, mind
)Another interesting aspect is in the level design
 Cactus could have easily been a straightforward arena shooter, but instead the levels show a great deal of variety in their structure
 While they all have the same goal  destroy all the enemies  some of them take place in a confined space; some of them unfold in an arena that changes shape over time; some of them are in levels that force you to move from one place to another
 One particularly memorable one scrolls infinitely in every direction, with checkerboard floor tiles flipping up and down according to which direction youre going; the backdrops are always interesting and exciting to look at as much as the main action is
Cactus long-term appeal comes from the same place as other arcade-style shooters: score attack
 Completing a level immediately shows you a leaderboard as well as a letter grade, with the elusive S+ rank being reserved for those who chained all of the enemies in a level into a single combo, didnt die and were generally a bit of a superstar
 After attaining an S+ rank, you unlock Pro Mode, which puts an on-screen indicator on your HUD showing whether or not its still possible to attain an S+ on the level youre playing; you can also quickly restart a level if you make a mistake along the way somewhere
The ranking system has been well thought out
 Levels are designed so that you can learn them, much like a bullet hell shooter, and attaining the best ranks is dependent on you figuring out these enemy patterns, how to avoid their attacks and how to ensure that youre always on the offensive to keep your combo active
 Bosses are similar, unfolding across several learnable phases, with the boss health bar clearly showing where theres a phase transition so you can ensure youre in an advantageous position ahead of time
If youre not in the mood for score attack, though, some Sega-inspired EX options allow you to play the game in various different ways
 You can try the game in first-person, for example, or from a fixed isometric perspective rather than the dynamic camera angles of the regular game  though both of these options disable the leaderboards
 There are also several graphical filter options  including an entertaining JJ Mode, which spooges lens flare and bloom all over the screen for an incredibly colourful experience  as well as options for having AI players alongside you or taking on co-op enemy waves with just a single player
In short, if youre a fan of arcade-style shooters and youre looking for something entertaining to feed your virtual quarters into, Assault Android Cactus is pretty much an essential purchase

Here's what you need to know
The basic robot-shooting gameplay is practically flawless
The controls are sharp, with both gamepad and mouse / keyboard working just fine (although I personally find using a gamepad much more fun)
There's no ammo or need to reload, meaning you can put out a never-ending barrage of firepower against the constant stream of enemies
Visual design is superb, with all the robots having distinct looks, making it easy to remember and react to their attack patterns in the middle of the chaos
Despite the ridiculous number of exploding robots on screen, I never find it overwhelming - everything reads well and the times when you die to something you didn't have a clear warning about are very rare
The battery system (which is effectively a timer + checkpoint system, with a bit of a twist) keeps the pace up and forces you to be aggressive
Sound design is great too
Audio cues are easy to pick up on (such as the "woop woop" when you reach low health, or the little "tink" when your secondary weapon recharges), even while having your face melted off by the soundtrack
All the little details feel right - the speed at which the power ups cycle, the range at which you can collect the weapon orb things, the time it takes for the secondary weapons to reacharge - and it all comes together to make a game that is just plain fun
On top of all that, the difficulty curve is handled well
There's a smooth progression from playing just to clear levels, onto playing for S+ ranks (along with a robot voice saying "S plus
" that makes you feel special inside), onto playing for pure score on the leaderboards
There are no real difficulty spikes - by the time you've cleared most of the levels, getting the top rank on the first stage is easy, and from there you can just keep going
Having said that, I do have a couple if issues with the game, the only one worth mentioning here is that I don't think it works very well in co-op mode if you have a bit of a skill mismatch
Due to the battery mechanic, every member of the team needs to contribute to killing robots as fast as possible in order to reach the next battery drop
If you have a less experienced player who falls behind, it's not like you can wait for them to catch up - the other players need to immediately pick up the slack by killing robots even faster
While this is possible, it's no fun for the player at the bottom, as they will be constantly dying, having their weapon level lowered, being unable to keep up with the damage, and then dying again
In single-player, however, this is a game that I can recommend unequivocally if you have any interest in fast arcade games

A small, four legged robot fires a trio of bullets at me and I dodge, switching to my secondary weapon to gain a few brief moments of invincibility, kill him and turn to Another small four legged robot
 Who shoots me dead
 Anyone who knows me can tell you that the only way I improve in a video game is through knocking my head against the proverbial brick wall
 Assault Android Cactus is no different, and my first few hours are not going well
 Developed by a small, three man studio out of Australia, Assault Android Cactus, or AAC for short, is a top down, twin stick shooter that is both difficult and extremely forgiving at the same time
 Featuring twenty unique levels and five memorable bosses, it offers a good solid chunk of game play, unique maps and bosses, and online leader-boards for those who are more aptly skilled than I am
 Players take control of one of eight Androids, and one secret unlock-able Android, in an attempt to make it to the end of a large space ship in order to stop a robot rebellion
 Once youve finished with that, the game also offers a once-a-day randomized level, score hunting on those leader-boards and something called Infinity Drive which seems to be an endurance type game mode where enemies spawn in large numbers, and youre expected to do your best to survive
 I cannot tell you that I did well in it
In short though, it took me about five or six hours to beat every level in the game, but it was time well spent, and I look forward to coming back to it
GameplayGetting shot in the back by a treacherous, sneaky dog-robot is, in other games, a death sentence
 Game over, try again, learn from your mistakes
 In AAC, the devs went with a different approach
 Where most games like this give you one or two hits before you game over, AAC gives you a generous health bar that can take three or four hits, and that regenerates whenever you go a period of time without getting hit at all
 And, instead of lives, player Androids are given a bar at the top of the screen in the shape of a battery that continuously ticks down as you play
 Every so often, killing an enemy robot drops a battery for you to pick up, extending your meter at the top and letting you continue playing
 Coupling these two together results in a system that encourages you not to get hit (You obviously arent going to get a battery when you aren't killing things), but also rewards you when you manage to do so, and forgives you when you make a mistake
 Some might call it hand holding, but I call it being kind to the player
 Not everybody has lightning quick reflexes
Speaking of reflexes though youre still gonna need some
 Trying each of the eight Androids you can
unlock taught me a lot about myself, and how much I suck at video games
 Each of them has two weapons, each unique to them and from every other character, and they all play differently
 While Cactus, the lead character and the namesake of the game, is given a standard machine gun, and a short range flamethrower you need to get in close to an enemy to use
 Easy to use while teaching you the basics of the game and where you can stand without getting shot, shes the first Android you are thrust into this world with and is a good choice for beginners
 Then you begin to unlock the others, and things take a turn
I wont describe every Android and their play style in detail, but expect to find characters who wield Railguns that penetrate, short range shotguns whose power drops off immensely with range, a gun that tracks enemies for you (not always a good thing) and a smoke covered tomboy that shoots lava
 Yes, really
 They each feel different from the last, and each feel as if they were designed to do different things in the game
 Some seem designed to finish quickly and compete for high scores, while others seem weaker, designed perhaps to work best with a buddy in co-op
 And yes, there is local co-op
While a game like this would easily shine in online co-op, the small three man team that built this can be forgiven with taking the easier option of local only
 Up to four players on a couch, or in chairs huddled around a small computer screen, can play at the same time with fun, chaotic effect
 A small crown above each characters head lets you know who is doing the best at the time, but things shift quickly and getting knocked down once or twice can send the crown flying across the screen to find your buddy
 Fast paced, colorful and sometimes hard to keep track of yourself, AAC toes the line of making you hate your friends and having a genuine good time because, while one person cannot finis hthe co-op version of the levels alone, having that one guy (me) who is not as good as the rest does not doom you to failure
 Life, and co-op AAC, is a team game
GraphicsMost top-down shooters struggle to make the graphical side of their game fun to look at, and with such a small team working off a limited budget, youd expect Assault Android Cactus to do the same
 Like me, youd be wrong
 While it wont challenge games from big companies for eye candy awards, the team at Witch Beam went to painful lengths to make sure their small little game was as nice looking, and sounding as could be
 From their lead animator, programmer and designer who has worked at companies such as Midway, Electronic Arts and Sega, to their Audio Director who worked with games such as Total War, Need for Speed and FIFA Soccer (throwing in a BAFTA award along the way), their passion and ability ooze from every corner
From colorful, expressive characters to bright enemies, constantly changing levels and cute, albeit short, cut scenes there is not much you can complain about the game from a visual standpoint
 Enemies are easy to pick out from the bullets, the bullets themselves are easy to find and avoid, and where some games find you lost among the chaotic battle happening around you, AAC goes to great lengths to make sure you know where you are, where the danger is, and conveys all of that in a gentle on the eyes, easy to read screen
The one complaint I can lodge has to do with a certain dog shaped, toaster looking enemy in the game
 Hopping around joyfully, these little monsters open up a hatch on their back, launching a missile up into the air where it rains down on you
 A bright red marker shows you where its going to land with plenty of warning but, with your eyes watching the enemies around you, the floors sometimes moving on you and the game wanting your attention in seven different places at once, its far too easy to miss that little red circle and walk straight into a missile
 Maybe thats my mistake though
 Well call it fifty-fifty
PerformanceThis is where things get a little tricky for me to sound authoritative on
 While certainly not a five thousand dollar machine, my desktop computer is designed and built to run games at a high level, and finding myself hitting 250+ fps with all settings cranked to maximum in the game is not a rare occurrence
 So how can I say exactly how smooth this game runs from a technical aspect
 Well, I cant
 Not entirely
 But I can tell you that the game has very low minimum requirements, others I know have run it on mid-tier laptops and I, myself, have run it on my Mothers laptop, she of the this website said I needed to download this fame
Ive also found success running it on a desktop at school and, while the frame rate stuttered and struggled to stay steady at anything over 15 fps, the game did run, and on a machine I expect contained pictures of components on the inside instead of any real machinery
 As long as you keep the settings reasonable, know your own machine and keep an open mind, it should run fine for you
 And, hey
 If youre still worried after reading this, the game has a free demo for you to check its performance yourself
 Those are still a thing some devs do

Early Access Review
Super fun game and if you have other friends playing the game aswell it can get VERY competitive
 Gets addicting and is very rewarding after you S+ that one level that takes ages (I'm looking at you Furnace)
 Would reccomend to everyone that is a fan of twin stick shooters with elements of bullet hell
 Incredibly addicting

[2013/10]Assault Android Cactus really shines in local coöp
On Friday evening, we slapped two PS3 pads and two Xbox pads onto a Linux machine, connected a projector, and had a 5-hour marathon session, with maybe 20 people rotating in and out at various times
There was lots of shouting at the screen and at each other ("Battery
 Battery
"
"Kill the toasters
"), as well as a fair amount of trashtalking over the statistics on round completion
[2014/08]AAC was one of my first exposures to Steam Early Access, and it's a shining example of how the system was meant to work
 When I first began playing, they had implemented one game mode, the four main characters, a handful of levels, and one boss
 Since that time, WitchBeam has continually blasted out new characters, levels, bosses, and game modes, while continuing to revise, rebalance, and polish existing content
At the time of this edit, AAC is still in early access (update 8
5), but I'm already extremely happy with my purchase, and I can't recommend this game enough
 Additionally, future WitchBeam titles will be unquestioned day-0 purchases for me
I nominated this game for the "I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won an Award" Steam Award 2016

To all those saying this game is too hard, it's a lot easier with both hands on the controller
 
Posted: 18 June
Wow
 This game shocked me with how good it was
I DEFINATLY reccommend you play it
BUT
This is not a game to start Shantae with
 The mechanics are different and it's not a good idea of what the series is
Beyond that, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse takes place directly after the events of Shantae: Risky's Revenge
 If you haven't played Risky's Revenge first, then you should because it will cause some confusting moments in Pirate Curse
Pros:- Amazing Graphics- You constantly feel interested in the game
 There's never a moment where you feel bored or want to take a break
- Just like all Shantae games, there is backtracking, but the other thing about Shantae games (excluding Half-Genie Hero)
is that the backtracking never makes you feel sick of the areas
 With the new pirate gear you obtain during your time in
the game, after virtually every world there is things to do in all the previous ones
- There are a ton of collectables- The game is NOT linear
 This game encourages exploration and has the best use of collectable hunting I've seen in my
years of gaming
 You have to go off your path and utillize your arsinal in creative ways to find hidden passages in walls
or hidden rooms to find them
 You don't even have to find said collectables and that really helps them feel like goodies
rather than chores like many recent games do
-
This game gives you NOTHING on a sliver platter
 Sometimes I feel I'll be hunting for a secret or a collectable just to find
a key in the chest I found
 The puzzles aren't simply laid out in front of you, they require dedication and smarts
 This
really protects the game from being too easy and definatly ups the enjoyment levels
-
Amazing character development
 The story is great, all the characters have lovable personalities, you just remember
them all and very few are just one-offs
-
The game also brings some of the trademark Shantae humor to the table which is always greeted with a warm
welcome
-
Fantastic soundtrack
-
Just straight fun platforming-
You actually use your items to fight bosses
 You don't know how many games render items useless by not doing this
-
Gems weren't jsut coming at you in heaps
-
Platforming wasn't too easy
-
REALLY good final boss fight
Cons:- Items that you had to purchase and upgrade in RR amd HGH were turned into one-time use items
- Some items like the Monster Milks and the Bubble Shield I felt were useless
Just buy this game and Risky's Revenge at the same time and you'll have a good few weeks

Risky's Revenge review: http://steamcommunity
com/id/stumperman/recommended/277890/This game is good, and should be bought
Pros:- Better and kind of worse item system
 You are no longer trying to double tap the bottom screen of the 3DS to use an item
 Instead you hit Select or whatever the keyboard control and press A on the item
 The downside to this is the key items and map are also here, mainly the map
 In the 3DS version you could have the map on the bottom, now you have to hit select then go to the map menu
 I already beaten the game 7 times now so I don't need the map
- Better than both prequels
 WayForward know how to make good sequels and this out of all 3 shantae games is so far my favorite
 Longer story
 fair gameplay, not too easy not too hard, it does get harder as you progress etc etc
- Good story- Memorable Characters (nameless npcs are even memorable)- Good Characters (I love all characters, even nameless npcs)- Challenging but not impossible - Excelent Platforming + Puzzles- Funny and unique dialouge
- Wonderful sprite animation- Awesome soundtrack- High replay value (After beating the steam version 3 different times I will have beaten this 10 times)Cons:- Bad for players who do not have a thrill for adventure
 This game does not exactly tell you what you have to do and where to do it
 You have to use your brain and the tiny amount of hints the game gives to find out where things are
 This is however good cause what's an adventure platformer if the game just tells you what to do and how to do it
- Grinding Gems to get items
 The items for upgrades and moves can be way too expensive and useless
 Like I said I beat this game a lot of times, I never used the back kick move, or the back dash
 Back dash being 100 gems (not bad) and the back kick being 400 which is too much for something I never had to use
 Also you have to upgrade your hair strength, whip speed, scimitar, and pistol 3 times which adds up to a lot of gems
 It's not that bad to grind for them but it could of been done better
So if you like Metroid/Castlevenia you will love this game
 The story in this one is more deep than Risky's Revenge and the original GBC game
 It is totally worth the 20 dollars to get
 That concludes this review with the 2 minor cons (one being really minor), I still have to give this game a wonderful score
I give this game a 10/10
Posted: 24 April, 2015
These are the pros and cons I have come up with during my first full (100%) playthrough of this game+ I have never taken so many screenshots in a single game before + Platforming+ Artwork + Soundtrack+ Plot (not just the story
)+ Humour in almost every cutscene+ Death barriers are clearly marked so you know which holes are hidden rooms and which aren't+ Lots of achievements+ Didn't feel like I was missing too much backstory even though I have yet to play the previous two games in the series- Two of the three combat skills you can buy are basically useless compared to your standard moveset- Maps do not tell you which items you have already found (and where they were located) which can lead to excessive backtracking- All the achievements are making my OCD kick inAll achievements acquired update:+ The speed run achievements are quite the challenge and the game rewards you with two "fan-service-y" wallpapers if you can beat it in under 2 hours with any% and under 3 hours with 100% completion
 Completed and acquired all achievements for Shantae: Risky's Revenge update:Pirate's Curse vs Risky's Revenge + More bosses + More dungeons+ Less confusing map system+ Risky's ship and pirate flares replace Warp Squids (much more convenient travel than before)+ Twice as long to complete (not counting Pirate Mode)+ Movements and attacks are faster and more fluid+ More meaningful dialogue and story+ Artwork of characters has improved and looks more like a visual novel during dialogue+ Save files now display %completion and location of last save+ Different attacks do different amounts of damage instead of them all being considered one "hit"+ Better quality and more memorable music (the soundtrack is also twice as long)+ Graphics settings now allow true fullscreen (no black bars or stretch) for 1080p monitors+/- Graphics are more or less the same as Risky's Revenge+/- Weapons and items replace transformations and magic
(I personally like this game mechanic but some people would prefer the hallmark transformations of the previous Shantae games)Shantae (GBC) 100% complete updateIts kind of funny how I ended up playing this series in reverse order
 Now on to the update:Pirate's Curse has many references to the original GBC game
 Many of the songs heard in this game are actually remastered from the old chiptunes of Shantae
 While the original game was MUCH more difficult in terms of travel from one area to the next, I feel like Pirate's Curse was a nice change from most of your troubles being day travel (or rather NIGHT travel when enemies were twice as tough) to more emphasis on labrinths, quests, bosses, and overall story
I still think Shantae is one of the best GBC games out there so don't discount it just because I said Pirate's Curse is better
 If you ever do get a chance, play Shantae (GBC)
 Verdict: Buy it now out of 10Thanksgiving Sale 2016 Edit: Gimme my badge, Steam
Posted: 23 April, 2015
(Note: I fully completed this game on the Wii U, so I have the experience to write a review)Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a 2D Metroidvania Style Platformer with a little bit of RPG sprinkled in
 The game takes place after Risky's Revenge
 There's a spirit of a once evil pirate called the Pirate Master
 His spirit awakens to find out he's capable of taking over Sequin Land, and tries to spread the area with Dark Magic, effectively ruling it slowly but surely
 It's up to Shantae, paired up with Risky Boots, to stop the Pirate Master by going to multiple islands and taking out the areas where he's getting his power
This game is SO much better than Risky's Revenge ever hopes to be
 It has a much faster pace overall, so it never feels sluggish
 Shantae's attack, movement speed, and even the gameplay itself is generally quick, making killing enemies much less slow and tedious, and making the game overall a better, more paced experience
 Other than that, it also has a much more interesting story with tons of character dialog and more immersive character development with funny and witty humor
You aren't limited to one huge area like in Risky's Revenge, but you now have multiple islands to explore, each with their own individual theme and secrets to uncover; also their own dungeon
 It certainly brings a breath of fresh air very often with each of the island's own unique style of puzzles, platforming, and fights
 Pretty much makes the game itself very diverse so nothing is boring
Shantae can no longer dance, but find some of Risky's pirate gear so she is granted more abilites
 For example, she can find Risky's hat to have herself gently float downwards or use wind to go up, or Risky's pistol to solve puzzles and shoot enemies from afar
 You'll find a new item in each dungeon, and they are well worth the journey to get them
 Of course, it also makes the puzzles much more variedThe game is a little more on the RPG side this time around
 Shantae's hair and Risky's weapons can be upgraded, and Shantae can even learn some new moves
 It takes lots of money to get everything fully upgraded, so spend your gems wisely
 It doesn't sound like much, but it's actually alot to upgrade
 There's also healing items that enemies drop, and sometimes even attack items
 You can access all of that by simply going to the item menu and using it, easy peasy
Overall, this game is wonderful, and a FANTASTIC step up from Risky's Revenge
 If you can get this, get it
 It's a wonderful platformer series that has a great, memorable story, and fun, fast gameplay
9/10

This game is spectacular
 If you enjoy platforming games you owe it to yourself to try this one out, either on the Wii U or on my personal preference here on steam
The art style is vibrant, colorful and full of life, as are the environments, characters and Shantae herself
 The dungeons and various islands are crafted to challenge your mind and creativity, while offering a wide variety of completely different enemies that don't hesitate to engage you
 As you progress you're granted new items that introduce unique facets to the gameplay
 One delicious layer of cake after another, the sweet saccharine icing of course being the tight, responsive controls that let you play exactly how you need
 The plot is immediately engaging, and the music really psyches me up
 If you were put off by the brevity in the prequel "Risky's Revenge" then you have nothing to fear
 There's a huge supply of content in this sizable, well-polished package

This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer
Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a platformer game which was initially released on the Nintendo 3DS and WiiU
 It's the third in the Shantea series
 I haven't played any of the previous one so I was a little behind on the story here
The game was released initially in 2014 and was ported to Steam in April of 2015
 The 3DS release of this game was actually nominated for the best platformer and was also in the Top 10 games in the Nintendo 2014 survey of fans favorites You play as Shantae, who is a half-genie
 You goal in the game is to save everyone from "The Pirate Master", with the help of her what appears to be long standing nemesis, named Risky Boots
 Throughout the game you will find various different "pirate equipment" such as pistols and cannons, these items are all used at various points in order to progress through the story
 You can also upgrade all of your equipment too to make them more effective
 This game is said to be the biggest in the series in terms of how many locations are included for you to explore
 We also see a familiar mini-map screen you will have seen in Metroidvania style games before
 The actual gameplay is very Metroidvania too, lots of jumping puzzles, thought based puzzles, enemies, collecting jewels and gems to find and chests with equipment and keys in to find
 The game uses a 2D graphics engine, which I can imagine looks pretty good on the 3DS, however it does look like a bit of an emulated game on the PC
 The dialog scenes look nice, but the actual in game graphics are very pixelated, granted some people enjoy that style so that may right be up your street
 I must warn you, this game is not easy at all
 You will die, and die, and die plenty of times
 It may even have you rage quitting at points that it is so frustrating, but you can't help but load it up again in order to move on
 The difficulty curve is very up and down, sometimes you can be going through one level and think its actually quite easy, then all of a sudden you are failing countless times on a specific area in the zone
 Being hard is not a bad thing at all; it's actually something I really look for in a game
 I did have to revert to Youtube videos for hints on how to get past some levels though
A full playthrough of Shantea and the Pirate's Curse took me almost six hours
 Sadly I don't think there is much replay-ability to be had here; once you playthrough it the once - there is really no other reason to playthrough it again
 This is actually a well put together port to the PC
 The developers have gone to the effort of adding full controller support along with a graphically helpful control screen to go along with it
 I would highly recommend you play this game with a controller aswell; playing on a keyboard would be a disaster
 I would recommend Shantea and the Pirate's Curse; but not at full price
 I think the six hours it took me to complete along with the zero amount of replay-ability means you should really be picking this up on sale
 However I did enjoy playing it, it is in no way a bad game
 I am looking forward to trying out the other games in this series now

After achieving 100% in Shantae, and spending 8 hours on the entirity of the game, I can say it was one of the best metroidvania's I've played
There are plenty of powerups, and there are lots of secrets to discover
Also, the only complaint I really have about Shantae is how inconsistent the difficulty is
 For the most part, the game is easy, then once you get to a certain island, IT GOES INSANE, then you leave and it's easy, then at the end it suddenly goes insane again
 I'd rate it 85/100
 It's a solid game, and one that I am happy to have in my Library

In both its visual novel and anime incarnations, Higurashi When They Cry, also known as Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, is revered as one of the greatest horror/mystery works of their mediums
---If I liked the anime, will I like the visual novel
Definitely, without question
 The anime is a great adaptation in two ways
 First, it does not cut out or distort many important plot points, although there are certainly changes
 Second, it makes fantastic use of the advantages of the animated medium to create suspense
The visual novel, however, explains several key plot points better than the anime does
 Most importantly, the visual novel portrays paranoia and confusion far better than anime ever could
 The visual novel really gets you thinking like the protagonist thinks, whereas the anime just has you experiencing what the protagonist experiences
Chapter 1, Onikakushi, covers the first four episodes of the anime
---Two main things set Higurashi apart from otherwise similar horror titles
Slice of Life CamaraderieHigurashi in its entirety isn't just a story about how bad things happen and a bunch of people die
 At its core, it is a story about overcoming adversity (although the first chapter is very much about bad things happening)
Higurashi's early slice of life scenes reinforce this overarching positive theme
 They depict a group of friends who participate in cutthroat competitions on a daily basis
 They struggle and play dirty to improve themselves and each other
 It's very much not your usual slice of life
ParanoiaParanoia plays a huge role in the first few chapters of Higurashi
 Many characters deeply involved in the series of murders have yet to be revealed
 Two main characters have yet to be introduced
 The protagonist, and by extension the reader, doesn't know why or even what is happening
 In this way, Higurashi is quite similar to the visual novel Chaos;Head (excuse me, ChäoS;HEAd)
 An unreliable protagonist tries to survive and figure out what the hell is going on
You could say that Higurashi is to horror visual novels as Amnesia: The Dark Descent is to horror video games
---Higurashi is phenomenal bang for your buck in terms of both quality and quantity
 It is very much enjoyable as a standalone work, but also leads into a greater overarching story
 What are you waiting for

Higurashi is a classic VN
 It's had anime adaptations, its own manga series, OVAs, live-action films, even a third-person shooter
 The cult surrounding this VN undoubtedly made 07th Expansion what it is today
 How's the Steam release, then
Returning players will notice that the English translation has been entirely redone
 MangaGamer opted to do away with the subpar 2009 official translation and redid all of EP1's script from scratch
 The results are satisfying; characters speak naturally, inner monologues don't feel stilted, and wordplay is more sophisticated
MangaGamer contracted an artist to create new character art to replace Ryukishi07's original work
 Again, the results pay off as the new character sprites look professional and do a great job at conveying the emotions of the characters
 I personally prefer the new art to the old, but purists can switch between the two by simply pressing 'P'
 The Steam version of Higurashi runs on an entirely different engine than the original, an engine which allows the game components to be modded at the players' leisure
 Players who wish to use the PS2 character art, PS3 backgrounds, etc
 are easily able to modify Higurashi's files to do so
 The new engine doesn't interfere with normal gameplay at all, and returning players might not even notice it
All of these make the Steam version one of the greatest ways to experience Higurashi, but how's the story itself
 Engaging, to say the least; first-time players often find it difficult to stop reading once they've invested time and emotion into the plot and characters
 Each chapter ('Onikakushi' being one of eight) is roughly 7-9 hours in length, so you'll definitely not feel cheated for content by the time you finish
Higurashi has earned its acclaim/notoriety
 If you ever wanted to get into VNs, this is one of the best you can start with

A psychological horror game/novel that doesn't include jumpscares
Not many games like that exist today
EDIT: There is one or two scenes in the novel that made me jump a bit but I think i am in the minority there (The 'LIES
' scene in particular)
Posted: 17 May, 2015
Finally, a game that teaches players valuable life lessons such as:- Stay away from little girls with cleavers
- When in a town full of crazy people, try not to be home alone
- Don't do cocaine in phone booths

so good, it'll make your neck itch 
Posted: 16 May, 2015
Higurashi When They Cry is a series that spans 8 Chapters (or Arcs) in total and Onikakushi (Spirited Away by the Demon) is the first of 8 chapters
 The Steam version is a remaster of the original Sound Novel which includes the option to switch between the new sprites or the original sprites
The story in itself is a solid horror/thriller experience, it throws you in a shoe of Maebara Keiichi, a recent transfer student to Hinamizawa and his experience with his friend
 The beginning of the game shows you an all-happy go round group of friends and kyute girls that as they go about doing kyute things
 As the story progress, Keiichi discover that there was a bloody murder in Hinamizawa
 Confused and curious about what happen, he started asking his kyute friends about the incident but they keep denying it happens, which makes Keiichi starting to doubt his friends
 The story starts to get interesting around the end of Watanagashi festival, I won't spoil the rest of the story but expect a crazy ride after that
If you have already watched the anime, then you must read this VN (I know I said Higurashi is a Sound Novel, but blame Chunsoft on that one) since the anime butchered a lot of content from the VN
 There is no choice to be made since this is a kinetic VN and no it doesn't have voice acting even though it was promoted as Sound Novel (blame Chunsoft)
 Also this is just the first chapters/arcs of Higurashi so expect to shell out another $6 for Tsumiboroshi, Meakashi, Watanagashi, Matsuribayashi, Tatarigoroshi, Minagoroshi & Himatsubushi
 Based corporate :^)Closing this review, I recommend any oldf*gs out there (like myself ;-;) who have played Higurashi before to play this one not only because of the updated sprite, but also unifying all your Higurashi in one place (Steam) is nice if you didn't have the physical copy of all Higurashi
 If you're interested/new to the series, love horror/thriller genre or have watched the anime and still feel that it's lacking, pick this up and sate your horror/thriller need

As someone who watched the anime before playing this game, let me preface this review with the three words that resonated in me the whole time I went through this
So
Much
Content
This remastered sound novel contains the first four episodes of the anime
In rough numbers, this is about an hour and a half of content
As someone who can read rather fast, this sound novel took me almost nine hours
This wasn't two hours of good content and seven of boring padding, but rather nine solid hours of enjoyment
Seeing the thoughts behind Keiichi, the main character, change as the novel progresses, seeing more of the average day life that the cast goes through prior to Watanagashi, and just in general seeing things fleshed out so much more than in the show was wonderful
The atmosphere was perfect throughout, and the character sprites were much more engaging than I was expecting as someone new to sound novels
My only real complaint was the total lack of choices throughout
I know through the friend that got me into this series in the first place that later chapters will have them, but it was surprising to both of us that this one was completely on rails
This didn't detract from the story, but did feel a little disappointing
So, do I recommend this experience
Whether you've seen the show, or want to see what all the fuss is about before looking at either the rest of the novels or the show, I most certainly do
For $6, you get a book complete with backgrounds, character sprites, and sounds
You get a fantastic first chapter of a fantastic story
You get heartwarming moments, heartbreaking moments, and a few truly creepy moments
What more could you ask for
Posted: 27 January, 2016
First, a brief note to the uninitiated:This is not a pleasant story, whatever the screenshots may have led you to believe
 Beneath the veneer of a cheesy, run-of-the-mill school-comedy lies a cruel world of madness, terror, and violence
 Major characters die routinely; sometimes on-screen, sometimes off, but never in a peaceful manner
 Nonetheless, it is a highly compelling experience, and very rewarding if you can endure to the end of the series
 If this intrigues you, feel free to read on, but those looking for nothing more than a stereotypical anime-harem-style rom-com would do well to look elsewhere
 Higurashi may resemble that on a superficial level, but this is a series that delights in letting the reader think they know what is going on, even as it brings the façade crumbling down around them
 Now, then
Each chapter of Higurashi When They Cry is a seemingly self-contained story comprised of three distinct parts
 The first is indeed a light-hearted slice-of-life comedy, centered around a mixed-age group of students living in a remote Japanese village in the early 1980s
 Made up of four local girls and the protagonist, a boy who just recently moved into town, this group spends their time going to school, playing a variety of games together (usually under the threat of ridiculous and embarrassing penalties for losing), and generally goofing around
 This relaxed, easy-going atmosphere  filled with ruthless card games, lunchtime chopstick duels, and treasure-hunting at an illegal garbage dump  appears at first glance to be utterly inviolate; a tranquil, serene place where nothing tragic could ever happen
Inevitably, this atmosphere begins to sour, as the locals' carefully hidden secret  a four year long string of deaths and disappearances  starts to show through the illusion of a peaceful country village
 Seemingly straightforward on the surface, with little reason to believe they may be connected, these incidents nonetheless have some disturbing things in common
 The victims have some connection  albeit increasingly tenuous ones  to an old, hotly contested dam construction project
 And each of these events occurred around the time of an annual religious festival held at the village shrine every June
 While most try not to speak of them, particularly to outsiders, or pass them off as sad coincidences, these incidents invariably give rise to rumors of a conspiracy within the village to purge it of those perceived as enemies
 Or, among the superstitious, of the curse of an angry god
Finally, the proverbial dam breaks and events begin to spiral out of control in a sudden, rapidly escalating drama of suspicion, violence, and murder, suffused with a pervasive psychological horror that straddles the line between a supernatural malice and one that is all-too-human in nature
 Personal secrets are dredged up and sins exposed, showing characters the reader thought they knew in a very different light, while eerily echoing centuries old regional legends that speak of this place not as a quiet, insular community, but rather as a monstrous village of man-eating demons  oni, for those into Japanese mythology
 Who is at fault
 Is anyone at fault
 Could the crime have been prevented
 Do you even know what the crime is
At times switching gears so seamlessly that you hardly notice and at others doing so with a deliberately jarring abruptness, these three elements combine together to gradually build an atmosphere of tension, terror, and inexorably approaching tragedy, even as they challenge the protagonist and reader alike to uncover the truth of what exactly is happening in this tiny mountain village
Higurashi When They Cry is a visual novel in a stricter sense than most, known as a kinetic or linear visual novel that lacks player choice, as opposed to the more typical form of visual novel built around branching storylines
 Gameplay amounts to the same kind of player interaction that can be experienced by reading a traditional mystery novel  gathering clues from the narrative, building and revising a theory, and attempting to reach the correct solution before the author reveals the answers in the end
As previously mentioned, each chapter is essentially self-contained: covering roughly the same period of time; utilizing the same pool of characters (regardless of what may have happened to them in a previous chapter); and featuring the same general situation
 Yet each story also differs in various ways
 Different characters and their backgrounds take on the central roles
 New characters are introduced and previously minor ones are expanded upon
 Some plot elements are explained away, while others are unveiled for the first time
 And ultimately, a new, unique chain of events is brought about, leading to its own distinct conclusion
 Later chapters toy with this formula in various fashions, one notable way being by changing the protagonist to tell, or retell, the story from a different character's perspective
 All together, this allows the reader  through repetition, of sorts  to gradually start to distinguish the events that are fixed, that are certain, from those that can change, what is real from what is illusion, and try to piece together the truth, perhaps even finding the miracle that leads to a happy ending somewhere along the way
With each chapter seeming to have no bearing on the events in any of the others, this series can be understandably confusing for new readers, who will have difficulty working out exactly how the disjointed pieces are meant to fit together
 In the interest of aiding those not yet in the know I will offer this, decidedly non-spoiler, interpretation: consider each chapter as a particular path from a Choose Your Own Adventure book or branching-style visual novel, only written as its own individual story and given to the reader in sequential order
 While not entirely accurate, this viewpoint should allow new readers to reconcile the apparent disconnect between chapters until such mysteries begin to be revealed in the series' second half
Higurashi is also described as a sound novel, owing to the developer's emphasis on the use of background music and sound effects to help shape the atmosphere of each scene
 This is done exceedingly well, although many of the better pieces of music start to appear in the later chapters
 At the same time, the developer, 07th Expansion, and the game's author, Ryukishi07, are very much the Japanese equivalent of an indie studio, with Higurashi being their first project
 Nowhere does this show through more than in the graphics
 The background images are largely ordinary photographs with a filter over them and the original character sprites, while expressive and charming in their own way, are fairly amateur work
 The character sprites can be switched out to updated, more professional ones in the options menu, if so desired
There are some minor details regarding the translation that could use some polish, but overall it is a thoroughly engaging affair alternately capable of making the reader laugh out loud and sending a chill down their spine
 After letting Onikakushi and Watanagashi sit unplayed on my desktop for months due to time constraints, I just recently powered my way through both available chapters, promptly reread the entirety of the manga series, then played Onikakushi through again
 I'd have done the same for Watanagashi, but my love for Higurashi's quasi-sequel Umineko has flared up and stolen away my attention for the time being
As a long time fan of the When They Cry franchise, my only complaint is that the next chapter isn't out yet
 If you have even a moderate tolerance for what one prominent video game critic refers to as Anime Bull****, I cannot recommend this series highly enough

Ironically enough, good horror can often serve as an escape
 When you're fully immersed in a state of mind where your attention is drawn, or rather forced towards a source of fear and terror, the unpleasantness serves to pull your mind away from a life of deadlines, chores and unfulfillment
 In that sense, it's a lot like drenching bland food in plenty of hot sauce - sure, your mouth may sting to high heaven, but at least you don't have to taste what you're eating
In that sense, Onikakushi drew me in hard
 The premise isn't anything that original (an insular country town with a dark history harbours an unpleasant secret that you stumble upon by chance) but the execution is exceptional
 The degree to which it pulls you into the psychological state of doubt, terror, helplessness, paranoia and delusion is so extensive that I experienced horrible acid flashbacks at no less than four points in the story
 By the time it was over, I felt tangible relief
The main plot takes a while to get going - the buildup takes up almost half the story and is composed almost entirely of dumb anime tropes, if that sort of thing might turn you off (personally, I'm fine with it), but the payoff is well worth it
 I'd highly recommend this, especially at so cheap a price

This game has a niche target audience so I'll do my best to outline it below
 If i have to give a rating I would give it an 8/10 and reccomend getting it on sale
 I'm very aware that while I enjoy these games reccomending them is a bit dodgy as alot of people simply will not like what this game is
 It does what it tries to do but that wont appeal to ALOT of people
REASONS NOT TO BUY THIS GAME:This game is not mechanically deep, characters roles are pretty simple to figure, beyond buffs debuffs and manipulating the turn system theres not alot to learn, the last one is a nice touch but still not a good game for someone who wants to think hard about their strategy
Story is pretty poor in general (though not even close to as bad as rebirth 2 imo) and it has alot of repetition in monsters, dungeons etc
 The game is rated 12+ and that age level seems appropriate so if you're looking for adult images, look elsewhere
 Fanservice is tame and sporadic
It has quite alot of post game content through the free dlcs but unfortunately there is pretty much no way to progress to the last 4 areas or higher level fights in a
natural way
 To do these you simply turn on the "in-game power level hax" and grind levels for an hour or two
 This means that to keep things fun post game you have to carefully balance your levels or else you will be annihilated/untouchable
The difficulty is a bit low for alot of the games until you reach the ultra late-game at which point it reaches stupid levels and the only way to balance is essentially to be really careful about how you break the game (see above point)The 4th wall gets SMASHED repeatedly here
 All the games broke the 4th wall but this one just completely ignores to the point where even I got annoyed in later chapters and I'm normally immune to it
REASONS TO BUY THIS GAME:The games characters are the main draw
 Its a mix of a visual novel with a turn based rpg and the characters keep the visual novel element highly entertaining for the most part
 Having all the dlc characters active can make it a bit too much dialogue wise so I reccomend not using them for a first playthrough if you intend to do more than 1
 Some of the characters might drive some people crazy and as obvious as it might sound, anime like characters and reactions are plentiful so if you like anime you probably have a higher chance of liking this though I'm sure its not necessary
Having plutia and Nep as the 2 of the 3 main characters pretty much makes this game for me
 Is funny
 well I think so anyway :DThe battle system while simple is fun to play and the animations are really smooth
 If you have played the other games you have a good idea whats going on but this one is a step up on this front, not anything massively different just little things that make game more fun to play
 The entire interface is massively improved in this game too, it still has its flaws but the menu in this game alone is enough to make it the best of the three
Theres a challenge system introduced where you get little bonuses by completing challenges and while some of them are a little painful and the higher targets in many are RIDICULOUS, its still a nice addition
The game isnt too short at about 40-60 hours for a casual playthrough of true ending if you read everything, certainly not long by rpg standards but long enough that you wont feel ripped off

This game is much better than Re;Birth 1 and Re;Birth 2Just like Re;Birth 1 I completed it in 100% (all achievements, lvl 999, all bosses and events)
Battles aren't too easy (unless you're using super EXP plan from DLC), animations are as good as ever, story/characters/humor perfect
I bought it on discount but it's still worth those 28 Euros
 If you're Neptunia fan you have to buy this one
if you are new then I'd recommend playing Re;Birth 1 and Re;Birth 2 first before this
otherwise you'll miss a lot of jokes and references

Coupled with the bright, colourful art style and cheery soundtrack, I honestly struggle to see how anyone could play one of these games and not enjoy their time with it
 When compared with its original counterpart from PS3, Hyperdimensiondimension Neptunia Re:Birth 3: V Century doesn't have many new elements as we would like, just some added minor functions
 However, it's thanks to the improvements that the developers tried to include in the previous remakes that make this entry in one of the best iterations of all the franchise
 If you haven't played any game of the series, you could easily try this one
+60 FPS - 1080P+The Girls We Know+Fluid Combat System+A Ton Of Video Game References And Cultural In-Jokes+Museum Is Awesome+Soundtracks Are Better Than Ever-Pretty Hard To Play With Keyboard - Mouse (That's Not A Big Deal Of Course)-It Doesn't Offer the Same Amount Of Improvements Than Previous-Lack Of PresentationMy Review Score Is: 84/100 As Normal Gamer,And 110/100 As Member Of Lastation
I Hope All You Guys Enjoy,Boing

pros:- visually appealing with cute art - interesting story- nice music that isn't distracting or obnoxious and matches scenes well- more than one possible ending- strikes the perfect balance between being spooky and light-hearted- likable characters with charming personalities/interactions, including npcs- multi-dimensional: solve puzzles, play a mini-game, explore the mansion and unravel a mystery, rescue mission to save your friend, etc- possibility to earn achievements- halloween and fairytale themes throughoutcons:- short gameplay- small map
 the game pretty much takes place entirely inside the mansion, which is large (5F if you include the dungeon) but is still just one place
 the story still feels complete, but it would be cool if we could explore different areas more, even if it were just the house we live in at the very beginning- puzzles are interesting but not particularly challengingYou can tell that the developer put a lot of care and effort into this game and it is very enjoyable to play- to the point that I immediately tried getting a different ending after finishing my first one
 In my opinion, the fact that this game is free is reason enough to overlook and even justify the cons I listed
 I really recommend giving this game a chance

A relatively short RPGMaker horror game
 There are a few spooks but this game is more about story and puzzle than actual scares (there's a reason for this but I won't spoil it
)
 I had a lot of fun working through the rooms and was very satisfied when I got the True Ending
 Extras are unlocked so also has some replay value and lots of secrets to discover

Such an enjoyable little free-to-play game, I would have happily paid for the experience
 Unlike other games who merely put on a cutesy face in order to hide more highly disturbing aspects underneath, Trick n' Treat is a pure lighthearted romp through and through
 I love that about it, especially since I have two daughters who are just starting to get into playing "scary" games, and it was absolutely perfect for them
 (my youngest especially loved the fact that one of the main characters, Amelia, had the same name as her)
 I wouldn't classify this as a horror game per se, but more a mystery adventure game with spooky thematic elements
 The art is adorable in its clean simplicity, the characters are likable, the music helps set the mood and the writing is sure to make you giggle
 There's plenty of candy to collect and rooms to explore
 I found all the puzzles to be very original and have just the right amount of difficulty; not impossible but definitely will require some creative thinking
 I enjoyed this so much and found the story/characters so interesting that I have already begun playing the demo for the prequel, The Witches Tea Party
 Can't wait to see more of the colorful and magical world the dev has created
Posted: 27 September, 2016
Trick and Treat is a
pretty neat indie adventure game
 The game has some puzzles and horror, so if that sounds interesting at all I would recommend giving it a try
 Trick & Treat is free, its got decent art, decent soundtrack and gameplay I enjoyed
Posted: 29 October, 2016
Trick & Treat is a short RPGMaker game in which you help a pumpkin girl find her friend during a little trick-or-treating mishap
 Unlike most other RPGs of this kind, you don't fight any monsters in Trick & Treat - your task here is to explore the manor and solve various riddles and puzzles along the way
 The gameplay is simple yet enjoyable, the graphic is charming and all in all, the game as a whole looks and plays much better than I would expect from a F2P RPGMaker title
 Wholeheartedly recommended for the halloween afternoon :)
Posted: 28 September, 2016
The game was appealing and cute
 It was fun to play and not to difficult
 I loved the concept of it
 It reminded me of playing Zelda as a kid
 The only thing I didn't like was it only took me and hour and a half to complete and that was with me playing around in the extras section afterwards
 Other than being disappointed in how soon it was completed it was a pretty cool game
Posted: 24 July

Alright, alright
 Seriously
 This game is FREE
If that, plus the extremely high ratings from the reviewers isn't enough to convince you to try it, I'll just add my review as well
 I suck at reviews so I don't write them often, but some games just deserve my recognition
To begin with, it is worth mentioning that this game was built with RPG Maker, such as multiple other games released on Steam (and which accidentally, are overpriced and atrocious in the majority)
Well, don't let that mislead you - Eternal Senia is in NO WAY even close to being considered a bad game
Here are the reasons:1
 The combat system
No, it's not using the usual boring turned-based combat system from RPG Maker
 Yesss
Instead, the developer designed his very own ARPG battle system, which means that the combat happens on-screen, directly on the map as you encounter enemies
 No button mashing either
 You just walk into an enemy to fight it
"But wait, doesn't that get very boring very quickly
"Nope
 The developer didn't forget to add diversity to the combat system either
 Firstly, different enemies you encounter will have different combat skills
 Secondly, YOU will unlock skills as well
 The combination of perfectly balanced skills and enemy difficulty makes this game's combat system extremely appealing and fluent
2
 The story
Did any of you ever play a game which, although being fairly short, took you on a ride on a wave of emotions
 Because this is an approximately accurate description of this game's story
I won't be lingering on talking about the story - after all, I'm not here to spoil anything
All I'll say for now is that the game has a total of 3 endings, all very slightly different
 However, remain reassured that luckily, all three endings will not require you to replay the entire game; saving the game when prompted is recommended if you want to go back and get all the other endings (which I HIGHLY recommend, by the way)
The only thing which may turn off a few of you grammar nazs is the fact that some words may be spelled incorrectly, and some grammar mistakes can be found in the text
 But give the developer a break here - this is translated, you should be happy that you can have it in English language at all, right
 Besides, it's not God-awfully bad, in fact it barely even annoyed me, a grammar freak
Overall
Wait, you're still reading
 You probably would have had the time to download the game already
Seriously though, give it a try
 Come on
 It's free for fu
 For the love of video games
 What have you got to lose except a few minutes, which is what you've just wasted reading my longer-than-was-supposed-to-be review
TL;DR: Definitely worth playing
 And IT'S FU
 It's FREE dammit
What have you got to lose, right

There's a Legendary SheepThere are Multiple EndingsThe combat is amazingStory made me cryMy family questioned the large amount of tissues in the trash10/10 Would cry again
Oright, Now I'll be serious
I've played through all endings, and to say the least, this game was the closest to making me cry out of all games I have ever played
 There is a few grammar errors, but I would let that slide since the game was originally made in chinese
 I have enjoyed both of my playthroughs of this, and you can probably 100% it in about 4 hours tops
 There is news of a sequal, though I've heard the developer is only planning on releasing it on Android, Which if he does, Will probably get me close to crying as well
 Oh, If anyone wanted to know, Difficulty does NOT affect the ending
Overall, the game is fun and easy to play, But as a warning
Don't fight the final boss on hard mode, The nuns will make you rage
(It took me well over 100 trys to beat the Hard final Boss)Oh and can we get some fan art of Senia in that white shirt
 It sure was sad and probably the main cause of all my tissues
Posted: 27 September, 2015
This game is not free, as it requires you to buy alot of tissues for your manly tears
Posted: 14 August, 2015
Lo' and behold, fans of Ys and Mana series 
 
 
 this game is definitely worth a playthrough
Be warned, the story is an emotional rollercoaster
 I am a complete wimp when it comes to well-written somber stories
A story rich Action-RPG that really stirs the heart
 Everything about this game was taken into extreme care and consideration for all players
 It is relatively short, the game takes around 4 hours to fully complete
 I guarentee this game is not a waste of time
The only negatives are:
-- Although this game has controller support, you need to use the keyboard at some parts and there is no setting to rebind keys
-- The grammar is not 100%, seeing as the game is originally Chinese and translations were not done by a professional, so I won't judge too harshly
You saw the price
 Well
After playing this game, you will begin to wonder if half the games in your library were worth paying for

This is a moving and great game
I don't usally play RPG games at all, but this game
 was a exceptionGood:The Story is rich and full of meaning, your always finding out more things about the characters and backstory throughout the gameIt's easy to learnit may only have 4-5 MAIN levels but they are VERY VERY
 well done and good hidden secrets
For a small RPG game, it has aout 5-6 hrs of gametime and i didnt even collect all the sercets
I'm not gonna ruin the game but the endings
actually made me cry alot
 they ARE movingThe Art in this game for the endings and other parts are high detail and truely amazing
A Ton more
Cons:I only have one
 PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER ONEOverall 10/10 on the Wolf ScaleIt is rather sweet and careful constructed story and this game really deserves alot of praise
I will be playing this game again
 I can't get enough of it
Posted: 6 July, 2015
It's free ARPG but it's content is much more than a free game suppose to have
Good:- Nice Japan Animation graphics similar to Nihon Falcom (Ys series) style- Above average sound track- Easy to learn control and system- Skills and Equipment craft system are well done and keeps character grow up in the story progression- Story so far is interesting, especially for "Sister-sister relationship" lovers- Free of charge to own everythings of Eternal Senia, no DLC skins or map packBad:- No Full Screen or Exit game switches in game
 But it can deal with Alt+Enter and Alt+F4 for those familiar with common Windows Hot keySuggestion:- ***Updated*** Add Controller support will be very nice thing <--Confirm have controller support when press F1 in game, thanks for commentors- Purely for me, I would enjoy player character can select male or female to enjoy "Sister-brother relationship"
Score: 80/100, Recommend Everyone should try this nice game as free stuff

8/10I admit, this game got me by surprise on the simple way it work
 The story element digs you in
There is a lot of deep story built in and the game is pretty good
More than one ending
 Ever since I started it, I was hooked and I got to the end
When you see all the endings though, you got to hand it to them
However I do believe there could have been a "better" ending to them
Nonetheless I find this game truly exhilirating
My recommendation to those who want a free, on thier own time game
If you liked One way Heroics, Half minute hero, and to the moon
 You will enjoy this game
The music is really captivated around the storytelling that helped make people understand the mood in a game which few do

This game is as simple as it is awesome
It's cute, with retro graphics and peaceful enviroment
It's simple, doesn't have that much complexity
It's silly, lots of problems and conversations are worth reading
It's funny, as simple as it is it has some great and silly puns
I can only wish for more content to this game, but as it is right now with its 20m max
 of gameplay, it's a great game to try out, I had lots of fun playing it, venturing out and solving everyone's problems, the speech is great and it's a good game to relax
10/10 would marry an empty chest again

Early Access Review
Despite being a dating sim, this game teaches some valuable life lessons:1: Any girl will forgive you for anything you did if you just pester them repeatedly
 No matter how much they hate you, they will bury the hatchet
2: You can flip burgers, be a janitor, make video games, surf, protest, and go to school all at the same time
3: Any girl will fall in love with you if you poke them in the face repeatedly
4: Everything is expensive
 Because of that, in order to get far in life, you must be Bill Gates
5: You can change your own gender at the press of a button
6: You can travel through realities
 In doing so, all girls you've met will forget you existed and you must make them love you again, but they grow to love you even faster, proving this is the land of Sonic
 You're too slow
7: Sitting still and doing nothing will still make girls love you, even if you completely ignore them
 All chicks love it when you play hard to get
8: Your parents are very disappointed in you for playing this game
10/10 would cheat on everyone again

Okay so pretty much, I was playing this game at about 3:00 in the morning
 I was tired as hell and didn't feel like putting on my headphones, and apparently my volume was really loud
 Next thing I know, My dad just randomly bursts through the door at the exact time I had an itch on my crotch
 He saw my screen then saw my hand on my junk
 He then left my room and never looked at me the same again

Pros:* It's free* It's funny & is fully aware of how ridiculous it is* It's frequently updated* Best, most accurate character creation ever
* It makes you feel thoroughly exploited
 Why is this a "pro"
 Because you're dating a dozen girls at once
 There's a moral to this story
 Cons:* It's a clicker / idle game* Since it's a clicker / idle game, you keep coming back for hours on end just trying to make things that take ages take less ages
* Honestly you shouldn't play this
 It's hard to escape
 You could be playing other things
 You could be doing something useful
 You could have written your own game, or book, or symphony
 But no, you come back and do the same thing you did the last 300 times but slightly quicker
 because it's so easy to do
* You will never escape
 Never
 Unless you cheat and set your clock forward or hack some files
 But
 that's cheating

It works surprisingly well
 I wasn't sure how good it would be, but it captures both facial expressions and head movement very well
Pros:- Accurate head+face tracking
 They seem to have nailed this technology
- 21 different models (some with alternative skins), from humans to orcs to raccoons and even dragons
 Some of them are a little creepy but there's enough variety and colour to keep it interesting, and they all work well
 (Also different backgrounds)- You can stream it to Skype/Twitch: one click of the Toggle Streaming button and everything your webcam usually sees will be replaced by the animation
Cons:- If you haven't got your webcam positioned quite right then it can lose track of you and the animation resets, which is *really* annoying
- Not always very obvious how to use it
 I can't figure out how to save the movies as a regular format (it has its own custom filetype)
 That might just be me, but there's no instruction manual of any sort
- Price
 $15 for what is essentially a gimmick, might not be worth it to you
- IT USES COMIC SANS
 I wish I was joking
These are only minor problems
 In conclusion, it's a good, fun piece of software

if ur not playing the first one (original fairy fencer f) , then skip that game and just go for this one
 there is many aspect that really similar to original one (the whole first half actually)
 maybe anyone who have the original fairy fencer f could say this is DLC for additional route (like me) and dissapointed
 if u ask is this worth the price
 well if ur not play this series yet, then yes if you ignore the original fairy fencer f and go for this one instead
Posted: 26 June
Oh boy if it isn't a great JRPG Yes i would recommend to anyone who is interested in JRPG and good content story then this game is for you, the only bad thing about this game is that sometimes u can get constant drop on fps and weird graphics when playing on dungeons
 Also, take note that this game has lots of farming to do as well especially on gold,wp and exp if u wan to max out everything
Overall would r8 it 8/10P
S
 - Play it with a pc controller it has better controls than keyboard :)

Way better than the original game but my issues is that if you listen/follow to the tutorial instructions, the game becomes too easy
 I only hit level 10 recently and all of the mobs are too easy
 Mobs either miss me and bosses only hit me for 100 damage max
 Might have grinded too much but I only do each encounter per dungeon once, so all of my "levels" come from doing WP skill point increases
 I also don't have any of the DLC so I am using the standard gear
 If you are alright at being super massively overpowered at the start, then this is the JRPG for you

If you've played one JRPG from Idea Factory, such as the Hyperdimension Neptunia series, then you already know what exactly to expect from FFF Advent Dark Force
 Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force is like an enhanced version of Fairy Fencer F but with more contents
 The amount of storyline gets tripled and has numerous of endings
 The combat system is same as always but you're able to add up to 6 characters in your party
 However, all of the enemies have higher stats just for this occasion, some were too OP
 The soundtrack is really incredible especially the songs from the ending of each routes
 The story is somewhat predictable but it didnt bother me too much
 Overall Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force is an excellent game with solid improvement over the original game that other JRPG fans will enjoy
 Looking forward to the possible sequel

 Top Nep
Free product does not equal biased review
 If I put a thumbs up, it's because I think the pros outweighs the cons, but that doesn't mean the game doesn't have flaws (which are written down)
This review pretty much mirrors what I've said in my review of the original Fairy Fencer F game, with some more things on the plus side, hopefully
 You'd probably want to read it first if you've never played Fairy Fencer F games before, otherwise just read below
The good- True HD, say goodbye to the (720p
) upscale
 It's extremely striking when you do a side-by-side comparison between the old graphics and the new ones
 It's not just the textures, there are more flora and stuff overall
 Colors are more vivid, and the world feels more vibrant
 I won't post any more screenshots for now, I'll let you discover/enjoy the rest
- 60 FPS, stable (if you care about that)
- Whole new story route, and slightly revised story routes for the old ones
- New playable characters
- Party size increased from 3 to 6
- Menu interface slightly revamped (recolor mostly I'd say)
- New easier and harder modes
- New dungeons & enemies
- New story artworks
- Tuned down gold achievement (was 100M in the previous series, which was ridiculous)
- The new, highest difficulty setting can be a challenge if you go commando
- Fast loading times
The less good- Game still suffers from the "Mash the attack button and that's pretty much it" syndrome, albeit a bit less now
 I still didn't feel the need to rely a lot on magic, although I recall using it more times than in the previous series
- Criticals from enemies are a joke
 Normal attacks = 300, crits = 3000
 Logic
When you're going for the 0 deaths/0 defeats/0 retreats stats, it's a real pain
- Elemental mechanics are barely, if at all, exploited in this game, which is a shame
 Same thing for the formation feature
- No real incentive to play on high difficulties (higher than Hard especially), since the game doesn't provide any incentive to do so (higher difficulties do not give you more XP/Gold/BP, just "better drops"
 apparently
 Maybe
)
Enemies on high difficulties are just bullet sponges and all you'll be doing is wasting your free time pointlessly leveling to try to kill that boss that stops your progression
 This is probably the aspect I regretted the most with this new iteration
- You'll have to do a lot of new game+ iterations to complete the gallery
Closing wordsOverall, the game left me with a positive impression, although I still feel that most mechanics are just an excuse for the story
 But since the latter is enjoyable, I guess that's excusable
If you've never played the original FFF game, this is the iteration to get
 If you've played the first iteration and wonder if you should get this one, I'd say go for it
 I played the first one quite a while ago now, and I enjoyed coming back to it once again, replaying the story with better graphics, solid FPS, new route and all the stuff
A pretty decent expansion to the original game, for newcomers and returners alike
Posted: 15 February
Definitely a True Remake from its Original Counterpart 2 hours into the game, the first thing you'll notice is the graphical upgrade
 Not the upscaled resolution from the Original game
 This game offers a
true native 1080p
support and better textures
 (For those who play games in 4K, you would have to wait for mods) As for language
Englsih, Japanese, Chinese
are available for you to choose from
I'm sure most of the players who played the Original are much more interested on the new routes this game had to offer
 Or you are me who just want to revisit the same route and see how much has changed
 Everything feels much more satisfying than I expect to be
Better gameplay, more party members, much more detailed story
(which is quite lacking from the Original) and so much more
 For those who are new to the game, I would say if you are looking for a in depth JRPG, this is not for you
 It's basically a visual novel with some light JRPG element (Pretty much like Neptunia if you ever play one before) PC Optimization I would say its way better than Megadimension Neptunia
 Everything is stable,
no random stutter
(which is most likely the game is using Adoptive V-Sync)
 Maximum Frame Rate is still
60 fps , don't expect something crazy like 144 hertz
 MORE IMPORTANTLY,
DEDICATED PC CONTROLS 
 Something that I always complain about an Iffy PC Port (although I use controller)
 For some reason there is not much graphical settings for you to tweak in the game, lets hope for an update to enable us to tweak what we wanted it to be (just like Nep VII)
 So for
lower end PC's , plz
do not buy this
for this very moment
 It is much more intense than Nep VII
I saw the reviews saying that the game is buggy etc
 For
NVIDIA users , try
add the game
in
Nvidia Control Panel 
 If it doesn't work, try
uninstall GeForce Experience
(if you don't use ShadowPlay) because that thing is a bloatware
 Unfortunately for
AMD users , there are a lot of times Iffy games just won't work properly with AMD cards
 Your best shoot is to
wait for an update 
 Plz Rate this up for the bug Steam is currently having on this Game Apparently if you buy the
Normal ver
of the game, you will get the
Full Deluxe Pack
for free
 (Just check the Game Folder before you start rating down)EDIT: The bug has been fixed
Posted: 23 June
Despite not meeting the minimum system requirement, the game still runs smoothly on my sluggish MBP 2012 with an integrated intel hd 4000 graphic processor chip
Is that enough 
Edit: For anyone who can't start the game, change your system date time setting to any date that is before July 1st

Pros1-6 character battle system2-Enhance battle system3-enchance graphics4-Dynamic character interactions/pairings5-Comedic dialog6-Dozens of hours of fun
7-Customizable combat8-New story paths are great and expand the overall experienceCons1- Cliche Character Personalities, 2-Linear, hallway like dungeons3-Despite strong on simple levels, many character interactions fall flat due to lack of meaning on a broad scale
4-Overly repetitive, bland side quests5-Predictable stories (if you have play the original game)For the fans of that series and its comedic tone, you will find the same style of comfort here
 For newcomers, if you can put up with how contrived the story can be, it may be worth a shot thanks to the exclusive content
 Fairy Fencer F: Advent Dark Force added much needed and requested changes, but not everything seems to have been addressed with this re-release
 The different paths you are able to take add more depth to the already well told story
 Though it more often feels like a Director's Cut than a true remake, 'Advent Dark Force' nonetheless turns a flawed PS3 RPG into a stronger experience overall, making it the absolute best way to play 'Fairy Fencer'
 The story has been made a great deal more interesting, playing with concepts that the original only hinted at, and the combat has been given a big shot in the arm thanks to the expanded party sizes and rebalanced difficulty
 The game's biggest issue is that it feels like it could've been improved a great deal more than it has, leaving us with a game that's good, but falls just short of greatness
 Still, it's a worthwhile adventure that lays down enough strong groundwork that could lead to a truly excellent sequel
FINAL VERDICT: 4/5Advent Dark Force went all-out in order to make the most definitive version of Fairy Fencer F that it possibly could
 This title should be a no-brainer for fans of the original Fairy Fencer F, and I would also recommend it to anyone in the market for a good JRPG
 Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force provides enjoyable gameplay, memorable characters, and a branching story good enough to warrant multiple playthroughs  and hey, isnt that all that matters

Product received for free
This review will attempt to be as spoiler-free as possible, although it may get a bit long
Full Disclosure: I received the game for free for participation in IFI's closed beta testing, although I purchased the original FFF myself over a year ago
What's New
For those who played the original FFF, this will probably be important
The entirety of the original game basically exists within ADF as the 'Goddess' route, which you'll naturally enter unless you do some very specific things early on
 There are some slight differences with respect to dialogue, event details, and character introduction timings in order to facilitate better story flow, but the overall story is exactly the same
The 'New Stuff' is mostly the two new story routes
 There are mechanical changes as well, with the most obvious being the doubling of the party size to an incredible six(
) characters, and a change in the way that Avalanche Attacks are triggered
 There are also two new recruitable characters when you get to the third route
The story routes themselves are all separate from each other
 I thoroughly enjoyed each of them, as they forced you to come to terms with, and get used to things you may not necessarily be used to doing
 Some may dislike the fact that character rosters change (temporarily,) but in my opinion, the new routes are best taken in as the game providing you with "what if" scenarios
Each route also has its own set of character-specific endings
 They each contain their own set of dungeons; Some are new, others are 'new' with recycled assets, and some are repeats of earlier dungeons
 The game has also been rebalanced a bit from FFF
Should I Get It
I enjoyed the game, but I cannot overwhelmingly recommend it
For players who are familiar with other CH/IF titles (e
g
 Neptunia series, or the original FFF,) you'll be familiar with how ADF plays out
 For these players, I'd recommend it if you are interested in the story it tells, as I feel that the story is much better, and more coherent, than Neptunia's
For players who are not familiar with similar titles such as the Neptunia series, it's tougher to recommend
The problem is that this game (like most of their other RPG's) is not a very deep or complex RPG
 If you are looking for a 'good' RPG for the 'RPG,' then I cannot recommend this game, as you will be let down
This game, instead, plays much closer to a Visual Novel with light RPG thrown in between
 The majority of the game time will be spent experiencing the story through dialogue/event sequences, before running off to clear simple dungeons, then repeating the process
 Thus, the focus is much more on the telling of FFF/ADF's story, than it is about playing an RPG
If this idea of a 'casual RPG' with a storytelling focus sounds appealing, then by all means, I would recommend the game
Price, however, is a contentious point
Certainly, there is enough content in ADF to justify being pricier than FFF; The new stories easily more than double the amount of content in the game compared to FFF
 Couple that with the new visual upgrades, as well as re-hiring voice actors to voice entirely new scripts, and you come up with improvements that are more than trivial
However, the price is still on the high end (comparable to Megadimension Neptunia VII rather than the Re;Birth series
) Whether or not these improvements are worth the extra cost is up to you, but I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in the game, and it's on a decent discount
Why Are The Requirements So High
The required specs can appear to be fairly high, although that's the hardware IFI wants to recommend in order to reliably achieve 60+ FPS throughout the game
 I have been running the game on an nVidia GTX-670 and i7-3770k at 1920x1200 with maximum graphical settings, and I was able to largely get 60 FPS almost everywhere
 The exceptions were certain dungeons with heavy particle effects where I would dip to the mid 40's
The Bottom LineUltimately, I ejoyed the game, and I helped to beta test the game because I thoroughly liked the original FFF's story, and really wanted to see the new stories present in ADF
 Story-wise, I can say that I was not disappointed; I loved every minute of it
However, I cannot provide a blanket recommendation because this game still hits somewhat of a niche audience, and you'll have to decide based on my comments above whether or not this is for you
 If you are at all interested, though, I would say definitely

TL;DR: Have you played Fate/Extra and/or Fate/Extra CCC
 Buy this
 Have played other Fate games
 Might be worth a buy
 Only watched the various anime
 Carefuly consider it
 Never had any contact with the series
 This is not the best place to start
As a disclaimer, I am a fate series veteran, played/watched most of all translated available material
 Finished most of the game by now, am waiting until the end to summarize properly what I think regarding the story
 All other points are still the same
PlotThe plot is a direct continuation from Fate/Extra CCC, the Japan-only highschool holy battle royale and waifu/bro simulator for the PSP
Being a direct continuation, you are quite literally thrown into the thick of things right from the start
 Following in the footsteps of the Fate/Stay Night visual novel, you cannot choose a route from the get-go, as they are meant to be experienced in a specific order
 Whereas in a game it might be seen as archaic for newcomers, I feel like it does help to tell a more cohesive story at the end
Written by Nasu with help of Hikaru Sakurai, the plot in the first part is, without mincing words, very predictable
 As I have not finished the game yet, I can't tell if the first part serves the same purpose as the Fate route in F/SN (or, in a broader sense, the entirety of Fate/Extra) to better ease the reader into the world and by the third part it is more interesting and wild
 Regardless, it was still very much a product you'd come to expect from Nasu, immensely poetic and descriptive as it is
More to the point, it is almost fanservice-y in parts, from character interactions to the roster
 Many if not all quips might fly above the head of even someone that is used to the fate series but hasn't played the Extra duology; newcomers even more so
GameplayGameplay is standard Musou/Dynasty Warrior fare
 Murder mooks until the big guy comes out, murder big guys, use your big finisher move on the boss, yay
 For me, as a fan
 It's very cool
 For those who don't even know what happens when Archer uses his UBW
 Less so
SoundtrackIt works and fits the theme of the game
 If you've played Fate/Extra, you know what to expect
GraphicsGraphics are on the cheaper side of the spectrum
 Sometimes it does look good, but some of the moves and special cutscenes that zoom in the characters look stiff and very low definition
 Elizabeth Bathory's scenes are one of the biggest offenders
 Just looks hastily put together
 With the roster as frankly small as it is, when considering the franchise as a whole, this kind of thing is hard to defend
In closingMy opinion is that you should play this game mostly because of it's story
 Even then, that story is a continuation of a game that was never localized, that was a sequel and proper closing of a game for the PSP when it was already on it's way out
For someone like me, this game is entertaining, funny, and honestly what I'd expect from all parties involved
For someone who never touched the fate series or universe, I can't see them overlooking the repetitive gameplay, frankly boring first chapter, hard to understand story and apparently random selection of historical/mythical figures that may or may not be genderbent for whatever reason
______________________Edit 1: Formatting issuesEdit 2: Updated soundtrack impressions, and where I was in the story

Need more fate series on steam
Posted: 26 July
I can't do it
 I tried it on PS4 and on PC and I can't enjoy this game
 To be fair, this port is excellent*, but I can't defend the game
There is a lot of VN stuff here, and if you want Tamamo or Nero as your doting waifu, this game lays that on SO INCREDIBLY THICK in the VN segments that your teeth will rot from the sweetness
The musou part of the game
 It's
 perfectly playable
 I really have nothing bad to say about it for the sorts of people who just muck with musous for fun, to enjoy themselves
 There's a lot of flash, a lot of style, and a lot of waifus on offer (Though you won't get a free pick of them until you knock out large chunks of the games' main story arcs
)But I just can't stand the musou parts of the game
 There is nothing to your movesets
 The levels are just great big colorful cyberboxes where you warp from zone to zone
 At each zone, you have to stop and kill about 500 mooks to spawn the midbosses, kill two of them, kill another 500 (Triggering the "Holy cow chief, you killed 1000
 You are a true warrior of the holy grail
" message all of 40 seconds into the fight
), kill the second set of midbosses, then you finally have the zone and now have to do that eight or nine more times throughout the map
 This same kill, boss, kill, boss pattern is also how you do defense, so it takes just as long to repel an attack and shut your teammates whining for help up than it does to secure a new zone
If killing things were interesting in Extella, that would be fine
 But it isn't
 You do not have a Basara moveset
 You barely have a Warriors moveset
 While the moves are big, flashy, hit wide areas, and generally have an anime sensibility to them, they just aren't interesting
 And the stop-and-go pace just drags each mission out tremendously
 There is no fancy strategy or gimmick or story to be told in these levels, just the story of someone who has to walk to each room and slowly, laboriously clear it out while listening to your allies moan and wish you stopped attacking to clear out THEIR room
 Any time the game gets clever mid-mission, it usually involves you clearing EVEN MORE rooms and making your conquest of the map nearly sisyphean
 Worse, your musou attack is probably the least satisfying and most pointlessly long special move I've ever seen
 Your ultras are cool, but they are kinda big skippable corny anime cutscenes appropriate to the Fate franchise
 But you don't get those but once a match maybe and you'll probably mash that musou button most of the fight
 The entire thing feels like an amateur's first musou, and that's really what it is
 I rag on Senran Kagura, but Senran brings a lot better stuff to the table
 like Yumi, for instance
These are all little things, but they add up
 They may not be a big deal to you, really
 But if you're the sort who noticed that Samurai Warriors 4-2 just completely bungled large parts of the combat, or that One Piece Pirate Warriors 3 was secretly the best musou Koei had done, if you know what Sengoku Basara even is or why someone would want to play it, if you're a musou connosieur, I don't think Fate Extella will fit the bill for you
That's not to say Extella is a bad game
 I mean, I can't stand it and I think it's barely playable trash, but what is there, what effort they've put in, and the sheer amount of Fate fan-service
 There's an audience for this game
 If you aren't a musou snob, and you like the idea of having Tamamo and Nero practically beat the stuffing out of each other to prove which one loves you more, this might end up being something you like
 But I can't enjoy it
*EDIT: By excellent, I mean it runs smooth and loads quick
 I don't think it is hitting 60 FPS though, though the action isn't all that interesting enough to merit it, but I can understand disagreements on the issue
Posted: 15 August
You don't need EX Luck to pull Altera/Jeanne in this one

Fate/EXTELLA The Umbral Star is probably the best Dynasty Warriors-esque game out there
 The soundtrack is fantastic, there's a compelling story that even non-Fate fans can follow with relative ease, and the gameplay is great fun
The PC Port is flawless, it's incredibly optimised and runs at very consistent framerates
 You can see a direct comparison of graphics and performance between this PC release and the original PS4 release here: https://youtu

 With full controller support, and excellent performance, the PC port is every bit as good as it was on the PS4

Posted: 16 May, 2014
Before I say anything, 10/10
 If you have ever played and liked Mario Party, Fortune Street, Dokapon Kingdom, or any real or digital board game, this game should be given great consideration
100% Orange Juice goes into the long tradition of combining characters from different series by making them all into a single card game most recently done on Steam with Card City Nights or a board game most similarly done like Fortune Street
 This game decided to do both
 What I really enjoy about this game is that it is basically the first of its kind on Steam
 It combines many core elements from Dokapon Kingdom like combat and different stats, Fortune Street for promotions and board control, and Mario Party for stars and the 3 item max system (no minigames unfortunately)
 The main objective of this game is to get 5 normas
 Normas are objectives that you need to achieve by either collecting stars or killing enemies
 Once the objective is met, you need to land on an enemy orange or pass your own that you can automatically stop at even if you overroll
 Each Norma will give you an additional level up star, from a start of 1, and caps at 5 for the 5th norma is victory
 Higher stars mean you can use more powerful cards to help secure victory
A dice is rolled at the start of each turn
 Like other games of its kind, you can also use applicable items at this time, which this game implements as cards
 Each card, as mentioned earlier, does have a minimum level requirement, so overly strong cards will not come out till late game
 Across the board are many spaces
 Green draws a card, red fights an enemy, yellow gains stars based on roll after landing, blue drops stars based on roll after landing, purple warps to another purple, and the orange marker is each corresponding colors base that can automatically stopped at to get a norma if it is your own or landed on for the same purpose if not your own and can be used to heal
 There is also a grey space that does nothing :(
 The combat in this system is really reminiscent of Dokapon Kingdom
 In this game you can choose to fight whenever you pass an enemy or have to fight when another player fights you or you land on a red space
 Each player only gets to do one attack and one defend each encounter
 You can use applicable cards before combat if you have any that apply
 During combat, the main decider of things is how high you roll for an attack and what defensive stance you take
 When defending you can either defend, which will reduce the attack into their roll minus your roll with a minimum of one, or you can evade, which will completely avoid the attack only if you roll higher than the opposing roll
 There are also boss battles that sometimes occur on red spaces that drop a lot of stars
 If you reach 0 hitpoints, you will have to roll a dice to revive
 It requries a roll of 5 or higher and then goes does by one each turn you fail
 You also lose half your stars upon death and these go to the oppoment if defeated by that person
This game is a lot of fun and you should strongly consider it
 The only complaint one may have is this game contains a lot of pulp
 Hours upon hours of "pulp"

A board game that relies completely upon one's ability to simply admit defeat from the get-go
 You will go into this game expecting a fairly innocuous and casual romp best enjoyed with friends, and leave it screaming like an animal, cursing your very existence along with anyone who has wronged you while playing
 Expect nothing and remember that when you're in the lead, your demise is right around the corner
 After hours of playing this game online, I've adopted an almost zen stoicism; if I'm two tiles away from completing an objective, I know I'll roll a one and get warped to the other edge of the map
 I'm a changed man
 100% Orange Juice has lead me to renounce all expectation and desire, and to assume the worst from every situation
A fun, lighthearted board game for enjoyment with friends, 10/10
Posted: 9 April, 2016
100% Orange Juice is an interesting board game that relies heavily on luck, which can complement or negate a players skill
 The game has a vast array of characters, all drawn from games made by the publisher, Fruitbat Factory, and the developer, Orange_Juice
 GameplayBefore you play the game, you must choose out cards which have a unique effect on the gameplay
 Each player puts in 10 cards into a community deck, meaning that any cards put in have a chance of being used by any player (aside from the characters special ability cards)
 Each character is balanced in some way so that it is not too powerful, having either raised or lowered stats, as well as a higher or lower hp based on their stats to help even the playing field
 I always thought of this game as an anime Mario Party, except without the mini-games after each turn
 At the end of the turns, there is a chance of a boss monster appearing, or a board effect (which are chosen before the game starts, or already stuck into effect in campaign), which can damage players, regenerate health, and various other things as well
 Each tile has its own effect, which makes the game far more interesting, especially for players figuring the game out for the first time
Visuals and AudioThe game is very pleasing to the eye, where everything is so lively and colorful
 The darker levels have a unique charm that contrast quite nicely with bright colored characters and tiles
 The soundtrack is different for each level and compliments that level nicely, making each level have its own unique touch
MultiplayerMultiplayer is still alive and well even two years after release
 From the games I joined, the community is relatively friendly and is still welcoming to new players that try to pick up the game
 Some games within multiplayer can be shorter than others, but can range from around 45 minutes to well over an hour
 This is where most people play, as it can be more enjoyable to chat and play with real players while you play than bots
 The randomness makes it a big addiction for players, as you never know what will happen that round, nor how good your luck will be
Verdict: 8/10This game will show you your friends true nature, and will test not only your luck, but also your ability to think ahead as well as your patience
 Thankfully this game doesnt have an in-game voice chat, or everyone would hear you scream when you keep getting low numbers

100% Orange Juice is an adorable game that successfully keeps me coming back for more whenever I get the chance to play with friends
 Using dice, cards, and even turn-based combat (in a very simplistic way admittedly) this game has the full 100% of my approval, especially at its price
 There is also a campaign where you can unlock more characters who, like the initial batch you get, have passive skills and their own attributes, which serves to make them more individualized
And don't even get me started on the customization, you'd be here all day
 I'll just leave it at this: "The characters are highly customizable with currency you earn in game that you can spend in the shop
" Trust me, if I go any deeper than that you'll think I'm annoying
That said, I highly recommend 100% Orange Juice for those who want a cheap game they can all play with friends, be they fans of anime or just fans of board games
 Heck, even if they aren't fans of either, I think they'll like this one

100 PURASENTO ORANJU JUSO
 is a cute and fun virtual board game
Gameplay is fun, and cute graphics definitely adds to enjoyment
 Randomness plays a big role in who wins, but with proper character and card selection, you can generally tip the odds in your favor against AI (at least on normal difficulty, and except for the maps that are meant to be hard)
 100% OJ also has online multiplayer with easy matchmaking, so if you dont like playing against AI getting into a game with real people is quick and easy
Fully recommend it if you like board games or just looking for a fun casual game to play

Early Access Review
My favorite things about this game:-Each and every abnormality has a unique backstory
-Unique deaths of workers by abnormalities, (Singing Machine's kill is most terrifying to me)-Large updates make the game better by adding more abnormalites and overall improvement of the game
-Learning how to take care of each abnormality the HARD WAYThings I don't like about the game:- Repetitive gameplay, but I don't mind it much, I play the game for the abnormalities
Posted: 2 January
Early Access Review
Think a mix of Lab of the Dead ( A game where you experiment on zombies to get reactions out of them) Fallout Shelter (The Base layout that is) and the character visual design of Don't Starve
 The game has a LOT of fun ideas in it
 You are the manager at the Lobotomy Corp, which extracts energy from 'abnormalities' by putting them in a certain kind of mood
 The trouble is, the abnormalities range from helpful to your staff if treated right, to
game ending horrors
The most enjoyable part of the game is discovering what each of the abnormalities do
 From the Shoes to the Teddy Bear to even the cross skull (god I love that one), it is a sickening thrill to send in an agent to see if they get killed
if they are lucky
 SCP Foundation and Cabin in the Woods inspired the developers, but they have managed to create characters that feel fresh and interesting
 Beauty and The Beast is one that makes me feel rather sad and disgusted
 However, an issue I have with the game is how unsure of itself it is
 In that the idea that your motivation is
collecting energy instead of trying to figure out what these things are
 Lab of the Dead had a convincing motivation (you are trying to figure out how the zombies work to develop a vaccine/cure), and SCP Foundation it is more about protecting both the abnormalities as well as the world in general
 Now, a cynical game about collecting energy from abnormalities is fine, It's that it's too vague about the application of said energy or even what is outside of the base
 If the game was kind of like X-Com where you send agents out to collect Abnormaltiies, that would be an incredible way to justify the use of energy as well as give the player an incentive to learn more about the world
It also feels unfinished in a way that doesn't make a $20
00 price point seem justifiable
 The game doesn't loop music in a natural way, the sprites tend to run and bump into each other, there are a lot of grammer mistakes as well as just
it feels more like a flash game on Newsgrounds
 Would I reccomend this game: NOT YET
Give this game more time to actually justify the 20
00 price
 If you feel that you want to keep the game a mystery, then you should wait till it is released
 Otherwise, it is a game that needs a clear motivation for the player and a way to use Energy

Early Access Review
I have to give this a downvote for now
The game is FAR too hard
 Like honestly, way too much
 Dependant on way too much RNG too
Examples: - You have the Red Shoes anomaly yet you only have 2 agents, both are female
 Sucks to be you
- You have the Woman against the Wall anomaly and both agents are optimists
 Same deal
- I have 3 employees, one panics, I use the other 2 to supress them, however their panic response is murder
 They kill one employee, and now I have 1 less employee to supress the murderous employee
 So I lose
- Reaching a new department just to save your progress is tough work
 I had a hard time getting to level 3 no less, got to level 4, new anomaly comes about and everyone dies
 Back to level 1
 Why
- I'm trying to calm down an anomaly so I send someone in to calm it down, they screw up a few times and get some psychological or physical damage
 Now they're hurt and they have to wait before going in again, so I send someone else in, but then they're hurt and the other hasn't recovered yet
 Nor can they work on a different anomaly for fear of sending them insane or killing them
 Eventually I have 4 employees resting up to tackle their job again while the anomalies become stressed and escape
 I can't contain them with weakened employees, so I lose
 And that's on 2/3 recovery researched
I really really like the game, and the premise is excellent, but the difficult needs heavy work
 It's a shame, and as soon as it's fixed I'll swap my recommendation but till then
No

Disclaimer:The developers' primary language isn't English, this game was originally demo'd in Korean so there are going to be some slight grammatical errors here and there
 They aren't severe enough to really detract from the game though
Welcome to Lobotomy Corporation, AdministratorLobotomy Corp is best described as a management / simulation game with perma-death
 You're assigned as the administrator of a facility hosting SCPs Abnormalities
 Lobotomy Corp has developed technology to harvest "energy" from these Abnormalities as a saving grace for humanity
 Sounds easy right
 Well, not really
Every Abnormality is unique and has its own fully fleshed out character
 But, just like SCPs, Abnormalities can wreak havoc given the chance
 As the administrator, not only is it your job to keep these Abnormalities happy, but it's also your job to keep your employees safe
 Easier said than done, every employee comes with an array of stats that will detail how effectively and efficiently they can perform their job; whether their job be feeding an Abnormality or caving the head in of one of their fellow employees
The game itself doesn't give you much to go on in determining exactly how to handle Abnormalities which does make the game a tad more difficult (i
e
 what exactly having an employee perform a "consesus" with an Abnormality actually does)
 There's also several mechanics in the game that are left unexplained and up to the player to figure out
 It's a bit intuitive and there's a bit of a learning curve
Progression for story mode is divided into "days" with each day becoming progressively harder as new challenges continue to be added for the administrator to handle
 At the start of each day you're allotted a number of employees who you can assign to each section of the facility to perform tasks for the abnormalities in that area
 This adds an element of strategy to the game as the player is forced to divvy up exactly who he wants where to match the preferences of the Abnormalities, etc
To actually complete a day, players are required to (at least in the early days) harvest a specific amount of energy from the Abnormalities in the facility
 This is done by keeping all of the abnormalities in a good mood
 Likewise, abnormalities in a terrible mood will also detract energy from the gauge, along with going berserk on the employees
The game is fairly straightforward with a slight undertone of complexity which makes for a very interesting game overall
 To add, the story also presents itself through the administrator's accompanying AI who drafts notes and details logs about ongoing events throughout the facility
Tl;drI'd definitely recommend buying this game if you're interested in management / simulation games
 I haven't had any performance issues though that's likely because the game is a smaller management game produced in Unity
I'd also highly encourage fans of SCP to check the game out

Early Access Review
I got this game a few months ago and I loved it
 The bad translation was a turn-off, yes, but I could get past it because the dialogue was minimal and the game gave me enough other information to get by
 I loved it
 I didn't log back in for a while because I was busy with other things, and when I get back suddenly there are strangely drawn anime girls all over the place and the bad translation is now a huge barrier because there is no real tutorial and the basic onformation about each separate anomaly is hidden
 Plus there are now a maze of menus and pop-ups to navigate before you can get to the actual gameplay
 Developers, it you're reading this, Angela was a nice touch
 All these other people are just bogging down the storyline with pointless drivel
This game has always been a touch frustrating to play because each entity is unique and it takes some trial and error to figure out what to do and it's very easy to get people killed, plus the weapons you can give to employees are difficult to obtain and largely useless
 The only way to get to these weapons now is through the anomalies, which is just a touch counter intuitive when the anomaly is what is killing your employees
Overall, this game has massive potential, but the new direction does not bode well for it
 The problems it had before could have been fixed with a decent translation and a tutorial, but now the whole system is so unwieldy that I can't see any light at the end of the tunnel
I'd wait for the game to update a few more times before making the decision to buy it or not
 Maybe they'll turn it around, maybe they won't

This game is not what I expected
 I thought this would be a capture and contain type of game where you made sure the evil creatures didnt escape
 Its kind of like that but with more story to it
 Here are some of the pros and cons of the game though:PRO'S:Interesting storyUnique gameplayGreat Skill systemUnique CreaturesCON'S:No actual tutorialGets hard after Day 2Has no real explination on what to do, and how to do it
Other than that this is a great game, I love the concept and story behind it
 This game should be supported even after its final production
 In end, this game will be woth the money and is definitly worth the time

Early Access Review
Ok, here we go
I got this game at the urging of one of my friends, gave it a look and decided to try it
 I have to say it is truly a love, hate, wanna rip my face off out of frustration game that I believe is competely worth it
 Its basically a TIME/RESOURCE MANAGEMENT game
 (I say resource because the "time" doesn't really matter) You are monitoring monsters that are used to generate power and fill a quota for the day
 (with no time limit (yet)) While allocating employees to interact with the monsters to affect their power outputs or at least keep them from slaughtering everyone in the facility
Now, before I get into pros and cons I have to say that this game is sorta like a wash and repeat
 You start your day, do same tasks and reach a goal
+Has intresting monsters with surprising backgrounds that you may remember
+Shows signs of something happening behind the scenes
 (more content/updates to come)+The moments of quaranteen outbreaks are atleast entertaining as you watch your workers be slaughtered
+Monster Information passes over to the next game/checkpoint restart
+Its very satisfying to learn a monster's preferences completely
+Your character has to perform a couple tasks as well
 (not just siting and watching the monitor)+Still being worked on
-You will lose employees a lot
 (poor Jim)-Frustration builds pretty quick trying to learn about specific monsters
 (at least for me)-Can't locate a worker immediately if he panics
 (have to look for them)-AI's comments do speed by pretty fast
-Still being worked on
I found the game very engaging and entertaining and don't agree to some of the negatives other gamers have brought up cause I have no problem spliting my attetion for multiple tasks and manage finite resources at the same time
 But I do indeed agree that the game is still a little rough around the edges and has room to improve
 Which since updates are still coming hopefully means it will
 Price is a little steeper than what I think it should be right now but besides that it gets an 8/10 from me

Meh
 This game has a lot of potential, but the new patch is a step in the wrong direction
 Why does is feel like an anime graphic novel game now
 Why do these anime girls drone on and on and on about nonsense when all I want is to know what to do and to manage abnomalities
 I get that English is likely not the developers first language, but the translation is SO bad
 Wouldn't be as much of an issue if there wasn't page after page after page of mindless dialogue, but there sure is
 There are too many fail states in the game, it's way too easy to get everyone killed through no fault of your own
I'm in love with the concept
For now, this game gets a pass
Posted: 21 July
I do recommened this game however, I sadly had more negatives things to say 
Great first game and looking forward to further touch ups and improvements in the future 
Bought this because I have much love and mad respect for Game Grumps
However
 I want to give an 100% honest review
 Probably gonna get a lot of hate for this one - please note it's just my opinion
 The game is
 extremely short in a sense and lacks any real "spark" on some of dates
 It can be
 rather boring
 It's quite upsetting that you only get three short dates with one person and then it's over
 It makes it hard to really build any sort of emotional connection with the person of choice (wow almost like a real date
 haha
) It's a hefty amount of reading which is fine with me honestly but as it is said to be voiced, this can be misleading as its 'voices' are grunts, huffs etc
It makes me very upset as a fellow Grump fan to say that I don't think this game was worth $15 USD ($19 AUD for me
) Highly recommened to wait for this game to come out on sale
 It is still a good game and the storyline mainly follows the life of a single dad of whom guides his daughter, Amanda, in the later stages of being a teenager
 The scenes with Amanda are very heartfelt and thought provoking, especially considering I'm a female of whom is not a Dad and doesn't have a child
 If you were to touch up this game it'd be nice to see some "out-of-style-type" cutscenes, if that makes any sense
 Like in Persona 5 for example, they have their art style for when you're fighting and running around etc
 but then they have anime-like cutscenes where it shows lovely movement and flows really nicely
 That would've broken up DDADDS really nicely if it had cutscenes similar to that
To end on a good note
- Amazing puns- Amazing art- Amazing Dads: I like each individuals personalities, they're all quite unique and have varied styles
- Amazing team and crew
Posted: 30 September
I think I need to disclose some things before I start talking about why I do not recommend buying Dream Daddy
 The first is that I adore Game Grumps (specifically Arin and Dan), and that they've had nothing to do with the development of the game save for some voicing-- which is really just grunts and 'ah
's, and some marketing on their channel
 The fact that the Grumps' name is on this shouldn't really be taken into account
 The second is that I bought it pretty much the day of release and had been following it since it'd been announced
 Not as actively as some people, but I knew about all the dads
I'm going to be starting with the negatives-- frankly, the game itself isn't *really* the issue here
 It's the developers
The developers have been a little shady from day one
 Originally, I was unsure if this game was meant to be a joke, like a lot of other people first suspected-- I'm a queer man, so I was hesitant at first
 I think it's important to note that I DID read several posts online about how someone close to the dev team had played the beta and got the impression that this was a grab at Representation Points(tm) and that it was just a cash grab-- here's the post
 [yollgraveyard
tumblr
com] During the release delay, the devs were suspiciously quiet-- they apologized afterwards, but it was still super unprofessional
I also vaguely remember (EDIT: I should mention that I can't be bothered to dredge up proof of this) the devs promising they'd add other dads and extra content, and a few of my friends remember them saying similar
 And these two above points are absolutely tied; we're three months out from DD's release date, and the devs have gone silent
 Since release, we've gotten two patches-- two bug patches, despite fans asking for more
 There's still a bugged achievement that the devs haven't explained, and the second patch was a patch so small that it isn't even mentioned on the Recent Updates section of steam, nor on any of the twitter accounts
The devs have essentially dropped this project as soon as it stopped making money and was no longer in top sellers for the fact that it's a queer dating sim
 Which is what a lot of people feared
 I feel genuinely ripped off by the developers and the game; if it weren't for the fact that I've got more than 2 hours of this game, which is INCREDIBLY short and lacks any real story arc to tie everyone together, I'd refund it in a heartbeat
 This game is almost $20 AUD and yet I wouldn't honestly say it's worth even that much, especially considering a) length and the fact that the game isn't even really complete and b) the devs have abandoned it
It's a shame, because otherwise, the game is really pretty and has some great characters; Mat's route is my favourite and the game introduced me to PUP, one of my favourite bands now
 It's diverse and cute and I love the fact that you can make a trans dad (even if the CC is godawful compared to character art), BUT the fact that you can now tell that it absolutely was a cash grab destroys it all, and
I wouldn't recommend buying
this game to anyone because of it

Tldr: cute but wait for a sale
The artwork is great and the stories I've done so far are cute, but
i just expected so much more
 I really wanted to like this and especially after waiting through delays and being so excited I'm super disappointed
 The game, at least to me, feels cheaper than it is
 I just don't feel the price tag is justified
 I do feel it's important to mention that i love how inclusive this game is, I just really hope the devs continue to add to it and hopefully address some issues
- There isn't proper voice acting- The customization for your dad kind of sucks- it would have been nice to customize your child or at least pick between a son or daughter but that isn't a big issue -while the story is adorable, it feels really basic and bare
 I didn't personally get much connection with the characters something which is important for this type of game
 I know a lot of people will disagree
with my review and that's cool
 I'm glad most people are in love with this, but it's just not worth $15 in my eyes
Posted: 22 July
First of all, I DID like the game
 But it was, at the same time, deceiving
 I'd give it a 6/10, but if it were the right price, I'd give it a 8
5/10 for sure
Let's start with the good things about it: it is a very enjoyable, nice and light game
 Most dads are also charming, the art is great, too
But on the other hand
 routes are extremely, extremely short
 Takes around 45 minutes to complete each route
 Not only that, but the endings are very limited, only having 2 endings, so there's no room for replaying it to find the rest of the endings
 I remember the Official Twitter promised multiple endings per dad
 You don't get to know the characters, and most of the time, it doesn't really feel like you're flirting with them
 I only got that impression with Damien
 It's like you guys are obviously just friends until the end of the third date where you suddenly kiss and love each other
 I was really excited to do Brian's route, but was very deceived to find that his route is just
 being rivals and at the very end kissing
 Nothing more
 It felt empty and superficial, despite the cute shirtless moment or the final kiss and hug at Amanda's party
 Didn't feel like a real developing relationship
 I think that it wasn't only because of how short the route is, but because of how it was written as well
 You could also have a short route where it does seem like they're flirting, like Damien's
Your character also has a personality that can't be changed, which I've found a bit distracting when it came to dating other dads, because I felt there was no chemistry between my character and his love interest even if I really liked the dad I was trying to romance just because my character spoke for me
 I don't know if this is normal for dating sims, though
Next issue is how overpriced it is for such a short game
 15 dollars isn't what this game is worth, in my opinion
 I'm mostly upset about having spent that amount of money on a game that isn't worth it
 Had it been cheaper I would have been content because I paid for the content I was given
 It is, still, a very nice enjoyable lighthearted game
Another thing that bothered me was the voices
 Grunts isn't voicing and it gets really annoying
 I don't care about the Game Grumps, but it feels like they haven't done much for the game
 Would have been better if they hadn't participated in this project at all
And now, this is my personal opinion but
 Amanda can get reaaaaally annoying
 I know it's a Dad game and all that, but when you have to do several routes and hear her story once and once again it gets tiring and irritating
 But once again
 this is a nice game
 Cute, entertaining (except for the Amanda bits
) and with interesting characters, even though they don't really get to be fleshed out
 I recommend it, but not for this price
 I'd wait for a sale
 I really, really hope more content is added later on, because despite my review looking negative, I really liked the game and some of the dads and I'm looking forward to some more dad dating

Posted: 25 July
I really wanted to like this game, and was really excited to play it but honestly for me it was a huge let down
There are some bugs in the system that really took me out of the experience
 For example at the beginning you have to choose if you had a wife or husband previously
 I chose wife but time and time again they were refered to as 'dad' or 'your father', just a small thing but quite irritating when I was given a choice
 I also had some really weird stuff with Robert's route at the end where he got mad at me for trying to sleep with him, and I did nothing of the kind
 It's like the games branches aren't working properly (another example is my character asking him about Val, and in that route he never told me about her
) It just takes you out of the experience and leaves you quite confused
 You think this kind of thing would have been ironed out in testing
 The entire game became quite formulaic to me as just one wrong answer can give you a bad mark and apparently a bad ending, so I took to saving before every answer to make sure I got hearts for it
 Going back and loading and saving for answers that seem really inconsiquential is a silly way to play a game like this but I really didn't want to have to skip through all the scenes again and again to get the good ending because of one wrong answer
 My main gripe however is that the game just feels
hollow
 I really applaud the game for its inclusion, but the vast majority of the characters are really tropey and without any depth
 The dates with them are super short and seem to go nowhere exciting
 Honestly
I think the plots are really dull
 They just do not DO anything
 To have a characters entire story be 'I secretly like a sport that millions love worldwide' is not really the heartwrenching, romantic plot you expect from a dating sim
 There is no build up to these romances, they come out of nowhere almost every time and feel forced and unnatural
 There are so many things that are mentioned that seem important then never come up again, and a lot of the routes are very similar
 In fact they ALL end on the exact same ending which kind of makes it feel like the whole thing was pointless to begin with
 I'm not expecting Shakespeare or anything, but i've played dating sims which have made me tremble with anticipation and cry with sadness for way less money
 (Tbh I wish they put that 'secret ending' in, because at least that sounds exciting, and all the hints for it are in the game
) It's like they couldn't decide where they wanted this game to go or be
- funny, serious, sexy
 So instead it's a mishmash of all those things and all of them fail
 Some of the dialogue is funny but it's not sidesplittingly funny as the situations don't give rise to anything that could be
 Some of the scenes seem like they might be sexy then they cut to black
 Moments feel like they might be serious and finally going somewhere, but then they're over in a click
 It just feels rushed, unfinished and wholly unsatisfying
 I can't even say it's TERRBLE cause it doesnt do anything extreme enough to be terrible, it's just dull dull dull, and in a way, I think that's far worse

This isn't a game, It's an experience
What a game
 I can't believe it ended just like that
 It was really devistating when the game just ended right on the spot
 This had like 4 chapters and an epilogue: it wasn't enough for me
 I loved the heartwarming, the bizzare, and the lesson-learning adventures
 I KNOW for a fact that there are multiple endings
 And, on the side note I must say, worth the 20 bucks
The art style is simple, nice, generously colorful, and popped out~"Look at this
 Look at that
" "Woah, animals making hypotheticals
"Amazing
The story is very deep and vast - It goes into the very in-depth of the story's backround for Mae, her friends, family, and the town she grows up in, in the past and in the future
 Although, change comes too quick for Mae, as the entire town has morphed into
 something else
 You go on numerous adventures with your friends, and the more you do, the more you learn about them; and the more you learn about the themes/insights of life, as well as the game
What an experience
 This game leaves a nice taste in my mouth that makes me hunger for more, and there's always plenty more where that comes from
 The story telling is interesting and simple, the art is just beautifully pleasant to look at
This game deserves a well 10/10
 I give my warmest applause for this game and the developers
 Well done
EDIT 6/29/17: This beautifully written game is the new "Undertale" in aspects of story-telling, lush world enviornment, and amazing soundtrack
EDIT 7/4/17: Looots of thumbs up
 Not that it matters, of course (maybe for the developers)

This is a thank you letter to the developers
 My cat died two days ago
 I had to make the decision of having him put down
 It was one of the hardest things I've ever had to but it was the right thing to do
 He didn't suffer, he died in his sleep
He was 18 years old and he lived a good life
 We all loved him and although he didn't like to show it I'm sure he loved me back as much as I did
You see, I've never really had anyone to talk to, to share my most hurtful feelings, and although he couldn't talk he was always there
 He was there when my parents got divorced, when I was bullied at school, every time I felt alone I know he would be there to keep me company and not judge
 It feels like it was just yesterday when my parents brought him home when I was a little kid
 This is my first tough loss, and it's hurting like hell
 But I won't let his death make me bitter, I want to come out of this becoming a better person
 The love I had for this cat, it was immeasurable
And weirdly enough Night in the woods has helped me cope, although I'm not sure how
 Maybe it's because I got to play a cool and lovable cat-person, maybe it was the bonds I made with these awesome characters, maybe it was getting to walk around Possum Springs feeling at home, maybe it was the story
 It was a bit of everything I guess
So thank you for making this a bit less hard and thank you for this amazing game

Sometimes I fall in love with a girl
 Sometimes it's an anime girl
Today, it's an alligator girl

I bought this game originally because I liked the art style and thought it looked endearing
This game is that and so much more
The characters are relatable and well written, the story itself is pretty great (though it felt a little too fast paced near the end) and it's got a strong sense of depth to it that you probably wouldn't have expected from the game at first glance
I don't really want to give anything away about the game but if you are someone who has passed the teenage years of your life (or at least to the point where you are no longer in school), this game may hit home for you
 I think my favourite aspect of the game is it's balance between humor and it's emotional moments
 Nothing ever feels out of place or like it's trying to shove messages down your throat
 It's very quirky and funny but not afraid to sit down and have it's philosophical and melancholic moments
 I really admire a game that can find that balance
Seriously, just get the game
 I would like to add though, that the game itself took me about 9/10 hours to complete so that may seem rather short to some people
 Personally, I was okay with it since it ended on a satisfying note and the complaint of it being short is really just down to the fact that you just want to spend more time hanging out with the characters
10/10

Please don't hurt this game fandom

Now that it's over, all I want is for the story to continue, and that's just about the highest praise you can give to a story focused game
 Pick it up
 It's good

I honestly love this game
 Short and sweet
 To get to the point:+Characters have depth+Art is amazing+Replayability+Gregg rules, ok
-Kinda short-Needs more Gregg and Angus
I really identify with Mae in the beginning, I'm about that age, about to start a class in college, nowhere to go in a small town
 The plot gets thick quick and I'm not going to spoil anything, but this game goes from 0 to 100 REALLY FAST
 If you like adorable animal-people, live in a small town, or feel like your life isn't going anywhere, this game is for you; at least if you don't mind angry neighbors, weird bird kids, and crimes

Night in the Woods is an emotionally dense game that responds well to poking and prodding
 The more you put into it, the more you'll uncover about the characters
 I'm excited to go into my second playthrough and find things I missed
 For a narrative game, it has a rare trait: economy of language
 Many narrative games are content to bludgeon you with words, this one feels like how people actually talk
 The characters deal with problems that are all-too-real and it's easy to love them despite their flaws
 You'll dig it

My daughter (age 7) was fascinated with the 'let's play' videos of this game online
 She's already a big fan of animals and science, for example Wild Kratts
 We finally got this game and she's been really loving it
 The game has accessable controls, and so she can figure out how to play it, and although her species usually die out pretty fast, she still has fun starting over
 Her brother (age 11) also really enjoys the game, and has a lot more success
 (edit/addition) After seeing comments I want to add that the breeding and resource management aspects of the game do have good educational content, and because the
game is actually fun I see the young people really understanding how those things work
 AND since lots of folks seem confused by mentioning children
 the game is fun for adults as well
 It's got a surprising amount of depth, which makes it challenging for more advanced players
 I give this a thumbs up both for adults and young people
