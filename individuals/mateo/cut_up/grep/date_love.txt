How did love manage to blossom between them
 As it focuses on relationships between two girls who fall in love with each other, A Kiss For The Petals stays true to the romance between two women
 I kind of ended up falling in love with the game, and it's arguably my favorite visual novel, at this point (provided you don't consider Shu Takumi games visual novels, just adjacent to them)
I have to say that I love the scene from the trailer
 I would very much love to see action or comedy-packed scenes receive even just a short scene now and then
interaction with the gameI simply love how one can affect the game with multiple choices and this should definitely have a continued focus throughout the development
 I also love the variety of locations, background musics, and their transitions for different moods
 I must say it's also quiet immersive and interactive with the puzzles and the investigation minigames and different choices for building love relationships with interesting choice of partners in a universe of fantasy filled with interesting anime characters in terms of both appearance and personality and TG possibilities men like me would die for
 Overall, great presentation so far with what is given in the demo, favorite part through the story is the fox girl cafe ^-^ and thats saying a lot because "sakura spirit" almost destroyed my love for fox girls in visual novels
The characters are either boring, dull or plain stupid - I'd love to name names but I know the history of how reviews here get flagged, so I'll be good and abide by the Rules & Guidelines
By the time the credits roll, you'll have fallen in love with each of the boys along with her, even the ones you couldn't stand from the start
 You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you
