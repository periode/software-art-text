I'll just be a memory
I wanna forget
I don't wanna forget
I'm sure there's something we can agree on
I need you yes I do
I'm just a memory
I was beautiful then
I remember
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
I've got no sense
I'm with you though you can't see me
I won't be here to warm you
I am a ghost
I have your body
I have your soul
I know youâ€™re capable
I don't need you now.
I'm going back to sleep in the place
I discovered happiness
I'm waiting for redemption,
I just have to keep breathing...
I was and will be with you
I  know  that  these  stars  are  scrawling  their  lines
I  know  that  these  scars  are  surely  benign
