I made our lunch\nWe talked of yesterdays\nI remember more than you\nThat happens lots these days\nBut how we laughed, I almost cried\nAnd the afternoon flew by\nAs we sat on the patio sipping our drinks\nAnd the sunlight began to die\n\nMemory moves us past each other\nTime is a ribbon without an end\nLove is the lesson we keep learning\nDeath but a moment we must spend\n\nAnd we try to give each other comfort\nWe try to hold off that dark night\nEach of us careful of the other\nKeeping our own fear out of sight\n\nAh, you know I've always loved you\nAnd I know you've loved me too\nSo it's hard to watch you crumble\nAnd forget all that you knew\n\nYesterday while I was driving\nSunlight streaming through the trees\nSuddenly my heartache parted\nAnd suddenly I felt at ease\nYou will love me all your life\nAnd I will love you all of mine\nThat's the gift we give each other\nThat's the gift divine\n\nMemory moves us past each other\nThough time is a ribbon without an end\nLove's
