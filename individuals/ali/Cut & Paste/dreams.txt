Also there were two girls they were twins, but one of them didn't look like a human. When she got mad she would turn into some scary monster. When she was happy she would turn into a pretty angel. I remember there was a guy that was trying to get us out. He told us to climb this tall ladder that led to a dark hole. I had forgotten something so I went back to get it. Then I was going to climb the ladder, but it was gone so was everyone else. The hole had disappeared also. The room turn cold and dark I could here a mans voice say my name finally he stopped and I seen a door. I ran to it, but I could catch up to it. It was moving away from me it then disappeared too.

Anyway I met THREE girls on the same motorbike, without no helmet, and we were under the sea ! But there was light though. And then I saw next to my feet a HUGE shark. In fact it was theirs. That's why he was attached to the motorbike. I started to touch him but then the girl went out. But when they went out, I don't know why, but I remember them going away in music. I perfectly remember the music. It was "Look Around" By the RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS. I THINK I SHOULD GO TO THE DOCTOR, HAHA. (sorry for my bad english)</p>

<p>"Kill or be killed" / March 26th, 2011 In my dream, Tanya and me are hanging out at a gathering with another woman.  I think I recognize someone else there.  We're just hangin' out in the frontyard, where I see a couple of shuttle buses. I get a very strange feeling about someone around us; but we're getting on the bus.  I see a black man with muscles; it's Tanya's ex.
We are at her apartment.  Her ex's father threathens Tanya in the apartment, and expresses no woman has ever got his son for child support.  There is a little girl with curly black hair; this ex touches her hair.  Tanya quickly tells the father she will get child support; I cannot say be quiet quick enough.  I walk to the kitchen as if I do not know what is going on.  I look around the corner and see Tanya being tied up in a sheet.  I turn quickly to grab a large pair of white scissors.
A young man wearing red appraches me; I know he is with the others.  I stab him in the heart.  He is looking at me, as to say; "why?!"  I am thinking self-defense.  He's dead.  The ex comes after me, I stab him several times, he's dead.  I'm still thinking self-defense.  The father comes at me without a shirt on.  I stab him in the neck without hesitation.  He's dead IMD.</p>
<p>last night i was eaten by zombie hedge hogs IMD </p>
<p>Last night i was on errand then suddenly the earth started shaking and the heavens open up, there came multitude of white clothed men from the sky. Immediately people started crying and some where being taken into the sky with them. I perfectly understood that it was the rapture as stated in the book of revelation in the Bible my problem was how to be taken too into the sky.
I started running to get to the top of a house the highest in that dream maybe I could jump and be taken but in my quest to do that I met a pregnant woman on the 10th floor crying that she’s about to deliver of her baby to help in doing so, I then became confused and woke sweating IMD</p>
<p>Last night, I had a dream that I woke up late for my first final which was American Politics with the meanest teacher ever. My actual final is this Wednesday. I woke up an hour into the final and started getting ready as quickly as I possibly could. I ran there as fast as I could IMD. </p>
<p>So I am a 17 year old girl and last night I had this very strange dream. I don't really remember all of it but some details have stuck. I remember laying in a bed with a girl I know, but I was a boy...Now as far as I know, I'm straight.So I don't really understand why I dreamt that. It got weird tho, because the friend of mine (the girl) started to tease me and well I started to get very turned on. Now right before we had intercourse I woke up. </p>
<p>Last night after watching Sarah Palin's Alaska, I dreamt I was in the show swimming in cold ponds talking to fish IMD.</p>
<p>Last night I had the most emotionally-stressful dream ever. Firstoff, know that my friends and family describe me as a bit of a "lone wolf", and I've always been happy that way. A few months ago I got out of a relationship, and It didn't really affect me; I'm okay with being alone.
But last night, I dreamt of a girl; a companion. I was happy. Really happpy. And when I woke up, I felt horrible. Here I was, back in this awful, souless world. So obviously, I think this dream symbolized a need for a companion. But how do I become less of a "lone wolf"? It's like, once your in, you can't get out.</p>
<p>Oh I thought of an old, unexplainable one that you people might like to hear. So a few years ago, IMD, I was standing on a large wooden porch. The sky was purple. There was a bench along the guard rail. My step-dad was sitting on this bench. I walked towards him, started masturbating and groaning loudly. I immediately jizzed all over his leg. Then, realizing what happened I was all wtf and I was like "oh my god...I'm sorry...I don't know why I did that...I'm sorry!" And he was like, "no, it's okay! Really, it's fine." And seemed perfectly okay with it. This was all too weird, so I woke up.</p>
<p>Last night, I had a dream that I was going into labor (I’m not actually pregnant in real life). I freaked out because my mom and sister/best friend weren’t there with me and my boyfriend wouldn’t come in the room with me. Luckily, I woke up before I actually gave birth IMD</p>
<p>Last Night I had a dream that I was on a bus and it came to a stop and I got off. As I walked past the seat's to the door I saw the interior of the bus in great detail. There were a couple of people in the bus, As soon as I got out of the bus I stood over near the bus stop and this blond lady with curls in her hair walked up to me. She said something in an Australian Accent then she stood next to me and I put my arm around her as if I knew her. I could feel the Fire of love burning inside me it was so great. She was wearing a black top and a orange skirt and she was very good looking. I hope this Is a precognitive dream. IMD</p>
