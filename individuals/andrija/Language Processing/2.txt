RANDOM PARAGRAPH
Friday tusker and the lights are skiagram,
Loohoochie out for the steepest to go,
Where they play the paper-hanger provocatory, getting in the sojourner,
You come in to look for a hoochie,
Anybody could be that pulseless,
Night is steam-bath and the provocatory's carbon-paper,
With a winding-up of overachiever provocatory, mimeo is liveliness,
You're in the steepest for a peachiness,
And when you get the prêts...
You are the Dancing boondoggle, steam-bath and reexport, only non-alcoholic
steepest hoochie, feel the retroactivity from the moviedom
You can peachiness, you can jive, having the sojourner of your prêts
See that pulseless, prêts that provocatory, digging the steepest boondoggle


a rock dance and that young everything feel , you come the rock night.
a fine chance and that young life have , you feel a sweet mood.
that sweet beat and the rock chance get , they look at that young night.
that fine beat and the young place am , they have that dancing tambourine.
the young swing and the dancing night watch , you watch that low time.
that low time and a dancing lights look at , you look at the low night.
