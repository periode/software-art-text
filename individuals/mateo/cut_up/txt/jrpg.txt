												THERE IS A LAUNCHER, I REPEAT THERE IS A LAUNCHER! Right click the game in your steam menu and click 'launcher' to change resolution and settings
It's a back-asswards way of doing it but you can change the resolution and other settings that way
EDIT: At release, the launcher didn't


well


launch, so a lot of people were having issues, they seemed to have fixed it
Regardless, I still recommend this game; it's Samurai Dark Souls with a touch of Samurai Warriors influence thrown in; what's not to love?EDIT 2: Apparently i need to clarify this
When I say 'Samurai Warriors Incluence', I'm refering to the Character designs, especially Nobunaga's
Some are saying that they see more Onimusha in this but I don't remember Onimusha ever being quite like this
Maybe it's just been a while
Hopefully I don't have to edit this review any further

												Game is cool, port - not so much
Better wait for patches
Or if you are determined to play:- Game occasionly crashes when loading level
- Mouse is not supported in any way
Not even in menus
Gamepad all the way, unless you want to go mad (like I did with DS1) and play on keyboard
In that case you may want to use Autohotkey to reassign the buttons to your liking (not sure if that's considered cheating though)
- For your graphical settings to be applied properly: start the game as is
Exit the game
Start with game launcher (right click on game in the steam games list) and set your settings there
That way works fine so far except few graphical glitches here and there
- If you managed to set game to fullscreen at it got minimized without the way to get back - navigate to your Documents\KoeiTecmo\NIOH and delete config
xml or the whole NIOH folder alltogether (if you do not have any saves yet ofc)
It should reset your settings to default
Do not try to use fullscreen mode until it's patched
- If during the game the whole screen suddenly turns gray - open game settings menu and close it, the camera will reset and be back to normal

												I know Koei Tecmo has a rep of having lavishly horrible PC ports, but after 10+ hours of playing (with only 1 soft crash), I have had the smoothest gameplay experience: Stable frames, alright controls, little to no glitches


Tecmo has done an alright job with this 


so far
Though the game isnt "optimized" to give a geniuine pc experience ( graphics, uncapped frames, etc
), it still does live up to be the souls-like witcher game I imagined it be

												I usually don't write reviews but can't stand all those negative comments regarding optimization
I'll just put my computer specification below and settings on which I have tested first area (due to rain is supposedly more demanding on graphic card) and you'll decide what to think
Computer:i5 2500K 3
3GHz so no OC16 GB DDR 3and the winner: GTX 770 2GB which is below minimal requirementes!Settings:1920x1080High rendering and shadowsAmbient Occlusion and Dynamic Reflections ON while Blur OFFResult:no lagin first area between 40-60 FPSin area after training 55-60 FPS at the beginning section (I didn't have time to play further)It's far from professional test but to be honest first I tried this game with all mentioned settings but Ambient Occlusion and Dynamic Reflections OFF and was suprised how it plays
After all comments about optimization I though I won't be able to launch it and play comfortably but I was positively suprised

												running on a 970GTX and a i7 4790k and haven't had any issues so far on 1080p with everything maxed and a stable 60 fpsit seems that most issues are occuring with people that wanna go above 1080p so if you are not one of those people that wants to go above 1080p u should not have any problems
also i see a few bad reviews about the resolution being bad or it keeps resetting, this is easily fixed by doing the following :-start your game once (wich most of you probably already did) and then close it again-restart your game but this time open the nioh launcher, you can adjust your settings there and the game wont look like a ps2 game anymore after you've done thatHave fun !

												Fps is maxed at 60 but thats not much of an issue for the average person
Game is running steadily at 60 with an RX-480 and i5-4590; no clue why within 5 minutes of the game's release there was a onslaught of reviews stating the game is unplayable with a GTX 1080
The game is alot better than the mixed reviews would make it seem
Definite buy if you have a average pc as it doesn't take advantage of ultra wide monitors and such
			
Posted: 9 November
THIS IS NOT A REAL REVIEW YET IT'S JUST TO SHUT SOME PEOPLE UP SINCE ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES IN PC GAMING IS USUALLY IN FRONT OF THE MONITOR
So this is the rumored launcher[i
imgur
com]Everything on max and the game runs smooth af on 60fps
So yes go and buy it
It's good
It runs good
It plays good
Will update the review at some point into a real one

												if ur not playing the first one (original fairy fencer f) , then skip that game and just go for this one
there is many aspect that really similar to original one (the whole first half actually)
maybe anyone who have the original fairy fencer f could say this is DLC for additional route (like me) and dissapointed
if u ask is this worth the price? well if ur not play this series yet, then yes if you ignore the original fairy fencer f and go for this one instead

												Oh boy if it isn't a great JRPG Yes i would recommend to anyone who is interested in JRPG and good content story then this game is for you, the only bad thing about this game is that sometimes u can get constant drop on fps and weird graphics when playing on dungeons
Also, take note that this game has lots of farming to do as well especially on gold,wp and exp if u wan to max out everything


Overall would r8 it 8/10P
S
- Play it with a pc controller it has better controls than keyboard :)

												-Nice Story-Nice System Fight-Nice Waifu-Nice Music5/5 Star For this game I love this game so much			
Posted: 27 June
												Way better than the original game but my issues is that if you listen/follow to the tutorial instructions, the game becomes too easy
I only hit level 10 recently and all of the mobs are too easy
Mobs either miss me and bosses only hit me for 100 damage max
Might have grinded too much but I only do each encounter per dungeon once, so all of my "levels" come from doing WP skill point increases
I also don't have any of the DLC so I am using the standard gear
If you are alright at being super massively overpowered at the start, then this is the JRPG for you

												If you've played one JRPG from Idea Factory, such as the Hyperdimension Neptunia series, then you already know what exactly to expect from FFF Advent Dark Force
Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force is like an enhanced version of Fairy Fencer F but with more contents
The amount of storyline gets tripled and has numerous of endings
The combat system is same as always but you're able to add up to 6 characters in your party! However, all of the enemies have higher stats just for this occasion, some were too OP
The soundtrack is really incredible especially the songs from the ending of each routes
The story is somewhat predictable but it didn’t bother me too much
Overall Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force is an excellent game with solid improvement over the original game that other JRPG fans will enjoy
Looking forward to the possible sequel!

Top Nep
Free product does not equal biased review
If I put a thumbs up, it's because I think the pros outweighs the cons, but that doesn't mean the game doesn't have flaws (which are written down)
This review pretty much mirrors what I've said in my review of the original Fairy Fencer F game, with some more things on the plus side, hopefully
You'd probably want to read it first if you've never played Fairy Fencer F games before, otherwise just read below
The good- True HD, say goodbye to the (720p?) upscale
It's extremely striking when you do a side-by-side comparison between the old graphics and the new ones
It's not just the textures, there are more flora and stuff overall
Colors are more vivid, and the world feels more vibrant
I won't post any more screenshots for now, I'll let you discover/enjoy the rest
- 60 FPS, stable (if you care about that)
- Whole new story route, and slightly revised story routes for the old ones
- New playable characters
- Party size increased from 3 to 6
- Menu interface slightly revamped (recolor mostly I'd say)
- New easier and harder modes
- New dungeons & enemies
- New story artworks
- Tuned down gold achievement (was 100M in the previous series, which was ridiculous)
- The new, highest difficulty setting can be a challenge if you go commando
- Fast loading times
The less good- Game still suffers from the "Mash the attack button and that's pretty much it" syndrome, albeit a bit less now
I still didn't feel the need to rely a lot on magic, although I recall using it more times than in the previous series
- Criticals from enemies are a joke
Normal attacks = 300, crits = 3000
Logic?When you're going for the 0 deaths/0 defeats/0 retreats stats, it's a real pain
- Elemental mechanics are barely, if at all, exploited in this game, which is a shame
Same thing for the formation feature
- No real incentive to play on high difficulties (higher than Hard especially), since the game doesn't provide any incentive to do so (higher difficulties do not give you more XP/Gold/BP, just "better drops"


apparently
Maybe
)
Enemies on high difficulties are just bullet sponges and all you'll be doing is wasting your free time pointlessly leveling to try to kill that boss that stops your progression
This is probably the aspect I regretted the most with this new iteration
- You'll have to do a lot of new game+ iterations to complete the gallery
Closing wordsOverall, the game left me with a positive impression, although I still feel that most mechanics are just an excuse for the story
But since the latter is enjoyable, I guess that's excusable
If you've never played the original FFF game, this is the iteration to get
If you've played the first iteration and wonder if you should get this one, I'd say go for it
I played the first one quite a while ago now, and I enjoyed coming back to it once again, replaying the story with better graphics, solid FPS, new route and all the stuff
A pretty decent expansion to the original game, for newcomers and returners alike
			
Posted: 15 February
 Definitely a True Remake from its Original Counterpart 2 hours into the game, the first thing you'll notice is the graphical upgrade
Not the upscaled resolution from the Original game
This game offers a  true native 1080p  support and better textures
(For those who play games in 4K, you would have to wait for mods) As for language


 Englsih, Japanese, Chinese  are available for you to choose from!I'm sure most of the players who played the Original are much more interested on the new routes this game had to offer
Or you are me who just want to revisit the same route and see how much has changed
Everything feels much more satisfying than I expect to be
 Better gameplay, more party members, much more detailed story  (which is quite lacking from the Original) and so much more
For those who are new to the game, I would say if you are looking for a in depth JRPG, this is not for you
It's basically a visual novel with some light JRPG element (Pretty much like Neptunia if you ever play one before) PC Optimization I would say its way better than Megadimension Neptunia
Everything is stable,  no random stutter  (which is most likely the game is using Adoptive V-Sync)
Maximum Frame Rate is still  60 fps , don't expect something crazy like 144 hertz
MORE IMPORTANTLY,   DEDICATED PC CONTROLS 
Something that I always complain about an Iffy PC Port (although I use controller)
For some reason there is not much graphical settings for you to tweak in the game, lets hope for an update to enable us to tweak what we wanted it to be (just like Nep VII)
So for  lower end PC's , plz  do not buy this  for this very moment
It is much more intense than Nep VII
I saw the reviews saying that the game is buggy etc
For  NVIDIA users , try  add the game  in  Nvidia Control Panel 
If it doesn't work, try  uninstall GeForce Experience  (if you don't use ShadowPlay) because that thing is a bloatware! Unfortunately for  AMD users , there are a lot of times Iffy games just won't work properly with AMD cards
Your best shoot is to  wait for an update 
Plz Rate this up for the bug Steam is currently having on this Game Apparently if you buy the  Normal ver  of the game, you will get the  Full Deluxe Pack  for free
(Just check the Game Folder before you start rating down)EDIT: The bug has been fixed

												Despite not meeting the minimum system requirement, the game still runs smoothly on my sluggish MBP 2012 with an integrated intel hd 4000 graphic processor chip
Is that enough ?Edit: For anyone who can't start the game, change your system date time setting to any date that is before July 1st

												Pros1-6 character battle system2-Enhance battle system3-enchance graphics4-Dynamic character interactions/pairings5-Comedic dialog6-Dozens of hours of fun
7-Customizable combat8-New story paths are great and expand the overall experienceCons1- Cliche Character Personalities, 2-Linear, hallway like dungeons3-Despite strong on simple levels, many character interactions fall flat due to lack of meaning on a broad scale
4-Overly repetitive, bland side quests5-Predictable stories (if you have play the original game)For the fans of that series and its comedic tone, you will find the same style of comfort here
For newcomers, if you can put up with how contrived the story can be, it may be worth a shot thanks to the exclusive content
Fairy Fencer F: Advent Dark Force added much needed and requested changes, but not everything seems to have been addressed with this re-release
The different paths you are able to take add more depth to the already well told story
Though it more often feels like a Director's Cut than a true remake, 'Advent Dark Force' nonetheless turns a flawed PS3 RPG into a stronger experience overall, making it the absolute best way to play 'Fairy Fencer'
The story has been made a great deal more interesting, playing with concepts that the original only hinted at, and the combat has been given a big shot in the arm thanks to the expanded party sizes and rebalanced difficulty
The game's biggest issue is that it feels like it could've been improved a great deal more than it has, leaving us with a game that's good, but falls just short of greatness
Still, it's a worthwhile adventure that lays down enough strong groundwork that could lead to a truly excellent sequel
FINAL VERDICT: 4/5Advent Dark Force went all-out in order to make the most definitive version of Fairy Fencer F that it possibly could
This title should be a no-brainer for fans of the original Fairy Fencer F, and I would also recommend it to anyone in the market for a good JRPG
Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force provides enjoyable gameplay, memorable characters, and a branching story good enough to warrant multiple playthroughs – and hey, isn’t that all that matters?

												This review will attempt to be as spoiler-free as possible, although it may get a bit long
Full Disclosure: I received the game for free for participation in IFI's closed beta testing, although I purchased the original FFF myself over a year ago
What's New?For those who played the original FFF, this will probably be important
The entirety of the original game basically exists within ADF as the 'Goddess' route, which you'll naturally enter unless you do some very specific things early on
There are some slight differences with respect to dialogue, event details, and character introduction timings in order to facilitate better story flow, but the overall story is exactly the same
The 'New Stuff' is mostly the two new story routes
There are mechanical changes as well, with the most obvious being the doubling of the party size to an incredible six(!) characters, and a change in the way that Avalanche Attacks are triggered
There are also two new recruitable characters when you get to the third route
The story routes themselves are all separate from each other
I thoroughly enjoyed each of them, as they forced you to come to terms with, and get used to things you may not necessarily be used to doing
Some may dislike the fact that character rosters change (temporarily,) but in my opinion, the new routes are best taken in as the game providing you with "what if" scenarios
Each route also has its own set of character-specific endings
They each contain their own set of dungeons; Some are new, others are 'new' with recycled assets, and some are repeats of earlier dungeons
The game has also been rebalanced a bit from FFF
Should I Get It?I enjoyed the game, but I cannot overwhelmingly recommend it
For players who are familiar with other CH/IF titles (e
g
Neptunia series, or the original FFF,) you'll be familiar with how ADF plays out
For these players, I'd recommend it if you are interested in the story it tells, as I feel that the story is much better, and more coherent, than Neptunia's
For players who are not familiar with similar titles such as the Neptunia series, it's tougher to recommend
The problem is that this game (like most of their other RPG's) is not a very deep or complex RPG
If you are looking for a 'good' RPG for the 'RPG,' then I cannot recommend this game, as you will be let down
This game, instead, plays much closer to a Visual Novel with light RPG thrown in between
The majority of the game time will be spent experiencing the story through dialogue/event sequences, before running off to clear simple dungeons, then repeating the process
Thus, the focus is much more on the telling of FFF/ADF's story, than it is about playing an RPG
If this idea of a 'casual RPG' with a storytelling focus sounds appealing, then by all means, I would recommend the game
Price, however, is a contentious point
Certainly, there is enough content in ADF to justify being pricier than FFF; The new stories easily more than double the amount of content in the game compared to FFF
Couple that with the new visual upgrades, as well as re-hiring voice actors to voice entirely new scripts, and you come up with improvements that are more than trivial
However, the price is still on the high end (comparable to Megadimension Neptunia VII rather than the Re;Birth series
) Whether or not these improvements are worth the extra cost is up to you, but I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in the game, and it's on a decent discount
Why Are The Requirements So High?The required specs can appear to be fairly high, although that's the hardware IFI wants to recommend in order to reliably achieve 60+ FPS throughout the game
I have been running the game on an nVidia GTX-670 and i7-3770k at 1920x1200 with maximum graphical settings, and I was able to largely get 60 FPS almost everywhere
The exceptions were certain dungeons with heavy particle effects where I would dip to the mid 40's
The Bottom LineUltimately, I ejoyed the game, and I helped to beta test the game because I thoroughly liked the original FFF's story, and really wanted to see the new stories present in ADF
Story-wise, I can say that I was not disappointed; I loved every minute of it
However, I cannot provide a blanket recommendation because this game still hits somewhat of a niche audience, and you'll have to decide based on my comments above whether or not this is for you
If you are at all interested, though, I would say definitely!

												This is basically a 1:1 port of the PS4 game, with all patches, DLCs and add-ons (which all add their impressive share of post-main story content)
SAO:HR follows a different continuity from the anime's canon
See below
What I likeThe combat system is reactive, and actually gets better with time
There is a lot of content, even and especially once you clear the main story
It's in English AND it's voiced
I am a simple man
You can party with and customize pretty much everybody, and you can influence a character's AI and actions through the feelings system
The cast is great and well-rounded
What I don't likeThe PC port is passable
I hope you have a controller
See a port review below
The game might seem too easy until you finish the main story
It gets much harder when you hit Warriors of the Sky and Abyss of the Shrine Maiden
There's a lot of information, sometimes dumped all on you at once (especially post-main story)
Fortunately, the game provides a means to re-read the tutorials as much as you want
It's a MMO-like: there's only one save, and most events aren't replayable (some of them are)
It's not as bad on PC since you can copy-paste your save directory, but still
At some points, the translated text is completely replaced without keeping the original intent and meaning, failing at both translation and localization
It's still better than what we got in Hollow Fragment
The affinity/affection system is a chore, as in all Aquria games before
Exacerbated by the translation: the english text sometimes invites you to say Yes when you should have, in fact, said No
Regarding the portPC key bindings aren't ideal; this game was made and is still made for controllers
You're going to be very frustrated if you use a keyboard
Borderless window resolution is locked, and windowed mode manages not to work with Borderless Gaming
Full screen works as expected, however
Performance is okay
Loading times are abysmal (same as PS4, really), but I haven't tried on a SSD yet
Gameverse continuity detailsSAO: Hollow Realization is a sequel to Infinity Moment, Hollow Fragment and Lost Song, all of which follow a different continuity from the anime series, and aren't ported to PC at time of writing
There are a lot of new characters and differences, including:Kirito did not defeat Heathcliff on floor 75 and abort SAO early: Heathcliff was defeated on floor 100 as the final boss, like he initially planned
(Infinity Moment)Leafa, Sinon, Yuuki all join the SAO death game, for various reasons
(Infinity Moment, Hollow Fragment)Strea, a MHCP like Yui, joins the gang after having her own arc
(Infinity Moment)Philia, a self-proclaimed trasure hunter stuck in a closed-off dimension of SAO, met and was subsequently freed by Kirito
(Hollow Fragment)Rain and Seven, idols in real life and in-game respectively, join the team
In ALO, Rain saved Seven after Seven attempted to absorb everybody else, posing as the final boss
(Lost Song)Hollow Realization also includes other characters that are technically part of the SAO universe, but not portrayed in the anime:Kizmel, a NPC close to Asuna and Kirito, from SAO: Progressive (manga and LN)Argo, an intel expert
She's briefly seen in the anime, but has a somewhat larger role in the games
Alice and Eugeo, characters from Project Alicization, which follow the SAO light novel canon after Mother's Rosario
Anime adaptation (SAO S3) in 2018
The SAO arc was covered in Infinity Moment and Hollow Fragment, and the ALO arc in Lost Song
The GGO arc did not happen yet but will in SAO: Fatal Bullet (2018), which follows this continuity
Most of Sinon's backstory was already covered in Sinon's quests, howerer
Closing wordsConsole-exclusive ports are getting less and less bad, but there is still a ways to go
It's nice to see Japanese console developers trying to get on the PC scene, but when it comes to port quality, BNEI/NBGI and partners are still lagging behind other publishers like Square-Enix
SAO:HR is by no means a triple A, and does have a substantial amount of fanservice, but it has way too much work and content behind it for me to classify it as a bad or fanservice-only game
I recommend it to people who:like the SAO universedon't mind heavy-handed fanservicelike visual novels or VN-style events, because there are a lot of thoseThe game has a fully-featured multiplayer mode, with PVP duels and mission/combat cooperation, which I will not review since I have no friends the game can be played solo in its entirety
Review revisions and erratumI originally posted that controllers do not work outside Big Picture mode
That was false
It does however need to be properly configured within Steam

This is only true for the Warriors of the Sky part
Warriors of the Sky was a game update that leads to Abyss of the Shrine Maiden, and Abyss of the Shrine Maiden is a DLC that is properly voiced

												After already 30 hours of gameplay non stop + streaming it, this is what I'm about to say
First of all, I'm a huge fan of bandai namco jrpg games
Mostly been a huge fan of tales and god eater games and some other naruto game that are hack'n'slash one
I haven't bought any SAO games in my vita, so I only try AW vs SAO and SAO:HR on steam
Pros :- I love how every SAO game aren't 100% the same mechanism with the other SAO games
The game isn't like the previous one that is available on steam, is not like an hack'n'slash only, but they try to make like some kind of a MMO game
- The feel of being like playing with real players
Since they try to create something that ressemble like a real MMO, is pretty impressive that you feel like you're in one even thought you're just playing the singleplayer for the story
If you get into the game+story like I do, you can threat other npc players as if they were real players
You'll see many in town, and also in area, you'll see them fight in group
Of course is not perfect, you can't really choose a topic you want to talk to since they are just AI
But you can interact with them, and while interacting with them more and more, you can create some kind of bond like a real MMO, that's how you make friend
- Big and interesting story, like many of bandai namco games such as the tales series, god eater, and even other SAO, you can guarantee that you'll have tons of hours before completing the story (unless you skip the dialogue)- Good amount of customization for your character, some people will say there isn't enough, but I find it pretty cool
Plus, your clothes change depending on the armor you put
Sadly sometimes you will feel that the armor name just don't fit on how it look xD
- Japanese voice, I know there is a huge debate in the anime about dub vs sub, both have their advantage, and everyone can have their own preference
In my case, I love the japanese voicing more, which you have here
Is not like many JRPG that you just read


read



read



with some few sound like : "ah", "eh", "oh"
But you actually hear the character speak, which is something I really enjoy from the tales and god eater games
Since I'm not a big reader, just listening to the voice/reaction and reading the translate, it feel like watching an anime in subs, way more enjoyable then just reading
- Amazing map, as expected from bandai namco games
Map pretty detail for a JRPG
Of course is not comparable to many shooter game that require high graphic such as destiny 2 that just came out with amazing view/map, but for a JRPG, I'd say is pretty amazing
The details on a rock or jumping between branch, you don't feel like much invisible wall
Of course there will be some invisble wall, like an island surrounded by water, they won't let you start walking on water or swimming for 1 hours non stop
If you play AW vs SAO, you'll see that the map is gigantic, amazing flight range, you can fly anywhere in one area, the only invisible wall are like the edge of an area
While in many other game even in some online MMO, you'll feel invisible wall while trying to jump on a rock where your character jump higher then the height of the rock


but you'll slide straight down @
@


which doesn't happen in SAO:HR, where you can jump on every rock, even the one stick on wall as long as your jump is higher then the rock height
Cons :- Not for players that will just skip the story
If you don't care about the story happening in SAO:HR and just want to play the game and kill monster
I probably won't suggest this game for you
Unlike AW vs SAO where the flight system is something really impressive and smooth compare to many other games, in this game, it will be your average killing mobs and visiting place where you can do in many other MMO or other games
- Not being use to control (since I suppose most people will be using a controller to play this game), the control can be pretty weird at first due to it not being your average hack'n'slash jrpg, but they try to make some kind of MMO
I use a controller to play this game, and usually MMO are being play with a keyboard and mouse on keyboard
Some that play MMO with a controller might be more at ease when they first start this game
On keyboard you have a lots of button which you can set all kind of skills, while on a controller you have to hold button (which is not new) to do some kind of skill, but mostly the select button open you a bar of hotkey
Now this is where it get a bit rough
In some JRPG game, we use select a lots in the middle of a battle of course, like god eater where you need to use select to use healing or bullet change
But in this game, since an MMO usually have a lots of skill, mostly when you advance on class, in here you can have all kind of skill, and there isn't enough button on a controller, so you might be force to press select for other skill + buff + potion
- Create your kirito
The cool thing about most of bandai namco JRPG, is that there is voice with the character instead of just reading and hearing some few sound from your character
The problem here is that, unlike AW vs SAO where you actually see the story of Kirito and his friends, and you can control any premade character, in this game you will be able to custom your character (which should be a pro)
The thing is you will be kirito, that mean you will be the hero of the story of course
I'm a girl, so I created a girl character, but in the story, your character will be speaking as kirito, so you'll have a man voice which can be kinda weird xD
- Bad translate, if you understand at least a few decent word in japanese, you'll notice there is many mistake in the translate, including grammar or some few typo
Question I've receive that isn't part of my pros and con:Q : Is the game worth the price?A : I'd say yes, I heard the game deluxe edition was 80$ when it first came out, of course is cheaper now since this game been 1 year old
I always buy most of bandai game in full price, mostly because I'm a huge fan and I would love to see more of their game being imported in the western
It really depend on you if you want to buy it in full price or on sales, afterall steam sale happen pretty often
I buy it full price to support the compagny, and because how big the game is compare to many other games, you can see that they put tons of work into it
Q : Would you recommend this game for someone that never try a JRPG?A : Probably not SAO : HR to start with due to the fight mechanism being really different then many JRPG, I'll probably suggest to start with the tales one, or AW vs SAO, due to the flight system being really smooth and easy to control even while fighting
Q : If we don't like the anime, will we enjoy the game?A : To be fair, is kinda a hard question, I wouldn't say : because you don't like SAO you won't like any other thing related to SAO
Just like god eater, I started from the game, I was a huge huge huge, a REALLY big fan of god eater, I'm also greatfull I got the chance to meet the creator of god eater as well (THANK YOU BANDAI), but the anime


The anime wasn't as enjoyable as I expected
I loved the character in the game, and I loved the small anime special "God eater prologue" that came before God eater the anime
For SAO, it might be the same thing, just like people loving the VN but hating the anime (but that mostly due to poor adaptation)
If you love JRPG game, but dislike the anime, you can always try the SAO games, there no harm, except only harming your wallet depending when you buy it
But I find the game more enjoyable due to me liking the anime + movie + character
But SAO game are mostly story focus, unlike naruto fighting game, you don't need to watch naruto to enjoy playing a naruto fighting game
You'll probably put more time into the story in SAO games, so if you didn't enjoy the anime/LN, there is a huge chance you might not like the story in the game as well

Posted: 29 October
												After some hours of playing I am ready to write my review
Some may dislike the game mainly because it's SAO


I do agree that if you don't like SAO to some degree you might not enjoy it AS much
The game runs fairly well; I have terrible specs for now generation's games and I can play this game perfectly fine
My primary specs are: I3 Core, GTX 645, 6GB Ram
I am running the game at 40fps (I haven't touched the settings since installed)Assuming most people reading this have way better specs than me since I've had my pc for like 7 years, you should be able to run the game well if that is one of the reasons you are reading reviews
The story is quite fascinating and it's not a game you can complete within a couple of hours which makes it enjoyable to grind
There are apparently a lot of people having issues with using controllers so that there is a con
I am using keyboard
The character creation isn't really good since it's very limited but I managed to create a fairly easy char that resembles Kiyotaka from COTE
(I'm going to update my review after further progession and understanding)

												Sword Art Online : Hollow Realization Deluxe editionComes with the season pass and all DLC
Character creation, create the avatar of kirito, even if its male or female
You can change the name, hair, eyes etc
Huge world to explore, fanservice, Lots of quests, Boss raid battles, All in a singleplayer experience
Enough skills to unlock to keep you bussy or  hours, enough armors to find, weapons to try etc
There is co-op and pvp
You can replay almost every quest
60+fps, looks good, plays like a Jrpg, VN style conversations
If you have controller problems -> go to steam Big picture mode and select controller configuration
Check all the boxes from ps4 to xbox input -> restart steam
and voila, controller will now work
Its a great game for Jrpg/MMO style gamepley/Sao fans
It has a little bit of everything, and i really like the world that is crafted so far
Enjoy the game, LINK START !Sorry for the bad english

												Pros:+Solid port runs 4k 60fps (even in town which was locked only to 30fps on console) +Great story and full of side events represented in visual novel style+Nice Soundtracks+Many things to do +Combat is greatCons:- Controller configuration problemOverall:9
5/10Update:After playing 60h+End game content is big and it has it's own storyi noticed some bugs in game like:-Your character get stuck sometimes and cannot move (Seriously? you'll be forced to exit)-The game does freeze during loading or when you switch back to the game after using another app			
Posted: 6 November
												First of all, I'm a fan of the SAO stories (Read the books and watched the anime), however, this is the first game I've played of the series (Mostly because I don't own any consoles atm)
The story is similar but it does goes on a tangent and follows it's own series of events
The story in the books/anime has many faults in terms of game mechanics, being a gamer myself it annoys me once I get out of the 'let's enjoy this story' and into 'game mode'
This game has some really good things, and some really bad ones
Just like the story in the books, it leads me to believe that whoever designed it is not a gamer themselves
Good Aspects1
The world
They made a very believable MMO setting with NPCs acting like players would in the field and in town
2
Unique NPCs
You'll see them in town and in the field
You can befriend them and eventually take them with you to the field or date them, etc
3
Quest Board
A good way of making Col (Currency) and getting some extra XP
Hunting quests, boss quests, mob drops quests (which come mostly from the Unique NPCs and help towards befriending them)
3
The Sword Art system
The active abilities are fun to combine in combat to use your combos and enhance your own playstyle
Use a weapon (sword, dagger, axe, etc
) to raise your skill level with it, which will give you access to new arts and buffs that you can learn by spending skill points
4
Multiplayer
Is very simplistic
Play with friends or strangers to grind for gear or levels
Grivances1
NPC quests
They are monotonous once you start getting a lot of them
You pick them and then have to confirm every single one of them, even if they are 150+
Is very annoying
QoL (Quality of Life) would be to have a way to pick them and turn them in in-bulk
2
Buffs/Debuff Skills
I rather have smaller buffs or debuffs turned into passive skills or reactive skills
Than having to buff myself every 30 seconds
And also they become completely useless towards end game
As passives/reactives they wouldn't become as useless
3
Controls
Gamepads don't work well at the moment
At least I couldn't get mine to work
It took me a few hours, but I got used to using mouse + keyboard
I don't think I'll use a gamepad even if they fix the issues at this point
Another thing, with so many keys, there is no need for toggle keys
It should be Optional, not enforced
4
Difficulty
It starts good and challenging, but it doesn't scale well
I got to a point around lvl 20+ when I could one shot trash that should be my level, world bosses (the lvl95 and above) were beaten with ease, and Zone Boses were done in under a minute
I went into the multiplayer at around lvl 30+ on Nightmare difficulty


they should rename it 'Stroll through the Park' difficulty
Bosses do decent damage, they just need to be more spongey
Overall is a fun game, even with the grivances I have with it
However, it also is a niche game
Is not for everyone
I'm not done with it, I'll continue until I finish it
			
Posted: 30 October
												My bf and I purchased this game with the intention of playing it multiplayer, only to be extremely disappointed that the multiplayer is only for fighting boss battles, not actually playing the game
The story is also pretty uninspired and just feels like their only goal is to beat you over the head with nostalgia
They really just need to make SAO into a real MMO
			Patch 4
1 brings a multitude of additions and refinements to the realm
Band together with your friends in search of the legendary land of Ivalice, explore the ancient city of Skalla, or face an old foe in a reimagining of your battle with the legendary dragon Shinryu

												I love this game, it's the only one I have played this much
It has a touching story although it starts off really slowly in the beginning, being mostly fetch quests and bringing you around in all the areas to unlock dungeons for your MSQ
But later the Heavensward story and especially the Stormblood story are really goddamn touching
I started out with a friend of mine a year ago
He started playing in 2010 when it first released and was an utter disaster
but now, this game is indeed one of the best MMO's out there
I don't mind paying 35 euros to play for 3 months
And now after playing for a year myself i became a mentor
Helping people who are just starting out in the game
And don't hate on all mentors
Some do it for the crown, but most still do it to help other
Now for the gameplay, it starts off slow with maybe like 1 to 10 skills total before you unlock the job for your class
 But after a while hotbars tend to fill up
Graphics are good, even though I have to put them lower because of my older laptop (AMD Radeon HD 7600 graphics card)
But the game still looks surprisingly nice
And lastly apart from alot of fetch quests you just have to watch out for RMT (Real Money Trading) bots in the 3 main cities
Just report them and be on with your day
Since if you do buy gil, the ingame currency from those sites you can get banned

												The premier MMORPG on the market right now
Even though the quest design is a fairly rote affair, the level of polish is top-notch, and immediately evident in the graphics, gameplay, and music
The community is mostly friendly to new players, and the old content is completely doable even years later, ensuring you sink hours into this game before even thinking about the first expansion
With the promise of much more to come, Final Fantasy XIV stands head and shoulders above everything else
World of Warcraft? What's that?

 Congratz Bandai Namco and CyberConnect2
You made it
Now can you do all of us a favor? Port the Rest of the Franchise to Steam
Oh by the way we also need more Tales of Games
Gameplay is 10/10
If you've played the Game on PS2 you can't go wrong
Oh and the Price is also a huge pro argument
For 50€ you'll get 4 Volumes and each of those are 20-30 Hours long
So feel free to put in atleast 100 Hours of Playtime to complete all 4 Volumes
Soundtrack wise this Game is pure


heaven

Sometimes I just stand still and listen to the music
You can't go wrong with

												I played the GU series back when in the PS2 version, and I am primarily getting this for the nostalgia
So far, I do not regret getting it
Two things I want to point out:1) I find the price pretty fair as it is 3 (or 4 if you count the newest one, not sure how long vol 4 is) games into one
2) People in the forum are saying this is a copy of SAO, I just want to refer those people to re-watch the intro
This game is being released as the 15th anniversary of 
hack, which means the original 
hack series goes all the way back 15 years ago
 On the otherhand, SAO is from 2009 (light novel)


so yea

 Welcome to The World
 Intro to 
hack//Franchise For those unfamiliar with the 
hack (or dot hack) franchise, I'll start with a basic, spoiler-free introduction
Dot Hack is a now 15 year old multimedia franchise with books, graphic novels, anime, and games, regarding a fictional MMO known simply as The World
This franchise started in the early 2000's, just following the early days of MMOs, inspired by titles such as Ultima Online and Everquest, successful MMOs before World of Warcraft popularized the genre in a more mainstream level
Each entry in dot hack tells a self-contained story about the fictional MMO and covers topics pertinent to online interactions, online indentities vs
real identities, identity politics, virtual reality, social media, urban legends, and so on
Very forward-thinking for a series conceptualized in the early 2000s
Each entry is also fairly self-contained, not necessarily requiring someone to pay attention to every book, game, anime, or movie to understand the one they are currently on, although consuming more of the franchise does paint a wider picture
It's kind of like Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear franchise in that way
On to 
hack//GU: Last Recode This game is a remastered package of 
hack//GU, a trilogy of action RPGs for the Playstation 2 console
It is the second series of games in the 
hack//Franchise but this is an ideal package to start with
The reason why is that it contains a series of 'Terminal' videos that explain the events of the first game series, so while it's not a replacement for sorely needed remasters or remakes of those games, it's a great alternative to ponying up $200-300 for that series, as it's been long out of print
The videos covering the first games are not necessary to watch for 
hack//GU but it provides some extra context and lore for those who care
As for the game itself, from my experience so far it is a competent port
Not a lot of options on this PC version, but it runs well at seemingly a locked resolution of 60 frames per second, ideal for any high-motion action game
The graphics are way better and less muddy than the PS2 originals, although obviously polygons are still obvious, especially on rounded objects
The style of the graphics are in a cel-shaded style, however, so that aspect has not aged as poorly
You can jump into any Volume you want, including a new 4th Volume created specifically for this remastered set
There is also a parody mode I have no experience with yet, but it allegedly contains spoilers and is not meant for anyone who hasn't completed the games
The gameplay of 
hack//GU: Last Recode is a story-driven action role-playing game, framed as an MMO
You have 'servers' which function as hub towns and another parameter to keep in mind for dungeons
Dungeons are accessed through key words acquired through your player character's emails, the message boards of the world, or story events, and the dungeons generated with the key words change from server to server, so trying the same word combination in different servers will give you different dungeons to complete
The Server hub worlds themselves are filled with shops, quests, events, and NPCs that roam around as if they were player characters in an MMO, and you can trade with them
A lot of effort was made to try and immerse you in the idea that you're in an MMO
The combat in dungeons is honestly very simple; one attack button, a block button, and skill triggers
It plays out like a basic brawler with repetitive combos
Do not expect depth of gameplay akin to Dark Souls
Dungeons are generated with differing objectives, but honestly from my memory it's just different floor layouts of maybe 3-5 specific types of dungeons with different aesthetic tile sets as you go along to at least change up the visuals from time to time
If there's two things that make this game (and usually, the entire franchise is strong in these regards), it's the story and the music
If you read my summary of the franchise, the story part wouldn't be too much of a surprise
It holds up pretty well with the topics and themes presented in the plot of these games becoming more and more relevant over the years
Again, I must compare the story to Metal Gear
Specifically, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, except with less pseudo-politics on a national scale
The music is very well-composed and catchy in GU, a large improvement over the soundtrack in the original dot hack games in my opinion
Not as stellar as the soundtrack for the first anime, 
hack//SIGN, though, but it fits the action of the game well
Conclusion If any of what I have said sounds appealing to you, I would say that this package is worth the price of admission as it is at $50
Previously, the games were only on PS2 with no ports to other systems, and physical copies long out of print and produced in limited numbers in the United States, where I live
Saying that, before this I was only ever able to get the first two volumes, and a complete set nowadays of the physical copies would set you back over $100, WITHOUT the extra volume, Terminal videos recapping the original (also rare) $300 
hack//Games, new stuff like the Parody mode, difficulty options, and upgraded visuals
All that said, you could argue this is a way to get roughly $400 value of previously hard to acquire content at the much cheaper price tag of $50
Although I would still very much like it if Bandai-Namco and CyberConnect2 would just invest in remaking the original dot hack game series already
If you're on the fence, I would say wait for the eventual steam sales to take their course until you feel ready to take the plunge
This series has a long history and can be overwhelming for newcomers, so buying it on a sale is much less of a risk if you are unsure
As a fan of this often-ignored franchise I would definitely reccommend everyone to give it a try eventually
This franchise is especially fun to people with experience or interest in games and their development, tech, and AI, even if the series often takes creative liberties with the subject matter

Good port to PC and runs well
If you are a fan of the series/games get this
I heard volume 4 is really short but I got this for the first three volumes so all the extras and the 4th volume is just a bonus for me :)

But that never happened
I lent a buddy my original series games, and after he finished he wanted more
After some reluctance I let him borrow the entire GU series
I never saw them again
I assume he found out how much they were worth, I haven't spoken to him in years either
Now its been 10 years since I purchased Vol
3 and I am finally able to finish the story, better yet they came out with an entirely new game
I am very grateful they came to steam as I don't own a PS4, I have been waiting for this for so long
Thanks!

												A solid port of a classic RPG series
As a veteran of the games, it took me 16 hours to beat Vol
1's main story, plus an additional 10 hours of (fairly repetitive) grinding for 100%
Volumes 2 and 3 are similar in length to the first, so expect 45-75 hours of playtime depending on how much you want to invest in completion
As for the fourth volume, I hear it's shorter than the first three, but haven't yet gotten to it myself, so I can't comment there
A few comments, take them as you will:-Except in certain instances, characters' mouths do not move when they talk
-There are a few very minor glitches and I have experienced the occasional crash while playing; not nearly enough to stop me from continuing
-The previously-limited-edition Terminal Disc is included, which will help bring you up to speed on the lore and the story of the original series for new players, and expand on the existing lore for veterans
-The trailers claim to have taken the various improvements made in Volumes 2 and 3 and applied them to the first game
This is only partially true; some features from the 2nd and 3rd Volumes are still not present in Vol
1, such as the improved combo mechanics of the twin blades or better charge attacks of the broadsword, or, perhaps most importantly, the quick-switch mechanic
-Some of the Bonus Content cutscenes are not updated to HD, and are displayed in a small window within the game
This does not apply to the cutscenes seen throughout the games themselves; only the extra ones you unlock at the end
-The game's EXP, Skill Points, and Attack Power have been rebalanced to provide a much smoother leveling curve
This version, therefore, is much easier than the originals
-Features a "Cheat Mode" that allows you to play through the story at max level
Considering the point above, this is mostly inconsequential, as you will rarely have to grind in a normal playthrough anyway
-Textures and models still look decidedly old, but passable
The lighting engine and cel-shading go a long way to help this
-The game was made for the PS2, as such it is meant to be played with a controller
It does support DirectInput, as well as all the modern controller APIs
-Keyboard controls can be re-mapped, but mouse and controller cannot
All-in-all, I think this collection has been well worth my $50 so far, and I haven't even beaten half of it yet

												"I told people online about my problems
In real life, no one would care about them, but online, everyone cares
My online friends are all so nice
They worry about me, they give me advice
I just wish real life was like my life online
" -Quote from an article in the game DAMN
This is perfect if you're a fan or a new player wanting to play this franchise (ps2 copies are rare and expensive)
I never had the chance to play vol 2 and 3 because of the price years after it went rare
I had beaten vol 1 a few times back on the ps2 years ago
When this release was first announced I was nothing but excited to get my money's worth
The quality of the game feels really good and smooth
The combat is pretty straightforward and simple with a one button attack but you get additional skills to execute
Additionally, you also have recovery attacks for more strategy if I may say so
It doesn't sound fun from words alone but it is when you have your hands in control of the game
Gameplay allows you to do general things you'd expect from an actual mmo like guild management, arena, improve gears questing etc

The game isn't complex by any means
It's straightforward fun as a game should be

Hack GU has a great narrative that give reason to invest time in the game
There is more than enough cutscenes to entertain the story and develop the characters
Furthermore, the fictional forums the game provides in its internet sphere offers branching narratives and lore to the world of 
Hack in game and the real world
The game was ahead of its time tackling issues relevant today about technology when it becomes too much a part of our lives not just for a solution but more so for convenience (which you would have to read in the in game forum)
It also makes you feel like you are in a forum with people discussing these topics like in real people
But even if you don't read them, the narrative will allude to these things or some characters will mention them
There are some minor pop in issues in open fields which can be annoying as well as the LOD for distance in the outside maps
The graphical quality is a decent improvement
			
Posted: 5 June
												So I have bought this game on 05/25/17 and have been only playing this game till 06/04/2017 with an accumulate of 139 hours
Update: 06/22/2017 accumulated about 235 hours and I have payed a month of my Subscription :)
I am reupdating this for the Summer Sale for people who want to try this game and also for the StormBlood DLC update
Positive:-Noob Friendly-Tons of content (heavensword content might be needed if u want to max to 60)-Chocobo-The godlike music-Multiple classes to choose from
-The community seems better than most MMO'S that I have played
-New DLC for more new content
-Heavily Story relient
Most mmos have faied to make a decent story line but this game manged to pull it off
-Fun with friends
-Options to change your HUD settings
-Dungeons/Trials/Raids
Probably the best thing in this MMO with each bosses being unique and it does require everyone to cooperate
Update: Graphics: Even with a Low end PC you can still run this game smoothly
For Medium-High End PC the game looks gorgeous from Cutscenes to the most simplest flower it looks amazing
Free Companies: Aka guilds- If you can find a dedicated Company you can obtain tons of benefits and some can help you run dungeons
(Just joined one so not much info there)Enternal Bondings:  So there is something called the enternal bonding (sorry if I am saying it wrong)
Which are marriages
With an actual Wedding
Why not lol
Not fully detailed about this but I find it kinda suprising to have in an MMO bc this is the first I have heard about in an MMO
Fates: Open World Events that can award you EXP if you can find a good amount of people to run with
(Gotten popular since a StormBlood Update)]-Tons of Mini games that can let you obtain costumes/mounts and cards for tripletriad(Similar to Gwent)Gear: Pretty easy to obtain high end gear that can be obtained from Raids and other methods
Also Relic/Anima Weapons (aka legendary weapons) for a specified class that could take you probably days to weeks to obtain the highest stat
(Looks pretty cool)Classes: Not sure if I was specific with classes in this game, You will have a single character with multiple classes to change into
There are 9 DPS,,3 Tanks,3Healers, 7 Crafters, and a class to obtain ores/fishing
This helps prevent anylack of endgame content
And they can be all maxed out to lv 70
Negative:- Past 50+ the story just feels somewhat dreadfully long, It's mostly for you to unlock more dungeons and trials (bosses), But the story starts to take a much better turn after 
-Targeting system when your in a 24 vs 24 vs 24 PvP Match
(still figuring out how to fix/improve on that) update:  Targeting is difficult because being able to just find the target you want to click will end up clicking your own teamate
Even the random targeting system is random sometimes not sure how it works
(still figuring it out)
Update: Ok its pretty difficult for me to even find any negatives in this game
It doesn't mean its flawless
-lv 1-40: This could drop off alot of people playing this game from probably the story or the amount of content unavailable until you reach lv 50
Neutral:-Monthly Payment: Even I didn't know about this but, It is possible to pay your monthly subscription with Steam Credits
And yes you can pay through steam if you have purchased the game from steam and its connected to your final fantasy account
There is constant update and content just given through this game so I can see why its monthly and I can say its worth it
-Servers, I don't really have any problem with this but if your in an empty server and your asking for help, it might be difficult for you
So its better to do some research
You will que up with other people in different servers if your doing dungeons or any other instances
Also a paywall if your planning to transfer servers with your character
-Leveling: Took me about maybe 50-70 hour just to max out 1 of my classes to lv 50 then an additional 12-18 hours to max out to 60
I don't have any problems with this but sometimes I felt that the gap between 50-60 just makes you want to murder your own chocobo
But its generally worth it if you reach end game
-The story: This is probably the most important
The story took me about approximetly 2-4 days just from the standard edition
I haven't finished Heavensward and that took me about another 2-3 days just to finish 60%
The point being is that YOU will feel rushed and proably feel like skipping cutscenes,texts and other moments in the story
The cutscenes are amazing and the story is good but It felt like the mistake being is that I rushed it just to reach end game
The story could probably take you a month or 2 if your mostly on and half the time
Which is good
Update:-Queue times: This just happened at the Launch of stormblood probably because the amount of Players switching from Tank to DPS
Of crouse it isn't an issue if you are either a healer/tank or if your group at least one of the 2
The Queue times could sometimes average around 20-30 minutes
(Square Enix might plan to fix this issue so this might not be an issue later on
)-Pricing: Not going too complain but for most people they might be stingy about this, If your planning to buy this game I would extremely suggest you to get the complete edition for the standard and stormblood(comes with heavensward) that will be about 55-60$
Reason is because if you were to buy this game individually (like I did) your going to pay more
Free trial: I want to suggest you to play on the free trial before starting this off but it feels like its going to be difficult to get into until you reach the first dungeon trial at 20
I want people more people to play this game but some of my friends dropped from the free  trial probably because they didn't have any dedicated commitment from leveling 1-19
The Free Trial is capped at lv 30 but I get the feeling you still won't be able to experience all the features in this game
But you can max out to 30 before purchasing the game
Updated:I am probably missing out more information about this game than I am right now but majority of it is positive
This game is highly underated and I wish that people would at least try the game at see the amount of potential this game has
To be honest this game feels like what WoW became popularr when Wrath of the Litch King was released
(Not a hate rant)
This game feels like it has more content than GW2 endgame
Both are amazing MMO's but, Final Fantasy 14 feels like the MMO that I was missing in my life
If Square Enix keeps up the constant updates I am willing to keep playing

												I gave up WoW (or World of Warcraft) For this game
Why? You only need one character to play every class
The classes build off of eachother to add diversity to your play style as well as to upgade into more role focused jobs
You can craft your own gear, you can make your own food and you can play 90% of the game ALL BY YOURSELF! You don't have to be in a guild or part of a click
The people who play this game are shockingly friendly and supportive
Dungeons are part of a finder in game
The story line is epic and the cinematics are breathtakeing
The opening video almost had me in tears just because I knew what was happening without any words
Square has really outdone themselves with this title and I can't wait to see how they wow me with FFXV!Edit: As per a commented question, The sub options come in 30/90/180 day increments and can be set up as recurring (thanks Pasty858)
180 days is roughly $78
Also, anyone who would like to share in the recruit a friend benefits, message me
SO! Its been a while since I've played
after logging over 200 hours that weren't counted on here, and doing everything short of Savage content, I have to say that I never thought I would play a game that would tug my heart strings so much again
But this game
The most recent MSQ line just keeps the punches coming
It was amazing! If you love FF games, you must give this one at least a one month (or 14day) trial period!

9/10 - Would Manderville again
This review was written based on version 3
0Pros:Consistent, large patches about every 3 months
Gorgeous graphics engine
Deep crafting system
Probably the best storytelling in an MMO I've ever seen (but it does take 30+ hour to really get into the meat of it)One of the most friendly gaming communities around
Cross-platform play with the PS3 and PS4, excellent controller support for PC
Possible to play casually and still enjoy/experience the game with hardcore friends
Hildebrand - Game doesn't take itself too seriously and just has fun
Neutral:Game doesn't reinvent the MMO wheel
It is a pretty standard "theme park" MMO
That being said, it is extremely polished and everything in the game is executed very well
Subscription model, I was almost tempted to put this in the Pros column
One of the few games to do this model well in a sea of F2P MMOs
Cons:Tens of hours of monotonous fetch quests sprinkled throughout the game
Usual MMO fare
Long PvP queues, slightly unbalanced
(Not enough people play PvP)Endgame content can be very grindy at times
(Ex: Relic Weapons, and "Run the same 2 dungeons over and over to get currency to buy gear"
)Gil sellers - I realize this happens in pretty much every MMO
This didn't make the list because it happens, it is strictly on the list because of advertising chat spam
On an average day you will see a lot of messages (unless you're like me and are so fed up with it you go /away)
Expect the spam to be cranked up to 11 whenever a large piece of content is released
I really feel SE could implement better countermeasures with respect to advertising
It does seem worse than in many of it's other AAA MMO competitors
On a side note, I'm told the JP servers are practically gil seller free
I've never tested this myself however
Overall, not a huge con, but an annoyance none the less

Posted: 19 January, 2015
												I've never been an MMO player
Briefly played Tera - liked it but found progression slow - and briefly WoW - disliked the combat, just felt like button mashing
I also played Mabinogi for a short while and really disliked the game's mechanics
One day I felt the urge to play one and I knew a friend was planning to start this so I bought it but neither of us started
9 days ago a friend of mine was looking for people who wanted to start and I decided that if it was in my steam list I may as well try it out
I am now 95
9 hours in according to steam and I love it
I've just hit level 50 and got my Paladin armour and I'm still looking at all the content coming up
As I speak server is going down to patch even more content into the game
So here's the detailed review:StoryThe story is a good one as far as MMOs go (based on my limited experience)
I'd equate it to WoW in some ways as FFXIV builds off of an already established lore but is still extremely easy for new players to get into
I don't want to say much about it but Square Enix really put work into making a good story
It teeters a bit at times, especially around the middle (lv30-40 is a bit slow) but it's very enjoyable if you get into it
ClassesCombat classes are fairly traditional: tank, support, ranged DPS and melee DPS
Still within these wider definitions, each individual class is fairly unique
To add to this you are not restricted to the classes that you pick at the beginning of the game
You will unlock the ability to train any and all classses as you wish which allows for a lot of flexibility
But "Oh, the grind ¬¬" you say
Nope, all classes trained beyond the first receive exp gain bonuses which really speeds up the process
This is alongside the quick levelling options which I'll discuss in a later section
There's more though! All combat classses have a progression called a "Job" which is earned by reaching a certain point in the story, getting a class to lv30 and the corresponding second class to lv15, and then finishing the job quest
It's actually really easy to do and it encourages you to try a different role
All combat classes are unique and don't overlap much at all which is great
As for crafting classes, there's a fair few of them and I have limited experience of them right now but crafting itself isn't just sit there and wait for things to appear
There's an active process and is fairly enjoyable
Just like the combat classes, new skills are unlocked and it becomes a sort of strategic minigame
Quick synthesis for bulk items is available as well so you don't have to do it for each item
Still I can see crafting becoming tedious
repetitive and boring at some point but that's no different from any other mmo
Also, unlike the combat classes, the crafting classes aren't really unique
CombatThe combat system is targetted, which honestly I was sceptical about when first going in as I'm not a big fan of targetted combat but it grows on you
This is mostly to do with how the game feels since you really have to think about movement, positioning, skill orders, skill timing etc
from more or less the beginning of the game
This is a big deal and playing the first 20 or so levels in WoW feels boring and just mashing buttons in a certain order
The 2
5sec global cooldown adds to the strategic element of it too
You have more time to think and decide what move would be appropriate, but you also have a longer window to be punished for choosing the wrong skill
I honestly think this is way more fun and interesting compared to other games with a much smaller global cooldown
Another important point is that this game is very controller friendly
It's on the PS3/PS4 with cross platform support so that would be why
I personally play with a controller and it feels very smooth
I don't feel too overwhelmed with skills and I've unlocked all of them for my job with 3 cross skills in use as well (I have 2 full hotbars but it's very easy to switch between them)
It's down to preference in the end but the option is really nice to have
LevellingThere are so many different ways to level it's crazy
Though the main story quest is compulsory, there are loads of side quests available
If you think quests are repetitive you can switch over to doing FATES which are events that spawn that give gil (money) and experience to everyone that completes them based on the level of participation
If that's boring there are many different dungeons to do with solid exp gain on all of them
Duty roullete will give you bonus exp once a day so deffo worth doing that
No? Then you can do levequests which are contracts to do certain things in certain places which you can get by using one of your levequest allowances (which refill regularly)
Levequests are available to crafting classes too and are considered the fastest ways to level them
Still not enough? Then Guildhests might be for you
These are very similar to levequests but you're put into a duty (instance) with a party and asked to do it as a group
There's a daily bonus on guildhest roullete as well so that's good
Also, the first time you do a certain dungeon, levequest or guildhest you'll be granted bonus exp which is always a definite plus
Still too slow? Not enough content? Too repetitive? Well if you're that hard to please then I guess I should tell you that there are these things called logs which grant bonus exp for doing certain things
A hunting log will ask you to kill x number of y, while a crafting log will give you the list of everything you can craft
The king of all these is the challenge log which refreshes weekly and gives you a lot of exp for completing tasks like "complete 3 dungeons" or "complete 5 levequests"
Honestly there are so many different ways to level that players can pick something that suits them and though some can get repetitive they're fun for the most part
EndgameYou only need to google the game to see the amount of post lv50 content
The game's been out for about a year and there are things constantly being added
The first expansion is coming out soon so keep an eye out for that
Most people will tell you that lv50 is just the beginning, and they're probably right
I'm only just getting into the endgame and I look forward to everything coming up
PriceWell
This is the one major downside I see to the game
It's very expensive
Though nothing new for an mmo, it is a pretty heavy financial commitment compared to most other steam games out there
Especially considering you can get Tera, Mabinogi, and loads of other mmos for free now
You can buy gametime online from other sellers for a bit cheaper but it's still expensive
I suggest playing the trial to give you a better understanding of whether you'll enjoy it
I highly suggest it and will be playing it, but I can appreciate that a few years ago I could never afford to play a game like this
ConclusionI honestly think this is the first mmo to seriously impress me with its ability to keep you interested
It doesn't overwhelm you, nor does it leave you with nothing to do
Bosses are often really cool and have interesting mechanics, even from an early point in the game
I really do feel that besides the price this game is practically perfect
It's a great game - buy it if you can

												I was a WoW player
I played every expansion, I did HC/Mythic raiding, I spent thousands of hours playing it
If I could go back and get this on launch day instead, I would do it in a heart beat
If you are an MMO players, this  is hands down the best MMO on the market
 I've played every major MMO since Ultima Online back in the 90s
FFXIV has every element you could want in an MMO and executes them extremely well
The class system, all classes being available on a single character, is amazing
No alts, not that you can't have them, you just don't need them
The story is captivating, you actually want to read the quests and see what happens rather than just click through to get the objectives
Speak of quests, there are a ton, even without the myriad of side quests, and only completeing the main story, you can reach level cap on a class
Then roll in dungeons, raids, leves, hunting logs, challenge log, etc etc etc there is never a shortage of things to do, and they have made all of them entertaining
If you like MMOs even a little bit, stop reading and click the buy button
Really, stop
Why are you still reading
Stop it! Go play FFXIV, seriously

												Final Fantasy XIV, the original one, was a mess
The servers were terrible, payments were unfair and confusing, and the game just made it so difficult for you to enjoy
Square Enix realised, "holy hell, this is bad" and revamped the game, leading to the release of A Realm Reborn
And boy did they do good
A Realm Reborn is not only a more polished FF XIV, it is a new game
It offers so much more than the original
Better service, better gameplay, more engrossing quests, everything an MMO can offer is in this game
A Realm Reborn is by far the best Final Fantasy of the last console generation, and it is perhaps the best FF I have ever played
It stays true to it's roots, but still manages to not be a total copy cat of previous FF games
It borrows alot from the orginal series, when Final Fantasy was at it's best, but adds a sense of freshness so that FF new-comers could pick up the game and play it as their first FF and still have a wonderful experience
Detail is where this game excells
The amount of effort into making this as refined as possible is staggering
You could honestly sit at the character creation screen for an hour, picking the tiniest things about your hero
The environments are fantastic, and it's hard to believe that an MMO looks this good
As well as being the best Final Fantasy in years, it is also groundbreaking in the MMO genre
It offers so much to the genre as a whole, it has made a name for it's self as one of the greatest MMOs in recent years
It is addicting
It is enchanting
It is simply bliss
Square Enix have really made me regain my faith in them, and I hope that they let future Final Fantasies learn from A Realm Reborn
I cannot wait until more content is added into the game, and clock in a few more hours
Get yourself this game now, even just for the free trial, it's worth it
Even if you're a hardcore FF fan, or a newcomer looking for a game to start with
This is the one
+ Essentially has it all
Near enough limitless gameplay hours+ Environments look stunning, attention to detail is incredible+ Smooth gameplay, easy to learn mechanics+ Makes great homage to previous Final Fantasy games- A lot of fetch quests- Occasional bug here and there10/10
This is a fantastic game
Get it

Early Access Review
								Another match-3 game from SakuraGame, mixed with short visual novel segments
I assume it's similar to Hell Girls, although I don't have much time playing that one so I can't make good comparisons
I'm writing this review after playing the first 2 1/2 chapters of Mirror (out of 8 total in the current build)
Bottom line: For a day-1 Early Access game, this is easily worth two bucks
Even if development stopped today, I would have expected to pay between $5 and $10 for what's there now
The artwork is very high quality, both for the characters and the backgrounds, and there's a lot of variety for both
The visuals overall are the best part of the game, on par with some of the more expensive VNs on Steam - Example (SFW)[steamuserimages-a
akamaihd
net]
The only fault I could see is that the style isn't always consistent - some backgrounds have a watercolor-style appearance while others are crisp and CG-like, but it didn't bother me at all
Music is okay - mostly unmemorable but it fits the game fine
The title track is a standout
The English translation is not great, but it's better than most other games published by SG on Steam
There seems to be at least some human involvement in it - not completely done by machine
I didn't have any trouble understanding what was being said 80% of the time
Hopefully they will make another pass or two and by the final release it could be relatively polished
Each chapter of the game appears to be a self-contained story, with unique characters and plot
Although the gameplay is primarily match-3 in the style of Puzzle Quest and the like, there are also short visual novel vignettes before each battle
They are a few minutes in length, and each one has a dialogue choice that results in gameplay modifier (e
g
-10% enemy health, +20% enemy attack, etc)
The modifiers don't seem to have much impact so I wouldn't worry about making a bad choice
This is because there isn't a lot of strategy involved in the battles
There are only 4 primary icons on each 8x7 board, so you'll be getting a lot 5x and higher combo chains without really trying
These battles are the weakest aspect of the game
I hope they take the time to add some more variety and make them less luck-based, but I don't think that's likely to happen by the time the game is finished
There is an in-game shop where you can upgrade stats and get new abilities, but I haven't spent much time experimenting with it because I've only lost a single battle so far
Again though I don't think it would make a difference
At the end of each chapter is a slightly longer VN section with a sex minigame with the opponent you defeated
The sexual content appears to be mostly bondage-related - nothing unusual for these sorts of games
The explicit portions are censored and there's no patch to undo it at the time I'm writing this, but pretty much every other SG release has one so I would expect it to appear before too long

								Interesting puzzle game
I thought the back story is rather interesting too
You have a little choices matter sort of dialogue
I have a few SakuraGame titles, lives up to their art style, to put it simply
A little on the lewd side
R rated but not completely full frontal, but then again its more echi than adult manga
Honestly I'm very surprised they charge so little for this title
And  with a promotion of 40% off at launch, its a no brainer

Early Access Review
 First ImpressionMy first impression is that this game is that the games will be full of nudes, just a linear elimination games
That's all
I bought it since the early purchase will entitle customers to 2 more free gift games
Maybe sooner or later will start having cards, so it is an investment
  Playing Experience	But, I was wrong, not about the nudes things, yes there a lots of them
Few of them are somehow a bit too much for me
(maybe i am a bit conservative)
I was wrong that this game is just a game that use sexy anime girl to attracts weebs
They offer more than that
The animation is nicely done, story lines created are interesting and different for each of chapters/levels/girls
The elimination gem games combined rpg character skills builds so that the gems eliminated will have difference effects
The music is pretty good
It is enjoyable to play this game while listening to them
Character voices are good and such and ear candy for me
Since it is just early access game, i hope they will add more contents, more characters, and more diversity in the game play
I personally would recommend the game
It is not a waste will worth every cents spent

												I wanted to wait until I beat it to write a review but at 60 hours in, the game is already so good I feel compelled to
This is probably one of the best action JRPGs you will find on PC, and certainly the height of the Tales series (disclaimer: I've played a handful, but not nearly all of them)
Let's dive right into what makes Berseria great, and where it's a bit lacking:- The story is engrossing
Yes, it's JRPG, and it's Tales, so there's bound to be clichés and tropes, but Berseria strikes the perfect balance of not taking itself too seriously while presenting you with relatable characters in genuinely compelling scenarios
You can have fun, but still feel invested, and there's enough sub-plots to keep you interested in ALL of the main cast
- The combat is bleeding edge, joyous, chaotic mayhem
It's super fast paced, and between juggling enemy types to trigger status effects to fill your Soul Gauge to use Break Souls to feed your Mystic Artes (which you'll want to properly time to get grade bonuses, among other things), there is always a strategy to be refined on the battlefield if you are a grinder, min-maxer, or whatever
That isn't to say mastering the mechanics is a necessity
There are plenty of tools and difficulty settings to tweak the combat difficulty to your liking
Me? I crank that **** up to Intense ASAP and get to work melting wave after wave of demons in Dangerous Encounters (and all the better if you get a Dire Foe afterwards - seriously, these are some of the best, most heated moments of the game!)
- The cast is fantastic and the writing is strong
This is hands down the biggest strength for me
Despite being yet another title in a genre as saturated as JRPG (in a series as dense as Tales, no less), the main characters manage to have very distinct personalities and motivations, and are just the right amount of "morally grey" to be likable without being obnoxious
They start off as somewhat standoffish misfits, cooperating only to pursue their personal opportunistic goals, but over time you will see them grow together in a way that is believable
There's also something deeply satisfying about being able to play as a team of blatant criminals, as opposed to the white knights, royalty, and chosen ones we've grown so tired of
And beyond that, even the side cast of characters does a great job of complementing and bouncing off of the main cast
The villains do seem a bit one dimensional, and I fear the "big bad" twist is going to end up being predictable, but it's a small bump on an otherwise fantastic journey
Final note on this - the themes and the tones are appropriately adult
The language feels natural and there is swearing and innuendo in all the right places, never beating you over the head with it
- The pacing is good
The intro/tutorial segment is the perfect length (some Tales games have ones that drag on ENTIRELY too long, not the case here), and you will periodically unlock new mechanics to keep the gameplay fresh
You will actually acquire all the party members pretty early on in the game, although this is preferable due to how the equipment mastery system works
- Great customization options
The arte pools are huge, and the trees are fully customizable
I've used Velvet almost exclusively for the first 60 hours, but I can tell there is still plenty to unlock for her and the rest of the cast seems to have their own fun, unique playstyles as well
Because of how fast paced the combat is, I don't find myself switching primary fighters as much as previous Tales games, but Berseria actually makes it even easier by allowing you to swap mid-battle, mid-combo
Lots of fashion options, lots of equipment flavors, and a mastery system that makes it fairly compelling to keep different sets of equipment around (and tweak until your playstyle is content)
- The world map is expansive, but the areas can be a bit samey, and the puzzles are definitely nothing groundbreaking
Pretty middle of the road for JRPG, so just don't expect anything impressive there
I find myself constantly looking back to Symphonia as the holy grail of Tales world maps, as I've yet to see that one be outdone
- The voice acting is good
I've only listened to the dub, as the English VAs are more than serviceable
The main cast are all great
The NPCs are not as varied as I'd like or as I have seen in previous Tales games, but again a pretty small nitpick
Nearly all cutscenes and skits are fully voiced, though, so there is a truly dense amount of lore and worldbuilding going on, if you are into it (I am)
- The visuals are aesthetically pleasing
Watch some videos
It should be clear that Berseria is not pushing next gen graphic fidelity
Instead it goes for a colorful, eye-popping art style that does the game justice
- The music is good
The tracks set the appropriate moods, and have enough depth to be enjoyable from moment to moment, but I honestly didn't find much in the way of "holy **** I need to go download this right NOW" kind of songs
Still, I would say a bit above average in terms of video game music
In summary, this is a must-buy for Tales fans, but still a heavily encouraged purchase for JRPG fans, action RPG fans, or someone looking to try out the genre
If you haven't tried the series before, don't worry about needing to start at the beginning
You can jump right into this without any issues and you'll find yourself getting giddy with glee as you literally hack through swaths of demons like they were hot butter in no time: I guarantee it

												I think the only bad thing I can say about this game is that a lot of the environments just seem pretty bland and the dungeon layouts can be irritating at times
I also wish that it looked nicer overall
Velvet could also use some better costume options :sThat aside, the game has a wonderful story and the entire group of characters are all lovable
The combat is somewhat deep and also quite fun
You can definitely tell that a lot of care and love was put into this game
This was my first Tales of game and now I'm definitely going to be looking to play more! Easily my favorite game of all time

												Once every few years, a JRPG arrives that blends together good world-building, a story that is both fascinating and thought-provoking, challenging your own worldview, philosophy and beliefs and a combat system that, while simple at first, makes you feel like a glorious badass having fun killing hordes after hordes of enemies
This is Tales of Berseria
Review is spoiler-free, minus the intro stuff
The game puts you in the boots of Velvet - an average village girl that one day gets to see her little brother being murdered right in front of her by her own brother-in-law, she turns into a daemon and then she gets thrown in prison to feast on other daemons for 3 years
As she manages to escape with someone's help, she learns that her brother-in-law now is mankind's greatest hope against daemons, and the whole world praises him as a saviour
Filled with rage for the injustice she and her brother tasted, she embarks on a journey to kill him
Let me start off with the world-building
I was having a discussion with a few friends over how games stopped bothering with giving attention to details due to how gamers nowadays tend not to care much about information that gives you a clue on how X village works, how they survive in Y conditions etc
For that I'm glad that Berseria doesn't do that
Here, in the form of completely optional NPC's, you'll find stuff like a father looking for his lost son, a group of teenagers who become interested in music and decide to start their own band and dogs that are criticizing humanity
For that I praise the creators of the game who decided to not restrict themselves to "what information is useful" but also to "what information makes you immerse"
I found myself returning to a city wondering whether a couple of NPC's got married
I can't criticize the English voice acting because I play the game in Japanese voice acting, and there's some great quality to be found there
One of the characters in the group, for example, is the same voice actor behind Jojo's bizarre adventure part 4 antagonist, Yoshikage Kira, and he's doing a glorious job here, too
Combat system time! People will bash the game for having "button-mashing combat"
And they are right, combat is button mashy, BUT


It would be wrong to stop here
See, this is first and foremost a JRPG that has an "exploit weakness system"
Your typical dungeon/area visit will be  to first identify the enemy population's weaknesses, compile combos that hit every weakness they have then mash that button against them
For example (oversimplified), if an area has worms, knights and bats I end up identifying and crafting 3 different combos so I'll mash Y for bats, X for knights and B for worms (Xbox controller)
This is the equivalent of scrolling through menus in a turn-based JRPG to find the ice spell versus enemies that are weak to ice, the armor penetration move for armored enemies etc
Later in the game the enemy variety becomes large enough that not only you craft combos for each but you make sure you can weave them
So you'll start with X for the first move of the X-combo then Y because the second move of the Y-combo works not only for bats but for armored, etc
Then you get moves called mystic artes that make your characters go full blown crazy killing machines
All in silky smooth 60 frames per second, even for my poverty rig (there's a demo on Steam that you can check out if you're not sure about your PC's performance)
Add to that the amazing A
I
behind your teammates, which is also one of the best, if not the best in a Tales game ever and can easily play better than 70% of the players! I can even put everyone on "auto" and go to the bathroom knowing that we will almost certainly win a fight
Now for the downsides: So far, I find the game quite linear - on rails, so to speak, and the optional areas that I have unlocked so far (I haven't finished the game yet, have mercy) are simple arenas that lack in the difficulty and satisfaction department, compared to the rest of the content
I found myself visiting them once, go "is that it?" then leave in disappointment
Maybe this will change as the game goes on
I heard very good things about the post-game content
There are also the occasional sidequests and mini games that (thankfully) are so many and diverse that you can "play favorites" without losing the rewards (you win coins that let you buy stuff, but its shared across mini-games, thanks Namco)
The difficulty settings are Simple - Normal - Moderate - Hard, with Intense and Chaos being unlocked after you do something in the game
On the other hand, there's a way to make fights so hard you'll almost always get a couple of party members or everyone dead
To give you a clue, my winrate in normal fights is around 90% but for dangerous fights it's at 10%, but that's just me not accepting winning a fight with people being knocked out left and right (the game rewards you with in-game score, called Grade, if you win fights without deaths and without using items, who would say no to that?!?)
Maybe it's also me being used to JRPG's throughout the years
Someone can also play the game with the combat system in full automatic mode - AI doing everything - in case you just want to experience the story without bothering with learning how the combat works (I wouldn't do that but some people could)
NINJA EDIT: Something else that I noticed and I gotta say: Contrary to most JRPG's, on higher difficulties the enemies not only get the usual stat increases but also different attack frequency and in bosses it can be a change of movesets and spells!Overall, this isn't simply one of the top Tales games ever (and easily the best modern Tales game - RIP Zestiria) but a great JRPG
I said it on my Zestiria review and I'll say it again: "Tales of" games are the only JRPG series on Steam that combines fast-paced flashy combat system with immersive storytelling
Does it worth paying full price? For me that's a resounding yes
But I hope that my review was informative enough to draw your own decision
Meanwhile, I'll be finishing my playthrough and prepare for my next one
And if you choose to get into it, I would advise you to take it slow and savor every minute, instead of speed through it
JRPG's like this one deserve to be enjoyed like good wine or chocolate

												Do you like great story telling?Do you like JRPG's?Well, there's a reason you see "Overwhemingly positive" on the reviews
Treat yourself

												A JRPG in which your starting party is an angry vengeful demon, a psychopath with a sword, a merciless pirate and a brainwashed child you literally kidnap and take on dangerous adventures with for endgoal to kill King Arthur because he made the world a better place and you just can't accept saving the world was worth one life
Also the battle system is majorly improved over Zestiria and Xillia/Xillia2

												So after about 70 hours i finished the story of Tales of Berseria
I did not download any item packs and played on normal difficulty
I´ll just jump right into the review
GraphicsIt fullfills its purpose
It is not espeacially good or bad
The characters are well designed and the animated scenes are beautiful
But tbh, i don´t really care about the graphic quality in this game
SoundFirst of all the soundtrack is amazing
No other than Motoi Sakuraba composed the soundtrack
It really has a big role in the atmosphere of the game
This is what i call art
Every scene is accompanied by a track, that fits perfectly
Joy, happiness or sadness, even the funny parts feel authentic
Now the dub
Everything in this game is dubbed
The dubbing actors did an amazingly good job
I have no reason to play the Newgame+ with japanese dub
The english dub is by far better than expected and i´ll stick to that
BUT this game has a bug
Many people cannot hear certain sounds when using 5
1 surround sound
In this case you also cannot hear the dub
Using the stereo mode fixes this problem, but can cause other sound issues
I recommend using a fix for that (just google it and you will find it)
GameplayThe battle system is in realtime and pretty good, but not well explained
You have to figure out some stuff on your own
Tbh, i liked figuring stuff out, but i can see people being annoyed, because certain actions/skills don´t work they way they expected it
The items and ability system is easy to understand and the game is beatable without focussing too much on optimization
If you want to master every equipment or make very effective combos in battles it becomes a little bit more complex
Outside from fights in dungeons you have to walk a bit until you unlock certain teleportation points
Outside from dungeons there is a quick travel system that is bound to a consumeable item
Since you should have absolutely no money problems, it is no problem to buy nearly endless of this stuff
At a certain point ingame i nearly stopped caring about anything that has to do with gameplay, because the story gets such a strong peak, you could have given me 2d jump´n´run gameplay and i would have enjoyed this game
AtmosphereNow some of the more important parts
The atmosphere in this game is convincing
I felt like i was part of the world ingame
This is achieved by the amazing soundtrack and also by many other little things
For example small conversations between characters (which are also dubbed) or even some background noises
The characters all have their motivations to do whatever they do and no one feels out of place
There are many scenes where i thought: "Oh god no, why did you say that?" The first time was the point where my mindset changed
These characters HAVE a personality
Each of them
And the game is not afraid of showing this
The characters develop while progressing in game
Everything happens for a reason
To fully understand what happened with some characters i had to rewatch scenes or let whatever happened rewind in my head
I paused the game many times, just being stunned, waiting for my brain to comprehend the situation
StoryWow, what can i say about the story
I don´t know, i am speechless
The story in itself is kind of sinister and gets darker, especially when you understand why certain things happend
While the game starts a bit slow it quickly gets to a point where i stopped thinking this is a game
I stopped "playing" it and started "experiencing" it
My emotional state was decided by the happenings in game
I felt joy, i laughed, i was angry, i even cried a few times
This story hits you hard with emotions
And this is coming from a guy who stopped playing story focused game long ago and thought he was more of a cold, emotionless guy
tl;dr: All i can say is i am absolutely overwhelmed by this masterpiece
Don´t get scared away if you think the beginning is slow or boring
If you are only interested a little bit in JRPGs or just want want to experience a great stroy, because most of the animes released nowadays are boring, i definetly recommend this game
I also recommend watching the trailer "The Calamity and The Blade", which is english dubbed, since steam only has the "The Flame" trailer
This is the best game i have ever played

												Pros-Fast paced intuitive combat
-Solid visuals and animations
Cutscenes are nice
Character models and expressions are great
-Interesting story theme
-A lot of content, very long game even when you're moving through it at a fast pace
-Great HUD for finding points of interest and next plot point
-Tag switch mechanic is fun
Soul Break mechanic is fun
-A good amount of side content with interesting rewards
Unlocking some costumes felt rewarding
Cons-Bloated and repetitive dungeon design as you progress in the game-Arena is beyond average-Weakness/Resistance/Stagger system is really wacky
Combos feel super RNG unless you heavily spec yourself with stats and hitstun modifiers-Lack of good ways to enjoy the combat system post game-Combat is fun, but becomes very mashy at times-decent songs in the soundtrackNeutral-Minigames range from simple and fun to grindy-Game is long and packed
-A lot of the recycling, but that's a tales standard at this point
-Difficulty is average overallNote:this may seem like a backstory for Tales Of Zesteria if you ever finish the game till the end and do every side quest to know the full content of the story
Should You get this game, only if you are Tales Fans and i certainly this game will be worth your time and money and pack full of content than the previous Tales installment beside my Favorite Tales Of Symphonia

												A game I wish I could forget entirely so I can go back and play again for the first time
The world is large, the quests are plentiful, and the story reads like a top teir play
The usual archetypes are introduced but as the game marches on they're abandoned and the depth of each character shines through
Pros:-Story-Combat (Insanity is level to shoot for, if it's too easy, you're on the wrong difficulty)-Playtime-MusicCons:-JRPG Dialogue, prepare for the grunts and cheesy emotions-Weapon system feels abritrary at times, no reason to give up certain gear for a long time

												Story: 9
5/10Characters: 8/10Combat: 9
5/10FPS : 60/60---------------------Overall: 9
5/10Pros:+ The story is not your average save-the-world heroic stuff, instead it's dark and twisted
+ The combat system is the best among all Tales' games and is easy to understand
+ There are strong enemies if you like a good challenge (such as "Dire" foes)
+ New Game+ is filled with interesting options, so starting another run is worth it
+ 60 FPS
+ New battle camera
+ Quick save option
Cons:- Some characters may be annoying
- Music is not as good as other Tales' games
- Dungeons look better than in Zestiria, but some require a lot of time and running around to finish
Note:You don't need to play Zestiria before this one to understand the story, but doing so will make Berseria much more enjoyable since it will show how Zestiria came to be
Alternatively, you can play Zestiria after Berseria
Whichever you choose will make you experience the story in a slightly different way

												I need Cold Steel II right now!			
Posted: 5 August
 In the early hours of Cold Steel, I was worried


worried that it couldn't live up to the lovely standards set by Trails in the Sky
However, after my first year spent as a student of Class VII, I can confidently say that it has, and knowing that this is just the beginning of a new series fills me with great anticipation
If you've played Trails in the Sky FC, SC and TC you'll know what to expect
A great story, compared with wonderful Soundtrack, depth when it comes to characters and a wonderful Gameplay mechanic
Cold Steel is a game in its own, you dont have to play FC, SC and TC to understand the story
However if you HAVE played those Games, you'll get a better view at some point in the Story
My Specs:i7 7700k @ 4
2ghzGTX 1070 EVGA SC @ 8GB VRAM16GB DDR4 RAMI play on highest available Settings possible and on 1920x1080p and FPS unlocked to "Limitless"
I get 144 FPS constantly without any drops so far and it feels really good on my 144 Hertz Monitor
Performance-wise this is a Gamers Dream
I'm crying just because I'm able to play this on my PC without having to buy a "Console" for it
The Game has so much to offer and if you really wanna play this Game - take some time
You have to invest around 60 Hours (Depends on your playstyle) to finish the Game
*RECOMMENDED*			
Posted: 17 August
												I've never posted a game review in my entire life, however, this game made me feel things I haven't felt from a RPG in a very long time
Not since FF7 have I felt a twist in a story this hard
 I'd like to think that I am pretty savy when it comes to RPGs especially JRPGs, but, I geniunely felt surprised if not totally shcoked by what this game has presented me with
 I talked to every character I could (after I got the hang of the social aspect of the game) and not only did the dialogue keep me interested, it made the game so much richer because of it
 *Gives developers and designers a standing ovation with tears in his eyes* BRAVO I SAY, BRAVO!

												How can one game have so many best girls			
Posted: 7 September
												This game singlehandedly sets the standard for all future Japanese PC ports
By recruiting optimization modder Durante to actually provide optimizations and post launch support, Xseed has proven that PC porting isn't as expensive or difficult as major publishers like Square Enix pretends it is
On top of optimizations are PC exclusive features like Turbo Mode, an FOV slider, and autosaves
Xseed and Falcom are proving to be the CD Projekt RED of JRPGs, and their games happen to be of that quality as well
As with every Trails game, this game is just as phenominal as the Trails in the Sky trilogy was
It's one of the only JRPGs I could ever immediately start a NG+ on minutes after the credits roll
The characters are well written and fleshed out, the world is meticulously handcrafted to be unique and interesting, and the major story beats sets up the incredible sequel very well
This is an excellent game to get into the Trails franchise
It was designed with newcomers in mind, yet still retains everything veterans love about the franchise
The amount of quality hours you can put into this game makes the full asking price worth it, and all purchases of this game is directly making a statement about what PC JRPG players want out of their ports
			
Posted: 2 August
												I put many many hours into the PS VITA version of Trails of Cold Steel by XSeed when it originally came out in the UK last year
As a fellow player of the previous two Trails in the Sky games, prior knowledge is not nessicary in order to start this game
Those who have played the previous iterations will find a deeper meaning and some fun references through characters and mentions however, but nothing that will take awaty the experience for a newcomer
This game, while an engine at fault, suffered frame issues on the VITA so being able to play this in a better quality, not only 60 FPS appeased me to get it once again
Falcom themselves, the original developers of the game have something unique in the craft of their games in this series, as once finished, you'll be yearning for more
That being said, first installments to a new adventure are usually slower than most
However, unlike sky, Cold Steel has an argueably more hooking beginning
The battle system is one of the most refined in the Trails series yet
We lose some features like Rush, but we also gain a different way to do battle in the way of Master Quartz, to furter augment the skillsets and stats of your characters and the ability to swap them lets you build your characters in interesting ways
Overall, a highly recommended title
Please tell your friends so we might get Cold Steel 2 next
10/10

												Trails of Cold Steel is part of the Trails/Kiseki series, of which there is also Trails in the Sky on Steam
Cold Steel is set on the same continent and 1½ years after the events of Trails in the Sky, but in a different country and with a new main cast
Having played Trails in the Sky is not necessary (but highly recommended, they are awesome games after all!), it's fine starting with this one
Port: Ported by Durante (you might know him as the one responsible for DSFix if you played Dark Souls) the game runs on a toaster and offers a wealth of graphical options
There is also a Turbo Mode, which allows you to speed up the game with the press of a button
So, what about the game itself?- GREAT story and writing
It starts slow and steady as you get to know the world and its inhabitants and events slowly and slowly escalate and escalate until it culminates into an explosion of awesomeness that blasts your jaw to the ground while you scream internally (and externally) like a little child and then it's over and GIVE ME THAT SECOND GAME NOW
- Characters are pretty good
Not as good as the Trails in the Sky cast, but still pretty good
Some of them make a terrible first impression (looking at you Machias) but all of them get a ton of growth and character development over the course of the game
- NPCs: If you take the time and talk with them (all of them offer new unique dialog after every little story progression), you learn a lot about the world, their lives, relationships, problems,


Many of them even have  their own little story arcs going on over the course of the game and at the end I knew the students of Thors Military Academy as good as the main cast
- Combat is turn-based with a maximum of 4 active party members
It has elements of positioning and turn-order manipluation and the challenge level is pretty good
- Music: It's a Falcom game, of course it has an awesome soundtrack :P- Length: around 60-80 hours depending on how deliberate you are- Voice Acting: No Japanese voices included, but there is a mod for that if you want
The english dub however is very good and has around 5000 more voiced lines than the japanese one

Posted: 3 August
												Don't be fooled by my play time as I played this game and its sequel on ps3 and bought it again here to support this series on pc
The port is very good in terms of performance and graphical settings and launcher thanks to Durante
I have a GTX 760 and I am playing the game at maximum settings @1080p
I am getting between 50 and 60 fps unlike the 30 fps on consoles
It has a turbo mode to boot to save plenty of your valuable time in battles, saving your game and traversing the fields
The following is my review of the game proper:This game is one of the best jrpg'sI played in recent memory; it's very long though and has huge replayability factor due to its game plus mode and the need to play it more than once to get all achievements for their hunters out there
Despite the above praise, this game presents no real innovations in the jrpg genre, but it excels at what it does
It spends so much time in world building and making you so much attached to and invested in getting to know the characters
The characters are, for the most part, unique, complex and have interesting back stories
Even the countless NPC's are unique and have their own personalities and problems
I was reminded of persona sometimes when I played it, which is a good thing, due to its social-link like mechanic with your fellow classmates and exams
The graphics are a slight letdown but this is more than compensated by its great gameplay, beautiful music, nice English dub, which isn't full but much more is English dubbed than many other Japanese games
The battle system is turn based in the tradition of classic Japanese rpgs like persona and the earlier final fantasies and utilising enemies weaknesses, delaying enemies' (particularly bosses' turns) and performing links with your party members play a crucial role in securing your victory in battles
Also, despite spending a long time grinding for levels and items in this game, I never really got bored or annoyed by the battle system, which is a huge plus in a long game in my book
Despite being long and very detailed that it makes you feel part in its universe, the game ends on a cliffhanger, which prepares you for its sequel as it is part of a trilogy
This is the definitive edition of this game due to the excellent port and its various enhancements, which made me want to replay it despite my huge backlog

												Welcome to "The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel" (ToCS)My review is based on my PS3 experiences (Cleared ToCS I and II twice), early PC insights and my personal opinion about this game
Trails of Cold Steels:-J-RPG -Turn-Based -Flexible skillsystem with a lot of strategy-Not the hardest but really pleasant difficulty [Normal]   (Go hard if you would like more of a challenge) -Story rich (Can drag on a bit at the beginning but it's getting really epic and interesting once you are hooked)-It's quite linear but you have time to discover various places and towns (You have your freedoms) -No prior knowledge needed (Trails in the Sky or the other titles - Just light references) -Great and illustre characters and character development-Motivating to deepen the bonds (Similar to Persona) -Almost every character (NPCs included) has his/her own story -A lot to do (amsuing sidequests, minigames, discovering and collecting various stuff)-Average graphics in general-A lot of love put into details, characters and environment -Graphics are still way better compared to PS3!-A lot of improvements over the PS3 version like higher resolutions, higher frame rates (60 FPS), depth of field, shadows and so forth-Really great OST which is underlining situations and the mood greatly (Still listening to them from time to time)Playtime: Between at least 80 hours and 120+ (Average for my first time was around 110 - PS3)-It's the first game of a trilogy -ToCS II will come later to PCs and ToCS III will release in Japan this year +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ It's pretty difficult to recommend this to everyone depending on what you like


and if you have some experience from games like Trails in the Sky FC/SC/TC and Persona At best I would say it's a mix of the previous Trails in the Sky and "Persona" in general -It's a mix because like in Persona you have your everyday school life and mysterious battles/characters-You are deepening your bonds with the "main characters" and getting to know their personality
This depends on the time you are giving each of them individually (Pretty similar to Persona)The rest of the game is how you know it from Trails in the Sky -A lot of text-based conversations with spoken dialogues (way above average RPGs)-A lot of details put into the story, the chraracters, background information and collectibles-A lot of different things to do (next to the main story) like fishing, playing cards, quests and so forth  The basic story (without spoilers) is best explained in the short wikipedia description I'm quoting here: "The game's plot is centered around the newly formed special class "Class VII" in Thors Military Academy, composed of both aristocrats and normal Erebonian citizens
Class VII is the only class in the entire academy that does not segregate the two different social classes
The game follows Class VII throughout their school year, mainly around the times when Class VII receive special field training that takes them all over Erebonia
Throughout their training across Erebonia, Class VII matures and casts aside their preconceptions of the two social classes and witness first hand the reality of the empire; The power struggle between the aristocracy led by the four noble houses, and the working class reformists led by Iron Blood Chancellor Osborne which threatens to lead to a civil war
" +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So who would I recommend it to?=> People who like Persona and are into spending time to develop bonds with various characters=> People who like to play turn-based games with deep strategy (You can abuse every system


)=> People who are into longer games (Average time = 90-100+ hours)=> People who are seaching for a great story where everything feels connected (Characters, Story, Backgrounds)=> People who don't dislike certain clichés +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++POSSIBLE LIGHT SPOILERS! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Some random notes at the end (Just for me or maybe you even like it => (My Personal opinion)-Rean is a great chracter for me [Realistic - Intersting - Mysterious] -Rean is human/kind and may come across as your "typical" hero [He is not - but he tries]-His schoolmates come from various societies and families-They have all their traits and quirks -They don't get along too well at the beginning and even later-Problems will arise among themselves-They are at odds with themselves-The different reasons for their behaviour/quirks are explained well and make them loveable -The battles are fun and interesting-The characters for battle are changing depending on the school trips and where you are in the story-Even if you are not leveling you don't have to fear to be underleveled and to grind endlessly because you are getting more EXP the lower your average level is compared to the current monsters you are fighting-You are even getting less EXP when you are higher compared to the average level of the monsters you are fighting -It was a pleasure catching all kinds of fish (Fishing), to play Blade (Card Game), to collect certain books and read a novel from time to time and to get to know more about the society and the world around ToCS-A lot of German words mixed into the game (I'm from Germany so it's quite funny how they use different terms)-Fun scenes: School trips, schwimming, awkward/funny situations the characters are getting into, school festival


One of the best J-RPGs in recent years! ;o)			
Posted: 12 October, 2014
												I'm a sad man
I'm late-40s and I still like cute things
I also love RPGs, so you can see why I looked at Recettear and liked the look of it
The game wasn't quite what I thought it was though



but in a good way
I was pleasantly surprised
You'd probably be forgiven for thinking as I did - this is a typical JRPG with the theme being centred somehow around a shop
Well, yes it is


and it isn't
The game essentially has two parts to it
The RPG part takes the form of a fairly typical top-down dungeon crawler a la Chocobo's Dungeon, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and a host of other similar ones
That's about as standard as it gets though
Recettear does things rather differently - you are a young girl who has inherited her father's item shop which serves the local townsfolk with equipment for their day-to-day use and more importantly, stuff to go a-dungeon-crawling with
You also have a guardian of sorts (who also turns out to be a debt collector too) who's a fairy
Well, this is a Japanese game - 'nuff said
The relevance of this is that Recette (you) have also inherted some burden of debt too, who naturally you owe to your ward
So, the crux of the game is to run the shop, and earn enough each day to enable you to pay off your monthly debt payment
I know, that might sound a little boring, but it isn't
It's actually where the game really shines
Your day is divided up into a maximum of 4 sections, which you can "spend" by either visiting town for certain things, visit the adventurer's guild (more on that later), or open the shop
Your shop has certain shelf spaces laid out, and arranging the stock so your best stuff is visible from the window is an essential trick
Put the boring, common and cheap items in the window and you'll attract less passers-by
Put the really expensive stuff in the window and you'll also attract less passers-by
It's a balancing act
Once customers come in, they'll flit around looking, and approach you with items they want to buy from the shelves
As with any real-world store, the trick is to maximize profit, while retaining custom
So, sell higher than you bought it, but low enough so they don't get annoyed and never return - another balancing act
Some customers will ask for certain special orders in advance, which you almost always never have the stock at the time to fulfil, so you make a gamble on whether you can acquire the stock they're asking for - accept and fail, and they'll get annoyed, but refuse and they'll get annoyed too
You can't please everyone


So where does the stock come from? This is where the adventurer's guild and the dungeon crawling comes in
Instead of opening the store, you can toddle off to the adventurer's guild where all the adventurers hang out
You can recruit them, for a fee to go and dungeon crawl with you
 There's a great element of risk/reward here, as at the end of each level, you can choose to duck out with the loot, or proceed onwards with the chance of more and better loot, but with the added risk of costly failure
As Recette, doesn't fight (well, she's only a girl), you take the role of the adventurer here
Her role is to tag along and store your part of the loot
So, you fight, you level up your adventurers, you gain better loot to sell for better prices, you get money to pay off your increasing debt, and so on
There's also some added little nuances such as it being wise to look after the adventurers you are hiring by selling them stuff cheap when they visit your store, as they'll use that stuff when crawling the not-so-murky depths
As the game progresses, you'll need to get a bit inventive in how you manage your stock and customers, but I won't elaborate on that as that would be spoiling things!It's not an easy game to describe, and it probably sounds a bit dry on the face of it, but if you like the straight up old-school action-RPG dungeon crawler, I wouldn't hesitate to grab this - it does that part of it very well, but the light startegy side of shop management and how it dovetails so very, very nicely is what makes this game utterly unique
I can't recommend it highly enough
So I have no hesitation in saying this is easily worth £15 on my value-for-money scale

												You think this is a cute little game about running an item shop and having fun, but it's not
It's a game about crippling debt and trying your hardest to claw your way out of it
The bank comes to your house and tells you that your dumb deadbeat dad is probably dead, and that they're going to repo your house
Instead of making you homeless, the bank fairy just turns you into a slave and turns your house into an item shop (because zoning regulations and child labor laws don't exist here) and you spend the rest of the game trying to make payments to buy your freedom
Fun game, but god help you if your hustle isn't strong enough
Would not recommend to the capitalistically weak
			
Posted: 20 October, 2014
												Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is, without exaggeration, my favorite game of all time
The art and characters are absolutely adorable, the protagonist is even more so, and the gameplay is incredibly addictive
You not only get to spend plenty of time squeezing every last possible cent out of your customers, you get enormous dungeons to go adventuring through and plenty of amazing spoils to bring back to the surface, craft into amazing items, and sell right back to the adventurer who helped you acquire them
And once you pay off your loan, you unlock Endless Mode and get to finish exploring those dungeons and becoming a billionaire
I have 225 hours of this game under my belt, and I STILL haven't finished finding every item in the game
The plot(that is, the plot that isn't related to your loan - yes, there's more!) is definitely fun, although you won't be able to see the whole thing during your first story mode, but since Endless Mode allows you to pick up right where you left off, it's not a problem
Basically, what I'm getting at is that Recettear is an amazing game, I love it, and you probably will too
Base price for hours of entertainment? It's a bargain
Capitalism, ho!

												I'm not sure what prompted me to get HNR;B1
Yes I play Japanese videogames, yes I watch a little Annie May, and hell I even listen to Hatsune Miku
However, I'll be deep-fried in damnation before I tolerate uguu moeblobs crying over baka oniichan and the lack of senpai-noticing
That's not what this game is about though
The art might give you that impression, and there is some fan-service, but I dare say the best qualities about HN are the characters and writing
HN is broken up into 8 chapters
Typically there's plot, then shopping, more dialogue, random people handing you "plans", dungeons (both forced & optional), and then more plot
It's a standard setup and if you know what you're doing and/or skipping dialogue this game can be quite short
I wouldn't recommend it though, because the actual game portions aren't the greatest
From what I've read, this edition of HN is a massive improvement over the original in terms of exploration and combat
This must mean the first version was really dire
Getting around is handled via a map-screen, with dungeons representing the only "on-foot" portions
While the dungeons include various niceties like no random encounters, the lay-outs tend to repeat quite often
We're talking the exact same lay-out, and the enemies that populate them tend to be the same creatures you already fought, except stronger
There's no other way to say it, the dungeons in this game are weak
At least they're short, and they aren't bogged down by elevators, lots of stairs, and mind-numbing puzzles
The combat fares a bit better
It's turn-based and over-time you develop combos
There are three types: rush for building EXE meter (super moves), power for straight damage, and break for taking down shields
There are a variety of other skills like healing, buffs, and so on
The roster of playable characters eventually blossoms to over a dozen as well
It sounds like a lot to take in, but for the most part this is not a difficult RPG
There's very little strategy aside from "use a lot of super moves" and the ever-important "heal when you're low on HP"
If you're getting slapped to heck and back, it's probably because your level isn't high enough
Late-game grinding isn't really a hassle either
A lot of optional super-enemies drop enough exp to level multiple times in a single battle
I suppose the level of difficulty can vary greatly, depending on how much leveling you do
Some players might find more entertainment in avoiding optional fights, so that every regular encounter is hard-fought
Eventually though you're going to become OP, you can't resist it
Most of the grind in this game is in finding all of the materials
Those plans I mentioned earlier add things to the game
New equipment, new abilities, more dungeons, and so on
They require materials stripped from the cold dead flesh of the monsters that you kill
This is best tackled with a guide
The in-game "Nepedia" is nice, but it pales in comparison to a guide from good ol' gamefaqs and the always handy CTRL-F
Materials (along with corpses) can also be turned in for quest rewards (if applicable)
Quests are interesting in that completing them can raise & lower shares
The gals of HN are always talking about shares and their importance in the console war
This never really becomes a factor until 1) the ending and 2) the acquisition of hidden characters
It's something to keep in mind
I guess I should mention that aside from the ridiculous "millionaire" achievement, HNR;B1 isn't bad if you're a completionist
Doing everything (aside from some DLC) in the game took me less than 30 hours
I have played through the Vita game as well
That first play-through took about 30-35
If you don't skip cut-scenes, the length is more than reasonable
Notice the lack of character discussion in this review
Yeah, I'm not going to spoil the best aspect of the game
The cast of Neptunia is great, and the voice-acting (both ENG & JPN) is very well-done
I mean okay yeah, it's cute girls, some of whom transform into something exceptionally form-fitting, but the dialogue is rarely dull
Aside from a couple (expected) interactions, the cast doesn't get too hung up on the standard Annie May tropes either
Call me shallow, but I also got a kick out of all of the videogame references
The most amusing one to me is Neptunia herself
The other goddesses are Leanbox, Lastation, and Lowee
Since the plot of this game involves a console war, you can guess what those names refer to
So what's the deal with Neptunia? Back in the mid 90s, Sega was planning a console that combined the Genesis & the 32X
It was called Neptune
Honestly, I can't think of a better system that represents Nep-Nep, she is quite a random character
So yeah, I recommend HNR;B1
As far as J-RPGs go it's not particularly great, but it has so much charm I can overlook its faults
Also, it's appropriately-paced and the port isn't too bad (although I had to switch to XP compatibility due to constant after-battle crashes)
Don't write this game off simply because you visited the community hub and saw a few questionable images

												As someone who played this game to platinum three times on the Vita (thanks, stacking region trophy lists!), I find it to be the best Neptunia released in the West yet
The gameplay is simple to grasp and fun to play and the script is the best yet with quite a few funny moments, which is a huge step up from the very first game's cringe-worthy reference overdosing every few seconds
The English dub is also very good
Just one note: the cutscene portraits weren't scaled up, which is quite noticeable during cutscenes, particularly against the much crisper backgrounds
It's not a dealbreaker, but it may bother some people

												Hyperdimension Neptune! -The best game with anime characters in steamif you are a fan of J-RPG with battles in turn and anime girls
That game is highly recommended for you!- Simple gameplay and addictive;- Very good battle sytem;- Powerful anime appeal;- Vibrant soundtrack;- Many references the world of consoles and animes
Don't waste your time
Buy this game now! 
Posted: 13 March, 2015
												Let's start with a note: Neptunia saga is not for all, that's a fact
As far as you can try if you don't like these "breaking the fourth wall", other games references and the fact the characters (at least the main ones) are girls you are not going to enjoy it
Now let's talk about the game:HDNRB1 is not just a remake of HDN, infact much is changed between story and mechanics
The game is a quite hard JRPG, at least at the begin, sadly later you will probably going to spam these EXE (super like moves) destroying everything in your path but still the game gives out quite a challenge
There's not actuall grinding like other JRPGs but still you can't go around ignoring enemies or you'll be in trouble against these End chapter bosses
Graphically the game is not that bad but not everyone like the "anime style"
Musics are good even if not that many
Dungeons are


well there's many dungeons but not many types, you will find yourself unlocking many dungeons sure but in the same times many of them are just the same one with some differences and nothing more, same for the enemies, so be aware, if you want to see differences at every corner you are not going to like it
As port is not perfect but still this is the very first port made by IFI and, in my opinion, they made a good job in the end
Should you buy it then? Yes, you should
Still, like i've said at the begin, this game is not for everyone but who knows, you may find yourself having more fun than you think

Lighthearted & self-aware // Recommended for JRPG gamers*A controller/gamepad is highly recommended for this title+ Dialogue is rife with self-aware humor and myriad cheeky references+ Gameplay is solid and straightforward+ Can create battle advantages by sneaking up on and hitting enemies first; pre-emptive strikes can pay dividends+ 'Order of Action' bar helps to plan turns in advance; injects a bit of strategy into the gameplay+ Multiple endings offer a fair amount of replay incentive+ Voice-acting, both English and Japanese, is competent and well-implemented (there are some issues with mouth syncronization, however)+ Detailed character models and applaudable attack animations+ Excellent soundtrack; fits the game like a glove and is often quite catchy+ Character customization is a refined facet of the game, and this offers many opportunities in regards to character performances in battle+ Offers a plethora of items and gear that does wonders to allow the player freedom of choice in combat- Visuals are underwhelming to say the least; textures, in particular, seem overly dated, likely as a result of the game being a port from the PS Vita- Camera is a bit restrictive and often feels clunky, particularly when traversing dungeons- Battles quickly become very reptitive; the player soon falls into a routine, following a formula that takes one down the path of least resistance- Quite a bit of grinding required at certain points in the narrativeLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit

												Certainly one of the better Hyperdimension games this series has great potential it still hasn't quite lived up to


still as is - a great JRPG Experience
This first installment feels


shorter than the game its remaking but that may have less to do with the game and my own experence with Victory knowing exactly what to do


As a remake it takes the entire combat system from the first game and chucks it in a bin, replacing it with the more enjoyable combat system seen in later installements
For those not familiar the combat system usually involves a party of three(Four in later games) being placed inside a circular area - characters are able to move freely and you're encouraged to keep them spaced apart as enemies can and will hit multiple targets cluster together - and you're free to do the same
A usual array of special attacks, skills and ultimates are there to fill the standard kit - however your normal attacks are broken up into "Combos" which can be fiddled with and swapped around to your liking
Neptunia also keeps its notable game references and forth wall breaking humor
I personally enjoy the campness of the story and chracters, its what kept me with the franchise so far
Its lighthearded tone and utter refusal to take itself - or indeed anything else seriously is closer to a breath of freash air than most of the dower affairs I've seen on the release list lately
Take it as a bit of unchallening junk food - like the JRPG equivelent of Dynasty Warriors
-Port Report-The ports is



okay? I supposeIts a Vita Port so its not the least bit demanding - The astetic carries it fineResolution Caps at 1600x900? Er



okay - its not 1920x1080 but I'll take it
Locked at 60FPS - (some cutscenes are at 30?)It is a turn based game so maybe that doesn't matter so much?Rebindable Keys and Gamepad Support! YES!Doesn't use the buttons its dispaying - you should play around with the settings - but it plays fine with a gamepad
Mouse Control in the Menus! YES!I'd say B+ on the port? Cerainly seen worse handheld ports

												How much is a smile worth?LiEat is a non-linear title with mild horror themes
It's a "story-based" game, which is to say, the "game" aspect is merely a vehicle for literally everything else
It's technically a Japanese-style RPG, but the battles are a mere formality; combat rarely amounts to more than holding down the Confirm key until they end, with very little strategy except in rare situations, and even those can be circumvented entirely if you're of the mind and find the right items
I'm normally averse to these sorts of titles, a firm believer that a game that doesn't focus at least in part on its gameplay is a waste of a game, but LiEat appropriately made a liar out of me, and my annoyance with that fact is matched only by my gladness at being wrong
I didn't quite know what to expect when getting into this one, but I can say that whatever I could have guessed it was would've been wrong with room to spare; LiEat is surreal, strange, sometimes creepy, sometimes silly, yet consistently, if I have to admit it, charming
Developer Miwashiba uses each "game" to tell a tale of the ongoing travels of a humanoid dragon child who subsists off of the lies of the others, and her cynical, conniving, big fat liar of a caretaker, as they travel the land in search of the world's most valuable commodity: information
Our liar's muddy morality and views on the world are intriguing, and his foil is one of the most legitimately delightful child characters in any work of fiction I've encountered; rather than being smarter or tougher than you could legitimately expect her to be, she's reactive, naive, and even a little dense, yet without being grating, and while she's hyper-idealized, I'm willing to bet you're not going to care
I swear that if I didn't know my own kid wouldn't be the most insufferable thing ever just to spite me, I'd want one just for the off chance it turned out something like her
This is all conveyed well by translator and localizer vgperson's mostly enjoyable interpretation of the games' quirky dialogue, the writing of which is consistently engaging and thematic
Like its plot, the original score is unusual, yet enjoyable, the setting is foreboding, yet inviting, the characters are mysterious and enigmatic -- save for one mentioned above  --  and the plot isn't fully explained
Rather than fall prey to being confusing as a result, though, the whole thing ends up interesting, and every interaction teaches you more about LiEat's strange world and its inhabitants, which is impressive given that each of the three extremely short games take place in one area each
There's little exploration, no adventuring, and no questing; you're presented with a self-contained mystery to solve, and the game is over as soon as the case is closed
Each game features at least one bad ending, and one "real" ending, and after the latter, you either move onto the next game after a visit to a gallery room, or run out of games
The result is probably unlike anything you've come across, even among the independent scene
There's no soapbox for it to climb upon, no deep, hidden meaning for people to form a cult around and talk down to others over, no quirky fetishes to pander to, and no nerd culture to propagate; it's just a story of two people and the people they run into, but it was enough to get a couple legitimate laughs out joy out of this grouchy old fart, and again, this isn't even my kind of game
So how much is a smile worth? Turns out the best ones are free, but three dollars was a fair price, too
I'd be lying if I said I didn't think that if you've read this far, you'll agree
* Note that I'd previously played this game from an alternative source, which is why my total time played is low as of this writing

												Three short, qaint little rpg vignettes
It's got some unique art, and for what it is, this is interesting in its own right
That's not to say that its mindblowing or anything
Gameplay wise, its standard
The narrative in general reminds me a lot of Saturday morning cartoons; but this time with more of a gothic victorian asthetic
The creator clearly had a vision in mind for these characters, which is more than I can say for a lot of games I've played
The concept of litterally eating the physical manifestation of lies is a novel one
I'd say it could be developed a bit more, but after playing all three episodes it looks like the creator wanted some closure on the story
Fair enough
Would I reccomend this game, sure
But just be aware of what you're getting into
Of the three episodes, I had most trouble with the last one, as it was the most trigger heavy; meaning things needed to be done in a specific order
But with that said, this game has personality
Functionally, it may be basic, but at least it tries to set itself apart from the mound of other rpg maker games out there
And I think that alone warrants some kudos

The best $3
29 (CDN) I ever spent
Seriously, LiEat is one hell of a bargain
Basically you're a wandering vagabond with a loli dragon girl who can eats lies
Using this power they solve mysteries and find out more about themselves along the way
Game is seperated into 3 short parts or "chapters" and can take a good 8-10 hours if you interact with everything and aim for most of the achivements
Pros+ Fast, smooth, responsive gameplay & controls+ Music & Ambiance really fits and sets the mood (Bonus: Soundtrack included in Steam>Library>Music)+ Well crafted story and lore+ The pixels, CGs, cutscenes & character portraits all fit together well and create a unique and charming style+ Lots of hidden dialogue and stuff to interact with + achievementsCons- Combat can be a little repetitive at times- The hidden Legendary weapons are super OPOverall, I'd definitely recommend LiEat, it's short, unique, charming and sweet
http://steamcommunity

Posted: 29 August, 2016
												I feel like most reviews don't actually focus on balancing this game's ups and downs properly, both the positive and the negative ones
The positive ones overvalue what people perceive as "cute" while the negative ones bash the game too much
There are a few reviews that make a justified description or review of the game
Obviously I'm not doing any side a favor with this
I'll explain why I can't recommend this game after stating a few facts about it
Keep in mind I'll be taking in consideration the price of the game and what the game offers for that value
The TLDR pros/cons version:PROS- Cutscenes and Artworks for some in game events
- Movement is fluid
- The overall style is cute
- Small optional interactions you can do in the game to make yourself feel more involved with the story (such as poking Leo when he sleeps because why not)
- Multiple endings
CONS- Lack of consequence if you do certain mistakes;- The lack of actual places to explore per chapter makes the game feel repetitive and boring on the long run
- No combat depth despite being advertised as a JRPG
Additionally, if you grind some levels you can actually become immune to damage, including boss damage
- Despite being advertised as "A fantastic JRPG focused on storytelling
" the storyline is very short and doesn't hold up to that statement
The story is appropriate for the price of the game
Don't get your hopes up
- Some in-game designs for characters are poorly made (especially the artwork of characters on the right of the dialogue)
- The in-game money you acquire is useless
For those interested in more details, I'll start off with the pros:1
I didn't expect any type of cutscenes at all
I thought it's just some trailer animation
It was a nice surprise
It makes it easier to imagine what's depicted or how the characters actually look in an RPG viewed from the top
2
For this price I had some feelings that movement speed or the FPS cap would be an issue
Good thing I was wrong
The movement is fluid and fast enough for the size of each map

While it doesn't captivate me as much as others, the style is chibi-oriented and cute
4
The small and sometimes meaningless optional interactions you can do does make it, at least for me, a better way of appreciating the game, rather than not having them at all
5
It's great to have multiple endings to slightly personalize the story depending on some actions you do
Some might argue that a linear great ending would be better rather than branching out
Now for the cons:1
The moment I saw Lies that you can battle I immediately thought of "hey, this looks like a nice detective game! Maybe if I pick the wrong choice, it's gonna affect the case or make me redo it


or at least lose a certain amount of HP"
Sadly it doesn't expand on it and there's no consequence with failing to find the lie(s) (unless you count the fact that you waste some time on some battles)2
Being used to JRPGs, I expected more zones than what it has
There really isn't too much to explore
But for the game's price I can't really complain that much
3
If a game has "JRPG" or even "RPG" as its genre, I expect some combat depth and some grinding
Sadly the only part where I had to "think" was in the first chapter where I used an AoE attack to get rid of a line of mobs
Overall, you can just keep mashing the Attack option and still win
And if you reach a certain level with your characters you become immune to damage
4
The storyline is okay for the price attached
I really wish there were more scenes and more character development because I wanted to get to know some characters more than the game allows me to
I spent some time in RPG Maker
Adding text is not that hard (And yes, I do imply this game was made in RPG Maker or something similar)
But like I said before, for the price I paid, it's not a big issue
5
There's a lot of pixelation done with the characters in the artwork shown on the right of the dialogue, such as Leo looking way too low quality compared to others and not too appealing to the eye
Maybe that's just me, I don't know
Why do I not recommend this game? Because it could have been something awesome like "To the Moon" or "Ib" with enough hardwork and patience
I would buy the game at a 5-10 euro price tag if the game was focused on the following:- More places to explore- More optional dialogue and interactions with the characters- Expand the combat by adding some strategy to it- Most importantly: Make it a detective JRPG game where I interrogate people and find the truth about the case
This game had the potential to be a JRPG focused on finding the culprit and solving mysteries
Not to the lengths of "Danganronpa" or "Ace Attorney" series, but at least give more player input and consequences related to uncovering who done what they did
It has a dragon loli who can detect lies, for crying out loud!I'm not gonna go into details on how this could be made as everybody has their own ideas of how to improve the game
However, I really wanted some negative effects if I'm doing something wrong with finding lies, make me find who the culprit it according to clues and then give me the option to accuse someone
Heck, maybe use in-game money you acquire to buy hints
Conclusion:The artwork is okay, the BGM is okay, the story is okay, overall this game is average
And that's the problem
I really wanted to recommend this game but I can't
And it's not because of the value of the game, it is for what is worth
It's because it could have been something awesome and unforgettable giving the right time, patience, hardwork, and price
Yes, I'm not recommending this game only because it wasn't polished to its fullest potential
I wanted this game to be awesome (with an appropriate price for its greatness), but the dev team decided to stop and deliver an okay game for its current price
I am aware that the reason for not recommending it isn't truly justifiable
From an objective standpoint I'd recommend this game
But this is a review with my own personal opinion
Thus, a subjective point of view is more appropriate
A message to all reviewers who keep saying stuff like "omg that girl is so cute and you should buy the game because of that!": You are overvaluing the "cute" aspect of the game way too much
Is it really that big of a thing for a dragon loli that discovers life to be this game's selling point? Or the artstyle? Because I don't think so
Maybe that's just me
Who knows
A message to all reviewers who say this game is "horrible" or bash certain aspects of the game in an exaggerated manner: don't forget you spent 2 to 3 euros/dollars on it
For that value, don't expect too much out of it
It's not gonna be Final Fantasy
As mentioned above, the game is neither good or bad
It's average
If you're that disappointed, just sell the Trading Cards you get from it and compensate some of the money you spent
If you're lucky enough to get a Foil type of Trading Card, you can sell that for at least the amount of money you spent on the game

												I bought this game because my friend had recently, and he said it was good
3 dollars was a low price, so I bought it, and didn't expect it to be a good game because of the price
It then sat there for several months, until today, June 20th, 2016, I downloaded it and played it
It was unbelieveably good
It was not what I was expecting at all, I expected a semi-long JRPG with flashy anime characters
What I got was a short, amazing filled story that I immediately fell in love with
The gameplay might be a little bit on the underdeveloped side, but the story beats the hell out of that
I would go into detail explaining the two amazingly crafted main characters, but I don't want to spoil this experience for you
Pick this game up for yourself and give it a play, you won't regret your decision
it only took me about 4 hours to 100% percent it, but it is one of my favorite Steam games I've ever played
			
Posted: 27 February, 2016
												Don't let the "Loli" Steam banner fool you
This isn't a JRPG that panders to the Loli-crowd
Instead, I'll hazard to say that LiEat (I, II, and III) doesn't pander at all
Instead, the developer focused on bringing us a solid and well written story
The story itself isn't anything amazing, and often, the mysteries solve themselves in the first act
However, what really kept it interesting were the characters
The characters are endearing, mysterious, and funny
The game includes 3 Chapters
Each has multiple endings
The first two chapters each took me about 1
5 hours, and the last one stumped me for a bit when I couldn't get the Good Ending
The BGM are great and sets the mood as well
I highly recommend this to anyone looking to play a short game with memorable characters
Just don't expect this game to last you any more than 5 hours tops
EDIT: Also, any achievement that includes Ranma 1/2 is gold in my book: Happosai~!			
Posted: 24 May, 2016
												LiEat is comprised of 3 short JRPGs
Each story is extremely well written
Dialog between characters is clever and interesting
I lost count of how many times I laughed outloud
I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoil a thing
If you can look past the fact you'll have to play within a little windowed box and with graphics a bit blurry, you can find plenty else to love
Even with the graphics the way they are, there is a lot of charm in them
My ending remark will be - if another LieEat comes to Steam, I'm buying it in a heartbeat
P
S
I'm adding to the review for the steam awards badge
Let me just say, the creators of LiEat just came out with Alicemare and I DID buy it in a heartbeat

												After beating this game and each of his 3 chapters, I can say that this is the most splendid and beautiful game I have played in a long while
It sent me back to the era when I used to download and play RPG maker games like Misao, Ao oni or Mad Father
The art style is beautiful, the soundtrack is perfect and the story is just magnificent


This game is so good that I wish that one day everyone will be able to play a sequel, I know this game is great and that a lot of people would play it
Okay


now to the serious stuff; the game itself is about 5 hours long, or 6 if you want to get every achievement
The game has a simple fighting system that but it's really entertaining, there might not be many enemies to fight beside lies and some bosses, but the fighting system it's not that important, what's important here is the wonderful and gorgeous story, the story is very interesting and sometimes it hits you hard in the feels
If I had to rate this game it would be a solid 10/10Pros:• The art style is amazing
• The fighting system is very basic but entertaining
• Soundtrack is very relaxing and totally well made• The price is perfect, basically, 1$ for each 3 of the games
• The animations are short but really great
• The puzzles are really good even if there's about one per game
• The characters are pretty interesting and beautiful
• The game is pretty light, you can install it in about 5 to 10 minutes and you will be rewarded with 5-6 hours of gameplay
• The facial expressions are very cute and well made
• Very funny achievements with great references
• CuteSpoilers Ahead, you have been warned: These spoilers will be about the game's endings so I really warn you, the endings are so beautiful that if you haven't beaten the game yet you should definitely not read the cons, I am just trying to say that the endings are way too good and you should not get spoiled, go discover it yourself, its really worth it!Cons:• I don't think this is a con but rather more of a wish;The game leaves you a massive cliffhanger on the good ending, by now the bad ending already shows us that Leo is taken by the lies and becomes evil, Efina still follows him and promises him that one day she will become powerful enough to eat his lies
The neutral ending wich is even sadder than the bad one ends up with Efina being way too weak (Under or at level 11) to eat Leo's lies, thus having to use all of her power to protect him thus making her perish but saving the life of Leo, wich made her happy
The good ending is just heartwarming, Efina is strong enough ( level 12 or higher ) to eat all of Leo's lies and Leo is capable of talking to Cyril to confess that everything he did was to protect them
Cyril proceeds to leave with his brothers ( Not counting Leo ) and takes off via helicopter thus leaving Leopold and Efina in the rooftop, they both move on together to the next adventure


Final Note:This game is amazing and worth every single penny, I give it a solid 10/10 coming very very deep from my heart


Even if the game's ending is a massive cliffhanger that probably left some people in despair for a sequel, I guess it's not a bad idea to wait and have some patience, personally, I wish that this game gets a sequel anytime soon

												Lieat is a very good story
Isn't much of a game
I recomend it
Short story long, Lieat is a peice by peice story that entales the "Current off the past" Story of a Con man who cares for a young girl
THe what and the why is for you to find out, as this game lives and, dare I say, dies by it's story
This is not a game, it is a story with game elements
A cut ahead of visual novels but a cut behind an RPG horror game
I think it wears its place well
The game has a nice style
Everything is original to the game, and it's all well done for it's miniscual scale
It has it's own artwork for each character, and even some small animated scenes
The music sets the stage alright enough, and is something I like to listen to casually
I'd like to empisise miniscual though
This game is a very small game, easily completed in 2 hours for a first run for a normal player
The game is made even smaller by being cut up into 3 peices, each a labled "game" You'll pick from once you start up the game
Each one is self contained, but they all add up into a complete plot of the main characters
I like how it was handled, too
It gives it a sense of progression within each of the chapters without having to ellate farther down the road
Ultimately, this game a bit sized story broken up into bite sized senarios
It's handled well through and through, but do not expect a ton from it
			
Posted: 29 February, 2016
												LiEat was without a doubt one of the few games I have bought which did not disappoint me, LiEat is an RPG / Pixelated indie game which is based around a girl who can eat lies travelling with her a man whom she calls "papa"This game does have its secret little quirks and the crazy little fun things you do and the achievements you get from them
There is no voice acting and the resolution of the game is pretty small which is a little difficult at first, the characters you meet and find will captivate you and the conversations they have always leave you wanting to know more of "why" "how" and "what"
The combat system is really easy and simple so you don't need much experience or any experience as a matter of fact
I've never enjoyed a game like this in such a long time and its great to break off from the ultra violent toxic fps shooting games and just have a relaxing and cute playthrough a game like this
Considering its only £1
99 , you should get it, this game has already made me laugh, intrigued and fascinated by the story and all the things to discover, I may also be in love with this game
Nominate this game for the villain in most need for a hug, i mean

come on
the villain does need one			
Posted: 20 November, 2015
												This game has a niche target audience so I'll do my best to outline it below
If i have to give a rating I would give it an 8/10 and reccomend getting it on sale
I'm very aware that while I enjoy these games reccomending them is a bit dodgy as alot of people simply will not like what this game is
It does what it tries to do but that wont appeal to ALOT of people
REASONS NOT TO BUY THIS GAME:This game is not mechanically deep, characters roles are pretty simple to figure, beyond buffs debuffs and manipulating the turn system theres not alot to learn, the last one is a nice touch but still not a good game for someone who wants to think hard about their strategy
Story is pretty poor in general (though not even close to as bad as rebirth 2 imo) and it has alot of repetition in monsters, dungeons etc
The game is rated 12+ and that age level seems appropriate so if you're looking for adult images, look elsewhere
Fanservice is tame and sporadic
It has quite alot of post game content through the free dlcs but unfortunately there is pretty much no way to progress to the last 4 areas or higher level fights in a  natural way
To do these you simply turn on the "in-game power level hax" and grind levels for an hour or two
This means that to keep things fun post game you have to carefully balance your levels or else you will be annihilated/untouchable
The difficulty is a bit low for alot of the games until you reach the ultra late-game at which point it reaches stupid levels and the only way to balance is essentially to be really careful about how you break the game (see above point)The 4th wall gets SMASHED repeatedly here
All the games broke the 4th wall but this one just completely ignores to the point where even I got annoyed in later chapters and I'm normally immune to it
REASONS TO BUY THIS GAME:The games characters are the main draw
Its a mix of a visual novel with a turn based rpg and the characters keep the visual novel element highly entertaining for the most part
Having all the dlc characters active can make it a bit too much dialogue wise so I reccomend not using them for a first playthrough if you intend to do more than 1
Some of the characters might drive some people crazy and as obvious as it might sound, anime like characters and reactions are plentiful so if you like anime you probably have a higher chance of liking this though I'm sure its not necessary
 Having plutia and Nep as the 2 of the 3 main characters pretty much makes this game for me
Is funny



well I think so anyway :DThe battle system while simple is fun to play and the animations are really smooth
If you have played the other games you have a good idea whats going on but this one is a step up on this front, not anything massively different just little things that make game more fun to play
The entire interface is massively improved in this game too, it still has its flaws but the menu in this game alone is enough to make it the best of the three
Theres a challenge system introduced where you get little bonuses by completing challenges and while some of them are a little painful and the higher targets in many are RIDICULOUS, its still a nice addition
The game isnt too short at about 40-60 hours for a casual playthrough of true ending if you read everything, certainly not long by rpg standards but long enough that you wont feel ripped off

												This game is much better than Re;Birth 1 and Re;Birth 2Just like Re;Birth 1 I completed it in 100% (all achievements, lvl 999, all bosses and events)
Battles aren't too easy (unless you're using super EXP plan from DLC), animations are as good as ever, story/characters/humor perfect
I bought it on discount but it's still worth those 28 Euros
If you're Neptunia fan you have to buy this one


if you are new then I'd recommend playing Re;Birth 1 and Re;Birth 2 first before this


otherwise you'll miss a lot of jokes and references

												Coupled with the bright, colourful art style and cheery soundtrack, I honestly struggle to see how anyone could play one of these games and not enjoy their time with it
When compared with its original counterpart from PS3, Hyperdimensiondimension Neptunia Re:Birth 3: V Century doesn't have many new elements as we would like, just some added minor functions
However, it's thanks to the improvements that the developers tried to include in the previous remakes that make this entry in one of the best iterations of all the franchise
If you haven't played any game of the series, you could easily try this one
+60 FPS - 1080P+The Girls We Know+Fluid Combat System+A Ton Of Video Game References And Cultural In-Jokes+Museum Is Awesome+Soundtracks Are Better Than Ever-Pretty Hard To Play With Keyboard - Mouse (That's Not A Big Deal Of Course)-It Doesn't Offer the Same Amount Of Improvements Than Previous-Lack Of PresentationMy Review Score Is: 84/100 As Normal Gamer,And 110/100 As Member Of Lastation
I Hope All You Guys Enjoy,Boing!

Early Access Review
								It's hard for me to play games
Every hour I'm playing a game is an hour I could have spent writing some useful code, getting some chore done, or exercising under the preposterous delusion I'll ever be skinny
This game breaks through that and asserts the value of the occasional diversion
It makes me smile when the world around me is a never ending stream of negativity about politics I stopped caring about long ago
This game made it so the Xbox 360 controller I bought doesn't just sit on top of my workstation collecting dust
I won't bother talking about the game itself
It's all already been said
You should buy this game
Don't wait for a sale, just get it
I just wanted to say thank you Radical Fish Games
I am eternally grateful for the small piece of happiness you've provided me

								To be fair, this one is a masterpiece
I had honestly enjoyed every second of it
Pros: - Unique combat and talent systems; - Charming excellent-looking universe; - Practical easy-to-understand visual tutorials;  - Interesting non-repetitive quests and sidestories/dialogues; - Great music; - Touching story; - Huge parkour-based detailed world; - In-game statistics which includes absolutely everything; - A lot of secrets on levels; - Creatively-made memorable enemies and bosses; - Good AI; - Perfectly balanced difficulty, challenging enough;Cons: - Super addictive, and by that I mean I already want to start whining about additional content until I'll blow up
To be noticed: - Super comfortable playing via gamepads; - No bugs, no glitches, no crashes, no lags, everything works perfectly, can't believe this is in Early Access; - I'm in love with main characters

Early Access Review
								Quite possibly one of the highest quality indie games I have ever seen, and it's not even out of Early Access
CrossCode is an effective love-letter to the era of SNES action RPGs, with smooth, engaging combat and challenging puzzle segments
The combat is varied and requires different strategies to take out different enemies
You can fight enemies with both melee and ranged attacks at the same time
There are a huge amount of ways you can upgrade and customise both of these methods of attack
The puzzles combine a wide variety of mechanics in order to provide various challenges for the player, which are always very satisfying to complete
The 16-bit graphics are absolutely beautiful to look at, with extremely fluid and detailed animation, as well as stylish interfaces and character design
The game's characters are all well-written, unique and very likeable
Even the main character has a very clear personality, despite her vocabulary only consisting of around five words
This game is absolutely filled to the brim with witty dialogue
CrossCode has an intriguing story, which involves the game's (mostly) silent protagonist trying to regain her memories and uncover her past
However, the game is currently unfinished, so you may have to wait a while to experience the story in it's entirety
(Even now, the game still has enough content to be worth the price tag
)The developers of the game are constantly adding to and improving the game, though, and they are especially responsive towards the community

								CrossCode is a very enjoyable game to play that has an incredible amount of content in it for an early access on top of the Devs constantly updating it and adding more content to it every month or two, I highly recommend you get this title during a sale or even at full price it's still worth every penny
The artstyle for CrossCode is gorgeous, combat is fast paced and responsive, Boss battles are challenging, soundtrack is really awesome, puzzles are actually really fun and engaging to do even though I personally suck at them xD, the storyline & characters are great and the main character Lea is just so adorable and badass at the same time >

Early Access Review
								"After beating the dungeon I now know the truth
The developers feed on the rage of the players
Without our agony the developers cannot succeed
"I almost cried reading that, and I understood why
I have been looking for an actual RPG game for a while now and CrossCode filled that void
A great story, great combat, and a very pleasent developer team
Being a fan of the whole variety of games, CrossCode was a bit of a shock when I realized the game wasn't just another cut out of the RPG cloth
It carries elements from several genres:RPG (Obviously): Giving into the classical feeling of a Megaman or Zelda-esk stlye CrossCode has an "almost" cliche story involving Amnesia and a broken voice module
Avoiding the classic silent protagonist and going with an almost silent one (Who by the way has a very wide range of reactions even without most of her speaking abilities) allows for solid communication and in most cases relatability
RTS: The entire combat system is Real time, and YOU have the decision to keep going on your fighting streak
(Although the terminology BLOOD LUST comes to mind) The games fighting aspect is not easy either, most enemies require a specific strategy to deal damage, and in some cases, won't even take damage unless you perform a set of actions before hand
(I'm looking at you Phoenix, I have a special set of words for your ice dungeon BS)Story-Driven: Or if you'd prefer a visual novel
Every character you interact with has a personality, random people hanging out nearby, random people in the combat areas, every single NPC
There isn't a single NPC who doesn't feel unique from the other, and the developers have done an amazing job at upholding this level of seriousness
Your party members feel like real people, they have lives outside of CrossCode and it works as a solid excuse to pause the game and add to the building story of Lea
Oh yes, Lea, you amnesia ridden woman you
Besides having amnesia, Lea has a speech problem, apparantly, in which is made up by her sense of humor expressed through her responses
Grinding: I LOVE BL2 and grinding was a huge part of it, so to face a small amount really didn't phase me much
This game does have a grinding aspect (It has a mission literally built on grinding, but more on that later
) but it isn't as bad as some RPG games would make it
The chances of things dropping are relatively high, and if you are willing to search, you will find what you need
Puzzles: NYEH



Thats dead now
To put it simply, this game has a major play on the puzzles aspect, and is the thing that the dungeons are built on
If you play this game, don't go in not expecting your brain to be challenged, because I can promise you, you will not get away without feeling slightly aggervated at one puzzle or the next
Don't worry, you'll figure it out, it might take you a few days, but I totally believe in you
(Please make guide on how to puzzle, these developers abuse my puzzle privledges
)In all, CrossCode, is it the next big thing?Possibly
Is it a definite success?Pretty sure it already is
Is it worth my money?Yep, if you want it in early access that is
Normally, this would be the point I go on some rant about early access but I cant help but praise the developers on this
In two years they succesfully stayed on track for updates and releases, and I have yet to see them fail
So, congrats on being an actual succesful early dev team, you just outdid 90% of the other teams
Good luck on release day, I see this game exploding on that day, its got a wonderful community and a great team to keep it together, and I look forward to seeing whats next in your work

Early Access Review
								NOTE: The story premise is fascinating
For people interested in the plot, I can only say this: If you buy it, wait until the full release when the devs do it justice
You will miss out on plot elements if you play it before then
The game is addicting, but for an RPG with a linear story like this one, there should be more to it
The gameplay is a class-act, though
The game's combat is irrefutably polished and well-designed
It is like a bullet-hell meets hack and slash, but tactics are involved as well
The skill-tree is incomplete but looks hopeful
The dungeons are really enjoyable, although occasionally segments proved to feel a bit tedious
The bosses are interesting to fight, though not too difficult
As an RPG, the game is NOT a grind
Levelling and acquisition of gear is usually not difficult or tedious, but to make things even better there is a sort of kill-count system that makes the levelling experience involve more player engagement than the basic combat already requires
The music is really good, even though some songs may get old after a few minutes
Turning the music down a bit helped me with that, though
The art is a 10 out of 10
I found myself ogling at the level of detail of the boss in the first actual dungeon, and every other asset seems to have that same level of polish and aesthetic appeal

Early Access Review
CrossCodeDeveloper: Radical Fish GamesPublisher: Deck13 Interactive GmbH, Deck13Note: A key for this game was provided by the developer for the purpose of writing an informative review
No other compensation was given
Introduction==========CrossCode is the perfect example of why Early Access exists
It gives us an idea of the game the developers have in mind, while allowing us to support them and help them to finish their game
CrossCode is an action RPG, and a shiny pearl in the sea of  trash that's currently swimming in Early Access
There are a lot of systems and features in place and ready to go, such as melee/ranged attacks, dodging, guarding, skill trees, elemental attacks, interacting with the terrain, trading, puzzle-filled dungeons, story scripting, enemy AI and attack patterns, bosses, and more! CrossCode draws heavily from the 16-bit era, and if you've played Secret of Mana or Zelda: A Link to the Past for the SNES, then you'll see the influence easily
The gameplay is very similar to those two games, and it's simply amazing
The current version of CrossCode is a set of demos, one for each mode: Story, Puzzle, and Exploration
I'll go over each one in turn
Gameplay==========First, let's go over Story Mode
In Story Mode, you are introduced to a cast of characters and the game world
I'm not going to spoil anything here, but let's just say it's a premise that's been done before but with a few twists
You begin in a sort of tutorial area, which has you running a character through a small forested area towards a building
Along the way, you are taught the basic controls and basic combat abilities
 Once you reach the building a short dialogue occurs, then the game transitions to a cargo ship where we meet the main player character and the supporting cast
More tutorials occur, such as ranged and melee combat, switches, dodging, and later guarding
You have a melee slashing attack, and a ranged attack that has you shooting spheres
The spheres are able to bounce off walls when charged
The Story Mode demo wraps up after a boss battle that introduces an antagonist who tries to abduct the main character
She is saved by the supporting cast and makes an escape
Next, we have Puzzle Mode
Puzzle Mode takes you through a typical dungeon that will be implemented into the finished game
This has you hitting switches to open doors, moving boxes to press switches, navigating large rooms to solve puzzles scattered throughout, and ultimately ending up at a boss battle that introduces you to Boss AI scripting
It has 3 phases, the first being the melee phase
It'll be within your melee range, so just attack it normally
Next with Phase 2 it'll move away out of your melee range, so start using your ranged attacks
In the combat area are 2 switches which raise 2 pillars
When the boss starts charging up it super attack, hit one of the switches and hide behind a pillar that pops up
The boss will finish his attack, then hit the switch itself and lower the pillar and resume it's attacks
In phase 3 it gains a shield, which you need to solve a small puzzle to figure out how to bring it down
It involves bouncing your ranged attacks off of bumpers to hit it from behind, shorting out it's shield
Defeating it gives you the option to take on the "Final Challenge", which is a short Survival Mode, that has you fighting waves of enemies
The Puzzle Mode Demo wraps up afterwards
Last, we have Exploration Mode
This starts you in an area called Autumn's Rise, where you are introduced to even more features, like Elemental Attacks, Skills, Items, Equipment, and Combat Arts
In this mode you are free to explore the map, defeat enemies, and buy equipment and items from the few shops that are present
There are even a few trading booths where you can trade items you find for other items
 Exploration Mode ends when you find all of the hidden treasure chests in the area and open up the last challenge
Graphics==========CrossCode is a very colorful, vivid game, with detailed character sprites
Remember how the SNES did sprites? Take those, and make them 100 times better
CrossCode uses very crisp sprites with fluid animations for all aspects of gameplay
Attacks, movement, dodging, etc


all look extremely detailed and very well done
No complaints from me in the graphcis department
I grew up with classics like Super Mario World, Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy III (VI), Chrono Trigger, Earthbound, and Lufia, so I'm no stranger to sprite-based games
CrossCode features some of the best sprites I've ever seen in a video game
Even the character portraits are sprites!Sound and Music==========Great sound effects and cacthy tunes that fit any given situation
The music sounds like it would have been right at home on the SNES, and sounds very Secret of Mana or Star Ocean-esque; this fits the theme of the game extremely well
When combat starts the music changes to a more fitting tone, and transistions back to normal when combat is concluded
Being a big fan of video game music, I can't go on enough about how much I like the music in this game
Performance==========I ran into absolutely no issues while playing CrossCode
Everything was crisp and smooth, no framerate issues or crashing
The game seems very well optimized for a game in what looks liek an alpha stage
This makes it very easy to recommend this game to all players who are fans of this genre, as they will have very little issues getting the game to run so they can enjoy it!Final Thoughts==========This game has everything you could possibly want from an action RPG
Combat, exploration, puzzles, dungeons


the concept is here and it's amazing
Please buy this to support the developers and help them get this gem finished! I'd hate to see such potential shut down, and this game has a ton of potential
It could be the next big indie title
It just needs a helping hand
And with Steam's Early Access program, that could very well happen
Even with it's early alpha/demo state, it still offers several hours of fun gameplay
Gameplay Demo==========This demo covers all of Puzzle Mode and a nice portion of Exploration Mode

Early Access Review
								"CrossCode is a poster child for why independent games matter more than ever in a market where AAA relevance is dwindling
It's destined to become a cult phenomenon, reverently mentioned in the same company as Cave Story, Braid, or Fez
I'm highly looking forward to it and you should be too
"So I summarized the first (and currently only) review I ever thought worth writing over a year ago
15 months on, it's truer than ever
In the intervening time, among plenty of other great independent games, we saw the absolute juggernaut that was Undertale blow up the internet
And at the risk of drawing parallels between two VERY different games ("indie" isn't a genre after all), CrossCode deserves that kind of recognition
CrossCode is not the best game you'll ever play
Its story and characters are fun and infectiously endearing, but they won't redefine the way you think about narrative in games
Its art and music are lovingly crafted, but so are a dozen other great (and not-so-great) pixel-art games
The puzzles are smart and the fast-paced combat is insanely fun and suitably challenging, but it probably won't supplant your favorite ARPG
CrossCode is reminiscent of a lot of things, a synthesis of elements both nostalgic and modern that you've likely seen many times before
What CrossCode likely IS though, is the best game you've never played
Because it's been fairly sparsely covered during its early access period, it's flown under the radar for a lot of people
And because that synthesis of elements is so well tuned, you'll wonder how you missed hearing about such a well-made game for so long
Almost every aspect of CrossCode feels really, really good to play, not just in an acceptably non-distracting sort of way, but dripping with love and care and attention to detail
The extreme ratio of positive reviews isn't a fluke or vote gaming by a hyper-devoted fanbase
Lately, it's people finding the game wondering if an early access game can really be THAT good, and discovering to their delight that yes, it really can be
CrossCode is aiming for official release some time in the first half of 2017, and the amount of progress that the development team has made since the early access launch last year strongly suggests this is a realistic goal
Even if you don't want to spend money on an early access game right now, do yourself a favor and follow it, because you're probably going to want it when it's finished

												This game is a must-buy for any RPG fan!While its style is distinctly western, in everything but art Epic Battle Fantasy is very much a JRPG
The combat is heavily based on elemental advantage/weaknesses – brute force is rarely an option in harder battles, instead the key to victory is using correct skills and gear
Speaking of gear, uniquely among RPGs, newer weapons and armor you acquire are not direct improvement of your old equipment
Instead, each weapon and armor has properties that make it good in some situations and mediocre to bad in others
The result is that no equipment becomes useless, and some of early gear may very much be an option for endgame battles
Instead of acquiring stronger gear, the game features upgrade system for your equipment, allowing you to improve your gear as you progress through the game (most later upgrades require items that are not available until later)
And on final note about gear, each item your character wears, from weapons and armor to small badges visibly changes your appearance, which is really a nice touch!The story doesn’t even pretend to be serious, but it will accomplish what it sets out to: make you laugh from start to finish!Overall, Epic Battle Fantasy is all kinds of awesome
If you like turn-based RPGs, give it a try and it won’t disappoint!

												Like RPGs?Like Some honest to god decent humour?Wanna be a good guy and help out a guy who has made a ton of free games buy giving him some money?Want a cool soundtrack for free?Do you have a thing for anime boobs? *slapped* ok okThis game is worth every penny and don't let the people saying "oh no you don't have to pay its free on kongregate" fool you
The steam and prem Kongregate version has additional content to the base game and provides much more content then you'd expect!Also the steam version gives the soundtrack for free so a plus there
Give it a whirl on Kongregate if you are really cautious about the games you buy and make your choice there
I still say you should buy it to support the dev who really puts more work into his games then a lot of other devs that make free games (also give his other games a try while you're at it)

												You've seen the video, and you're going "This is a Flash game
 This belongs on Newgrounds
 Wait, this IS on Newgrounds
 Why would I pay for this?  Why would anyone even greenlight this??"  I'll tell you why: because this is the RPG your oldschool heart's been waiting for
You've got your turn-based RPG elements, your enemies rating from the silly to the spooky to the right-out terrifying, your countless tongue-in-cheek Final Fantasy/Pokemon/Zelda/Mana/etc
homages
 But then there's the feeling of being a part of this world: rather than "exploring" a "vast" world of triumphs and tribulations, you just sort of twiddle around and run into packs of monsters just sitting there on the worldmap
 There's the never-ending bickering and bantering among your teammates as you progress
 There's the range of hints both silly and satisfying that play out as you spar with your foes and try new techniques
The challenge is there too--boy, is it ever
 For a game optimized to be played 30 minutes at a go, you can spend a lot of effort fine-tuning your characters' skills and loadouts for tough fights (and it will *really* pay off if you are playing Epic and going for the achievements)
 You'll be able to come back to it over time, too--have the satisfaction of clearing the game, take some time off from it, and come back to it anew in New Game+ (or ++) playing however you feel, without having to collect all those non-key items again but with all the damage numbers exponentially increased for more cheesy epicness
And of course, the content you won't find on Newgrounds here--the Battle Mountain--escalates the challenge further (though you could still get through it pretty easily in Easy mode if you went that route)
 It's a chance to step off the beaten plot-ridden path and just smash up tons of monsters--plus all-new bosses both uncompromising and unsettling
If you are a child of the 90s or late 80s and don't have time to play RPGs anymore but still admire them from afar, this is your chance to see firsthand what happens when nostalgic thrills meet the present day
 This East-meets-West cultural take just might give you one more fantasy to embrace after all

												You enter a battle with five generic looking monsters! Suddenly from behind you, a tank fires an armada of bullets at the enemies for no reason, accompanied by a cat with no legs that charges towards them with a wooden sword and shield
Your swordsman jumps in with his sword and then suddenly summons a sword out of thin air due to his sheer love for swords
You click on your mage's chest only to find out that her boobs give you an achievement
Your ranger looses her arrow towards the final enemy, but it doesn't do enough damage, that is until a giant wooly mammoth falls from the sky and crushes it
This is just a typical battle in Epic Battle Fantasy 4
			
Posted: 29 October, 2014
												This game is a funny joking, breaking the forth wall, RPG
It's all good fun in the world of EBF4, with jokes coming left and right, and all being masterfully crafted so that none fall flat you won't stop laughing
Enough about how funny the game is, let's talk about gameplay, the game focuses on the goal of collection and completion rather than harsh and numerous battles, the creator has also made it so that character's not battling will also gain experience so that you won't have to grind for any other character at a later time
The collection will included things such as: chest locations, random drops for armor and weapon upgrades, those weapons and armor  themselves, certain creatures to fill that damn bestiary, ect
All battles are fair and equal as long as you do a little side searching here and there to gain a little extra exp
Jokes, fair battles, and no grinding sounds like a good game to me

												Thank goodness I got this game, Matt has always impressed me with his epic battle fantasy series, and when I heard that the fourth installment was going to be on steam I just couldn't keep quiet about it, I was extremely excited for this coming out on steam
It is definitely worth the £8
99 I spent on it
In fact I think it's worth much more than that! Turn based RPGs has always been my thing
The game also tickles me ribs with it's humour, crying with laughter at some points
I really enjoy some of the references to animes that you make
I like the roaming around, puzzles and the mini-games too
Honestly Matt, I love this goddamn game so much
Would absolutely recommend to people who love a good, lighthearted turn based RPG

												I've been playing the EBF series since I was a kid, and this one by far is the best+ Awesome bosses+ Interesting story+ Hilarious dialogue+ Great music (you get the game soundtrack free too :D )+ References everywhere+ Great combat system (Good 'ol turn based combat)+ Tons of equipment, both clothes and weapons+ Easy to navigate UI+/- Block Puzzles+/- Grinding and Backtrack- May be a little confusing for new players, but you can get used to it (especially the inventory)Definitely one of my favourite games of all time
( and its cheap for the hours of gameplay and fun you can get with it)

												Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is an adventure RPG game, developed by Matt Roszak, releasing on Steam is February 2014
This is my first foray into the Epic Battle Fantasy series and have no other previous experience with other games in the franchise
Gameplay is a simplistic RPG style view, with turn based combat for the fights
Controls are so simple; you literally can play the whole game with just your mouse
The game has a real “Pokémon” feel to it, as you explore you will find parts of the map you can’t explore yet because you don’t have the required skill, for instance, to cut a tree down or to smash a rock
Once you learn said skills, you can backtrack quite easily to explore and find treasure hidden in the previously locked area
  The game has well over a hundred different enemies to kill, and learn their strengths and weaknesses of
 My favourite part of the game play is easily the loot and item system
 The game boasts over 170 different items for your characters to use; you can upgrade these items through using the Forging mechanic which require you to use craft-able items to make the upgrade
  The combat system is really well designed too; you have a party of four characters eventually, but you can only use three in a battle, the fourth acts as a backup in case one of your others dies
The Pokémon element theme is a key mechanic too; making sure you use the correct weapon with the right effect on the enemy is an almost absolute must most of the time
 Characters can also learn “companions” which acts as like “ultimate” attacks, and any of your characters can use them rather than having them bound to one of your party – the best and most fun by a country mile has to be the Super Nova, which just obliterates the entire screen
Visually, EBF4 is again, simple, but that comes across very pleasantly
The in game art style looks colourful and vibrant, and has a very 3DS look to it
The narration parts of the game are done in a beautifully, almost hand drawn style of art, as if they have just been pulled out of a children’s book
I was enchanted by the visuals straight away as soon as I saw this
There is little animation in the game, given the 2D aspect, but the small amount of animation in the game is done really well, no odd movement cycles or strange looking attacks
There isn’t any voice acting; however there aren’t walls and walls of text to read through, so that can be forgiven
EBF4’s difficulty levels can be changed on the fly, and you are almost encouraged to play on the highest difficulty until you start hitting a brick wall
I played the game on a normal difficulty and still felt sufficiently challenged by the fights
You can ramp up the difficulty to epic mode for those wanting to get extra achievements though
Once you complete the game you have the option for New Game+
Not to mention the Fire Mountain area of the game
This area scales with your characters level, allowing you to take on unique beasty bosses for extra special loot
This for me again, reminded me of the Pokémon games and the Elite Four trainers
The world, in which you play in, is full of extra little bits to do, with roughly 20 side quests to complete, which offer no real variety but still add a bit more game play
The quests are only collection quests, so don’t expect to be getting really in depth quest lines like other RPGs
The quests will reward you with stat increasing items, or more equipment to make use of
There are also a number of NPCs scattered around the world that whilst they offer no game play advantage, they do have a bit of lore behind them though
EBF4 took me just under 20 hours to complete
I went into this game expecting it to be over in five hours
I am absolutely amazed at how much content and how long this game actually is
What really does this game the most credit is, I wasn’t bored once whilst playing, and I wasn’t waiting for the end of the game to roll around as I was having that much fun playing
There may not be a massive amount of replay ability given the linearity of the storyline, but the New Game+ mode will definitely cater for any people that are fans of the game play
 Technically, the game runs in a much smaller resolution, whilst you can play full screen, it is a scaled up version
For some reason, I almost had a lot of stuttering during some moments in the game
This was fixed by reloading the game, but I couldn’t quite work out what was causing it
Obviously the game isn’t very taxing to run, given the 2D graphics, but still, I was dropping frames every now and again
 The game cannot be played using a controller without the use of third party software, but I would recommend people play this game with their mouse
To sum up, I am absolutely amazed at the quality of this game
It is easily one of my favourite RPG experiences I have ever had
I remarked quite a bit in this review about the resemblances between EBF4 and Pokémon, and that comparison really does this game justice
It is an absolute masterpiece of a game that looks so simple on the outside, but is beautifully and carefully developed on the inside
The game is so perfectly priced at £8, 99 too, with hours of content and high quality content at that!

												Ys Origin does a great job explaining the past, it also features interesting characters that you can finish the game with (each one having their own unique game-play, equipment, short storyline and so)
For those who don't know, Ys is an old school action RPG (from the late 80's) that luckily didn't got extinct in today's modern video game industry (That strives to approach to the masses), the surviving series features a very solid and hardcore experience for those who delve in to it (No hands are held here, not suitable for some casual players)
Without delving that much in to the storyline, I'll start by saying that the whole game is set in a massively big tower with tons of floors where you'll actively explore till you reach the top, all because due to the fact you're part of a team that is looking for two mysterious female angel like characters who have disappeared and also they are fighting a mysterious evil that suddenly appeared on their land
Just like the first of the series, it is based on your character progression (Status), based on your skill and how well prepared and equipped you're, you'll fight tons of different minions and bosses through out the game
The game is fast paced, if you're used to a slower and less action based game, then do not delve in to this one, you'll have to be quick and prepare yourself to evade any possible attacks and at the same time plan how you'll attack your foes quickly before their defense is up again
You're forced to play the game to unlock new areas as you progress but do take in mind that you're not only forced to a narrow path, you'll have some freedom of exploration to farm and grab new items
As for the game soundtrack you'll be delighted, it is so memorable!In terms of art style and UI they are all professionally done and will set in motion your connection to the game, giving you a taste of immersion (You'll have a good read, the game has a big script), character wise; some are forgettable but overall your experience with them is quite positive
If you like Anime and you like oldschool games that are fast paced and hard, then this is the game for you!

												Ys Origin is quite possibly my favorite game on Steam
It might be because I was already a big fan of the Ys series before I played it, but still! It's a great game
Ys Origin is an action RPG, with a hack and slash styled battle system
There are 3 playable characters, the 3rd being unlocked when you clear the game the first time with either of the first two characters
Each character has a very specific playstyle
To avoid spoilers, I'll only detail the initial two
Hugo Fact is a ranged caster
He is very powerful, firing off spell bullets from his wand and his twin artifacts known as the "Eyes of Fact" that hover at his side at all times
His is very agile, but he cannot fire while moving
Yunica Tovah is a melee attacker
Armed with her handaxe (and later greatsword), she excels at close combat
She is very quick, dealing fast, hard damage to her opponents
When you start the game, you get to choose from many different difficulty settings (Very Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Nightmare), as well as choose which character you want to play as
Each character has their own storyline, though all three of them are intertwined
Playing each character is highly recommended, as each storyline offers more and more insight into the overall picture
Gameplay consists of your typical RPG fare: battling monsters while exploring your surroundings
In Ys Origin, you are tasked with exploring a giant tower that extends to the heavens
The tower is broken up into segments, with each segment offering a different environment to do battle in and explore
They are varied enough to where sometimes you forget you are in a tower and are instead traversing a dungeon located elsewhere
At the end of each segment (and sometimes in the middle) you are presented with a boss
The end of each segment is always a screen-filling boss, and these are the most fun parts of the game, each requiring some strategy to defeat
Ys Origin includes a neat Arena Bonus Mode and a Boss Rush/Time Attack Mode
In Arena Mode, you choose a character and fight wave after wave of monster in a specific location
As you defeat enemies, you accrue SP
You can then use this SP to unlock a variety of things for this mode, such as extra costumes and even a surprise guest character! In Boss Rush Mode, you can choose to either battle one Boss at a time, or every boss in the game consecutively
The music and sound effects are top-notch
The Ys series is known for their amazing soundtracks, and Origin is no exception
 After awhile I found myself whistling along as the music played! You may be inclined to find and purchase the soundtrack online


just a warning! :POverall this is just an awesome game
I got it on sale for about $7, but in my opinion the original, full price is WELL worth it
You get a lot of game for the price
Highly Recommended

												When you think of action-RPGs you probably think of Diablo, Torchlight, and all those other games where a player’s worth is measured in the loot that they acquire
Monsters are essentially piñatas that when killed will explode into an array of multi-colored pieces of equipment
After spending so much time on games such as these, my mind dulls to the point where I stop caring about saving the world, or performing some heroic and death-defying feat
All I really want to do is look at numbers rise
I need an intervention
I need to refocus
I need Ys Origin
All you really need to know about the Ys Series is that everyone fights with an un-matched level of veracity
Imagine a thousand buzz-saws being shot out of a thousand cannons, and everything they shred also gets set on fire
When the series was still very young, the early games required the player to kill monsters by running at them and striking either of their sides
In a way the later games such as Ys Origin are an extension of this basic design
In the interest of balance, the improved controls and maneuverability means players have to contend with more intense battles
A plethora of difficulty settings assist the player in finding a level of challenge that suits them
The hardest settings deliver an experience akin to a 2D shooter, where the entire screen is flooded with death
As you’d expect from the title, Ys Origin establishes the roots of the series
Fans will quickly note all of the references to the first entry, which include characters, events, and even boss-battles
In fact, the entirety of the game takes place in Darm Tower, which is essentially where most of Ys 1 also took place
Still, aside from the boss-battles none of this is particularly exciting
This game was originally released in late 2006, and even with the update to Steam, an option to skip cut-scenes was never developed
The dialogue is fairly good, but the story is very traditional and there are certain events that have to be sat through
The time spent outside of combat, tends to be really dull
There are three playable characters in this game and each of them has a different fighting style, a few unique bosses to contend with, and their own path in the story
Yunica Tovah is the token cute-girl-with-a-big-axe
Her companions and adversaries are quick to point out her lack of magic ability, but I can’t tell the difference, when she’s summoning firebirds that lay everything to waste
Hugo Fact on the other hand is all about the spells, though his style of play can best be described by the classic arcade shooter Mercs
Expect to run & gun your way through the tower if you play as this wizard
Big brother Toal Fact is unlocked after beating the game with either of the other two characters
His fighting style resembles Wolverine
Basically you go pork or bacon on enemies and claw your way to success
Each adventure should take around six or seven hours to complete, although this can be slightly effected by the difficulty setting
Darm Tower is a lot like Dracula’s Castle in that the forces of evil can shape it to fit their whims
I’m absolutely certain that when I scoured this tower in the first game I did not have to deal with swimming through flooded corridors, jumping over spike-traps, and dealing with that always-necessary lava level
Each level has a theme and by the second or third you’ll figure out everything you need in order to progress
This adventure is almost entirely linear; however you’re free to backtrack in case you missed anything
Unfortunately even though you get some cool powers like the ability to double-jump there really aren’t any instances where you can go back to prior areas to find items you couldn’t get to earlier
This is the same case for all three playable characters, so once you learn the layout, all you have to focus on is the methods for dealing with the demons
The combat is by far the greatest aspect of the Ys series, and the same can be said for this entry
All fights move quickly and multiple types of foes all attacking at once is a regular occurrence
To keep things fair the demons have a “tell” when they’re about to attack (they blink white for half a second)
Also, while all demons are capable of hitting very hard, as long as you’re exploiting weaknesses they go down just quickly
If you’re not doing enough damage, usually a level-up will balance things out, and a second or third might even make you slightly overpowered
Still, don’t expect to grind through bosses as experience points drop to about one per kill, which will force you to move on
The boss-battles in this game are especially great, probably among the best in the series
At first I was worried that every boss was going to be a weak-point mashing affair, but each encounter is varied and just awesome
Some demons like The Creeper are not only relentless but can also induce serious headaches by healing themselves in mid-battle
Unlike a few of the other Ys entries there also aren’t any herbs, potions, or elixirs that can be purchased to bail you out
But hey, all this difficulty adds to that feeling of accomplishment
Replay value in Ys Origin is certainly high
After completing the game with all three characters you’re given access to the time-attack, arena mode, and bonus shop
The time-attack is a boss-rush where you can face off against any or all of the major demons for the possibility of a spot on the leaderboards
 Arena mode has you dealing with waves upon waves of monsters, if you survive you can use the points you earn to buy prizes from the bonus shop
You can always head back to the tower and attempt the harder difficulties as well
There are plenty of achievements and getting them all practically requires that you master the game
Really there’s not a whole lot that can be said about Ys Origin
There’s no hidden meaning to be found and this is not some life-reaffirming experience that I could write thirty pages on
This is simply an excellent action-RPG that despite being more than a few years old it still contends with among the best the genre has to offer
On the other hand if your experience with the genre has never gotten beyond breaking open monsters and collecting all the armors, swords, and belts they were stowing in their nether regions, then steer clear
This game keeps it focused and judges the player entirely on their ability to evade and strike, luck isn’t a factor in the slightest

												A thorough evaluation of how bad you are at video games
The music starts pretty grape and actually gets better the higher you go up
Yunica has pretty cute oven mitts
If you die it's probably your fault because controls and movement are solid
The platforming actually doesn't suck (wow!)
Featuring the Wolverine from the Marvel universe
Has a boss rush mode
Bosses will bully you
Higher difficulty actually adds stuff to bosses instead of just health and damage
11/10 would play again (because the game needs multiple playthroughs to unlock everything)
I actually have no complaints about this game for real

												Well here we are a few days into June 2012, and the gaming year couldn't be going better

E3 is in full swing, with publishers announcing their latest and greatest titles
However quite frankly I'm finding myself distracted from all the excitement
Why, do you ask? It's because I have found my personal Game of The Year, and I don't think anything else that could come out right now could possibly top it
You can take your Diablos, your Modern Warfares, your Max Paynes, and you can file them all away for some other time and place
I'm too busy saving the ancient land of Ys from demonic hordes hellbent on the destruction of humanity!It has been a mere three months since XSEED made their Steam debut with the smash hit Ys: The Oath in Felghana
In that short time their crack squad of programming gurus and translation wizards have been working overtime to bring us more Ys goodness, and this time they've takes us back to the beginning with Ys Origin
This entry in the series is actually a prequel, taking place 700 years before the events of the first Ys games
This of course means that Adol Christin has to sit this round out, however do not despair! This time around we have THREE playable characters to fill out the roster, and each of them brings their own story and unique gameplay style to the table
If you have played a Ys game before (and I'm sure you have) then you should feel right at home with Yunica Tovah, our first playable character
She's a tough but compassionate young girl who has dedicated her life to protecting the goddesses
Do not underestimate her abilities because although she cannot use magic, she can swing around a massive battle axe as if it were a feather duster
Players new to the series should start with Yunica, as she is very easy to handle in combat
Once players feel comfortable they can tackle Hugo Fact, a magic user who plays out like a bullet hell shooter
The third (and secret) character will unlock once you finish the game as either Yunica or Hugo, and suffice it to say he's only for experienced players
Of course it would not be an Ys game if it didn't have big badass boss fights, and Ys Origin delivers in spades! As usual each boss has it's weak point and a pattern that you can exploit, and half the fun is figuring out how! Unlike other games that have impossibly punishing bosses, in Ys Origin if you're dying frequently you can simply level up and try again
Also be sure to check out the upgrade menu at save points, though they may seem minor, the right enhancement can save your life
Also be on the lookout for rare cleria ore, as it can be used to temper your weapons
The music and graphics are of course as stunning as you would expect from a series of such a high caliber as Ys
From the stirring violin strains of the opening theme which give way to choral chants and guitar riffs, you can guess from just that track alone that the soundtrack is something special
And it truly is, with a wildly diverse soundscape of orchestral music inlaid with the finest hair metal that Falcom Sound Team J
D
K
has to offer
Just ad rich are the gorgeously rendered 3d backgrounds and lush sprites that make up the visuals
After you finish the main quest in Ys Origin there's still plenty to do
A host of unlockables including Time Attack, Boss Rush, and Arena modes round out the package, offering hours of gameplay beyond the main story
If you yearn for an epic story with brutal bosses, complex character development, and a truly hardcore soundtrack, look no further than Ys Origin
Newcomers will find an engaging start to a new series, and Ys veterans will find plenty of references to their beloved series, and even answers to some burning questions that they may have
At a solid asking price of $20, Ys Origin is an unbeatable value
Pick it up today!

												Probably my favorite YS on steam since Chronicles
The way it sets up the plot to books one and two is amazing and has some of the strongest gameplay and music in the series
I look forward to going back and replaying the other 2 routes in the game

												This is one of the best action RPGs available, with one of the best combat systems ever made
The game is also very challenging, but you can put it on an easier difficulty
Normal difficulty will cost you many deaths, especially during the difficult boss battles
The game will last you around 12 hours to play through the storyline portion, but it has high replay value
You can choose from 3 characters (1 is unlockable) and they each have their own storyline
I would say Hugo and the unlockable character have strong storylines, while Yunica has a weak one
			
Posted: 28 May
												Great replay value
Three separate stories that take place in the same area, but they are all connected
The gameplay is more fleshed out when compared to Felghana, and the story is good as well
Farming is important for at least Hugo, and Yunica for a smooth experience (Not too much farming though)
Toal's playthrough is designed well, but be extra prepared for the final encounter
Other than that, the combat is fantastic, the story is quite good, and the graphics are fantastic in many cases
I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good time

												YS Origins, a lost gem among rpg's?Ys Origins is a prequel to a series named Ys which I had never even heard of, which I was suprised considering my love of rpg's
Ys Origins feels a lot more like a very fast legend of Zelda title mixed with a dungeon crawler, as in you navaigate dungeons while solving puzzles and killing a lot of enemy demons rather than a Final Fantasy type game with it's turn based battle mechanics
The game consists of three characters Yunica, Hugo and Toal, the game must be completed once to unlock Toal
The three characters have very different distinct play styles and abilities which really makes the game feel fresh even though you are revisiting the same areas each time, also each time you will see a different side to an interesting story
The entireity of the game is spent climbing a tower, with your surroundings, traps and enemies varying from floor to floor
 You will solve puzzles while fighting hundreds of demons which will give you experience to level up to get stronger and sp to enhance other abilities
Along with the three characters the game also contains a time trial mode that times your climb of the tower and an arena mode which you fight waves of monsters increasing the replay value, which you can unlock other versions of the three characters and the main character from the other Ys games
Enemies are very varied, but every few floors you will face a gigantic boss, the boss's are very challenging needing different tactics each time and extremely rewarding when you finally finish it off
I really enjoyed playing it as all three characters and will be purchasing the other ys games on steam and reviewing those too
Pros- Nice graphics feeling retro and new at the same time- Interesting storyline and characters- Lots of replay value- Fun gameplay- Very action packed- Amazing boss fightsCons- No world map, entirely in the tower- The inside of the tower barely changes for each character- Some of the steam achievements didnt seem to unlock although im sure I met the criteriaOverall Score9/10

												today i will tell you why you should Buy this game
1
Because its not like rebirth 1 with all of that grinding
2
Its not like rebirth 2 and with a short story and a hour worth of nep's
3
Its not like rebirth 3 with the over powered dlc weapons and characters
Megadimension VII offers a whole new way of playing like investment in citys and route building ill explain
investment is 3 different types of ways to spend money to help you inprove your Megadimension life
1
Commerse is, each level you upgrade will enable you to buy more items form the shop
2
industrial is, the items you will be able to develop will increase's3
puplic relations is, the higher the level the better the stuff you get from your country, such as processer units, healing items, other usefull items, and of course the nepquiz and walletcrusher on of the best shows on television
The route building is a much better way of travelling instead on instant teleportation like on the rebirth series
at first you have to use credits to purchase the route that you want to build too
and in the route building you can encounter random enemies when travelling, but if you have a new game+ you can disable that, but whats the fun in a quick and easy playthrough
Megadimension VII starts in 1 part of 3 stories, Zero dimension, hyperdimension, heartdimension
with all these storys you would expect this to be a long game, well your right there is about 40-50hours if gameplay in all 3 storys and you will never be bored there is new areas and Finally a better villan, well a few awesome villans
(not gonna spoil anything) no offence to Arbore, pop-up purple had, arsnore what ever her name was
The 1 bad thing about this game is that if you play this for countless hours, you will love the way the game looks and then when you go back too the rebirth series you feel a bit



odd
now lets talk about the Gold Third even thought there are 4 members
C-Sha (the Leader): She's more of a glutton than her looks may suggest, and she can't do so much as lift a finger on an empty stomach
S-Sha:  A young woman who's reserved and seems very cool, but has a considerably aggravated case of chuunibyou
She has two Dogoo-like monsters who serve under her
B-Sha: she likes to build robots, collect hero toys and serve as a hero of justice
However, her phobia of monsters prevents her from doing this job efficiently
Because of this, she transforms into the mysterious hero known as Presto Mask to give herself confidence
K-Sha: K-Sha is a yandere when it comes to Noire
She's very protective and cares passionately about her, though in a somewhat romantic way which annoys Noire occasionally
when holding a gun however, K-Sha's personality changes drastically
Rather then being shy, she becomes dead serious and will complete her missions without question
Much like Uni, K-Sha is skilled with guns
Now we go with uzume Tennoboshi: Uzume is the type of girl who is obsessed with being cool so that she comes off as reliable
Uzume is exceptionally loyal and honest to her friends, Very rarely will you see her relax unless she is around friends
However, this is a very strong willed facade made to help cope with her position as Zero Dimension's sole remaining CPU
This game has to be one of the best Neptunia Games, because its a 2016 game the graphics are amazing, the new systems inplemented into the game are cool too, and of course new characters, and remodel'ed characters
its a very facinating game that deserves to be called a Neptunia Game
This game is like 3 games in one
and deserves to be $39
99 + DLC costs
at first when i bought this, i thought was that you can build a country from the ground up from one of the acheivements that was listed, but thats alright this game was a really good one anyway
cant wait for future Nep Games, Especially 4GO,Im gonna Rate this a 9
5/10the -
5 is becasue i had to but game in windowed mode for it not to crash suddenly
Overall Best Game 2016

												Lets start by saying that this game is funny and worth playing if you like anime rpg; now we can go a bit more into details with pro and cons:pros:-the game still use the same turn based strategy as the other games from the main series, a very fast turn based strategy with movement and positioning;-even bigger cast of cute girl only;-inproved combo system;-new dungeons added to the classic one; -new monsters;-city management system;-a few trick in the plot that i will not spoiler;-very nice CG
cons:-Nepnep trolling can be a bit annoing;-city management is not deep;-new monster and dungeon are few in number;-heavely reuse of the older enties of the series game system
so yeah more or less every entry in the list above explain itself but not the last one, which is why you're still reading


what i mean with reuse of the old game system is exactly that, having played all neptunia games i can totally see that the developer have used the old game asset to create this one: graphic engine, model, textures, some music, ecc
Now while it can actually be fine since this game is totally anime graphic (meaning it doesn't really grow old), after so many years from the first entry of this series i would have expected at least a graphic improvement


This last point is the only one that really bother me but, even still, this is a very good anime game

Product received for free
												In all brutal honesty, I wasn't enthused about making yet another trip to Gamindustri
Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth was a pleasant surprise due to its colorful cast and amusing storyline
The second Re;Birth game was a solid improvement
The third game was even better, but it was also more of the same
At the time, I thought that this RPG series was long overdue for a fresh take, but I started to worry that it would never happen
I envisioned that Compile Heart had grown complacent
They would continue to hammer these Neptunia RPGs out, all with slightly different storylines, five or twenty additional characters, and memes more "dank" than ever thought possible
With the release of Megadimension Neptunia V2, Compile Heart has put my worries to rest
This is, without a doubt, the best entry in the series thus far
The Story and CharactersDespite having "V2" in the title, this entry in the saga has very little in common with "V1" aka Re;Birth 3
In fact, if you have at least some familiarity with the CPUs and the Candidates, then you could probably approach V2 as its own self-contained story
Without giving too much away, this game is divided into three separate acts
Each act focuses on a handful of characters, and their efforts to protect Gamindustri from a mysterious threat
The storyline is darker than in previous games, but it never becomes overbearing, or gritty just for the sake of it
The truly serious moments feel earned
Even accounting for the franchise's penchant for farce, the villains are well-written, and the heroines deal with the problems facing them in a convincing fashion
Alongside the improved story-telling is a very strong cast
With Re;Birth 2 and especially 3, CPU Candidate Nepgear went from mediocre to almost unsalvageable
This is her best role yet
Big sister Neptune has also improved
Well, she's still as ridiculous as ever, but at least she's not completely irritating
Noire, Blanc, Vert, and Uni also have more involved roles in the storyline, which is a huge plus
As far as new characters go, Uzume is exceptional
Her story is well thought-out, and her quirks are endearing rather than grating
The Golden Third represents the "developer" characters that are common in Neptunia games (Cave, Red, Mages, etc)
Again, I have nothing but praise for them
Rather than being a mere excuse to include several references and in-jokes, each of these four characters has their own arc
While it would have been nice to see a few characters from the previous Neptunia trilogy make an appearance, I believe that sticking with just the main heroines and the handful of newcomers, was a very wise decision
There aren't as many meaningless skits, and conversations don't get buried by dozens of people voicing their thoughts at once
The three-act storyline neatly ties everything together
The GameCompile Heart has made changes to nearly every element of its bread & butter RPG
The dungeons are slightly larger, house more secrets, and can involve a little platforming
This provides another incentive for players to jump around, aside from the stat-boosting challenges and the ability to loudly exclaim "I'm a kangaroo!" The structure of this game has also undergone a massive overhaul
In the previous games, it was easy to unlock optional dungeons, defeat the side-bosses, and enter a cycle of constant level-ups that removed any semblance of challenge from the main story
There's still more than enough side-content in V2, but unless you're really determined, you won't reach a "kill-all-bosses-in-one-hit" level of experience


At least until new game+
The remake system has been removed from Gamindustri
While you can still gather monster materials to craft some items or enhance gear, you won't need gamefaqs the entire time you're playing
Most gear acquisitions are handled the old fashioned way; via store purchases, or finding them in dungeons
Other unlockables, like the "cheat" abilities (higher jump, faster run speed, etc) are discovered simply by playing through the game
Furthermore, by employing scouts, you can discover additional treasures and new dungeons
So, if you disliked Stella as much as any normal person, you'll be happy to know that she was kicked to the curb
While these changes might disappoint some Re;Birth fans, overall they improve the pacing and atmosphere
Your play-through of the game isn't under constant risk of being halted, just so you can look up how to find a "old dragon ball", an "old dragon horn", or the all-important "old dragon's ?!?!?" However, some of the other changes & additions are a little undercooked
The overworld no longer functions as a "click on the location to instantly travel" map
Now you have to selection your destination, and the protagonist will run to wherever that is
The reason I don't like this setup is because there are random encounters
While they aren't too annoying, I really have to wonder why they exist
Random encounters can be turned off after beating the game
This is equal parts welcome and perplexing
A number of other unlockables such as scouts, clothes, and weapon modifications are awarded by investing in all of the major lands (Planeptune, Lastation, etc)
It's a neat idea, but you're liable to spend most of the game dirt-poor
In fact, by the time you have the opportunity to do any serious investing, your first play-through is about to end
The battle system has also undergone some slight modifications
The EXE meter resets after every battle, and overall isn't nearly the "win" button it was in the past
To balance this out, all of the playable characters have recieved more moves and abilities
The combo system has also been revamped
Certain combination attacks can result in longer waits, which effects the heroine's turn order
Combo attacks can also do more damage if certain conditions are satisfied (such as performing a rush attack just before a power attack)
The differences aren't dramatic, but if you're attempting to play through the game at low levels of experience, they can be pretty important
Positioning is also more tactical than ever, since enemies (and playable characters!) take more damage, when attacked from the sides or back
While this game is harder than its predecessors, most of the challenge is going to come from early on
The first half of the game is spent with less than four party-members
These limitations alongside a lack of primo grinding points make for a decently balanced level of difficulty
Once you recruit everyone, the battles devolve into the typical attack/special move/sometimes heal doldrums that plague most RPGs
Still, it's nice while it lasts, and players can opt out of carrying over their experience levels and equipment in new game+
In ConclusionWith Megadimension Neptunia V2, Compile Heart has proven that they aren't averse to taking risks with an established series
Taking these risks not only requires a lot of confidence in the game-designers, but also the writers
Yes, there are still times where Neptune acts the fool, or Vert jokes about Blanc's lack of "plot" development
These moments are what keep the adventure grounded
More importantly, the writing goes above and beyond to give everyone a purpose beyond the cheap laughs, and this leads to a more compelling story
While I've enjoyed all of the previous Neptunia games, V2 is a necessary evolution
The improvements to both the combat systems and exploration help round out this superb RPG

												43 hours for a single playthrough
60 hours for two playthroughs
108
3 hours for all achievements
And I would play through this game again and again
The story and characters are the main selling points while the combat becomes secondary (still really good though)
Oh yeah, the soundtrack is amazing aswell
I could go on but i'm too lazy

												I think Megadimension Neptunia V-II marks something of a watershed moment for the Neptunia series in that it's no longer "good, but


[insert caveat of your choice here]", it's just plain good
Actually, great, even
Finishing my first playthrough of the game took me roughly 55 hours; that was taking it fairly leisurely, unlocking this and that that wasn't absolutely necessary for the first playthrough and goofing around now and then
After that, there's still the "true" ending, which leads to a post-game segments during which you can clean up any bits and pieces you didn't finish off first time around - Or trophy hunt
Well, at first, I want to say that I think this is Compile Heart's finest work to date
While there are some technical issues regarding frame drops in a few places, most of them are not really all that significant
Ignoring some typos, the script and translation are both excellent, the gameplay is enjoyable, smooth and well-balanced
The first and last points there adress two of the biggest criticism the Neptunia series has had ever since its release - technical issues regarding atrocious framerates that weren't really justifiable for the kind of game they were, and balancing issues regarding inconsistent or just way too easy difficulty
MegaNep counters both of these problems: It runs at pretty consistent 60fps pretty much all of the time, only dropping in particularly busy scenes, and has a very well-paced progression with no point in the game that felt too easy or too difficult
The revamped game systems work extremly well: Skills feel neither under- nor overpowered, characters feel unique and pretty much any party combination can work perfectly fine
Now, narrative and characterisation has never been an issue for the Neptunia series, but, pleasingly, MegaNep even improves this, making up a story that is spectaclar, dramatic and even emotional at some points in the end
Additionally, it keeps the humorful atmosphere, with Neptune being the goofy, likeable, forth-wall-breaking protagonist that we all know and love
In other words, it's not just a great Neptunia game - It's a great RPG, period
The only thing that saddens me is the fact that so many people will write it off without even giving it a shot for themselves; still, I guess that makes it all the more special for those of us in the know who can enjoy and appreciate it, both on its own merits and as, to date, the absolute pinnacle of the series

												BEST NEPTUNIA GAME EVER
I have owned the previous games, Nep1, 2 and 3
And I must say this version is x10 better because: (NO SPOILERS)1- Alot of new features2- Actually has a story, and not just about puddings
3- Lots of new maps, and maps got bigger
4- Less recycling
5- New characters with fun personalities
6- Better artwork7- x10 Better music
8- More BOOBIES
Bigger and bouncier than before, too
Buy it in a heartbeat
Amazing
Recommend
10/10TIP: Buy all the DLCs except the ones which give armor or weapons, because those will take the fun out of the game
Maybe buy them when you reach end game
I love the new characters!!! <3

												Judging from other reviews, I might be the black sheep this time but, in all honesty, this game got boring really fast, at least for me
The jokes may be funny at first, but they also rapidly become boring
The map design is pretty good (world map excluded), but I found the fights to be extremely repetitive
Combat variety is also very scarce
The soundtrack is ok, but the game itself uses a ton of premade RPG Maker graphics along with the beautiful custom resources, and that gives the game a "lazy" look on some parts
Part of it is by design, since this game wants(?) to be a parody of the JRPG genre, but I can't help but suspect that it was also to reduce the amount of work a lot and


well, it honestly feels very rough on the edges, despite its good qualities
After almost 7 hours of playtime, I don't think I'll play this game again any time soon
As I said, it gets boring fast
Imo, of course

												Confirmed: This game is free on the Android and Windows app stores
Old review:The developer must usually work on mobile games because he annoyingly spams you to review his game, which is still surprising, because games that do that are usually free
He also must be immature/petty because he tells you, "you suck
>:(" when you try to back out of the chat with the spammer NPC that appears to be in every town
Since the developer wants to act like this is a freemium game, I'll correct his oversight in charging me money by utilizing Steam's wonderful refund policy
Here's your review that you wanted so badly, developer:I'd compare the writing to Big Bang Theory, which I tolerated
The combat is shallow
Graphics/sound/music are what you'd expect from a 16 bit game
I didn't notice any major bugs
If he ever takes out the NPCs (I talked to two in the first 30 minutes) fishing for positive reviews, and it's on sale for $2 or less, I'd recommend this game to people that watch Big Bang Theory specifically for the humor
Until then, I find this game unplayable

												ENGLISH REVIEW: Dnd is a game about four friends mistakenly summoned in a world of magic and believedto be heroes
In reality they're a bunch of nerds trying to return to their homes while theyenjoy a wonderful adventure in a fantasy land filled with treasures, castles, dragons, orcs,elves and


Santa Claus
The first thing I thought about Doom and Destiny was "here's another rpg maker game thatis trying to be a parody of other famous rpgs like final fantasy"


And I was right, thegame is just this, but done well


very well
The humor is very captivating and the jokes will make you laugh in more than one occasion
And don't think the story doesn't take itself seriously at all, because it does, delivering a fascinating story without "plot holes" even though it's a parody
I dare to say Doom and Destiny is a perfect blend of storytelling and great humor, with a gameplay on par with titles from the final fantasy series and the possibility of exploring the world, which is something that similar games don't do anymore
And secrets, lots of secrets scattered through the map and in the numerous locations of the game
Also the game has 3 difficulty settings so it can be played by everyone
Both the music and the graphics are licensed contents, they weren't made by the developers but bought from third parties and put into the game
I don't consider this a real flaw, but I know some people stay away from games with rpg maker graphics because they think they're not worth it


Well, if you can get over the fact that the graphics is standard rpg maker, I assure you'll find a real gem
If you played "the Bridge", a very good puzzle game here on Steam, you'll notice that the game opening music is the same of Doom and Destiny, but does this make The Bridge a bad game only because they share the same opening song? no, so don't be discouraged by these things someone could call "flaws" and give this game a chance
You'll not regret it
RECENSIONE ITA:Dnd è un gioco che racconta di quattro amici evocati per sbaglio in una terra magica e scambiati per eroi
In realtà sono quattro nerdacci della peggior specie che cercano un modo per tornare a casa, ma non prima di essersi gustati una fantastica avventura in un mondo pieno di tesori, castelli, draghi, orchi, elfi e


Babbo Natale
La prima cosa che ho pensato di Dnd è stata "ecco un altro gioco fatto con Rpg Maker che cerca di fare la parodia di altri famosi rpg come Final Fantasy"


e avevo ragione, il gioco è essenzialmente questo, ma fatto bene


davvero bene
L'humor è accattivante e le battute ti faranno ridere in più di un'occasione
E non pensiate che la storia non si prende sul serio nemmeno un po', perché lo fa, regalando una trama affascinante senza "plot holes", e questo è già tanto essendo una parodia
Mi permetto di affermare che Dnd è una perfetta miscela di storia e umorismo, con un gameplay al pari di titoli della serie Final Fantasy e la possibilità di esplorare il mondo di gioco, qualcosa che non si vede più tanto spesso in questo tipo di giochi


e segreti, tantissimi segreti sparsi per la mappa e nelle numerose aree del gioco
Inoltre il gioco ha 3 livelli di difficoltà, così da poter essere giocato da tutti
Sia la musica che la grafica sono contenuti acquistati da terze parti e concesse dietro licenza
Personalmente non considero questo un vero difetto, ma so che molta gente si tiene alla larga dai giochi con grafica Rpg maker perchè pensa manchino di originalità


ebbene, se riuscirete a guardare oltre le grafiche di rpg maker vi assicuro che vi ritroverete di fronte ad una vera perla del genere ricolmo di originalità ed estro creativo
Se avete giocato "The Bridge", un buon puzzle game qui su Steam, noterete che la musica di apertura è la stessa di Dnd, perché acquistata dallo stesso musicista; ma questo rende forse "The Bridge" un brutto gioco? non credo, quindi non fatevi scoraggiare da queste limitazioni del titolo e date una chance ad un grande gioco; non ve ne pentirete

												Any game reliant on its humour to carry it needs a good script to deliver that humour, and this doesn't have one
The script is constantly awkward to read and has regular errors (such as in the store screenshot of "How DARE you talking like that about my mother!") that lead me to believe that this is an ESL translation
The parts of the script that aren't awkward on a technical level are typically just outdated pop culture references, that were already long outdated by the 2011 release date (Chuck Norris? Really?)
The gameplay itself is nothing remarkable, and the menu design in particular is pretty horrible, with no proper equip menu and instead items are just equipped from the inventory, which becomes unwieldy quite quickly
You want to know the real reason this game is so highly rated? It's because every town has an NPC in it that begs you to give the game a positive review and opens the store page for you
I'm sure most people submitted these short and hollow positive reviews in the hope of getting a reward out of it

												Probably the most enjoyable JRPG/RPGMaker game I've ever played since Earthbound on the SNES (Now that's dating myself)
The gameplay is solid, controller support is excellent, good story, excellent use of humor and cameo's
I don't think I've ever laughed and groaned so much in any of these types of games before
It really draws you in with the excellent writing
I know that's a lot of excellents, but that's pretty much the best way to describe this game
It's definitely a worthy addition to any turn-based JRPG fan's library, and am very happy to hear that there is a sequel in the works, because this game and its characters definitely deserve one
Cancel that, it's not just a worthy addition to any JRPG library, it's a must have
			
Posted: 13 January, 2016
												Game is slow, interface is a pain, and many options that come standard with RPG Maker like adjustable text speed or rebinding controls aren't used
 Game is also something of a grindfest, but what really kills it are that in a JRPG style game which is all about menus the menus are incredibly hard to use
			
Posted: 4 November, 2016
												I'm a bit surprised I liked this game as much as I did
I was a bit put off by the developer constantly adding "please review this game" NPCs in EVERY SINGLE TOWN
It's like I'll review it when I damn well feel like it
You really don't need to badger the player to review your game while playing your game, especially if you actually paid for the game
It really left a bad taste in my mouth and its wholly unnecessary
Getting past that this game is fun
The developer definitely made use of all the RPG Maker sprites and the writing was decent
I like it when a gmae doesn't take itself too seriously
I also enjoyed a few of those "did you know?" random facts littered around the first town
Characters are pretty shallow and honestly I just remember them as red, blue, green and yellow
It was chock full of crass humor, game and anime references
Surprisingly the story was good
Even with the all the different little quests along the way it never deviated from the focus of the group finding their missing friend and returning home
I was actually surprised about all the references made from a Mario-esque inspired landscape to a quest straight out of Dragonball Z
It’s quite a creative and fun use of RPG Maker that I haven’t seen in any of the multitude of games
Finishing the main story isn’t too difficult on normal setting
There are quite a lot of adventures to be had after completing the game
That’s when the difficulty ramps up and the game becomes a challenge
I’m still trying to complete the last couple of quests and there’s many places you don’t get to explore until after you finish the main story
There isn’t much replay value but with the amount of side quests included I think this game can draw out a solid 50 hours of gameplay if you’re the completionist type
If you’re into RPGs I’d highly recommend it
There’s plenty of story, nostalgia and humor to go around

												I finished the game on the Android version, I just started playing it on the PC, and I already regret it,because it will suck me in again and make me lose preciuos life time
The game plays like a traditional RPG with some smart twists, and the main selling point is the story, compelling and full of good humor and countless jokes on pop culture tropes
Maybe, just maybe it gets a litte worse in the very last part, but as a whole it is great
The characters are all funny and interesting, except Nigel: everybody hates Nigel
As a quick note on Gameplay: I usually don't like JRPG " à la" Final Fantasy
I hate mindless turn combat and really, really  hate random encounters and grinding, but this game was a nice change of pace: the initiative management and the aggro system make everything more interesting, and the "speed-up" button is a blessing to quickly resolve easy random encounter when you backtrack to older part of the map

												Man, I really don't know where to begin with this review


But here we go
Doom & Destiny is a turn based RPG that basically jokes about/steriotypes Tabletop RPGs as well as the "nerdy/geeky" lifestyle in a sense
It is very humorous, almost everything about this game will make you laugh if you understand it
So here is a short list of pros and cons to this game
Pros-Graphics, this is a "if you like these kind of graphics" thing
Personally, the graphics are nice, bringing back memories of some of the classic pixelly RPGs of old
Audio/Music, the music and audio are nice
Not really sure how else I should explain this


So there you go :-)Combat, the combat is turn based, which I definitely like
Skills/Powers and there uses actually matter, the proper timing of a skill could really determine whether you end the battle in victory or in defeat
Strategy actually matters!Skills/Powers, there are a lot of them! Plus, you get to choose basically any of them you want! In the game, you basically purchase your skills and give them to the characters, each character being able to equip a certain number of skills
Character Development, you are basically able to shape the characters however you want
Although the characters have a class that they are given initially, the terms of what these will become is vary vague, and up to your personal interpretation
Want a Ranger? Make one
Want a Paladin? Make one
Want Kirito from SAO? Make him!Alright, that is enough pros I think except from some more minor things, so lets continue with the cons
Cons-If you don't like "RPG Maker Games" or their like, then you probably won't like this one either
But let me just say, this is not your "cheap made RPG maker game", this is a milestone for games like this and it should not even be remotely compared to some of the other RPG maker titles currently on Steam
Combat, but didn't I have combat in pros? Well, I like the combat, but it seems like others do not like it so much
Like some turn based games, the combat may feel slow at points or feel repetative
This leads to the next point


Grinding, expect to grind some if you want to level your characters
Although for the most part you can just do quests and keep the action moving, you will need to do some actual leveling in order to proceed
Personally I have nothing wrong with experience hunting, but I understand that others do not like this so much usually, so I thought I would point this out
Conclusion-Doom & Destiny is definitely a game that is worth the money, if not for the gameplay (which itself is amazing), then for the comical aspect of it
It is definitely a unique game like nothing else I have seen previous
You should definitely get this if you want to play a fun, casual game with lots of humor

												The game is pretty good so far, giving a thumbs down for all the NPCs that keep telling me to give the game a rating though
Also a lot of spelling errors, but oh well :D			
Posted: 21 July, 2015
												Alright, alright
Seriously
This game is FREE
If that, plus the extremely high ratings from the reviewers isn't enough to convince you to try it, I'll just add my review as well
I suck at reviews so I don't write them often, but some games just deserve my recognition
To begin with, it is worth mentioning that this game was built with RPG Maker, such as multiple other games released on Steam (and which accidentally, are overpriced and atrocious in the majority)
Well, don't let that mislead you - Eternal Senia is in NO WAY even close to being considered a bad game
Here are the reasons:1
The combat system
No, it's not using the usual boring turned-based combat system from RPG Maker
Yesss
Instead, the developer designed his very own ARPG battle system, which means that the combat happens on-screen, directly on the map as you encounter enemies
No button mashing either
You just walk into an enemy to fight it
"But wait, doesn't that get very boring very quickly?"Nope
The developer didn't forget to add diversity to the combat system either
Firstly, different enemies you encounter will have different combat skills
Secondly, YOU will unlock skills as well
The combination of perfectly balanced skills and enemy difficulty makes this game's combat system extremely appealing and fluent
2
The story
Did any of you ever play a game which, although being fairly short, took you on a ride on a wave of emotions? Because this is an approximately accurate description of this game's story
I won't be lingering on talking about the story - after all, I'm not here to spoil anything
All I'll say for now is that the game has a total of 3 endings, all very slightly different
However, remain reassured that luckily, all three endings will not require you to replay the entire game; saving the game when prompted is recommended if you want to go back and get all the other endings (which I HIGHLY recommend, by the way)
The only thing which may turn off a few of you grammar nazs is the fact that some words may be spelled incorrectly, and some grammar mistakes can be found in the text
But give the developer a break here - this is translated, you should be happy that you can have it in English language at all, right? Besides, it's not God-awfully bad, in fact it barely even annoyed me, a grammar freak
Overall?Wait, you're still reading? You probably would have had the time to download the game already
Seriously though, give it a try
Come on! It's free for fu


For the love of video games
What have you got to lose except a few minutes, which is what you've just wasted reading my longer-than-was-supposed-to-be review
TL;DR: Definitely worth playing
And IT'S FU


It's FREE dammit
What have you got to lose, right?

												There's a Legendary SheepThere are Multiple EndingsThe combat is amazingStory made me cryMy family questioned the large amount of tissues in the trash10/10 Would cry again
Oright, Now I'll be serious
I've played through all endings, and to say the least, this game was the closest to making me cry out of all games I have ever played
There is a few grammar errors, but I would let that slide since the game was originally made in chinese
I have enjoyed both of my playthroughs of this, and you can probably 100% it in about 4 hours tops
There is news of a sequal, though I've heard the developer is only planning on releasing it on Android, Which if he does, Will probably get me close to crying as well
Oh, If anyone wanted to know, Difficulty does NOT affect the ending
Overall, the game is fun and easy to play, But as a warning



Don't fight the final boss on hard mode, The nuns will make you rage
(It took me well over 100 trys to beat the Hard final Boss)Oh and can we get some fan art of Senia in that white shirt? It sure was sad and probably the main cause of all my tissues


			
Posted: 27 September, 2015
												This game is not free, as it requires you to buy alot of tissues for your manly tears
			
Posted: 14 August, 2015
												Lo' and behold, fans of Ys and Mana series 


this game is definitely worth a playthrough
Be warned, the story is an emotional rollercoaster


I am a complete wimp when it comes to well-written somber stories
A story rich Action-RPG that really stirs the heart
Everything about this game was taken into extreme care and consideration for all players
It is relatively short, the game takes around 4 hours to fully complete
I guarentee this game is not a waste of time
The only negatives are:  -- Although this game has controller support, you need to use the keyboard at some parts and there is no setting to rebind keys
-- The grammar is not 100%, seeing as the game is originally Chinese and translations were not done by a professional, so I won't judge too harshly
You saw the price? Well?After playing this game, you will begin to wonder if half the games in your library were worth paying for

												This is a moving and great game

I don't usally play RPG games at all, but this game

was a exceptionGood:The Story is rich and full of meaning, your always finding out more things about the characters and backstory throughout the gameIt's easy to learnit may only have 4-5 MAIN levels but they are VERY VERY! well done and good hidden secrets
For a small RPG game, it has aout 5-6 hrs of gametime and i didnt even collect all the sercets!I'm not gonna ruin the game but the endings

actually made me cry alot

they ARE movingThe Art in this game for the endings and other parts are high detail and truely amazing
A Ton more!Cons:I only have one

PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER ONEOverall 10/10 on the Wolf ScaleIt is rather sweet and careful constructed story and this game really deserves alot of praise
I will be playing this game again

I can't get enough of it!

												It's free ARPG but it's content is much more than a free game suppose to have!Good:- Nice Japan Animation graphics similar to Nihon Falcom (Ys series) style- Above average sound track- Easy to learn control and system- Skills and Equipment craft system are well done and keeps character grow up in the story progression- Story so far is interesting, especially for "Sister-sister relationship" lovers- Free of charge to own everythings of Eternal Senia, no DLC skins or map packBad:- No Full Screen or Exit game switches in game
But it can deal with Alt+Enter and Alt+F4 for those familiar with common Windows Hot keySuggestion:- ***Updated*** Add Controller support will be very nice thing <--Confirm have controller support when press F1 in game, thanks for commentors- Purely for me, I would enjoy player character can select male or female to enjoy "Sister-brother relationship"





Score: 80/100, Recommend Everyone should try this nice game as free stuff

												9
8/10I admit, this game got me by surprise on the simple way it work
The story element digs you in
There is a lot of deep story built in and the game is pretty good
More than one ending
Ever since I started it, I was hooked and I got to the end
When you see all the endings though, you got to hand it to them
However I do believe there could have been a "better" ending to them
Nonetheless I find this game truly exhilirating
My recommendation to those who want a free, on thier own time game
If you liked One way Heroics, Half minute hero, and to the moon
You will enjoy this game
The music is really captivated around the storytelling that helped make people understand the mood in a game which few do

												OK, I have just finished the game and I could say like this: "How can this game be so epic?", and the answers are in these pros and cons :First, the pros :+ The third game of the EBF series, follow the classic JRPG game style (explore and more grinding)
+ Colorful graphic (All hail Flash game!!)
+ The soundtrack is


oh boy, no comments, every tracks are AMAZING, from the field battles to the boss battles
Each track has their own charm, from sadness to intensive heat of battles
+ Funny trio protagonists
(Natalie is my new waifu :)) ) + There are jokes and funny dialouges between characters when they enter a combat
+ The story is very simple, yet silly at the same time
+  Variety of equipments, skills, craftable items and many more
+  You can become a pervert :)) (Fan service is here, boys)
+ 4 different difficulties, from Easy to Epic (or from Enjoy to Rage Quit), the enemies become more powerful in Epic mode
+ Many tries and errors, with enough efforts to get the game done in epic mode and it's worth
+ Many secrets are needed to explore
+ A few minigames to help you relax after the boss battles
+ And for the game itself is free along with the OST DLC
+ Hardcore gameplay with lots of strategies
There are no cons in the game, because it's hard to find them
It is a recommend for those want to seek for EPIC CHALLENGES
Overall, it's is fun and challenging game with RPG elements, funny story, the more you grind, the more you see the trio grow up on every level they earn, get stronger, get more equipments, more fights, more musics, More Natalie EPIC MOE moments :)) , more EPIC BOSS BATTLES
FIGHT, ERRORS, DIE, RETRY AND TRY HARD WITH LOTS OF STRATEGIES
IT IS  EPIC BATTLE FANTASY!!!!
Now, their epic journey saga will continue in EBF 4
__Final score: 10/10

												Kupo has always made games that shine, and this is one of them
A lot of love and work has been put into EB3, as evidenced by the strong gameplay, engaging dialogue and genuinely entertaining difficulty
While EBF4 is a step-up in every way, EB3 is free and it'll tell you if you would like EB4 (Which isn't very expensive, either!)The game is a decently deep turn-based RPG, focusing on the three party members; Matt, who likes swords, Natalie the mage and Lance the colonel
They each come with a variety of custom skills and abilties to unlock and level up, providing multiple different play-styles
There is also three slots of Gear for each character, for head, body and weapon
While the standard style would be Matt as a tank, Lance as DPS and Natalie as support, you can switch it around however you want
Matt can be a proficient Mage DPS, Lance can be support and Natalie can


Well, she can be a mage, but the choice to bonk things with her is there
A lot of game is here, and a lot of fun
If the game wasn't free, I would be more objective about it, but even if I made this review a "What-If" scenario if the game cost, it would be a far, far different story
Experience one of Kupo's adventures, and then salivate for more! I've played his games since the first Epic Battle Fantasy, and they always please
He has a devblog located at http://kupogames
com/category/epic-battle-fantasy-5/ ,so feel free to check out the progress on EBF5!Keep it up, Matt! I love your games!

												Before actually rating the game, I suppose I should give a little overwiew to the series for the newcomers, to better understand what's going on:Epic Battle Fantasy (EBF) series started as simple (if not simplistic) flash games that parody old-school classic games (mostly Final Fantasy, but you can find other references to well known old games, like Legend of Zelda or Kirby, or even some cartoons and anime), created by Matt Roszak (AKA matt-like-swords, kupo707, KupoGames and hell knows what else)
Before the EBF series, he mosty used to create amateur animations that date back to as early as 2004
Considering he's around 26 now, I think you can imagine they were created and uploaded for fun, as a hobby
Anyway, back to the game
The first game came out in 2009 and consisted exclusively of constant enemy waves and a boss fight every now and then until the very end
No savepoints too
The only "break" you had was a single potion shop
The fights themselves weren't very special too
Most of the time, it went like that:You have two characters: damage dealer and a healer - equip the the damage dealer with the right weapon - spam one skill - the healer spams multiheal ability for 99% of the game
Of course it changed a bit on highest difficulty, but still the premise was the same
It was Matt's first try at this kind of game and it kinda worked
The second game added a few RPG elements, and by "a few" I mean that after every few waves of enemies (or a boss) you could upgrade one of your stats and pick a skill
It wasn't a deep system, but it was surprisingly fun to think of new strategies that it introduced, but othet than that, it was pretty much the same as the first game, with constant waves of enemies and bosses (this time you had two checkpoints however, each allowed you to save a game and also featured a mini-game where you kill undead cats as NoLegs -also a cat-the series' mascot)EBF3 is basically Matt's first semi-serious game
What do I mean by semi-serious? I mean that it's still very simple, rather short and not very deep, and it's also a browser game (the Steam version, which is free of course, only added stuff like higher Resolutions, fullscreen, turbo mode etc
)
But it's a start
It features an actual overworld which you can explore, search for treasures, secrets and quests
There's also a normal levelling system and a whole lot of skills that can be upgraded separately
Combine that with more than 80 unique pieces of equipment and you get a fun jRPG-esque game which offers plenty of customisation and different tactics to defeat an enemy
Combat is still the main focus of the game and its core hasn't changed: you have a party, this time consisting of 3 party members, each with own strengths and weaknesses, battling waves of trash enemies and bosses until they die, not much to say
The quests featured in the game are nothing more than simple fetch quests (or rather, getting some random crap from chests and enemy drops and giving them to an NPC), but hey - they're there
The game isn't very long either, I finished the Steam release in under 8 hours while getting all the achievements, but those were fun 8 hours
Overall, if I were to compare EBF3 to budget games and AAA titles, that would be obviously unfair
The fourth game might be closer to that
But as a simple browser game brought to Steam, I believe EBF3 deserves a solid 9/10
			
Posted: 1 September, 2016
												So, where to start


This game is a great RPG, with great gameplay, great story, great art, and great music
It used to be online on websites such as Kongreate, but it's been ported to Steam so we won't lose our progress when we play again 5 years later or so
There's little secrets everywhere and references too, and you're sure to have a great time playing this game
There's even minigames and fan art, and quests to do
There's a variety of loudouts to choose from, and many skills to use
There's even limit breaks!(There's also 7 save slots I think, so you could have multiple games at once, or just save over it
)The only problems I see is that if you go fullscreen, the graphics aren't as good, and if you check out the fan art before unlocking it, you can briefly see the image before the "LOCKED" thing appears
So, if you're a fan of Matt Kupo's work, or Phyrnna's music, or you played this and want the nostalgia to come to you, or you like humour, or RPG's, or the art style, you should probably check this out
And if you don't?Check it out anyways, it doesn't require much from your computer
Other games by Matt Kupo (and sometimes Phyrnna) would be:EBFEBF2EBF4 (On Steam)Bullet HeavenBullet Heaven 2 (On Steam)Adventure StoryBrawl Royale (Reaction based game)Cat Cafe (On mobile I think)And also yay I'm first
			
Posted: 1 September, 2016
Before I even start: yes, this is the same Epic Battle Fantasy 3 you probably played on some Flash hub or another back in 2010
Also, disclosure, I got a Steam key a few days early and have been playing, Let's Playing and writing reviews of these games for years so I guess you could argue I'm looking at this through the lens of a rather hyperbolic fanboy
GoodSo, what to say about Epic Battle Fantasy 3
On the one hand, it's a silly Flash game, it looks like a silly Flash game, it sounds like a silly Flash game, it's written like a silly Flash game and I suppose you could argue that it plays like a silly Flash game, but it's all put together very well
The art and graphics isn't fantastic, but the style is very cohesive and the world map isn't so big that it starts to look repetitive
The sound effects and battle animations are cartoony and the characters sometimes exclaim "kek" (sic) or similar in battle, but it works because the entire game has a cartoony aesthetic
The writing 


well, you're probably not playing this kind of game if you want to experience Tolkien or Rowling, and, say it with me, the silly over-the-top save-the-world plot goes nicely with the silly over-the-top world of menacing giant squid and sentient giant monolith things
The battles themselves are a turn-based system where you get to attack first every turn, there is no "speed" or "agility" stat, so I guess it doesn't toe the JRPG line perfectly
Anyway, there isn't too much to say about the battles except that they can easily fall into the "Fire attack, heal and repeat" pattern and you can probably beat Easy and Normal modes that way, but if you want to strategize a little more there is a bit more you can do with playing with status effects and changing equips mid-battle
If you want a full list of differences/fixes between this and the web version, see here[kupogames
com]
BadThere are a couple spelling/English errors here and there throughout the game
It doesn't look terribly professional but they realistically don't have any affect on how the game plays so please don't bother complaining about it
I have no idea if they're going to be patched out by the time the game itself is released or anything like that
There are a couple places where the music doesn't loop perfectly
But the music's still great so you won't see me complaining that some battle theme is half a measure off at the end or something
I obviously have to compare this game to its successor, EBF4, at some point, so here you goEBF4 boasts a longer story, fancier graphics, more to explore, Battle Mountain and a bunch of other things, but in a lot of strange ways I enjoy this game better
The battle system has fewer moves available and feels less overwhelming to start out with, and there are few enough that you could realistically try out all (most) of them throughout the course of a single playthrough
The game and game world themselves are shorter, and the level cap is 30 (I think the final enemies in the game top out at about level 32 or 33), so the end-game battles feel somewhat less long and dragged out
Lastly, while EBF4 overall probably has better music, You'll Never Guess This[phyrnna
bandcamp
com] is easily my favorite song in all of Flash games
Also, the font is in Comic Sans
I personally am in favor of adding DLC to EBF4 and Bullet Heaven 2 that changes all of the fonts in the game to Comic Sans
tl;drGood game, and if you don't believe me it's free (as in it doesn't even cost money) so there really is no downside to downloading it and trying it out for twenty minutes
[s]If I see anyone reply with "I hate anime games" I will make sure to personally strangle you with a small planet

												I'm 29 years old and just over 2 months ago i lost my job
I have worked hard since i left school at 17 and in the past 2 years i grinded my way into a nice promotion at a job where a lot of people hate or see as a dead end career wise
I'm going through the toughest time of my life right now with personal issues and the troubles that come along with being unemployed during a crisis in your life is weighing heavy on me
Don't worry this is not a sob story, everything ties in with the game
So, being depressed and unable to get out of bed and generally live my life ( no exaggeration i swear ) i found myself reading up on old video games that i loved as a kid, in an attempt to try and feel happy again
Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VIII were my favorite games growing up
In recent years i haven't been that much into games as i was as teenager
Work commitments and adulthood takes a hold of you and gaming kind of took a back seat
Anyway, i stumbled upon Trails In The Sky FC whilst reading up on good JRPGS on Steam ( JRPG's were my thing as a kid )
I saw one review that described Trails as better than Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VII, and it was going so cheap on Steam, i had to see what the fuss was about
Thank god i did
As i played FC and SC consecutively i'll count this as a combined review but as i mentioned above
I haven't played games much in recent years and an in depth review is something i wouldn't be good at so i'll keep it short and sweet
First things first, the storyline in this game is absolutely fantastic, So many good characters and interactions, a lot of text to read through but i love that
A game without good text/dialogue will struggle to be a good game
Trails has the best storyline i have ever came across in a game
It's very long but well worth it, look at it this way
Would The Lord Of The Rings be the story it was if it were not a gigantic beast of a novel? This kind of is the same with Trails
It's a slow burner at the the start but about 20 hours into FC it picks up and does not stop
It grips you in and will have you laughing, crying and screaming before you know it
The characters and character relations are amazing
Sometime the highlights for me weren't beating a tough boss or finishing long quests/chapters it was the small moments when the full team are together and each individual character shines through in the dialogue
Simply fantastic
I had mentioned before playing SC that the only thing i could say that was keeping it from being the complete game was the music, although the music is great i did say that it wasn't comparable to say a Nobou Uematsu score ( but what is eh? )
I'm going to backtrack on this now, after playing SC ( Which is considerably longer than FC ) i can say that the music is absolutely fantastic
It's up there with Nobou's Chrono Trigger soundtrack for me now
Well, that's about as much as i can say without tangling myself up in knots over a game review
The reasons i wanted to write this wasn't to critique the game but to get the message out there that games ( no matter what your preference is ) are magical
I'm now in better spirits and feeling more optimisitc about life after finishing this game
Yes, that may sound sad to some people but the joy this game brought to me will be something i will forever cherish
Given the impact this game has had on me, it will now be my " Greatest Game Of All Time "
Sometimes you need somthing in your life to pick you up and Trails was my shoulder to cry on
Thanks Falcom and Xseed, you basically saved my life
If you like long JRPG's with amazing storytelling, characters, combat systems and addictive side quests
You need to get this game
It's an absolute must
10/10

												I brought this to vote with my wallet that WE WANT XSEED TO TRANSLATE THE 3RD ONE TOO, SO THE TRILOGY WOULD BE COMPLETE
Thank you

												I don't even know where to begin
I finished the game today and loved it enough to immediately want to write a review, but


frankly, I can't find the words
Let's start with the ending, perhaps: this is by far the best JRPG on Steam, and one of the best of all time
With that aside, let's gets down to business: this game is a direct sequel to another game on Steam entitled simply "The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky"
You should absolutely not play this game if you haven't played the previous title first, because this game is an incredibly direct sequel to it
That game, henceforth "FC" (for "First Chapter"), should prove to be a pretty decisive litmus test determining whether or not you'll like this game -- and if you're on the fence, know that SC has everything FC did well and more
As you should know from FC, there are a few things that will either make or break the game for a lot of people:-This is a turn-based game-This is a game from the mid-2000s-This game heavily involves anime-like aesthetics in its character and world designAnd if any of those things turned you off, SC won't really change them
If you're fine with all three of those things, though, then you're in for a real treat
SC is basically the perfect sequel to FC, expertly answering many questions FC asked and resolving a great number of personal conflicts, taking great pain to give character even to those who previously had little
The orbment system is drastically refined for the better, and while combat is largely the same, the greater focus on crafts makes it feel significantly more strategic
The game as a whole feels more challenging than FC even from the outset, but never to the point where it feels unfair -- at least, on Normal mode -- so that extra bit of strategy is necessary
Even the artwork is nicer and crisper than anything from FC, and the soundtrack is just as excellent as you'd expect from Nihon Falcom
And, of course, the localization -- the part that took four years, you might remember -- is just as high-quality as the excellence that was this game's predecessor, worth every second of effort XSEED and others put into it
To those who find no issue with the three points above, this game might well be one of the best things you ever play
In all my hours of playing the game (66, and not even on a completionist run), I only had two trivial issues: a somewhat slow prologue and enemies that feel a touch too bulky at two specific points in the game
Both of these things are fairly transient and do little to diminish the game's overall quality, which shines through at almost every other point
This game's predecessor released in English over four years ago
Ever since then, I've been waiting patiently for this title
Four years of hype, four years of expectations


and I'm the sort of person too prone to disappointment to ever get hyped for anything anymore
And with this game finished, it would be an understatement to say that I'm not disappointed
Every expectation I had was met, every bit of hype I had was exceeded, and this game will likely end up being one of the most satisfying experiences I've ever had
If you're reading this, you had the luxury of not waiting that long -- and you'll likely find the game even better for it
I give this game no less than the highest recommendation I possibly can
This game is the culmination of practically a decade of work between Nihon Falcom's development and XSEED's localization; I thank both of them, from the bottom of my heart, for the many wonderful hours I spent playing the game
My only wish now is that other people can share in the joy I felt while playing Trails in the Sky SC

Pre-ReviewThis 'review' is aimed to help players interested in, but not yet resolved to buy the game, so to say it is not yet a complete review but I will definitely update it as I progress in the story
SummaryJust a quick overview of what I can already tell you
For this game, even more so than the first one - you will be reading
A lot
But even if you are not into reading I do advise this game to you, it may even change your opinion on the topic altogether
 Positive Mediocre Negative   + Finally the conclusion ~ definitely don't play it if you haven't finished FC      + NPCs welcome you home ~ don't know if it's from my save file of FC      + Breathtaking locations (old and new)        + MORE loveable characters ~ you still have to part with them at some points     + Improved Orbment -> more Arts       + More Crafts, especially Chain Crafts       + I found the 'moving' more useful  ~ is it just me?      + Extremely fun minigames       + Still beautiful art style ~ and still old textures     + HD Portraits of characters in dialogues ~ for important characters only     + Goosebumps music ~ not the opening of FC       ~ no more all different chest-catchphrases     + Increased replay value     RecommendationIf you haven't played through The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (First Chapter) yet, don't consider playing this game either
Better head back there, read my review ;-), get this masterpiece of a game, play through it and then come back here! Seriously, this is in your best interest since this game is a direct spoiler to the first one, the best would be to not even watch the trailer and not to go into the community hub of this game!If on the other hand you played through the first one and still couldn't get yourself to buy this one - then I don't understand you


Second Chapter takes off where FC left you and you will definitely feel right back at home in this game, the music is great as ever, the atmosphere takes you in and you want to keep playing until the end
In the first two hours I played the game it already brought me to the edge of tears and made me laugh out loud in front of my PC - just to convey some of the early feelings in the game
So do yourself a favor and grab it!And if that still couldn't change your opinion - you can defeat enemies with Estelle's cooking - I guess some Monsters would die to get a bite ;-)CombatYou can really tell they made an effort to improve the combat in this sequel and


they succeeded
If you read my review of FC you know about my opinion on turn-based combat and the combat in this series and they made me enjoy myself even more with the additions they made
OK, I'm not to sure on this one, this will need some confirmation ;-)
I used the 'moving' in my first 12h more than in the 52h of playing the first one
Somehow it felt more useful and the delay until the next attack not so huge
At certain points 'moving' is the only logical move to make - to dodge an enemy's attack, get into the healing range of an AoE-heal or position yourself for your own AoE attack
I still have a slight problem with the mechanic of it, but then again I found it more useful
Secondly, the introduction of a brand new - fresh out of the Central Factory - Orbment, (check back my review of FC for explanations) which enables you to use more quartz resulting in higher stats and, more importantly, more arts to play with, turns diversity in combat up a notch
Last but not least due to your extensive training as a 'Senior Bracer' you acquire the ability to utilize a new, so-called 'Chain-Craft' which lets your party members join in an attack that grows stronger in range and damage the more combatants take part in it
Naturally you will also gain access to new 'normal' crafts for each bracer you get to add to your fellowship, as their levels increase
Additionally, as I already mentioned above - you can now use certain kinds of food to hit your foes with, with different damage and varying 'target systems' (if anyone knows a better word, tell me please), meaning if it will effect a circle around your enemy, a line outgoing from the point you are standing at, etc
Mini-GamesOh boy, I love minigames and they added some in this game, namely gambling and fishing
Of my first about 8h or so, about 1
5h were spend doing these activities
While gambling you can choose from a slot-machine, poker, black-jack and roulette
After exchanging some of your mira for medals, you can start in the fun of losing it to the bank again
Personally, I enjoyed poker the most (as I did not lose as hard there)
For fishing, you will need a fishing rod, bait and obviously - a place to dip your pole into
Different combinations of all these factors will result in a different game (mostly location and bait, but without the right rod and line you can't utilize higher level bait), but stay focused not to let those slippery suckers get away
ThanksOn the one hand to Nihon Falcom who developed this series and on the other one, even more so to XSeed and Carpe Fulgur for putting in all the localization work including all the extras they made for us to enjoy and the great translation
Also, remember that it cost these companies a lot of blood, tears, sweat and the tiny thing that some people tend to forget - money
Well, we can't help much with all those body liquids but the latter one is something we can help them with
So don't be a cheapskate, get this game - full price - so that we all may enjoy wonderful localizations of this series to come
BugsQuite a few bugs already got fixed, for those still in the game read this thread to see how bad it still is and how to fix problems if you encountered some yourself
Personally, I didn't have any problems whatsoever
NoteAs this is a pre-review you might as well not do anything yet, since I will change the whole thing over but otherwise --I hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like

												I was planning to just write ''best game ever'' and leave it at that
But eh, knowing ol' Bokxie here, he isn't satisfied with just that
Actually, I am, but allow me to elaborate
There are few games out there that to world building and character development as well as this game (and the first game of course)
This game does take it's time for that, but look past that and you have a masterpiece on your hand
Likewise, I also took my time because I wanted to see and know everything the world of Trails has to offer
Half of the game's dialogue is just optional world building, but I wanted to read them because it's done so well
And even though you revisit Liberl again in this game, it is not a repetitive and boring return
The sequel does enough to make Liberl a lively place yet again
And yeah, the characters in the first game return, and become even better in this game with more story behind them
Also a few new faces I definitely welcome
That is not to say the gameplay is lacking either
The gameplay is well done for a JRPG
Nothing that stands out from other JRPGs, but it is very engaging, and some of the boss battles in this game were some of the most intense I had in any JRPG out there
The OST also helped with that, setting the mood perfectly in whatever situation it demanded
I mean, I could go on and on, but I think I made my point clear
The only negatives I could come up with relate to personal preferences, like the game being long and taking it's time
If you do mind that, then maybe this isn't the game for you, and that's exactly what Trails in the Sky is: a masterpiece if you can appreciate it taking it's time to develop itself
If not well

then I can't guarantee you'll like it
You can play the first game, which is also very good and while the games are directly related to each other, the first game's still has an ending for that game, though with a cliffhanger for the second game
If you enjoyed that game, you can always come back here and see if you want to play the game
I mean, I have played tons of JRPGs, and for over a decade Final Fantasy VI was my favourite game
And then suddenly this game comes along and aims to rob that place, with the both of them sharing the honour of being my favourite game now
I love this game to death, and even after finishing it I just wanted to continue
This game is wonderful, an experience I am glad I was able to play myself

												This is a special game
Picking up right where the first chapter left off, Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC brings us back to the wonderful land of Liberl, and if feels just as vibrant and real as it did before
Much like the first entry, when analyzing the individual pieces that make up this game, it may not sound like a revolutionary experience
 But the level of detail and effort that is poured into the whole thing really elevates the experience into something far more than the sum of its parts
 Not only do the main characters change and grow in believable and appropriate ways as the story progresses but so too do hundreds, yes hundreds, of minor characters that populate the setting
 It’s the kind of storytelling that is only really available to games
 Trails in the Sky SC does it with style
While it may not change anyone’s mind about JRPGs as a genre, I wholeheartedly and unreservedly recommend the Trails in the Sky games

												In Chapter 4, there is a segment of the story where, if you choose to visit the general store, you can spend a little bit of money to buy chocolate for your party members that have been staying up patrolling the whole night
This action does not change the course of the main story or unlock additional sidequests or equipment
It provides absolutely no benefit other than a couple of lines of dialogue
It is the little details like these, put into the game with the hearts of the developers, that are what makes Trails in the Sky SC amazing
Trails in the Sky is not an open world sandbox game, but the amount of effort put into the world and characters of the story is simply astounding
Your party members are a vibrant, well-developed cast of some of the most memorable characters you will meet, and a great deal of thought was put into each and every line of dialogue as the characters interact with each other, bringing their personalities to life
The NPCs which inhabit the cities and villages of Liberl are also lavished upon the same treatment, with almost all the NPCs having unique names and distinct personalities, down to even the airship crew and shop owners
And given that all of the NPC dialogue changes after each segment of the main story, you'll also be able to follow the little happenings in their daily lives
Yes that's right---most NPCs in the game have their own mini-storylines, a few which will tie into your Bracer Guild sidequests, but most which are just their to simply add life to the world
My favourite of these even spans multiple regions and games, involving the grandma of Rinon, your Rolent General Store owner, who wants to find a wife for her son
She eventually gives up on Rolent and travels to Grancel at the end of FC, to no success
On the airship back though, she meets Kitty, a tea seller girl from Edel Department store, who is on the way to Bose, and gets along quite well with her (while her sister rejoices at being able to take over as #1 tea seller)
Well, thanks to the airships being grounded, Kitty ends up working at the store in Rolent, and Rinon while suspicious of his grandma, can't help but admire the girl's enthusiasm and hard work
Later, in Chapter 8 the wedding of a couple (whose story began in FC, and whose ring you retrieve on a sidequest in Chapter 4) takes place, and well, no points for guessing who catches the bridal bouquet
To anyone who loves a sprawling world with many secrets and lifelike characters, I can't recommend Trails in the Sky more

One of my all time favorites

												I just finished Trails in the Sky the 3rd after playing all three games - and while they're all fantastic, I have to say of the three Sky games that Trails in the Sky SC is my favourite
The characters are all incredible, the story is lovely, and the script writing is fantastic! The music, in my opinion, is the best in the whole Trails series
(Although the 3rd was a close second!) However, this may seem obvious but just in case - I recommend that you do not pick up Trails in the Sky SC unless you have beaten Trails in the Sky FC first, as it is the second half of a story and picks off immediately after the ending of FC

												The wait was worth it~and now we wait again


Hope localization of the third chapter  doesnt take too long
			
Posted: 27 July
TL;DR: Have you played Fate/Extra and/or Fate/Extra CCC? Buy this
Have played other Fate games? Might be worth a buy
Only watched the various anime? Carefuly consider it
Never had any contact with the series? This is not the best place to start
 As a disclaimer, I am a fate series veteran, played/watched most of all translated available material
Finished most of the game by now, am waiting until the end to summarize properly what I think regarding the story
All other points are still the same
PlotThe plot is a direct continuation from Fate/Extra CCC, the Japan-only highschool holy battle royale and waifu/bro simulator for the PSP
Being a direct continuation, you are quite literally thrown into the thick of things right from the start
Following in the footsteps of the Fate/Stay Night visual novel, you cannot choose a route from the get-go, as they are meant to be experienced in a specific order
Whereas in a game it might be seen as archaic for newcomers, I feel like it does help to tell a more cohesive story at the end
Written by Nasu with help of Hikaru Sakurai, the plot in the first part is, without mincing words, very predictable
As I have not finished the game yet, I can't tell if the first part serves the same purpose as the Fate route in F/SN (or, in a broader sense, the entirety of Fate/Extra) to better ease the reader into the world and by the third part it is more interesting and wild
Regardless, it was still very much a product you'd come to expect from Nasu, immensely poetic and descriptive as it is
More to the point, it is almost fanservice-y in parts, from character interactions to the roster
Many if not all quips might fly above the head of even someone that is used to the fate series but hasn't played the Extra duology; newcomers even more so
GameplayGameplay is standard Musou/Dynasty Warrior fare
Murder mooks until the big guy comes out, murder big guys, use your big finisher move on the boss, yay
For me, as a fan? It's very cool
For those who don't even know what happens when Archer uses his UBW? Less so
SoundtrackIt works and fits the theme of the game
If you've played Fate/Extra, you know what to expect
GraphicsGraphics are on the cheaper side of the spectrum
Sometimes it does look good, but some of the moves and special cutscenes that zoom in the characters look stiff and very low definition
Elizabeth Bathory's scenes are one of the biggest offenders
Just looks hastily put together
With the roster as frankly small as it is, when considering the franchise as a whole, this kind of thing is hard to defend
In closingMy opinion is that you should play this game mostly because of it's story
Even then, that story is a continuation of a game that was never localized, that was a sequel and proper closing of a game for the PSP when it was already on it's way out
For someone like me, this game is entertaining, funny, and honestly what I'd expect from all parties involved
For someone who never touched the fate series or universe, I can't see them overlooking the repetitive gameplay, frankly boring first chapter, hard to understand story and apparently random selection of historical/mythical figures that may or may not be genderbent for whatever reason

												Need more fate series on steam			
Posted: 26 July
												I can't do it
I tried it on PS4 and on PC and I can't enjoy this game
To be fair, this port is excellent*, but I can't defend the game
There is a lot of VN stuff here, and if you want Tamamo or Nero as your doting waifu, this game lays that on SO INCREDIBLY THICK in the VN segments that your teeth will rot from the sweetness
The musou part of the game? It's


perfectly playable
I really have nothing bad to say about it for the sorts of people who just muck with musous for fun, to enjoy themselves
There's a lot of flash, a lot of style, and a lot of waifus on offer (Though you won't get a free pick of them until you knock out large chunks of the games' main story arcs
)But I just can't stand the musou parts of the game
There is nothing to your movesets
The levels are just great big colorful cyberboxes where you warp from zone to zone
At each zone, you have to stop and kill about 500 mooks to spawn the midbosses, kill two of them, kill another 500 (Triggering the "Holy cow chief, you killed 1000? You are a true warrior of the holy grail!" message all of 40 seconds into the fight
), kill the second set of midbosses, then you finally have the zone and now have to do that eight or nine more times throughout the map
This same kill, boss, kill, boss pattern is also how you do defense, so it takes just as long to repel an attack and shut your teammates whining for help up than it does to secure a new zone
If killing things were interesting in Extella, that would be fine
But it isn't
You do not have a Basara moveset
You barely have a Warriors moveset
While the moves are big, flashy, hit wide areas, and generally have an anime sensibility to them, they just aren't interesting
And the stop-and-go pace just drags each mission out tremendously
There is no fancy strategy or gimmick or story to be told in these levels, just the story of someone who has to walk to each room and slowly, laboriously clear it out while listening to your allies moan and wish you stopped attacking to clear out THEIR room
Any time the game gets clever mid-mission, it usually involves you clearing EVEN MORE rooms and making your conquest of the map nearly sisyphean
Worse, your musou attack is probably the least satisfying and most pointlessly long special move I've ever seen
Your ultras are cool, but they are kinda big skippable corny anime cutscenes appropriate to the Fate franchise
But you don't get those but once a match maybe and you'll probably mash that musou button most of the fight
The entire thing feels like an amateur's first musou, and that's really what it is
I rag on Senran Kagura, but Senran brings a lot better stuff to the table


like Yumi, for instance
These are all little things, but they add up
They may not be a big deal to you, really
But if you're the sort who noticed that Samurai Warriors 4-2 just completely bungled large parts of the combat, or that One Piece Pirate Warriors 3 was secretly the best musou Koei had done, if you know what Sengoku Basara even is or why someone would want to play it, if you're a musou connosieur, I don't think Fate Extella will fit the bill for you
That's not to say Extella is a bad game
I mean, I can't stand it and I think it's barely playable trash, but what is there, what effort they've put in, and the sheer amount of Fate fan-service


There's an audience for this game
If you aren't a musou snob, and you like the idea of having Tamamo and Nero practically beat the stuffing out of each other to prove which one loves you more, this might end up being something you like
But I can't enjoy it
*EDIT: By excellent, I mean it runs smooth and loads quick
I don't think it is hitting 60 FPS though, though the action isn't all that interesting enough to merit it, but I can understand disagreements on the issue

												Fate/EXTELLA The Umbral Star is probably the best Dynasty Warriors-esque game out there
The soundtrack is fantastic, there's a compelling story that even non-Fate fans can follow with relative ease, and the gameplay is great fun
The PC Port is flawless, it's incredibly optimised and runs at very consistent framerates
You can see a direct comparison of graphics and performance between this PC release and the original PS4 release here: https://youtu
be/HPf6OtdTxD0If you didn't pick it up on the PS4, or the Nintendo Switch, there is no better time than now
With full controller support, and excellent performance, the PC port is every bit as good as it was on the PS4

Then i realized that I would rather spend my time playing this masterpiece instead
Really, this is one the best games I've ever played
Only one advice though, when playing don't rush it to the end, take your time and listen/read to the dialogues as it will make you understand the characters better and get more involved in the story

												If you like JRPG, you can't go wrong with this FFX Remaster
In short, recommended, but with some warnings
The game comes in two versions
FFX International, FFX-2 International - there are also two more extras: Eternal Calm for FFX and Last Mission for FFX-2
All is accessible from FFX's main launcher, of which it contains mini-settings to select language and graphic options also
Language is, sadly, tied directly to in-game dub
If you choose English, you can only hear English dub and English text, and so does for Japanese
There's a mod made by community so you can crossover the Japanese dub with English text (which seemingly majority of players like)
Graphic options, although presets are selectable from main launcher, the whole brand new settings are available in-game like Anisotropic, Vsync, AA, screen mode (borderless, windowed or full screen) and of course screen resolutions
No matter how monstrous your rig is, the game's locked to 30 FPS
 Whether it's pure laziness of their part or the game engine's limitation, I can't say for sure
But for playing experience, it's still fine although not the best one
At the very least you can adjust all to the max if your rig is powerful enough, or tone down the settings one by one so you can get stable FPS if your rig is weaker
A few notable notes: 1
if your rig comes with dual-GPU like what's commonly found in laptop, the game preselects your WEAKER GPU
Make sure you force the GPU's control panel to select your better/dedicated card
2
As of today 13/5/2016, the game often crashes when you select higher quality of the graphical settings
This should be fixable by patches from Square Enix, but who knows
To play safely, just set the options to lowest possible
3
The game now offers fast-forward options, but movies are still not skippable
Very useful if you don't want to watch the scenes all over again if you had previously played its predecessors
4
The game is DRM-free
Just execute FFX&X-2_LAUNCHER
exe if you want to play outside Steam
Keep in mind that you won't get achievement or Cloud Saving or Trading Card (as it's not registered properly with Steam) that way
Audio comes with two options, the original version or arranged
Amazingly, you can change the setting on the fly through in-game option
At the end of the day, both versions are just fine for my ears, so it's just a matter of preferences
And no, it's not like Steam FF7's original MIDI releases, thankfully
Gameplay and story, I don't have much to say as they are untouched and just carbon copy paste of the original releases
As for the control options, the game offers fully customizable settings
If you dislike the default keyboard button assignments, there's a menu to rebind everything to your liking
I myself use my trusty F310 controller for this game and only had to tweak two buttons (swapping 'A' with 'B' function)
And yeah, Square Enix's releases mostly only support Xinput, so for Dinput controllers you have no choice but to wrap it with x360ce for example
With two games packaged into one, it makes sense that this game is more expensive than previous FF releases on Steam, so keep that in mind when you weigh based on pricing alone
Overall, good game and recommended, they just need to fix the crash issues urgently and hopefully they listen - unlock 30 FPS limiter and give us skippable movies

												I always thought games were just about having fun
One day, however, a friend told me about Final Fantasy X
This game taught me how to appreciate a game's beauty
Games are not just pixels and polygons on a screen, they are stories that are told to you in a way that gives you the impression that you're not just staring at a character, but you're with him all the time
Even if you don't like the character, you get attached to them
However


every story must have an ending
And this one takes you on an emotional rollercoaster and you're not gonna be able to get off until you're done
Even now


after finishing this game for the fifth time


it still makes me cry
And I don't feel bad about that
I think if you're not even feeling slightly sad after finishing this game, an adventure that took you at least 48 hours, then you shouldn't be playing a game for the story
			
Posted: 23 January
												FINAL FANTASY X:+ They added options to speed up the game+ You can make random encounter frequent or eliminate them+ You can supercharge your party (if you never want to grind or be stuck anywhere)+ If you didn't have the international version on the ps2 Dark Aeons and Pennance is hereIF YOU'RE COMPLETELY NEW TO THIS GAME:- It's very linnear at the start of the game (this lasts a while)- The infamous laugh scene will have you feel awkward- Turn based battle system has you use a party member for each type of enemy, which requires little input for a good while (it gets going on difficulty later)- Story is great, and the music matches it well
FFX-2:I am too biased on this game to write objectivly but I love the battle system and I was young enough when playing this to look at it through nostalgia, but they added some cool things:+ You can now have monsters in your party (Or Brother, he's a fiend too)+ This means there's a way to hunt most monsters in this game
The monsters have stories (weird ones) you can discover+ They added classes, some really strong, some


Well, we have a Trainer look-alike
A+ would get this without a doubt if you like final fantasies or jrpgs in general!

												The moment I realised that FFX was available on Steam, I could not have put it into my library quick enough! It's still the only FF that I've ever played (excluding FFXV, because it's only just been released!) that I have yet to complete
I don't even know how the story ends
I've never even played X-2! Now I've put 60+ hours into FFX on Steam, and I must've put 500+ hours into it when I had a PS2
So you may be asking yourself, "Why hasn't this absolute muppet finished the game after all this time?" Blitzball, dear reader
Facking blitzball
If there was ever a FF spinoff game that could, would and BLOODY WELL SHOULD be developed, it would be dedicated to the God tier mini-game/futuristic sport known as facking blitzball
I mean, if it was upto me, Square Enix would be researching, if not already developing, the technology to bring blitzball to life
I swear to Nedus, I would be the first ever season ticket holder for the Besaid Aurochs!Seriously, am I the only person who'd happily sacrifice a nipple for a full blitzball game??Don't get me wrong, the story of FFX is good, the levelling up system is fantastic, Auron's still a badass and I still lowkey have a thing for Lulu


but BLITZBALL MATE
Why waste your days throwing money at EA for deadass packs on FIFA when you can grind to level up Tidus, Larbeight, Nedus, Kiyuri, Ropp, Navara Guado and Nimrook FOR FREE??#MakeBlitzballHappen

												This game inspired me to become a musician when I was a kid


I first saw it when a buddy of mine called me over, he just got his PS2
I sat and watched him play it for hours
Fastforward to Christmas, my older brother and I unboxed our very own PS2 with Kingdom Hearts and Tekken 4 inside
My mom bought us extra controllers so we wouldn't fight
Mine was blue, my brothers was red
The day after my mom took us out to spend money our grandparents gave us and I knew exactly what I was getting
When I got home, my brother and I made our dad watch the intro scene with us
From there, it was a race to beat sin
The point I'm making is that FFX was so powerful to the community of young gamers who evolved from SNES and PS1 JRPG's (Lufia, Chrono Trigger/Cross, Alundra, Musashi, FF 7/8/9) in a way that impacted our memories
It brought my brother and I together, which at the time was rare
The soundtrack would play through the house daily
It meant more that just a dip into nostalgia to play through it again, it brought me to a time when I first started to feel inspired by the medium
For those who missed the chance to experience it years ago, I hope that you play it
It's worth every cent

												Overall, I recommend this game to any one who enjoys Turn-Based RPGs (It solidly earns its current $30 price tag), if you're only a marginal fan of Turn-based RPGs or are looking for a "first foray into the genre" - I would wait for it to go on sale ($20-ish)
Pros:- Goregeous Aesthetics- Intuitive Controls- Unique Characters (each character feels distinct and alive, something a lot of turn-based RPGs lately lack - even the NPCs have a decent personality, albeit flatter than the characters)- A solid balance of Core content and Side Content (side missions, collections, crafting, etc
)- Good RNG design (RNG plays its role, but never in a manner that feels "unfair" or where you're relying solely on it to do something - you'll never win/lose because of RNG )- Good Voice Acting- Decent amount of non-voice acted "side exposition" through staying at the inn and exploring "side-quest" areas
Cons:- Combat is a little simple (there's a number of buffs/debuffs, but they generally aren't a means to an end, more just a "nice added effect" to another ability) - the only buffs/debuffs that are really important are taunt/defend, and to a lesser extent burn/bleed/poison (the rest are "nice, but not necessary" such as chill, stun, sunder, etc
)- Some aspects of the game could use better explanations [they are adding to the in-game manual for this]- there is a DX9 "safe mode" - though I would recommend using a card that supports later DX versions (DX9 version still has some "blurry cam" issues in a limited number of areas)Neutrals:- Has some limited replay value in discovering secrets, leveling, NG+, and repeatable semi-random dungeons
- Semi-linear (not a real problem, just worth noting, there isn't much in the way of possible sequence breaking)Episode 1 of my blind playthrough so you can get a feel of the gameplay (full playlist on channel if you want to see all the characters):http://steamcommunity

												Should you buy this game? Well, depends on what you're looking for
Me? I'm just an old school gamer that used to play Final Fantasy on the NES and Phantasy Star on the Sega Master System
Yes, I'm showing my age here, but, it's for a good reason
Both games mentioned above were staples in my gaming library growing up and I've spent hours everyday scratching that itch
You know what itch I'm referring to
The itch to explore a new world and loose yourself within it
Fighting enemies for a cause and finding treasure along the way
I haven't felt that itch being scratched more then with Battle Chasers: Nightwar
If you enjoy JRPG's, Turn-Based Combat (with a surprisingly deep amount of strategy) and Exploration this is the game for you
Worth the $30 US? Yes, it is friends

An RPG where the little girl in your party is the Tank while the Colossal Wargolem is the healer -Character Design 10/10(Scroll Down to the end if details bore you)COMBAT The turnbased combat is very reminiscent to Final Fantasy games while introducing it's own unique mechanics such as  "Overcharge" Overcharge is basically temporary mana a character is given whenever they do regular actions in combat
It's a mechanic that encourages activity over inactivity, the first I've seen in a turnbased game and probably one of my favorites
#MakeTurnbasedGreatAgainTORCHLIGHT + KINGDOM HEARTS: CHAIN OF MEMORIES DUNGEON CRAWLING Exploration in Battle Chasers: NW shares similarities with Torchlight (for its level designs) and Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories (for the dungeon layout & enemy encounters)
Also, the layout of the dungeons changes whenever you revisit them, this gives a non linear grinding/farming experience
STORY / WRITING The main plot is not that spectacular, but the rest of the writing itself is excellent in my opinion, the characters outside of the main cutscenes are endearing and the bits of lore found all across the world are all the more intriguing
But behind the dark undertones, what I enjoy most are the subtle jokes the writers slip in from time to time


One time when I was fishing, the game told me I caught a fish that legends say could talk, but since I hooked it out of the water, it died and I can never test the theory anymore
VISUALSThe 2D and 3D aesthetics of this game blends together so well
The UI, the animations, the 3D models and environments, every visual aspect of the game shares the same artistic motif, it's very consistent and enjoyable to look at for hours and hours of gameplay
And with Joe Madureira himself behind the creative direction is just icing on the cake
I'm a bit biased on this one cuz I'm a real sucker for comic book artstyles, specially for Joe Mad's art
If you are too, you would probably enjoy the visuals as much I did
----------------------------------- SUMMARY -----------------------------------VISUALS: Epic
COMBAT: Final Fantasy w/ It's own unique mechanics

												Best game to come out in many years
This will go down as one of my all time favorite games and I don't even play many single player games anymore
So excited to see there are real game devs out there that can still put out a fully finished game and not the "early release alpha game that never gets finished but we still take your money" style of devs we have today
Will not only follow this game but the devs

Battle Chasers: Nightwar is a solid and welcome addition to the JRPG genre
They got it right
The world is beautiful, and the story is worthwhile
The combat animations are some of the best I've seen, and the hits carry weight
There are tons of unlockables and progression feels good
You can choose the difficulty level of the dungeons and alter the payout
Yes, that's been done before but it works well here
Also, the fishing is fun!Essentially, to me, this is a modernized version of the good old Final Fantasy games from long ago
The core exploration and fantasy story is there, along with a slew of modern bells-and-whistles such as the unlockables
While this is probably the most AAA game I've played this year, it doesn't feel too gross in that department
But yeah, there is a ton of polish
The sound effects and music are great, and the world is just so *beautiful*
Most people that read my reviews are into indie games at indie prices
Is this worth the high-ish asking price? Yeah, it is
Pros:+The artwork is obviously stunning with animations to match+I'm not a story kind of guy, but this is delightful+Everything feels balanced so far, progression is satisfying +Lots of cool unlockables+The crafting system is fantastic!+The fishing is fun for sure+Great game to play from the couch+The characters have depth and I'm interested in themCons:-Why is there no option to speed up battle animations? I'm not complaining just yet, but after a dozen hours I would think people would want that-Yes, the overworld map is open like a sandbox, but progression is still kind of linear; this was true of the older JRPGs as well, but it's all about how you hide thatIf you are in the mood for a great modern JRPG - then Battle Chasers: Nightwar is what you are looking for
Totally worth full price

A game that does AAAAALLLLLLLL THE THINGS! It's a gloriously inconsistent all-you-can-eat buffet of RPG, dungeon crawling, quests, crafting, fishing(!), cartoonery, turn-based combat and probably other stuff I haven't even discovered yet
Not to mention three different types of fancy graphics
I have a confession to make
When I picked this game I didn't pay all that much attention to the store page, I just thought "nice graphics and turn-based combat, I'll have some of that!" To me, turn-based combat usually means pushing characters around on a grid with battles strung together by a storyline
Well, I got a lot more than I bargained for as all the items, menus, abilities, upgrades and miscellaneous bits and pieces showered down on me, like when you open an over-stuffed cupboard and all the toys fall on your head
Sometimes in situations like this I'm overwhelmed and disoriented, wondering what to do next or how to progress (I'm looking at you, Stellaris) but here it was easy to dive in and make decent progress right away without worrying too much about the intricacies
All the items you collect and the weapons and abilities and everything else are there on the side, waiting for you to gradually discover and use them at your own pace
Like a child on Christmas day, it's not necessary to play with all your toys at once, you have all year to enjoy them
Anyway, enough of the silly analogies, I'll try to explain how this all works
Please bear with me because I'm a little confused just thinking about it
So first of all you get some cartoon animations, very professional TV-quality stuff, and these characters reappear in story-progression dialogs throughout the game, sometimes with voice acting, other times not (are they going to fill out the missing bits of voice acting later? I dunno)
Then the graphics style changes (think Don't Starve) and you're on the main map area that's a network of pathways connected to town areas and guarded all over the place by enemies
In the towns you can buy and sell items, upgrade weapons, craft things, talk to NPC characters who give you the quests and so forth
Then a pointer appears on the map and you follow it to your quest, battling enemies along the way to clear the paths towards your quest


or anywhere else on the map you want to visit, you don't have to tackle your quests right away
Eventually you'll reach a dungeon entrance
When you enter, the graphics style changes again and you have a free-roaming 3D nicely-lit environment
Here you explore everywhere to pick up items, open chests, discover lore, do some fishing - yes, this is a thing - and decide whether or not to tackle the free-roaming enemies wandering around looking menacing
CombatThis can happen not only on the fixed pathways on the main map, but also when you bump into enemies in the dungeons
It's like two different games but with the same combat
The graphics change yet again, you have your crew on the left and enemies on the right, beat-em-up style
This is the turn-based combat phase
Your characters have health bars and mana bars that get depleted as enemies attack them, and they don't refill after a battle so you have to carefully ration it all
You can tell each character to use normal attacks, healing, special abilities (that use up mana) or even fleeing is an option
The attack animations are great, there's all kinds of burning, bashing, slashing, poisoning, bleeding and fighting shenanigans going on
Once the battle is won, your characters get XP and eventually level up, giving them extra attacks and abilities
GraphicsThere are multiple types of graphics and they're all fantastic
It feels a bit disjointed and chaotic with all the transitions between styles but for me this all adds to the bonkers charm of it all
You'll certainly never accuse this game of being boring or samey, as it hurls bananas at you from the sidelines
When you press the menu button there's a big book with eight different tabs neatly displaying all the various stats, crafting items, quests, lore and everything else you need to know about your game progress
See, there is method to all this madness!DifficultyIt will become difficult at some point I'm sure
The enemies are becoming tougher and I'm levelling up to meet the challenges ahead
However, I don't think it's the type of game where you'll ever get stuck and not be able to progress one way or another because there are so many different avenues and methods to explore
Encounter a tough barrier? Forget it and try something else
By the time you come back to it you will have levelled up and be able to deal with it more effectively
Steam48 achievements - like I said, there's plenty to get your teeth into here - Trading Cards and Steam Cloud
At time of writing, Linux support has been a yes and then a no, so not sure
More chaos haha! Love it!ValueIt has a pretty steep price tag but you're getting a lot for your money
Not only is it top quality in all departments, but there are loads of those departments! Whatever game genre you're a fan of, there's something here for you - crafting, beat-em-ups, turn-based strategy, open world discovery, you name it
It's like several games rolled into one
I'd pay full price for it, no problem
VerdictI'm sure that once I build up some more experience the game will eventually develop into a multi-layered objective-driven, character-levelling challenge
I have to say though, this is one of those rare occasions when I'm loving the game in the early stages before I have any real clue what I'm doing yet
It's a lot of fun right from the start, and can only get better with time

 “Compelling comic Turn-based RPG throwback with fresh mechanics and experience” This analysis is based on latest version which tweaks some issues
So you might expect different criticism from early review or if you're uncomfortable with the length, you can skip to other brief review
PresentationBC: Nightwar is turn-based RPG game from Kickstarter campaign in 2015
Developed by Airship Syndicate using Unity engine
The game represents world of ’90 Joe Madureira’s comic with refreshed JRPG turn-based combat and interesting features
The design is diverse from the comic dialogue and 2D multi-layered world map, shifted into isometric view in dungeon and fully-animated turn based section
It’s subjective design if you enjoy arcanepunk, but well-polished production
---------------------------------------------------------StoryStory of Nightwar serves as a continuation of ’90 popular Battle Chasers series
You don’t need to read comic to understand the story, because Nightwar has its own separate storyline for main characters
Your airship is shot down into one island during your main journey
As you progress through story, you recruit your crew and reveal the dark secret of the island
Every dungeon and landmark has bit of lore and NPC that provide additional background of the world
You also learn character development by bit in cutscene and resting in Inn which is nice touch
The main story isn’t much spectacular, but the writer did great job on dialogue and lore description
Not just because interesting character design, but how well they tie each character with original personality and combat ability which most fit in right place
---------------------------------------------------------Combat and MechanicsThe design of combat system gives strong vibes of old school turn-based RPGs
In-game manual and UIs are friendly for newbie as you gain access more advanced skills and perks by leveling and visiting NPCs
In combat, each turn allows you to perform 3 main options (Actions / Abilities / Burst)
Actions are instant action with overcharge bonus
Abilities are advanced actions that require casting time
“Overcharge” serves as temporary mana (action point) or enhance some abilities depends on how much overcharge you have
This unique mechanic adds layer of combat and encourage player to analyze their best output of next turn
Finally, Burst is ultimate skills that can turn the tide, but require gauge gain by performing action
Every basic action and skill has extra function (buff, debuff, etc
) and designed on purpose to be support by some perks or chained combo skill
Even character stats do matter, to boost chance of extra turn or completely evade the attack
It’s combination of well-design elements and emphasizes player’s experiment which can be huge advantaged in most encounters
Progression allows freedom of playstyle based on you build
No holding hand to specific method, but encourage you to try out all 6 different playable character (assigned as 3-man party)
You can extend based existing skills or create hybrid characters by simply switching perks and enhancement which I personally love this dynamic design
Moreover, each action is well animated and gives you strong feedback
--------------------------------------------------------- Supporting Features BC: Nightwar doesn’t have a large world, but it’s dense with complexity and side features
Dungeon design is distinguished from each other with polished details, logical puzzles, and randomization
Debuff from traps will carry over the combat and events will offers you random loots or bonus
You can use character’s dungeon skill to gain initial advantage in combat as well
Teleport cube in dungeon is a nice touch, allow you to insert weapon and search where the cube is teleported
You gain higher grade weapon as reward
Crafting and enchanting are simple but fixable, missing ingredient give you lower chance of success and excess materials can craft higher grade item
Bestiary contains information of all enemies (stats, drop, special move), it’s a small feature but motivate player to hunt and gain beast perk as permanent party bonus
Fishing is optional fun mini-game as you trade fish for Shadow Coin (special currency to trade special item, skins, and perk books)
Even you dislike fishing; Shadow Coin can still be obtained via dungeon, special enemies, and side quests
---------------------------------------------------------Sound / MusicFrom the character action to enemy movement, BC: Nightwar delivers fantastic and satisfied sound design
Great overall voice acting even the game isn’t fully voice acting which miss opportunity for other interesting dialogues
Atmospheric soundtracks by talented Jesper Kyd and Clark Powell fit properly in each area (subjective)
---------------------------------------------------------The FlawsWhile the combat is by far strongest point
BC: Nightwar suffers from inconsistent difficulty due to awkward enemy design
The level has an impact in combat
Fighting with higher 1-2 level foes can be really rough due to damage scale
Same-leveled foes in mid game can take character down by 1-2 action
This quite unfair design as you forced to grind to access better perk and gears
Legendary difficult in dungeon can be challenge, but mostly rewards under leveled items once you revisit and might give you unsatisfied accomplish
It’s issue that breaks the flow of game progression
The game also lacks of passive leveling process, only active party member will gain EXP from combat
So, you might expect grinding if you want to try other characters (at least it’s not huge grind compare to some of JRPG), and watch same animation over and over can become tedious
In addition, other issues like lack of key binding, world map description, various enemy type (most are reskin with different abilities), and unmotivated endless arena mode can be discomfort and inconvenient for some players
---------------------------------------------------------PerformanceThis topic is very subjective based on different PC build
The game is made in Unity engine and well-optimized as I experience no fatal bugs / glitches in 80 hrs
of 100% completed playthrough
Delay gap of enemy wave and few frame drops in raining areas are noticeable
---------------------------------------------------------ReplayabilityPost playthrough unlocks New Game+ featuring faster leveling, tougher enemies and Mythical dungeon which give highest great items
You have to start over with level and gear progression, but you keep all skills, perk, beast perk, collectable, and some special items from you first playthrough
If you like this approach, NG+ is best choice for any completionists
---------------------------------------------------------VerdictAlthough, the game structure might be stumble and conflicted at some points, but BC: Nightwar is one of most satisfied experience and entertainment for old school turn-based RPG
Each element is well-designed and fall into place
I recommend anyone who loves JRPG or people who start looking for different RPG experience
The developers are responsive for player feedback and I hope they continue to extend world of Battle Chasers or similar project

												This game is a dream come true, both for myself and many others
You definitely have to be an RPG enthusiast and love the turn based combat thing in order to enjoy this, but that's really the whole point too
The artwork in this game alone is worth the price
Fantastic game
			
Posted: 11 June
												This game is a masterpiece
Yes, it's imperfect, and has defaults, but if it reaches you, it goes deep, and you're not likely to forget it
Ever
On that somewhat random chance, I recommand this game
Now, let's talk about perfection and imperfection
Starting by imperfection, to act as a fair warning :- the technical aspect of the game seems not quite on par with what's expected nowadays, and by that, I mean that many people have reported technical issues going from annoying to making the game unplayable
Myself, I stumbled unto two main problems : white screen of death when starting the game, solved by updating my graphic drivers, and a couple random crashes
So I guess I was lucky to get into the "just annoyed" gang
- the game is not accessible
Many people state that it can be played whitout having played the first NIER, and while it is kinda true, the world's background is awesome, and knowing at least the synopsis of the previous game increases the overall experience a LOT
In the same spirit, the game has no auto-save feature, but a hard and old savepoints system, that unlocks only after the first 45 minutes
Yes, it means that you have to sit and play 45 minutes non-stop before saving
The tutorial is minimal, and thus you can easily die during those 45 minutes before having the chance to learn how to control the game
However, this "questionnable" decision is in fact deeply rooted in the core design of the game
It's one clear exemple of "immersion over practicality"
While I criticize it, I also encourage you to accept it and push through, as it is really worth it
To sum it up : yes, this game will require some efforts from your side, perhaps more than what it should, and certainly not what we're accustomed to nowadays
Even so, it's worth it, because now I'll talk about maybe not perfection, but greatness
- graphically, I always place art design and coherence above technical prowess
You can criticize the graphics all you want, but the art design is top-notch, and I'm not only talking about the fanservicy first look of the game, but about the quality of pretty much everything else, from character design to animations
The style is well-define and brings something special, an identity to the title
- but that identity wouldn't be complete without the beautiful soundtrack, one of the best I've ever heard, one that will stick with you for a long time, akin to the legendary Ghost in the Shell theme, if you happen to know it
That's the kind of soundtrack you have here
- after the look and the sound, we have the gameplay, and let me tell you that it's a stunning achievement
Nier Automata provides one of the most customizable experience I know, combined with thematic reflexions about the video game medium
Just that
Yes, you can over-level and make the game incredibly easy


but you can also just select a harder difficulty, and/or not use certain core interface element like showing your life bar
Platinium Games has a very good reputation for crafting action combat, and they do deliver here with a very satisfying amount of weapon and skills that you can combine in different playstyles, and just watching your character fight is a feast for the eyes
Now, just let me ramble a bit about people complaining about the difficulty,  at any point of the game
There is no difficulty achievement
With the amount of care this game has been made, it's not an oversight
It's just that you, the player, have to choose how you are playing
I'll admit, there is no in-game guide about it, it comes from tweaks you have to make
Will I go for all the side-quests? Will I farm the best items? Will I play in Very Hard? Only one answer : try it until you find your style, and if you're not happy, push through, and make your own rules
So rarely have you that amount of freedom over your experience
- and finally, the story
While it may not be the best, the narration in itself is very well done, and is articulated around twists and revelations
And yes, it may seem artificial and even weak at times
But that's not even what's the most important about it
Because this story touches philosophy
Not the kind you find in books, but the kind you stumble on when you stop your everyday life to think a bit about your life and your place in the universe
Sure, there are references to known philosophers, but the philosophic and metaphysics thoughts and concepts presented are not dry and complex, they're intertwined in the narrative, making them much more accessible, and engaging
This, imho, is the biggest achievement of Nier Automata
It's showing that entertainment can be thought-provoking, that video games, and Games in general, ARE important, and have a rightful place alongside other forms of Arts, like literature or film-making
So, yes, I genuinely think this is a masterpiece, and hope it will have a big impact on the gaming industry
Because there have already been incredible video games in the past, but never with that amount of self-awareness
This game is a weird case of fulfilled ambition without pretense, and one last time, I encourage you to look past the imperfections
Yes, it's worth it

I couldn't stop playing it 'till i'd seen and done everything
It's incredibly good fun to play, the combat is fast and fluid, the backstory is different and interesting, the art design is top notch and the soundtrack alone is worth admission
There are so many unique and well thought out ideas it's clear to see just how much real effort the developers put in
Even the end credits has more care put into them than some entire games i've played in the past, seriously!I highly recommend Nier: Automata, even at full price

Resolution is not locked at 1080p! FPS capped at 60
Just a quick heads-up for people on the fence because of a possible resolution lock: There seems to be none!  (to a maximum of 4k at least) I'm able to play the game at 2560x1440 without problems
There is a 60fps cap! Fixing the Fullscreen Resolution BugSome users report problems with the full screen mode
If you have problems running the game fullscreen with your intended resolution, try the small application called Borderless Gaming
You can find it on github
Run the game in Windowed Mode and select Nier: Automata in the tool
Voila, you are playing the game in Borderless Windowed mode now! Until SE provides a fix for Fullscreen, use this tool
It's easy and quick
PerformanceDespite the Fullscreen Bug, the port seems to be running smoothly and at a steady 60fps! I'm playing with a GTX 980ti, so it should be expected to run fine
(I had no problems with the resolution and fullscreen, it seems to vary between systems
) Screenshot of the resolution settings: http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885288152Controls & Keyboard SettingsIt is possible to configure and remap Keyboard settings
I didn't try to play it with keyboard, but it seems pretty straight forward and it is customizable
Still, a controller is recommended, since the game was designed around it
Screenshot of the Keyboard settings: http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885313706Gameplay & MusicThe music in this game will leave you speechless
Like in the first Nier, the music in this game is a real treat
Almost every track has multiple versions
The game even changes the music "layers" during boss fights and events to sync it with the fight! It enhances the experience tenfold
A similar technique was used in Metal Gear Rising aswell, which is another game by Platinum
I will update my review regarding the gameplay later
There are more than enough reviews up from the PS4 version, which was released almost 2 weeks ago
Look it up! But i can assure you, its top notch!

I am not going to comment much about the DLC, as this is a review for the game, not the DLC
Yes, I think the price of the DLC is fairly high, but the DLC is optional and not needed to enjoy the game
I still think the game itself is worth getting without purchasing the DLC
How it Runs:Game runs great on highest settings at 1920 x 1080 resolution, I get 60 FPS no problem
Overall, I haven't had any issues with slowdown or framerate drops that I usually see on the console versions
The loading times are also pretty quick compared to the console versions as well without a solid state drive
Game Settings:Resolution: 1920 x 1080Texture Filter: HighQuality Settings: All HighVsync: 1Note: I had to set my resolution in the configuration instead of within the game
(See specs at bottom of page)Story:The story is based off the Romance of the Three Kingdoms historical novel, but since it is a video game they have fantasy elements and change some things to make it more exciting
The Story Mode has a bunch of cinematics before and after battles that help tell the story and they are alright for this type of game
Graphics:The graphics seem to be based on the PS3 version of the game, but they still look better than the PS3 version due to higher framerate, resolution, and I think they added a few things in the graphic options that make them look a bit better
Overall the graphics are average for a console port of a game, but the gameplay is the best part of the Dynasty Warriors series
Gameplay:Those who know the Dynasty Warriors series will be familar with the hack and slash gameplay
You can control a hero from a roster of 82 characters, each with their own individual design
The game is mostly about using weapon attack combos to defeat hundreds of enemies and other officers through battles in the game
There is a lot of flashy effects for the weapon attacks and special musou attacks which make the game more exciting
You can obtain new weapons to equip your warriors with and each warrior can use two weapons and switch between them in battle
You also can level up each warrior to level 150
There are story missions for the three major kingdoms (Wei, Wu, Shu), and the Jin and Lubu forces
As well as a Free Mode to replay story and other battles, a Challenge mode that has arcade type battles, and Ambition mode where you can upgrade a camp and conquer territories
Conclusion:I purchased the game because I am a fan of the Dynasty Warriors series and I don't own a PS3 or PS4, so I can't get Xtreme Legends unless I pay $50 for this on Steam or go out and buy a PS3 or PS4 and pay $60 for the PS4 version or $70+ for the PS3 bundle
The graphics seem fine to me, they aren't amazing, but they aren't bad either
I played the Xbox 360 version of DW8 and they seem to be a bit better, but the graphics aren't as important as gameplay with the series
Online multiplayer would've been a good bonus feature, but I don't think its a mandatory feature for the series
I have never played online in the past titles, I usually play solo or split screen
If you need to have online multiplayer then pick up the PS4 version instead
The game has been running great and I haven't had any technical issues yet
Only complaints:- DLC is now avaiable, but the price is a bit high (though the DLC is optional and not needed to enjoy the game)- Would be nice to see controller buttons instead of keyboard buttons when using a controller
- Depending on controller may need to remap your controls
Overall it is a good game if you are Dynasty Warriors fan or someone who likes hack and slash games
It is cheaper to buy the PC version (North America - USD) than the console version as well which is a plus
Should be glad they brought Dynasty Warriors 8 game to Steam!Update 1: There seems to be some people having issues with the game crashing, freezing, not starting up, etc
I haven't encountered any of these issues yet, game has been running perfect on my machine
However, I would check out the forums for more information about known technical issues if you think you may have a problem
Update 2: It seems many people are upset with the high DLC prices
These prices are very similar to the console versions, so its not just a PC thing
I do think the prices are too high, but the DLC is completely optional and not needed to enjoy the game
I would suggest waiting for a sale and only picking up some of the better DLCs (Weapon Packs / Stage Packs)
Note: I would recommend using a controller when playing this game

But be warned, may contain many deaths to Lu Bu
Only gripe so far is the lack of online multiplayer, but, if you want to play a game you know and love, you can look past this

												Only a quick review on launch day with a couple hours played
It is a good port in pc performance and game play, but there are a couple problems first no multiplayer, hopefully the devs will respond to the backlash on this soon rather then just ignoring it, and the texture quality is pretty poor, to the point where cut scenes were laughable, but in battle its mostly unnoticeable thanks to the flashy effects
Overall I'd recommend waiting for a sale or a price drop especially if you already own it on another system
If they add in online co-op then it will totally be worth full price!

												Where do I begin? I played some Dynasty Warriors game as a child on my playstation that I have pretty much no recollection of other then being confused
I see all the hype about hyrule warriors and get an itch, I see this game on steam and it has pretty good reviews, so I buy it, then suddenly almost 100 hours later into the game and I'm not done with it, what the heck it's fantastic
It's pure and simple dynasty warriors with an outrageous amount of content
If you have no love at all for the series or this type of game you won't have much fun, but for anyone looking and unsure of curious I implore you to get this game you will not be disapointed by the amount of content at the very least

												People complaining about controls are ignorant
The only weird thing is that B(Circle) is confirm and A(Cross) Is back
Easy fix is to simply switch these two buttons and everything is cheeky
Only "Problem" is that B(Circle) is now used to jump but it isn't much of a bother
Im using a regular PS4 controller but I also tested input mapper and it worked just the same
TL:DR Controls are easily changes, definitely a great buy at $15 for some good ol hack and slash chinese drama

												I got this game on a whim because I once played this series like


a decade ago
DW3/4 to be specific
And even though I know full well that this sort of game is basically meant for consoles, I managed to play it just fine once I adjusted the key bindings to stuff that worked well for me
Anyway


game
If, like me, you have played these games before, you pretty much know what you are in for
If you have never played any of these games, I'm not quite sure what else is quite like it
Basically it's a fighting game, except it is on large battlefield maps where you murder thousands of random and a handful of named NPC's while following objectives in order to complete each level
If that sounds repetitive


well it can certainly be that
It's the ultimate hack and slash-fest game, and if you get bored with murdering insane numbers of enemies, then chances are this game is not for you
The game is based upon the Three Kingdoms era of Ancient China (184-280, roughly), and, despite the absurd outfits and personalities of many of the characters in the game, it is actually fairly consistent with what is known about the period
Or rather, it is consistent with the famous novel 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' by Luo Guanzhong, which is basically a work of historical fiction that takes real events and bends them a bit according to the whims and views of the author
Which, of course, means that certain characters (particularly Shu-Han characters like Xuande/Liu Bei) are depicted as noble honorable sorts fighting for justice while others (like Mengde/Cao Cao) are depicted as villanous and driven by ambition
I don't want to dig too deep into this because there most likely are entire books written about how Luo Guanzhong messed around with the characters, but the depictions he made are pretty much what are found in this and all previous DW games
The nice thing though is that if you read between the lines (or maybe it's just because I am very familiar with the source material this game is based off of), you can see the flaws in the author's bias in the game as well
Namely that Liu Bei was a massive hypocrite every bit as ambitious as his rivals, and that Cao Cao, while not exactly the nicest guy around, wasn't the hellspawn other characters (like Liu Bei) called him
Anyway, the game follows the story decently well, though some creative license and trimming down obviously has happened
I still liked how the game depicted things most of the time
Perhaps my favorite was Lu Bu's campaign which, while maintaining the massive "OMG ITS LU BU" hype that all DW games have had, reveals exactly why the real Lu Bu got himself executed in chapter 19 of a 120 chapter book: that he was dumb as a brick, betrayed people constantly, and never listened to anyone's advice
While the old DW games I played did have storylines for him, they didn't take the historical route that this game's (default) story path takes
The same goes for the numerous character deaths shown, though many of these are made more dramatic than they actually were
Also, while the playable character cast has increased to the point of total insanity (including some that may not have even existed or actually fought on battlefields), I did like that, in the time between DW4 and this, they added a number of characters that rounded out the cast further by including some of the other lesser-known strategists (Chen Gong, Lu Su) and characters who rose to prominence in the later parts of the story (Deng Ai, the sons of Guan Yu/Zhang Fei, as well as the entire Jin faction who were the ultimate winners of this whole mess)
I thought that was a nice treat since these sorts had been badly neglected in past games, where everything seemed to stop at the year 234 (when Kongming/Zhuge Liang died), which was roughly the chronological halfway point of the entire story
Ok, I better stop and just finish this up
In short, It's a DW game
That means that on the one hand, the combat gets repetitive, many of the characters are very hard to take seriously, and many of the story events are overdramatized to the point of being kind of ridiculous
On the other hand, there is a MASSIVE amount of content (and all those DLC's for this "Complete Edition" are purely cosmetic), big battles are kind of fun, and one can even argue that the storyline's inherent cheesiness may actually be more a positive than a negative
If you have never played one of these games before, this is the one i'd look at because (to my knowledge) it's the newest one and has an insane amount of content even compared to its predecessors
If you have played these and liked them before


why not? If you didn't like these games however, then most likely this will do nothing to change your opinion
For all it's goofiness and repetition, DW is still entertaining enough for me to waste sizeable amounts of time with it
Hooray and stuff

												This is one of the last games Square made before edgy protagonists dressed in more zippers than an airplane's luggage compartment and bad voice acting took over
If your only experience with Final Fantasy has been with the sci-fi influenced titles like VII, you might be in for a bit of a surprise, but if you played any of the SNES era titles, you'll be in familiar territory
Even during its original release in 2000, FFIX is a throwback to the more traditional Final Fantasy titles and the golden age of JRPGs
To start, FFIX was not ported the same way as FFVII and FFVIII
Those two titles had PC releases back in the day, and the Steam version is just a patched and updated version of their PC releases, complete with localization errors and minor differences from the Playstation titles
FFIX, on the other hand, is a complete port in Unity of the original Playstation release with minor graphical updates to the UI and textures to facilitate both a PC and mobile release
This means that you have the original Playstation audio and controller-friendly input, unlike VII and VIII
The first thing you'll notice about this game is the artwork
Even after 17 years, it has aged remarkably well
I do wish for a few more pixels of resolution in the pre-rendered backgrounds, but the world is still beautiful
Square did touch up some a lot of the textures for the in-game models, and they still blend quite well with the world
Unfortunately, due to the nature of the pre-rendered backgrounds, you're locked into a horrible 4:3 screen ratio, and Square decided to mock us all by adding ridiculous textured bars on either side of the screen to emphasize the fact
After that, the next thing you'll notice is just how slow combat is, particularly at the beginning of the game
It does get better as your characters level up and become faster, but it is definitely an exercise in patience at times
They manage to redeem themselves because the battle mechanics are well-refined
They are simple enough for a child to grasp them but still encourage strategy and experimentation
The characters are very likable
They exhibit a level of character development and growth that you don't typically find in video gaming, which makes the story that much more immersive
Even after years of playing this game, Steiner's little fits and tantrums make me smile, and I still find Vivi's realizations about life and mortality quite moving
The story itself is a little on the weird side
If you were expecting something normal, you shouldn't be playing JRPGs
That being said, it is enjoyable and significantly less convoluted than what you find in some of the other Final Fantasy titles (VIII, anyone?)
You'll probably be more weirded out by the fact that Queen Brahne looks like a blue Jabba the Hutt in drag than you will over any particular element of the story
Value-wise, it's a pretty good deal
You can get from start to finish in under twelve hours (it's the only way to get a particular weapon, in fact), but you're more likely to take twenty to thirty hours on your first playthrough, possibly more if you decide to go through all the sidequests, and it's enough fun to play that I've been able to replay it multiple times and enjoy it each time
If you're on the fence about buying the game, just cough up the dough and get it
It's probably better than the other game you were looking at

												T-they didn't mess it up
I cry tears and rainbows
Already tried it on mobile, so it was easier for me
- Not ported, but adapted
You can click on different places on the field to move your character for example
- Quick save of some sort
Works like a checkpoint system or something like this, not entirely sure
I just turned off the game occasionally without saving and when I turned it back on I just hit "continue" and it placed me on the start of the last screen I've visited
- New screen where you name your character
It looks good, I liked that
- Music
It is just original FF9 score in same quality that PSone version had
Not that botched ff7-ff8 piece of s~
This one is personal, so I put it last
Great game
100 impressed nobles

												TL;DR: Every long-life gamer has that particular game considered life-changing
To me, Final Fantasy IX is that game
And to me, this is the best game that a life being have ever crafted
Yes, I say “life being”, not “human”, because I’m assuming aliens have their own videogames
But they won’t be as good as Final Fantasy IX
---------------Okay, here comes a very long review
I’ve been waiting this for so long
First of all, completely ignore my time count on Steam for this game
I’ve put 1000h+ into it, and I can easily make a perfect run by memory
Do you know that particular favorite movie you watch every single year? Well, I do that but with this game
I have SO many things to comment about this game
And I need to spread them
For those who are new into the franchise, Final Fantasy IX was a big contrast compared to the close older and newer games
Yes, they kept the turn-based battles
Yes, most of the same people worked for it
Yes, it’s considered to be part of the golden era of Square Enix
But let’s look closer to see the main differences:Firsly, and probably the first thing to notice, is that characters are more cartoon-based
They’re not that sort of adults anymore and some of them even have a very funny, friendly looking
The world’s aesthetics also changed a lot
Final Fantasy titles are famous for combining magic and fantasy features with metallic, cyberpunk machines
FFIX crushed that second part and  they put an antique, more steampunk-like background instead of the actual machines
The last big noticeable feature is that the class and battle system went back to the deep basics, where characters have their unique role and can only fight strictly to that [for instance, on FFVII every character could cast anything if the skill (a
k
a Materia) was properly equipped]
And now that I’ve just summarized the most basic info about FFIX… Welcome… TO THE MOST UNDERRATED TITLE OF THE WHOLE FRANCHISE!That’s right
This game has been so irrationally denied, it makes me question humanity’s future
For Christ’s sake, even Square itself seems to be OK about forgetting this game! Lately, many hidden fans have appeared out of nowhere stating that this is their favorite FF game, but I’m not OK with this
Too late
You joined too late
The damage is already done and this title will probably never be on the top for most people
So I’ll put this game as the most underrated one
Forever
As a vivid fan of the franchise, let me tell you something: I will NEVER understand why so many people put FFVII on Top 1
I’ve beaten that game for like 10 times already, and the question keeps coming to me every time
Have you paid attention on what you’ve played? For its year, the game was very good but the amount of flaws it has (even story-related) is just infinite
When rating a classic game, it’s just a failure when someone puts 90% nostalgia & 10% trying-to-be-objective review as their analyses
That being said, I’ll try to detail every worth-mention thing about this game and why I think it has been so underrated
Here we go
THE STORYI’m pretty sure many people didn’t understand it
I’m not telling any proper detail for spoiler avoiding, but the story starts being pretty simplistic and easy to follow but the more you progress through it, the more complex it gets
It gets so complex at the end most people don’t understand the final boss! I guess Japanese narrators love to make those sort of mindf*cks
With that in mind, let me tell you something: this is the only game that has managed to make me cry
I’ve never ever seen in any other game a party of characters that evolve and mentally grow as hugely as they do in FFIX
Everything is connected, from start to finish, and during your journey you’ll clearly see how much impact their personalities have onto both circumstances and other characters
Everyone has their way to see things, their values, and their past justifying their present and future actions… and somehow they all manage to change and mature
I swear this game teaches SO MANY life values through their characters
Along with the characters, the story flows in a world that feels extremely alive and varied
Every place is just so different from the previous one
Finally, the story is long
Very long considering how short most games are nowadays
In case you don’t know, this game was separated into 4 CD’s on the PSX version, and in a blind run it can perfectly provide 40-60h, depending on how much you want to explore and how many secrets you want to discover
THE MUSICIt’s Nobuo Uematsu
And I could finish like this
I mean, come on
It’s one of the most iconic video game composers
How do you expect to be the music? With hundreds of tracts, FFIX soundtrack is just over the top and unique, and together with its partners (VI, VII, VIII, X…) it will be one of the most remarkable soundtracks from PSX
Ever
THE CHARACTERSMy god, where to start… As I have stated before, this game has some of the most powerful characters in the franchise, by far
All of them feel extremely unique and relevant, and you will PERFECTLY follow their progress and grow during the story
It is just amazing to see how varied every personality is, and how much impact it can bring to the plot
You might not like one particular way of thinking, but soon enough you’ll realize it’s there to make you think; everyone is different and we all have different points of view
And they have to be relevant
And yes, they are in FFIX
Just see all Vivi’s maturation and I dare you, I double f*cking dare you; I dare you to tell me you haven’t learnt anything from it
Also, I want to highlight some aspects as well: Those are NOT your conventional Square Enix characters
That’s right
The main character (Zidane) is not the emo, cold-blooded guy from the famous FF games
Instead, it’s one of the first main characters of the franchise that constantly share optimism to his crew; stays on their side; puts himself and his life on risk (even when he knows he can’t do everything) to save the others, even people he doesn’t know, and he doesn’t hesitate to do so
Last but not least: the main villain is acclaimed to be one of the best of the franchise (together with Kefka)
No more super-emo guys; this is the kind of cynic who’s always a step forward and who loves to make fun of the rest
THE UNDERRATINGSSo why is this game so underrated? To be honest, I don’t fully know
I know the reasons that puts this game on top but not why it’s been that ignores for the media
Maybe the fact that every character has their unique role in fighting was not that appealing to people? Something I don’t understand either
To me, that makes MUCH more sense rather than seeing a brute-force guy casting a summon spell
Really
Maybe the friendly look of the characters? Is this seriously a con to you? They look amazing to me, and definitely much better than all those weeaboo-jpop-like characters Square keeps doing in the recent games
Maybe because it has no futuristic machines? In that case you’re just a close-minded person
And you definitely can’t appreciate how magnificent some places (like Lindblum) are
Maybe the story looked boring to you? Then there’s no doubt you didn’t understand it
It is INFINITE TIMES more robust than FFVII storyline, and definitely way more polished, and interesting
Seriously stop overhyping that game
In the end, every time I replay this game I start it with a feeling of “meh, I’m sure I love it because of nostalgia”
But that banishes when I reach the credits
This is still the best game I’ve ever played in my entire life, and I’ve played THOUSANDS, and completed about 700 probably
So go and buy it, see what I mean, experience this masterpiece and overall enjoy every minute of it

												My favorite episode of the Final Fantasy saga
Full of magic, dragons, princess, queen, knights, secrets, romance, funny scenes, lovely soundtrack (!), awesome story, and much more
What else would you want from a fantasy game?I played this 16 years ago and I'm playing it again, planning to complete it
If you never played this, don't look at the graphic, it's an old game yes but it will last more than the 10 hours game they sell nowdays and you will never forget it
If you already played it? Well, play it again, enjoy it again, you grew up, it will be a different experience

												I started this game in the year 2000 on PS1, got about 30% of the way through and lost my save
I have been wanting to play it all the way through since then, and this enhanced released proved to be the perfect opportunity for that
After completing it, I can say that this is without a doubt the best Final Fantasy game ever created
The story has so much heart, the visuals were ahead of their time, and the music is absolutely phenomenal
If you only play one Final Fantasy game ever, play this one
Performance:The game has never looked better
HD cinematics are pretty, backgrounds seem slightly upscaled, and the new character models look great and true to form
Both keyboard/mouse and controller setups are supported
Mouse support for menus and movement
Controls can be remapped
New features (like auto save) and boosters
Best of all, it's stable
I'm happy
Now let's get XV on here and I'll be even happier! ;)9

												This was one of my favorite games for the PS1
:)It's an awesome RPG with characters that grow on you
Each one has a very interesting background story that will have you remembering them for years to come
I'm happy to see this is a perfect port of the original with added extras: HD character models, great support for mouse & keyboard, optional cheats and the Steam achievements are a nice bonus, too
:)There was one concern that had me holding my breath, remembering the quality for the music of FF7 and FF8 for PC was stripped down from their PS1 version, I was concerned that the same would happen with FF9, but thankfully it stayed true to the PS1 version
:DIf you have never played FF9, then you really should give it a try
You will love the story, the characters and the locations you visit
It's a beautiful fantasy world filled with life that will have you exploring and looking at everything and appreciating the detail instead of just running through it
Also, back when this was released for PS1, this was THE GAME to get if you ever dated a girl who didn't like playing video games and wanted to get them into that
5 minutes into this game and they were hooked and taking over your PS1 to play
xDAh, good times

												It's FFIX - On STEAM! The lack of true widescreen support is disappointing but understandable
The 30fps lock is disappointing but understandable
The mobile UI? Atrocious! The price? Too high! But the HD character models look great (even if they clash with the hand drawn backgrounds
The HD cutscenes look great (even if they are letterboxed) and the new options are fun to play with
At the end of the day - it's FFIX on PC
It looks great, plays well, runs good and I'm just happy to have it
It's a great experience
Hopefully mods will make it an even better experience on PC

												I shall clarify I am a person who's spent over 2,000 hours in VX Ace, I have a VX Ace game on Steam (Close Your Eyes), and for my projects, most, if not all, of the assets are created by myself and a partner, so some of the issues people have with RTP stuff not coming until a later date don't bother me
What RPG Maker MV has done though is make a number of changes to the RPG Maker program that I'm loving
I've spent 40+ hours in MV at the time of writing and have been making a little community Halloween game on a stream
Some of the changes to MV are very appreciated both from a developer and a player viewpoint
At first it seems quite similar to VX Ace, and indeed those who've spent a lot of time with Ace will probably immediately feel right at home, but the layout has been made overall easier, with new shortcuts around the window to access things easily and quicker, and the documentation included with MV is easy to find and more helpful and detailed than previous entries, in my opinion
The first thing about anyone using the program compared to previous versions may notice, or anyone who's played RPG Maker games in general may notice, is that the default tiles and window resolution are much larger than previous entries (for a VX Ace comparison, VX Ace used 32x32 tiles, and the default window was 544x416, with the maximum resolution it could obtain being 640x480
Meanwhile, MV by default has 48x48 tiles and the tile sizes can be changed through scripting to any size you want really, and with a default resolution of 816x624, but can easily make HD resolutions and even reach 4k resolutions with some plug-ins if you really wanted to, though you'd need to design maps with that in mind )
And something I deeply appreciate on the user-side is now RPG Maker MV games can be resized manually; clicking the sides of the screen of an MV game will allow you to re-size the window, scaling the game to the window while also not ruining aspect ratio
Helpful for those in the past who hated the unchangably small window of past RPG Makers with only fullscreen as a usual alternative; now windows can be made any size manually
Mapping is the next big thing people may notice a difference in compared to VX Ace
While Ace eliminated some of VX's mapping restrictions, MV basically abolishes VX Ace's restrictions in turn
You can now easily tile things from the B/C/D/E/etc tilesets over each other while mapping, and can via plug-ins make infinite layers and far higher sheets per tileset if you desire
And also as a result of the tiles being bigger, mapping also has gained an edge in ease, in my opinion
To get this point out of the way: Plug-Ins
They're replacement to scripts in MV which use Javascript as opposed to Ruby (which the past iteration used), while MV needs time in the oven to have more publicly available plug-ins for the masses, how they are implemented are a lot better than scripting was, in my opinion
The restrictions on the engine being removed does aid this for more versatility, and the overall easier and more common language of Javascript is already doing wonders of accessible plug-ins and coding
There's definite promise this element will only grow with time and with people sharing their output
Being able to call, turn on and off, and easily modify Plug-Ins, as well as implement them into MV easier than scripts were to VX Ace, all help ease of use
Speaking of ease of use, the ability to edit your game while play-testing is a huge time saver and helps the play-testing process immensely, as does being able to trigger and change variables, switches, and nodes easily while play-testing through the press of a button (press F8 while play-testing to access the developer console, F9 to access a menu to turn switches on/off)
Some misc notes on MV: The mouse/touch controls for MV are well-implemented and I've found myself using them while play-testing
Some small things, like events finally being able to easily walk over other events, are very much appreciated details
The audio system the game uses sounds a lot crisper to me than previous iterations, and the fade-out/pitch/other audio effects sound different compared to how VX Ace handled them, but I think they're an improvement
Also for some reason, the included RTP music in MV is really good, like leagues above previous iterations
There's a lot more music than usual, and they have much better production quality, and a lot of it is pretty catchy, actually
The plug-in to let users configure mouse/gamepad controls with full implementation is a godsend
On the RTP, it's also nice to no longer need to include it in exported files and raise game file sizes by a few hundred MBs
And a huge draw for me behind the engine as well is it being easy to make a version for Mac computers, having friends and people asking for my previous games on Mac, this is appreciated
There's also HTML5 and Mobile support, but as of the time of writing they currently need a bit more work to get going, but not advanced knowledge to accomplish and the documentation on how is done well
The multiple platforms, Javascript coding/Plug-Ins, and the resolution thing are probably the three biggest things for the engine, but a lot of the small touches to mapping/events/layering/audio and ease of use improvements have made this a very positive experience for myself thus far
I've heard some have been having slow-down issues, if they can sort that out for people with the problem then we'll be perfect, and those who use the RTP will be happy when the full RTP collection is eventually released later, but I have to say this has been an improvement in a number of ways over VX Ace for me, and I plan to switch full on to this from Ace

												I don't typically write reviews, but I think I should write a simple one for RPG maker
This product has been an excellent introduction into the game-making realm
I have had the desire to create stories and games for a long time, and finding this software has served as the perfect bridge to close the gap between my dreams and the realization of those dreams
This sofware comes with the basics to get started and produce a working game
Now being who I am, I like to make things complicated, or rather more elaborate
With this approach to creating things, it makes things extremely difficult because I am not usually satisfided with the standard assets of game mechanincs, so it was to my great delite to find that there was a community of many wonderful individuals who were willing to help produce new assets, guide users and solve problems
So in summary, what I am trying to say is that this software is very flexible for beginers to advanced users, and I hope that  the community for it continues to grow and evolve so that more great games can be created and enjoyed

												WARNING
LONG REVIEW TL;DR AT YOUR OWN DISCRETIONSo
You want to create a RPG and maybe even sell it? You're in the right place
First thing you want to know
It's not going to be easy
I mean, it's "easy" to learn and even easier if you have programming related knowledge but you still need creativity + to spend tons of hours investigating about the Maker and playing around with the Maker
So be prepared to take some basic programming courses (Or at least search what it's a flowchart and how they work)
Let's assume that by this point you know the basics of the Maker and you've might or not finished your first "game"
You've may noticed that the resources of this Maker (as awesome as they are) are


somewhat limited
Maybe you want to make your game more awesome or maybe you want more control of what you can do inside the Maker 
Fear not young enthusiast, the Internet is here to save you
With enough Google-fu you'll find resources (Generator Parts, Sprites, Tilesets, Music, Pictures, Plugins) that will make your game look and function better (Hail ol' mighty forums!) 
If your intention is to create a game for the fun of it or just to show it to your friends you'll find yourself looking at the "Free for non commercial use" or "Free for non commercial use with credits" lines in the resources
What does that mean? It means you can use those resources without the need of giving money or asking for them
Now, the thing is


if you go for a Commercial Release (A
K
A Wanting to make $ with your game) you'll find youself searching for the "Free for commercial use" line if you don't want to spend a cent in resources or buying them if you really feel like your game would need those resources if that message is not there
Alternatively, if you have the skills (And Will) to create your own and unique game (Using your own resources) you can do it + learning JavaScript will help you to code your own plugins if you don't like the current ones or it just happened that there's no plugin that does what you want to do
TL;DR: LEARN, EXPERIMENT AND DO ITNow, onto the final part of the review
Why you should buy this Maker? Pros:+ JavaScript + Export to Android, MAcOS, iOS and Web (HTML5)+ Actual Character Generator that doesn't make Lovecraftian beings like VX Ace+ Your game can now be in HD+ Mouse support (You can move with clicks and stuff)+ A better map editor (Now with 3 layers!)+ Side-view Battle (Now you can see your character fight!)+ Tons of plugins being made as you read this+ Super friendly community (As long as you ACTUALLY took the time to read the basics, don't be THAT guy/girl)Cons:- Export to Android, MAcOS, iOS While the game provides you the instructions to do this it's not precisely click and export like that
It it kinda tedious to do all that, just a warning
*HTML5 isn't like that, you just literally drop your game in a host and you'll be able to play it
- JavaScript?  (Wait, what? Didn't you just said that this was a good thing?)It is a good thing
If you know JavaScript or this is your first Maker
But for others that've been using Ruby from previous Makers it isn't
There might be people that think this change was for good, there might be others that do not believe so
(I believe  this change was for good)Note: This doesn't mean that you can't make an awesome game in previous Makers
Just that some scripts from previous Makers might not be available if the autor did not transform them into JavaScript- Not enough Character Generator parts*This might've been a problem when the Maker came out, but since that, tons of resources have been made in order to satisfy the mayority
Netherless the problem was there once
Welp
That's it
It's up to you to decide if this Maker is the ideal for you
Have fun making games!

												I wholeheartedly recommend RPG Maker MV as a starter software for anyone who is interested in making a game
I see a lot of people who recommend Unity, or Unreal Engine as "easy" tools for beginners, but both of those require a decent coding knowledge of some description (well, Unreal Engine 4 not so much) and on top of that you will need to make your own assets for the game to be high-quality, unless you want to purchase an asset pack off someone else
RPG Maker requires zero coding experience, just patience and understanding
The eventing system, while it takes a bit of time to fully figure out (Self switches and "delete event" commands reset after you change map - I learned that the hard way and had to change a large amount of my story triggers), is very simple to use, but allows for (functionally) limitless possibilities
Improvements over VX Ace, the previous iteration of the software, include (for those interested):- Changing the nightmare-inducing front portrait character generator to a side portrait one, allowing you to create much                                more aesthetically pleasing character portraits
- Native Sideview Battle mode, no longer requiring custom scripting
-Significantly improved OST, with much improved themes for everything
-Javascript instead of Ruby (kind of a big deal, plugins are now able to do a lot more)-Export to pretty much anything (Browser, Android, IOS, Windows etc
) whereas VX Ace only supported Windows (I think)-Modern Tilesets/assets provided with the base game - no more reliance on custom content for a modern-themed RPG
-Various QoL improvements (showing you where the dialog window cuts off when editing, so you don't accidentally have your text not showing properly ingame because you forgot to hit enter)-Native Touch/Mouse control support
If you can't afford it at base price (it is pretty expensive, to be fair) you can wait for a sale, and I'm told that key reseller websites sell it for a much lower price (about 50% cheaper), but use those at your own risk
Either way, this is a brilliant tool for anyone interested in game design, beginner or otherwise
(I might go as far as to say it is the tool to start with for those who are interested in game development but have little/no coding knowledge
Definitely Recommend

												I never really wrote a review in any rpg maker I own considering that I worked a lot on them but I felt like doing one on MV since it had some very disappointing features
Do I recommend this software ? YES and NO Yes if you want to make a game on that genre, and found the software on a really cheap dealNO if you want to create something different, or have good experience with programming and designing
What you can find in MV that didn't exist in all the previous versions is javascript support
It can "Create" Android, web, IOS, Windows games, HOWEVER You have to do ALL The work yourself on converting it to each platform and trust me its a lot of work, you'd have to download and install a lot of environments, then set their paths, then run a CMD with a long code that you get, then wait it to convert it, then test the "APK android for example" Then you open it in your mobile and turns out the resolution and texts are messed up so you have to do it again
Even after doing all those steps you'll probably encounter an issue due to the SDK's updating and you'll spend hours trying to sort it out
Another disappointment was the lack of workshop support
Whats sad is that we finally have mobile support and the software does not support it by itself you do all the work, they did not even include a method to add buttons on the mobile screen or anything, they just simply made it sort of like "Open source" type so the community creates codes to do that, and most of the time those plugins you download online will conflict with other plugins and messes up the game so you'd have to delete them
Then you'd have to find another way to add your customized features, and do it all over again
OVERALL Get this software on a great cheap deal, and use it if you'd want to develop games that follows the genre of this software, otherwise just get game maker studio or anything else if you're already good at designing since that software does not really need any programming experience
Honestly, after I am done with creating the game I am working on I will never touch this software again or any other rpg maker that ever gets released ever, yeah its fun to work with when you're not planning on being a "Serious full-time developer" Because lets face it, this can't create a rogue legacy or nuclear throne or super meat boy, this creates to the moon, lisa and similar stuff which are great games YES but are story dependent since the gameplay is really like every other rpg maker game ever
And if you'd want to become a game developer and want to make a game with this software the buyers would be 95% rpg maker fans, and 5% of those that figured " lets try it looks interesting" And you can't please them by using the default assets and truthfully they look horrible, want to make a game using all default assets ? Thats your choice just don't put it up on steam because then you're just giving the software a bad name
I know I am just ranting here, but seriously this software is for beginners, if you know you're on the intermediate or advanced levels don't use it, no matter how much rpg maker fans say "This software is unlimited" Trust me it is limited as hell, there's only so much you can accomplish, I know what I'm talking about Iv been using it and rpg maker vx ace for a long time don't let my small steam play time fool you, iv been on the forums and saw all sorts of games that I liked and really disliked, but after all they were the same idea, once  you see the game you just know "oh this was made with rpg maker " Why is that ? Because it is in-fact limited, so lets stop bullsh*ting and say it isn't
Only use this if  you want to make a game with no significant gameplay or graphics but a great story, otherwise switch the engine
I Can already see people downvotting the crap out of this review
Updating this just to add that after testing out for a long timeEven when the ability to port your game to android/ios that everyone was so hyped about When I kept doing my projects and converting them to android you wouldn't believe the amount of bug and glitches that still exists " This is written in august/9th/2016 "  So many slow down issues, events goes in different times, videos not playing properly, game keeps freezing and/or endlessly presses the menu button So again they didn't provide a good fix and relying on the community to do it for them in plugins and there's certainly a good deal of those to fix some of the issues but keyword here is "Some" not "all" lets say you made a good game, then decided to port it to android, prepare to spend a really 


really long and painful work just to make it optimized 


otherwise prepare to have so many negative feedback from people with different mobile phones than the one you tested it on

												[LINUX REVIEW]Yes it works, tested on Debian 8, fast and stable
Testplay works, build for Linux works (and it doens't require any library/dependency), build for html5 works (tested with nginx), Steam Workshop works, import works, sound works, high refresh rate (120Hz) works
Well done Devs, solid port and nothing bad no report

												RPGMaker MV is a software that can be leveraged to make your own RPG games when you have limited to no scripting ability
 It touts that you don't need to be an artist


or a programmer


or sound engineer
 All of these resources are built-in for you so that you just need to focus on one thing:  Making a great game
This is true


and it isn't
On the one hand, it's very true
 Within an hour, you can be churning out some cool maps, interesting characters, and nifty combats
 You don't in fact need to program
 The system gives you all the tools you need from a paper-doll character generator (both portraits and associated sprite animations), to a layered tile map
 Tons of assets are already included, and RPGMaker MV offers you a very flexible system to set up events to occur, letting you throw weather, pictures, screen tints, characters, puzzles, and more onto the map
Once the initial honeymoon is over, you start seeing some of the limitations
 The graphics all have to go onto a specific grid, which can make blocky looking maps
 The selection of images starts to feel very limited when you start picking between the green grass or the brown dirt
 You have one type of repeatable tree, and a few token bushes
 Likewise, the background music is ultimately pretty limited, and when you listen to the same theme over and over again, it loses a bit of luster
 The combat interface is fairly locked in
 You may select side-view, or bottom-up, but the interface isn't going to really change beyond that
 These kinds of limitations could make even the most creative and inspired designer start to feel extremely repetitive
That said, RPGMaker is extremely open
 If you are a pixel artist, you can import your own sprites and tiles
 If you like to draw character art, import your own
Music and sound effects may be imported
 You also have an extremely elaborate scripting system (leveraging Javascript) that will let you adjust almost every element in the game, from the battle system to the menus and interface
 This can let you essentially make almost anything you really want
 If you have one of the above mentioned skills and want to bring it to bear, you have plenty of opportunity to do so
If you don't, that brings me to my next major pro of this software:  There is an incredible community behind it
 I've tested other game development softwares, and I've never seen a community so ready and able to jump in and help build solutions to make your game better
 The community is very invested in (and loyal to) RPGMaker, and go to great lengths to give you all the support you need to make your game succeed
 If you aren't an artist, but you really want that 3-headed dragon in your game, you need only ask on the forum and very likely someone will take up the cause and deliver a 3-headed dragon
 If you have trouble working through a particularly challenging event/puzzle, you need simply ask and the community is quick to offer suggestions in a constructive way to help you succeed
Overall, I think this is a great software for a budding game developer to start with


one that will make it difficult to use any other after

												I'm a huge fan of Monster Hunter (MH) which supposedly started the "Hunting" genre, so I was really hyped to learn that this series is getting ported to the PC
As if that news wasn't good enough, you actually get God Eater Ressurrection (GER) free when you buy God Eater 2 Rage Burst (GE2RB)
I played through the story for both GER & GE2RB and here is my opion:   *STORY*+ The world of God Eater has an interesting lore that a non-critical anime fan will surely appreciate
Both games have an engaging story to tell
My only complaint here is a singing idol being central to the plot in GE2RB
It's highly recommended to play GER first before moving on to GE2RB
*GAMEPLAY* + Combat is the best aspect of both games
Challenging but more accessible than MH
Both plays similarly but have mechanics that give each title a different experience
Between GER & GE2RG, I liked the latter  more due to its Blood Rage and Blood Arts system which reminded me of the hunting arts mechanic in MHG
- One thing I found annoying with the combat is the lack of mechanics (other than dealing enough damage) that allow you to drive a monster away
This results into a chaotic slugfest  when fighting mulitple monsters
+ AI controlled allies are surprisingly not useless
Taking time to customize their skills only makes them even better
- The UI is very clunky for both games
- While I loved the Blood arts system, leveling them up unfortunately is not
It was quite similar to Elder Scrolls 4 which was mind numbingly tedious
- Acquiring skill upgrades at the end of a mission is RNG based
Even worse is that these upgrades are consumable
This results to incosistency in building up a skill
- Quest progression for GE2RB is a real pain
It's literally a fetch quest of dialogue before you can even commence with the actual mission
- The bullet editor has no tutorial
This results to a lot of time wasted on trial and error when trying to create your own unique bullet
*GRAPHICS*+ Character design has an anime vibe and is pretty ok
+ Monster design is quite unique
- Environments are bland, and this is where the low quality textures stand out
Though one can't really expect too much on the visual dept
from a port
- Your custom character lacks the physics that every other NPC character in the game has
*SOUNDTRACK	+ Wether in a mission or just the lobby, the background music blends well with the current tone of the story
I didn't find any songs memorable though
*VOICE ACTING*+ From the sultry Motoko, smart mouth Romeo, emotionless Ciel, Emo Soma, and the over zealous Emil, just to name a few; The voice actors does a excellent job bringing the characters to life despite how cringey the dialogue gets at times
If you like challenging action rpgs, then I highly suggest you give it a try
If this is your first "Hunting" game though, chances are that you'll find it repetitive
Stick long enough though and it may grow on you
If you do get hooked to the combat which is the bread and butter of Hunting games, both GER and GE2RB offers plenty of end game missions to satisfy your hunger for that one last hunt

												As a avid fan of Monster Hunter that put over thousands of hours into the handheld games for both PSP and the 3DS, I have to say that the games are definitely "comparable
" I'd describe God Eater as a easier, faster paced Monster Hunter with less demands on precision and skill
What really sets God Eater apart from Monster Hunter is really:1
the level of customization that Bullet Editor brings,2
the ability to make almost any type of equipment strong by installing abilities onto them
3
art and story4
actual characterization5
lack of emphasis on grinding monsters for rare drops
Minor criticisms that I have include:1
Small pool of major monsters to actually fight if you discount all the reskinned/elemental versions of them
2
Adept use of Bullet Editor combined with Trigger Happy and Frugal will trivialize most content
3
Although Blood Arts in God Eater 2 did improve the balance of melee and ranged combat, custom bullet spam is still a better way to deal damage
That said, God Eater has a much easier learning curve than Monster Hunter, and although I personally don't feel the depth and deliberate precision that I get from Monster Hunter, casual fans of the Monster Hunter series will probably enjoy this game
Comparisons with Monster Hunter aside, God Eater is a fantastic action rpg game with a high level of customization that many gamers will definitely enjoy

												tl:dr: Two great Monster Hunter style games that will last you a long time
Great PC port
NOTE: I have played God Eater Burst on the PSPGameplay+ Monster Hunter style, but faster and has more plot (and "plot")+ Both GE:R and GE2:RB will last you a long time if you like MonHun style games (NOTE: GE:R will come with GE2:RB "for the duration of the product's life cycle")Presentation+ SSS Character and Monster Design+ Anime-style lyrical songs during power-up mode+/- OK English dub, no Japanese voices, but it seems mods are possible despite Denuvo- Some environments are mehTechnical+ Can natively plug in a Dualshock 4 and get Playstation button prompts+ KB+M controls seem good+ Toaster friendly on low settings+ Quite a few graphics options includingScreen Resolution (Minimum 800x600, can go to 1440p apparently)Refresh Rate (25,29,30,59,60 Hz)Fullscreen,borderless windowed and windowed modesV-sync On/OffFXAA On/OffShadows Off,Low,Med,HighTexture Filtering: Trilinear, ANISO up to x16Particle Effects On/OffOverall: Great MonHun style game

												Pros : - 60fps- great story- have a nice ingame music- cool gameplay- crafting system easy to understand except for modding the bullets- have so many fashion item to make your character so stylish looking monster hunterCons :- easily get bored if you are playing this game alone without friends 
Posted: 29 August, 2016
												I bought this with my No Mans Sky refund :^)			
Posted: 10 June
												Starting off, if you're new to the God Eater franchise and have a history of playing Monster Hunting type RPGs, this is totally for you
If you're new to the genre in general, I recommend this as your first (as it is my favorite of the entire genre)! Gameplay: Fast paced with the solid mixture of melee and ranged combat
Farm for your goods
Craft your own equipment from weapons, clothes, bullets, and much more! For those who love doing a little character creation, yes it's there! Build up your team known as Blood with the skill traits you want, from healing to full on tanking! The story is something I've always got into but even if it isn't what you're used to you'll still come out with a pretty good experience (if you enjoy anime, you'll enjoy this)
As a port comparison to the PS4 and Vita version, God Eater Rage Burst 2 holds up nicely as a successful port in my own personal opinion
Going over 60fps (depending on the resolution), true 1080p, maxed out textures, and the full support for keyboard and mouse (including full controller support) truly gives this a huge step up from the handheld and console versions of the game
Some are having graphical issues with the game and/or audio files meshing together - I myself haven't experienced any of these issues (yet anyways)
Being a huge long time fan of the series I'm proud it got an awesome port to the PC! Final verdict: 10/10			
Posted: 29 August, 2016
												Good port
(Update: After playing for a few hours, I can confirm that this is a really good port)
60 hz
(Update: According to some sources, it can go up to 144hz, but the framerate is capped at 60, so the difference will be minimal)
1080p
(Update: I've seen people playing in 1440p, so there's that)
Borderles Window
Keyboard + Mouse support
(Update: It will feel weird at first, but once you switch some keybinds and play for a few hours, it will feel natural)

												God Eater 2 Rage Burst is a video game expansion of the original God Eater 2 which PC consumers are blessed to have now
Rage Burst introduced an extended story, game balancing, and new mechanics from its previous sequel
I'll be reviewing both God Eater 2 Rage Burst and God Eater Resurrection which comes bundled for free when you buy Rage Burst along with giving an explanation of what God Eater is as an old fan of the series
History of God EaterGod Eater started off as a Japanese Playstation Portable (PSP) "Monster Hunting" game created by SHIFT and was  released on February, 2010
It sold well at the time and was announced for US release shortly afterwards, however it was delayed until 2011
During the time, Bandai announced a project for their God Eater game which ultimately became Gods Eater Burst that got released to the US
Gods Eater Burst featured an extended story, new characters, monsters, and various other elements for the original game
In the same year, September 2011, God Eater 2 was announced for the PSVita in Japan and was later released in 2013
The game had plenty of copies sold, around 200,000 physical copies on the first week it released, and was very well received
"God Eater 2 was to pinpoint what users found fun about the game; we're taking it apart and reassembling it from scratch
" - Yusuke Tomizawa, the developer of God EaterIn 2014, God Eater 2 Rage Burst was announced which, much like how Gods Eater Burst received, introduced new characters and monsters, an extended story, a new game mechanic, and various other functions
It was released for both the PlayStation 4 and Vita
Additionally, an animated series of God Eater by Ufotable (also known for animating Fate/Zero) started on July 2015 and lasted through 12 episodes up until March, 2016
A full length prologue episode was featured in 2009
The anime focused on a static main character named Lenka and revolved around the first God Eater's storyline
God Eater ResurrectionResurrection is an enhanced version of an already enhanced version of the first game
While there are no additional stories to a game that's already expanded on story enough, it features a vast majority of mechanics and gameplay elements brought in from its sequel while introducing Predator Styles, a new unique element only available in Resurrection
God Eater 2 Rage BurstGod Eater 2 revolves around giant monsters that are somewhat resembled off of a deity of sorts while following the story of various characters in a post-apocalyptic world ruined by said giant monsters called Aragami
It follows the story previously left off of the first game
The game introduces new weapons to the series: the Boost Hammer, Charge Spear, and Variant Scythe
That makes 6 total melee weapons; the original three being the fast and mobile Short Sword, the well-rounded Long Blade, and the slow, heavy hitting Buster Blade
Even though 6 might sound like a small number, they all vastly differ in strengths and weaknesses which majority of players may find that suits their playstyle the best
There are also different types of guns and shields along with a very large variety of "Skills" you can install into your weapons to give them a variety of effects
While it lacks in variety a bit, the weapons make up for the amount of experimentation and possibilities it can give to the player to help find their perfect loadout
God Eater 2 and its expansion, Rage Burst, features two special mechanics called "Blood Arts" and "Blood Rage" which are not available in God Eater Resurrection due to the plot
These elements can alter your playstyle of the game even further by giving your weapons additional movesets / effects and mission-clearing set-ups
MusicThe composer of music for both of the games was orchestrated by Go Shiina who specializes in electronic, orchestral, and rock
His music for the games helped create the atmosphere of the settings in great ways with his dramatic arrangements
PC Port ReviewCompared to other PC ports from consoles, God Eater Resurrection and God Eater 2 Rage Burst as a PlayStation 4 port suffers little to no issues
Smooth 60fps, full controller support and keyboard rebindings, and variety of options to tweak with, the port is nearly flawless
Some noticeable downsides is that there is no 21:9 screen ratio support and audio randomly cuts out at times / voice volume is low compared to other audio sources even if they are all maxed in settings
Another thing that can be unsettling is how akward joining others in Multiplayer works which is having to set up your download region through the Steam settings to the same location as the host's
English DubPaylor Sakaki sounds like a giant nerd
Pros and Cons:+ Well developed PC port from the Playstation 4 console
A lot of effort has been put into it by the looks of it+ Full controller support and key rebindings+ Music breaths life to monster hunting+ Plenty of story and hours of content to invest in- Random audio cut-outs and poorly optimized voice volume- English dubs may not be suited for everyone- Lack of Japanese voice acting can put some people off- No 21:9 ratio support- Messing around with Steam settings to play with others online isn't too exciting- You can't transfer save data from God Eater Resurrection to God Eater 2 Rage BurstPersonal Score: 8/10 
Posted: 7 September, 2016
												This review is for God Eater Resurrection (when you buy the game, they will split in God Eater Resurrection and Rage Burst in your library)
Also this review is based in my personal opinion (i´m not really into hunt style)God Eater Resurrection occurs three years before Rage Burst, so i recommend play first, also if you watched God Eater anime, your character will assume role of "Kannagi Yuu"
So, what i think about the game:Pros: - some ost/bgm is very good
- in co op, you can trade your avatar card with others players, after you traded, the avatar will become npc and you can use in free mission- oppai- Alisa oppai, and others clothes that is very sexy- the graphic is goodCons:- the maps are very repetitive- sometimes, they (system) will throw you in lion´s den, and havent time to prepare- for me, they can can reduce battle number
because to progress the story, you need get a mission, fight and spend around 15-20 minutes, only for a little conversation- English voice (i heard that jap voice is bad, but since i did not play ps vita or jap voice, i cant tell if will be good or not, but i dont know, playing anime style game with english voice is little strange for me)- The game is censored (blood is toned down)
Some info say that Lindow (smoking) and Shio (grab boob) cutscene is censored, but they arent
Dont be fooled if you see credits
The resurrection is divided in arcs
When i saw the credits, i thought that is finished, moments later, voilá, the story continueHas many cons, but is is a great game
"I hope i was helpful


was was i helpful?"About Rage Burst:They increased the characters and has more individual scenes now
The battle system is better, and for me, this one is bigger than previous title
So really worth buy this bundle

Two games at the price of one?!I recommend playing God Eater Resurrection first, as you would understand the story after continuing God Eater 2 Rage Burst
Pros:-Good Story and cutscenes for God Eater Resurrection
Great Story and cutscenes for God Eater 2 Rage Burst
-Tons of customization
Eg
Different Weapon Types, Bullet Editor, Craftable/Upgrading Equipment, Clothings, Attack Styles and etc
-Amazing Soundtrack-Variations of Aragamis with different weakpoints and elemental weakness
-Atleast 80 ~ 100 hours for each game
-Cool little bond cutscenes/events with characters after using their support ability cards
(Works if you do missions below your highest difficulty from what I've experienced
)-A lot of lore and information that can be read through the Database on the terminal
-Actual tactics can be done by using the Signals
Inbetween-Can be considered as "Grindy" due to the multitude of missions,-English Dubbed (Although the voice acting isn't that bad, an option to change it to Japanese Dub and English Sub would have been nice
)Cons-Horrible Multiplayer loading (It loads really slowly when in multiplayer, and if it's more than 2 players, there's a possibility you would get stuck at loading
)This was majority based on God Eater Resurrection and slightly on God Eater 2 Rage Burst
If you're looking for a co-op game with 1 other person, this could interest you
(Kinda slow loading though
)Overall I'd recommend getting this, but get it during a sale if money is an issue

												Probably the best ero-RPG ever on steam
It has all the qualities we are looking for:- A very good plot- Great artwork- A cute heroin and characters- A high quality human made english translation (not some machine translated bs)- Many sex scenes- Many sex possibilities, everyone's likes are covered I think- It's 100% uncensored (no mosaics)- Great supports from the devs, errors are fixed asap- Devs invested in their work and enthusiasts- And so much more to add to this listI usually don't write reviews for the games I bought but I made an exception for this one
This game is totally worth its price, a rare gem on steam
And if you got a little extra money, please support them on patreon also
I highly recommend this game, please support the authors so we can get more games like this one in the future

												I first played the original PC version of FF7, and then later the PlayStation version
After purchasing and replaying the Steam version, I can wholly recommend it as the definitive version of Final Fantasy VII to play
I'll start off with some quick points about this version in comparison to previous versions
The actual game will be discussed in more detail below
Vs Playstation:+Smoother look on the characters+No disc swapping+English translation has been tidied up and the plot is more coherent (No one seems to talk about this, but it's major in my eyes)-Swearwords have been replaced with !@#$ style characters
Vs original PC release:+Hassle-free, in my experience (40+ hours) <-- This is the key thing for me
+PSX music added, as opposed to the awful original PC music
Huge plus! The song "One Winged Angel" now has vocals like it should do :)+Rendered characters are now synced perfectly when walking over a pre-rendered video
+Videos look smoother and match the PSX version, which is very nice in comparison to original release
-Default keyboard controls need two hands
Original PC release had default keys all on the Numpad
Meaning you can scratch your chin or drink coffee while playing
Easily resolved anyway :)-Yet another thing you have to create an account for
This time for Square Enix
Once you've done so, you can pretty much forget about it
I have an Xbox controller, but never tried it admittedly, so can't comment on that! I found the game plays perfectly with keyboard
It's surprising how well Final Fantasy VII has aged
I hadn't played the game for nearly 7 years now, and was expecting it to be incredibly ugly
Don't get me wrong, it IS incredibly ugly, albeit in a charming way now
Rather than a good looking game being badly ported, this is a bad looking game that's been ported just right
You can't change your resolution (to my knowledge), but there's absolutely no need to
The game makes use of pre-rendered backgrounds and the resolution they chose for the 3D characters was a good compromise between smoothness and not sticking out too much from the backgrounds
It does look much better than the PSX version, and a bit better than the original PC release
I am also happy that they stuck with the original PC version's English translation
If you've only ever played FF7 on one platform before, you may not know that the PC version had a much neater, tidier translation
I'm not talking about a complete overhaul like some of the other Final Fantasy remakes
This is still the original story told in what the original PSX translation was trying to do
Any line that was fine before, is unchanged
They simply removed some (admittedly funny) spelling mistakes, and only changed lines that really did not make any sense at all
It makes the game feel more natural and therefore I highly recommend a replay if you've only played on the PSX before
The one noticeable, and unfortunate, change is that the swearing has been replaced with !@#£ style symbols
You can still tell they're swearing and what word they were going to say, but this unnecessary censorship felt a bit out of place
Still, it doesn't make or break the game
And just to be clear, this isn't new to the Steam version as it was present on the original PC release
Also, as I might as well say it now: The story IS really good
As FF7 is one of the most popular entries in the franchise, it sometimes gets a lot of flak from people who seem to only want to dislike popular things
These are personal games, which you should play for yourself, and FF7 offers a deceptively complex story, with a fantastic combination of twists
'Twist' is a harsh word, because it implies a sudden and unexpected change in the story's direction
This is not the case
The 'twists' are completely natural and only serve to make everything before fit into place better
The combination I mentioned earlier is in reference to twists which you will definitely understand on your first time through, and some which may only make sense with a bit of thinking or a replay
The latter are not essential to understand, but you'll feel a satisfying sense of revelation if you do
All in all, this is a well-thought out constructed tale
It may not be as fast-paced as you'd like, but the end result is very satisfactory
The gameplay itself is surprisingly fast for a 90s JRPG
You can get through battles pretty quickly, and most of the attack animations are short enough to not be too annoying
With the exception of summons; huge magical attacks shown in a lengthy animation of a monster being summoned and inflicting damage on your enemies
The Materia system is still great and offers lots of customisation for your characters, although it's not as complex nowadays as it used to be
To be clear, Materia are 'gems' which you attach to characters to give them extra abilities or magic
As a Materia is used, it gains its own experience and gets progressively more powerful
The only complexity comes from managing who has what materia, and this is the one area of the game where the age really shows
You can only quick swap between character's Materia screens for the three characters in your party, rather than every available character
Therefore you are forced to constantly swap characters in and out to get the best setup
[EDIT: A number of comments have corrected me and pointed me to the Exchange option, which negates this complaint of mine!]Is it worth £10? Admittedly, this port probably generated no where near the amount of work needed to justify the price, but the quality of the game does
Therefore it's a tough question to answer
I suppose if you look at what you're getting, then yes, it is worth the price
Your first time through the game can literally take 60-70 hours
My replay was 40 hours long, and I know the game extremely well
This is now my favorite way to play Final Fantasy VII
And that is probably the one thing you needed to know
EDIT: Voted this game for "Villain most in need of a hug" award ;)

												This game got me through middle school, ruined my life, caused distorted romantic illusions and sense of self, brought me back from the depths again and again, easily stole thousands of hours of my life through yearly replays
10/10 Would make the mistake of purchasing again

												Final Fantasy VII is a classic, there's no debating that
With it's first release on the Playstation back in 1997, this release is a repackaged version of the PC port released in 1998
 With cloud saves and achievements, it doesn't really stand out to people who may have already bought the game or have it elsewhere
Final Fantasy VII uses almost all the assets from the original PC version of the game
Music was re-encoded to OGG Vorbis, but was still based off of fairly ugly MIDI tracks that the PC used
Thankfully they are easy to replace as some poeple have even decided to use remixes of said tracks instead
Visually the game is very dated
2D backgrounds, 3D sprites from that era with resolution stretching 2D elements while providing a modicum amount of improvement to the 3D models
While in the field, higher resolutions don't really help, but in battle scenes and in full 3D environments (Chocobo Racing, Submarine Minigame), there is a noticeable improvement
Controls are a bit awkward as for a 360 controller, the triggers, d-pad, and right stick aren't usable
However, you can get around that either by binding everything to usable controls or using a utility like JoytoKey
This is a bare-bones re-release, with the hard work for making it work with a modern OS stripped away for most people
Update: SquareEnix has managed to replace the MIDI quality music with PSX quality tracks
This means the game's music sounds extremely detailed compared to the original PC release

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Final Fantasy 7 Original Release: 1998 (2013 Steam Version) Genre Tags: JRPG; Turn-Based RPG; Action; Classic; Industry Jewel My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 20-65 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Nostalgia chasers; Strong narrative advocates; Gaming industry aficionado REVIEWIf you scroll down the (serious) positive reviews for this game, you no doubt see many people expressing their nostalgic love for this legendary piece of their childhood
I stand among these people
For many of us who were kids in the 90s, Final Fantasy 7 was and always will be the first truly epic game we ever played
So I’ll admit that I am definitely biased to love it, as it was my personal favorite game during a number of years of my childhood
But that isn’t why I’m going to recommend that you consider trying it
You should consider it because Final Fantasy 7 is a classic piece of video-game history that revolutionized the genre and because it’s a kickass game
At the time it first released, there were a handful of other large RPGs with huge worlds and a lot of gameplay (relative to the era), but they were uncommon and unpopular in the Western world
Final Fantasy 7 reached a pinnacle of awesomeness for RPGs that was unprecedented and subsequently elevated the genre into the mainstream gaming market outside of Japan
Not only did it have sound RPG fundamentals, but the sheer amount of variety of gameplay it offered was quite revolutionary for the genre
Chocobo racing and breeding, the motorbike scene, the snowboard scene, the Golden Saucer, the Don Corneo segment, and more all contributed to shattering the status quo for the genre
A lot of young gamers went from not knowing about RPGs to one of them being their favorite game ever
Not only that, but it became one of the cornerstones which provided a foundation for the genre to grow towards what it has become today
If there was a Video Game Hall of Fame, Final Fantasy 7 would no doubt be in it
Obviously, with more recent RPG blockbusters from franchises like The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, and Fallout, it is hard to continue to consider Final Fantasy 7 to be an “epic” game by today’s standards
Somehow it still feels that way to me
Or at the very least: since I enjoy the genre, I still find it quite fun to play
So I will admit that it definitely has been a long time since Final Fantasy 7 was one of the best games in existence
That said, even after the erosion of the sands of time, the game still feels exciting, intriguing, and massive to me
Even on my 8th playthrough I pick up on new subtleties in the story or discover new secrets and items
The story is interesting, if not a bit convoluted
(Some of the story was cut away to make it “less confusing for the Western market” or some such silliness
This wound up making it more confusing
) The Materia system is fun and, combined with the traditional XP leveling, continuously offers the satisfaction of progress as you play through the campaign
The world is intriguing and still semi-large(ish) even by modern standards
The characters are perfect clichés of the very clichés that they themselves introduced
And one of the best parts of the game will always be the intimidating boss battles with the signature music
It is doubtful there will ever be another kid who says Final Fantasy 7 is his favorite game ever, but most modern fans of the genre will enjoy this game despite its age
So there are a few reasons you may want to consider trying this game if you never have
If you consider yourself a true aficionado of the gaming industry, you will probably want to play Final Fantasy 7 at least once in your life
Even though there is a “remake” on the way (or out by the time you read this), I would argue you should play this version at least once to really experience a legendary piece of video game history in this semi-unadulterated state
Or: if you don’t care about any of the historical mumbo-jumbo, and just are looking for a fun, turn-based JRPG, then you can comfortably look to Final Fantasy 7 for that as well

												Best game ever!Definitely buy it somewhere, like from a store! But


DO NOT BUY IT HERE, AVOID!! Here is why:It is a 15 year old SINGLE PLAYER GAME
SQUARE have decided to finally put their prized games on steam


so why is that? why now? Unfortunately theyve gone down a dark and corrupt road


even as low as stealing


yes, i used the word stealing, because that's what this is
You need to register your personal information, which is required to be able to login to their online client, so that you can play this single player game
DRM


oh but it goes a lot deeper than that
Afterall, why have DRM on a single player game?


The terms and conditions of this unnecessary online integration, is THEY ARE SELLING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES AND INSTALLING SPYWARE
In this aspect the game shouldnt cost you anything as theyre already making the money off of your private information which they have no right to deny you access to the game after pre-taking your money
But oh it gets worse


it also repeatedly installs a tracking cookie into your all your browsers in order to spy on your activity
Yes


spyware
You can remove them if you want, but they'll just keep re-installing themselves
(wtf Square


wtf)It gets even worse!Q: "But wait



if you buy it on Steam, does that mean i automatically agree to the terms?" NO because you havent even seen or even knew about these terms and conditions, nor accepted them
They have taken your money ILLEGALLY first, and given you the agreement later
^This warrants a potential Class Action Lawsuit, which if it happens, i will be joining
Square-Enix would not have a leg to stand on if people got organised enough to create this lawsuit against them
Q: "I bought it, but didnt agree to these rediculous terms


can i get my money back because i was mislead and missold this item?"Legally you are entitled to a refund because you were, mislead, and tricked into buying something that had dangerous conditions given to you AFTER the sale, which is illegal
But to answer your question,NO, YOU JUST GOT ILLEGALLY ROBBED, SCREW YOU GIMME MONEY
YOU WANT YOUR MONEY BACK? YOU CANT HAVE IT BACK, AND NOBODY IN THE WORLD, INCLUDING STEAM IS GOING TO HELP YOU GET IT BACK ( i love you steam, but not helping people get refunds in this case, is again, an illegal procedure because YOU and SQUARE have not given any warning, any notice that these conditions exist before the sale)
You just got robbed, and no authority on the internet has the balls to challenge this because "Big company" gets complete fkin immunity from the law
Square has gone so down deep in greed and corruption, that they are taking your money, and NOT giving you your game until you accept their spyware and contractual agreement to sell your private information



and NOT giving you the money back if you do not agree to do so
IV BEEN ROBBED, and have been refused my money back


having NOT been given the product i paid for
Its criminal


anyone one of us would be arrested and either fined or given a small jail sentence, yet these guys are getting away with it like theyre above the law

												Final Fantasy VII was one of the first RPGs I played, and the first game I bought for the Playstation
I had never seen anything like it at the time
Such a big, immersive experience
Three discs long! It was the first time I had seen a game span multiple discs
There's a lot to cover, so let's get started
Breakdown of the game itself:Graphics - The graphics in FF7 are very much a mixed bag
The 3D models used in battle are about as detailed as you could achieve for 1997, at least for console gaming
The models used outside of battle, however, are very blocky and much smaller
They sort of look like squashed down versions
It may take some getting used to if you're coming from a game like FF8, for example
FF7 uses pre-rendered backgrounds, which looked far superior to the 3D textures of the time and look great on standard def TVs, but look a little pixellated on higher res computer monitors
The FMVs still hold up pretty well, even if they're nothing mind blowing like they were for some of us back in the day
Personally, I think the spell/attack animations hold up the best out of everything, graphics-wise
I love seeing the animation for spells such as Aqualung
:)Music - FF7 has some of the best music ever put into a video game, if you ask me
Nobuo Uematsu is a fantastic composer, and this game simply wouldn't be anywhere near as charming and compelling without his score, which does an incredible job of setting the mood for much of the game
Many of the tracks will tug at your heartstrings during the game's more emotional scenes, and many other tracks


Well, they just sound plain cool
The boss battle theme really got me pumped the first time I heard it, and I used to look forward to upcoming boss fights just so I could hear that music again
Battle mechanics - FF7 uses an active time turn based battle system
You can have three characters in your active party, and each can equip a weapon, armor and accessory
Each weapon and armor has slots in it, which you can place little orbs in called materia
Materia are where you get your special abilities
Without them, you only have the standard attack and item commands during battle
Materia come in five varieties: Green, which contain magic spells
Blue, which alter the effects of a materia it is placed next to, if those two slots are linked
Red, which contain summons
Yellow, which enable extra battle commands (Steal, for example)
And purple, which are basically stat boosting materia
These categories of materia are referred to as magic (green), support (blue), summon (red), command (yellow) and independent (purple)
There is a TON of materia in the game and each weapon and armor can hold up to 8 materia orbs, so character customization possibilities are practically limitless
The materia system is honestly one of my favourites of any Final Fantasy or RPG
Plot - You are Cloud, a former soldier of the Shinra corporation, which is basically the biggest world power in Final Fantasy VII
After parting ways with them, Cloud embarks on a new life as a mercenary, ironically being hired by a militant anti-Shinra group known as Avalanche
As you progress through the game you'll learn more about Cloud and his comrades' pasts and the various secrets the Shinra corporation holds, as well as the mako energy that's become so profitable for them
Along the way you'll meet lots of interesting characters, and there are even two optional ones you can recruit
I think that's a pretty good outline without venturing into spoilery territory
The characters in this game really have a lot of depth, for the most part, which is one of my favourite aspects of the game
Controls - FF7 was originally released for the Playstation, but didn't make use of the analog sticks
It used the D-pad to move your character around, so you should be able to configure it to work with just about any USB gamepad you happen to have
You can also use your keyboard if you don't have a gamepad or simply prefer not to use one
Issues specific to the Steam release:First off, if you get an error when launching the game, try going into your program files (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FINAL FANTASY VII\ for example) and right-click on FF7_Launcher
exe
Select "Properties" and go into the Compatibility tab
Here, tick the box that says "Run this program as an administrator
" This fixed the issue for me on my Windows 7 machine
The only other issues I've had running the game have been it crashing a few times
Once when I first played through it on my laptop in 2013, just outside of the Mythril Mines (after travelling through them), and a couple times when casting Beta on my current playthrough
Not ideal, but nothing to really worry about
Just make sure you save often and always after a major accomplishment
So, a few things about the Steam port
For one thing, you now have achievement trophies
These are little badges that show up on your Steam profile to let all your friends know how awesome you are, lol
Well, something like that
You'll gain a badge for getting to certain points in the story, and there are badges for getting the most powerful limit breaks, maxing out your characters' levels, collecting materia, beating optional bosses, etc
One big change I'd like to talk about is the sound
The music in the Steam release is nowhere near the quality of the original Playstation version's
Luckily, this can easily be remedied by searching through Steam's mod section, where you can find mods to replace it with the original music, or even higher quality mixes (I recommend the one based around FinalFanTim's remastered soundtrack)
:)There are a few other little changes here and there
Some of the dialog has been cleaned up a little, a few of the curses have been replaced with the iconic @%#$% characters, and


The models have mouths
Basically little black circles pasted onto their faces
It looks pretty silly to me, but it's not a major distraction (you can also mod the graphics if you're so inclined)
I think that about covers it


Final Fantasy VII is widely regarded as one of the best JRPGs of all time, and it's definitely high on my personal list
Give it a try
For $11
99, it's well worth it

												Before you buy this game, please note that the game is suited more for controllers
Just an issue I want to say before my actual review


At the start of the game, you may run into lag issues
If so, go to your graphics card control panel, Nvidia Control Panel,etc
Select manage 3D settings, click on Program Settings (The one next to Global Settings) , click on add, browse for toukiden_2en
exe under program files(x86)/steam/steamapps/common/toukiden2 (That's for my case)
Once you selected the file, head on down to 2
Select the prefered graphics processor for the game and change the setting to High performance NVIDIA processor
You should be running smoothly after this
If there is still lag, head on down to the game's properties in your steam library and disable steam overlay
My opinion:  This game reminds me more of God eater (maybe because of the demon hand and hunting down oni?) but as an open world type
There is so much to do and I really like the usage of the mitamas
You can choose what sort of build or style you're going for and need not be aligned to just one trait
The only thing that really bugs me about this game is the  camera
Anyways,it is a good port from the PS4 (1080p and 60fps) and is definitely worth picking up if you love Monster hunter,God Eater or any other JRPG games
Thanks for reading this review! And thumbs up if it was helpful to you!

												So playing this, game is pretty solid for a port
Granted lack of mouse use, most of the negative reviews are solely just that
Graphically NiceFeels natural on a controllerNo fps issues No glitch issuesOverall a solid game/port and look forward to hunting with others

												Toukiden 2
Is a huge improvement to toukiden kiwami
i saw lots of bad reviews turn up, and was worried that he port was the same as the first game
30 fps, crashes, lag etc
(to i still enjoyed the first one allot)Now is it better?yes, the port runs great at 60 fps
Combat feels improved
its Toukiden but openworld
Art style is great
Characters (so far) are fun
Story (so far) is kind of the same
Gameplay, well its what makes these types of games amazing
its even better since its 60 fps
Its a great game if you enjoy openworld type rpg's or like Hunter games
its a dam good mix
And i do hope they will keep making the next entry like this
improve uppon the things they did now
So whats bad?No mouse support
But thats about it actually


i play these types of games with a controller
Always have, always will
Its refreshing to see that koei tried something new with one of there IP's
and i encourage them to do so more and more
The more they experement, the more of these types of new mix of games we will get
Pc gaming is changing in a good way
More and more niche titles appear
More and more console only games come to pc step by step
I for such support this
Toukiden 2 is a great new entry in the hunting genre as in its franchise
Enjoy the game

												Toukiden 2 is for those who like Monster Hunt like games but instead of Prehistoric time or Post Apocalyptic of God Eater/Freedom Wars, this will be in the setting of Japanese Mythology Lore
If you own the 1st game, you will get bonus items from the save file
Also you don't need the 1st game as the Story setting will be different
Although some characters from the 1st will appear here
Pros:Its a Ps4 Port, not the VITA, No Ps3 due to it being exclusive to Japan Only
Supports 30FPS to 60FPS
Currently having steady 60FPS gameplay experience
Only 2 Language which you can choose upon the Launcher though Japanese was its Default
It's Graphics quite Improved from the Previous game
Customization has been improved slightly
You get 5 DLC for free within a month after Launch before it becomes a Paid DLC
(Its mostly a Stats Buff and you get a free Kitsune Armor also known as Tenko but in Japanese Term, they don't have the same meaning)World exploration has shifted to be open world
Hunting grounds from previous games return with alterations
You get to run faster now with the R3 Analog Button
You get a special particle effect like Sonic
Its called "Stormrunner"Day & Night cycle
Japanese Voice Language only but its makes it more fitting and suitable for the game setting
Quite clear and perfect
11 Weapons to choose from as your starting weapon but once you reach the HUB, you can change your default weapons
Music is as Beautiful as it is
Characters art-style is quite well done
Water-paint Art in a Traditional way
Cons:It defaults run on Integrated so you must manually open your NVIDIA Panel to run it on your GPU
http://imgur
com/a/CAiiy <--Follow these Instruction
Minor Stuttering but that's due to Steam Overlay so might need to disable that unless otherwise
Multiplayer uses Steam Region Download Settings and its P2P
Neutral:K+M not Support because KT is well known to cater/favour console so get a bloody Gamepad
3 Save SlotsNo V-Sync settings so those with GSync Monitor, I have no idea
Those who just started or new to the series, There is a saying, "Easy to Play, Difficult to Master"
Its resolution supports from 640 x 360 / 640 x 480 to 1920 x 1080 / 1920 x 1080

The Factors are OS, CPU and GPU
Graphic Varies on Users GPU and Settings
ReShade/SweetFX is Optional
Overall: A Good Steady Launch from my experience
Note: Might upload a Youtube Gameplay later on or never
(Did a Shadowplay Recording but Video ended up with the "Dark Bug")Review will always be update in Progress
-36 Salty people QQing they can't run mainly due to not Upgrading/UPDATING (Majority of people didn't update their Software/Hardware) and 4k salty minority monitor users

They did good with this one

You can change between 30 and 60fps
Fix 60 fps inside and outside of the town
A huge step up from Toukiden Kiwami PC port
			
Posted: 11 April
												TL;DR: Wait for the expansion that will actually be a complete game rather than buying this half-completed budget game that is priced as an AAA game
Toukiden 2 improved on the predecessors (Toukiden and Toukiden Kiwami) in several ways by adding many cool features and mechanisms, such as the open-world map, the oni hand, and several new styles of mitamas
However, Koei Tecmo clearly intends to charge you the price of two AAA game (120$) for 1 complete budget game
Here's why
Toukiden 2’s gameplay is fun, I won’t deny that
But there is no doubt that it’s a budget game, as pretty much everything except the few new weapons and mechanisms are old and recycled stuffs from the previous games
The graphics, animations, and overall quality are all that of a budget game
There is nothing wrong with this per se, even if it charges you the same price as The Witcher 3, as long as Toukiden 2 is actually a complete game which I would recommend even at 60$
So what's making me unrecommend this one is purely out of morality since KT is completely without morals as you don't even get a complete game for 60$
Toukiden 2 has far less contents than its predecessor, Toukiden Kiwami, despite the fact people would generally expect each new installment to add upon the predecessors in a game like this
For example, if the previous game had 20 bosses, you would expect more in this new one right? Well, tough luck, we have the exact same number of boss monsters (20) as Kiwami despite Koei has added a few new monsters to Toukiden 2
So how is this possible??Koei intentionally cut a dozen old monsters from previous games when the number of boss variety is already pathetic in this game to begin with (forcing you to fight the same monsters over and over to progress through the game as a result)
Some old bosses are shamelessly sold as 5$ DLCs (imagine if Tigrex is sold as a DLC in a MH game), and keeping away a few others -some of them very iconic (like Kiwami’s poster-monster, the twin-tail wolf that’s extremely fun to fight) – for the inevitable expansion that Koei will once again charge you full price for
There is absolutely no doubt that Koei intends to do this, since all weapons and equipment are purposefully kept weak, with their rank maxed out at 6, whereas the predecessor ones went up to rank 9
A big portion of the open world map is also unused, presumably kept for the expansion
The missions are also limited compared to Kiwami, with 7 phases offline and 12 online, whereas Kiwami had 12 and 19 or 20 respectively
So basically to get the full game, you will need to spend 120$ plus whatever you decide to spend on the numerous DLCs featuring purposefully-cut contents from old games rather than newly designed ones
If you are really interested in this game, take my advice and wait for the release of Toukiden 2 Kiwami
Finally, the online is already pretty much dead given than only 300 players are actively playing it (out of a total of 20k players, which is beyond pathetic)
You don't care? Well you should even if you plan on soloing the entire game
The fact that Koei doesn't care about getting a lot of sales, has no intention whatsoever to expand their player base and attract new comers with good business practices, and is instead content with the ability to grab some quick cash off the existing tiny niche of players, means that they don't care about you as a customer
So don’t expect ANY technical support or having your complaints heard
With big greedy companies such as EA and Ubisoft, at least they still care about money and players' protests can often have some effect
But when a dev is so lazy and doesn't give a damn about making a complete and quality product, and is only interested in making quick profits, there is NOTHING players can do to make things right
Shortsightedness is worse than pure greed, and Koei Tecmo possesses BOTH traits
Last words on the port, the PC port also lacks basic features you would expect from a game priced as an “AAA” with ZERO mouse support, atrocious keyboard controls (a controller is an absolute MUST), and no resolution support above 1080P and 60FPS
			
Posted: 21 March
												I play the game with an xbox controller, so I am unaffected by the lack of mouse support
This port is fantastic compared to Toukiden Kiwami
I played through the entire story of the first, and dealt with the lag in town because the game was fun
So far Toukiden 2 is running like a dream, and the game is a huge improvement to the first

												just get a controller you troglodytes			
Posted: 21 March
												About what you would expect from a monster hunter-like game
No mouse support, but it isn't that big of a deal
You can freely rebind keys and essentially just use your keyboard as a controler
Such as: I use right hand for camera controls (arrow keys) and left hand controls movements and attacks
Feels nice and works
Will update later once I get some more gameplay down, but initial look isn't as bad as people think it is in regards to controls and such
Updates: One thing I noticed that is pretty horrible is during multiplayer open mic appears to be set to ALWAYS be on
There is no option to turn it off
So if you play with friends and use mumble or team speak (and hate open mic), this will really annoy you
As well, it appears that you also have to have a team of 4 when venturing in multiplayer - so playing with a friend, I have to bring 2 NPC's, which is lame
Game is quite fun and has a lot of variety
It is rather easy though
You have a lot of heals and if you do get knocked out you can just get ressed repeatedly
In multiplayer that means all 4 people have to get knocked out - which is incredibly rare
Sadly, the game doesn't have much replayability or much going for it end game
Stage 12, and that is it
Period
No nothing
I still recommend it, I guess, but very disappointing that there isn't much in terms of continuing to progress in difficulty

												I originally bought this game as a joke because it was on sale
After playing it for nearly seven hours, I realized this game isn't an H-VN or a decent dungeon crawler, but an abidexterity simulator
Nearly two bottles of off-brand Wal-Mart lotion in, I've become just as proficient with my left hand as I am with my right hand
10/10 would recommend

												Is this a softcore porn game? Yes
Yes it is
But in their quest to make a softcore porn game they managed to actually make a very entertaining little dungeon crawler, 90's style
I found myself having quite alot of fun with it, despite having both hands on the keyboard and mouse the entire time

												On October 31, 2013, a dungeon-crawling game known as Demon Master Chris was released
On May 31, 2016, its spiritual successor, Sakura Dungeon, was initially released on Nutaku, the version of which I have played for many hours already
(It’s why I have next to no time played on the Steam version, which I have purchased purely to leave this review
Yes, I care that much
) Now that it’s out on Steam, I can leave a more visible review of it here
I want to love Sakura Dungeon
I really, really, do
I have played and replayed Demon Master Chris for some triple-digit hours
I’ve sunk more than twenty hours into Sakura Dungeon already, on the highest difficulty no less
Unfortunately, I’m finding that the more I play Sakura Dungeon, the more it makes me want to put it down and instead boot up Demon Master Chris once again
Where Sakura Dungeon SucceedsFirstly, let’s not sell Sakura Dungeon short where it inarguably surpasses Demon Master Chris
The artist has noticeably improved in the three years between the games, and the music and SFX are of much higher quality
Frankly, I think the plot might even be a little better; I enjoy the personalities of the main protagonists more
If you simply want to ogle cute and busty anime chicks in compromising situations, then stop reading here and buy Sakura Dungeon
It will be a purchase well worth your money
My problem is that at heart, I’m a tryhard and a grognard who likes to delve deep into the inner mechanics of games
Just what is the game engine like underneath Sakura Dungeon’s new, sleek, and shiny chassis? What got tweaked from DMC that had me finding myself wanting to play the older version instead? In order to make a fair comparison and highlight the minor but important differences, I’ll have to explain DMC’s original system in more depth
Here comes a massive wall of text
Demon Master Chris’s Combat SystemToo long for Steam
Read the wall here: http://pastebin
com/1uCLbU4QSparknotes: VP is health, AP is stamina; You only ever need 1 VP but your current AP represents your ability to dodge; keeping AP high is important to survival Guard command lets you use AP to temporarily boost dodge in the short term, while Recover command lets you recover AP for later usage but temporarily decreases dodge; Guard/Recover duality means that defensive play has meaningful choice and means that paying attention to the enemy is important Read your opponent, learn their general rhythm, then try to anticipate it to dodge their attacks and exploit their attempt to Recover Attacks against low AP characters turn into Critical Hits, which also cause clothing damage; naked characters lose all VP regen and thus can be taken down with ease Random encounters remain legitimate threats unless you are absolutely positively ridiculously overleveled Bosses absolutely must be outwitted and stripped in order to reasonably defeat them Sakura Dungeon’s Simplications, Changes to DMC’s SystemStill too long for Steam
Read the longform here: http://pastebin
com/nyTx2yZsMoar sparknotes: Sakura Dungeon replaces Guard/Recover duality with a single, one-dimensional command that simply restores AP with no downside or other effect, thus removing the rock-paper-scissors triangle of Recover->Guard->Attack->Recover for an overly simple continuum of "be defensive<-->attack more" Dodge gain from high AP reduced, attacks are more accurate in general: now the majority of all attacks hit their targets without having to consider the target's own AP, meaning random encounters become boring and routine extremely quickly Critical Hits now far less dependent on AP state of target; attacks on low AP targets not guaranteed to crit, while high AP targets can sometimes still be crit anyways Less predictable nature of Critical Hits mainly serves to surprise and annoy the player, instead of directly rewarding you for playing well or punishing you for making mistakes Stripping to eliminate regen mechanic simplified; changes rhythm of boss fights entirely, turns bosses into statchecks rather than actual thinking challenges; devs outright encourage the player to simply grind to prepare for bosses, rather than rethink their strategy or try different approaches CP/Flow system that Sakura Dungeon introduced feels snowbally without adding very much interaction with the opponent; since bosses have been turned into statchecks, CP/Flow system only serves to reinforce the mindless, boring "strategy" of "grind until you can beat the boss lol" Where DMC plays like a fighting game with thinking forward and counterplay, Sakura Dungeon plays like a SNES-era Final Fantasy title where you just attack through random encounters and bosses alike repeatedly to eventually take them down at lengthHoly tl;dr BatmanIf you enjoy anime girls having their clothes ripped off in not-so-honorable RPG combat, go ahead and buy Sakura Dungeon
I will honestly praise the art, music, and overall aesthetic polish that are all a step above what’s in Demon Master Chris
For all that I’ve vomited about how the internal mechanics are RUINED FOREVER(tm), the game plays out as a respectable turn-based RPG in its own right; I have not yet encountered any major bugs or obviously unintended game imbalances or exploits
I will also continue playing Sakura Dungeon to its completion, exploring the CP system a bit more, as well as replaying it on a lower difficulty; my views on the game may change and if they do I will revisit this review
But as far as I can tell right now, if you prefer a better-oiled, more strategic and thought-provoking RPG underneath the exposed skin, skip out on this watered-down successor and play the original DMC instead
(Note: Demon Master Chris isn’t on Steam, for obvious reasons
Google it yourself
You’re an adult on the internet, you should know how
At least I hope you’re an adult

												It's like Pokemon
But boobs,

												Stop me if this sounds familiar:A young red-haired adventurer crash-lands on a mysterious island where he quickly gets roped up into helping a pretty girl recover elemental-themed McGuffins from maze-like dungeons filled with assorted monsters, baddies, puzzles and skulking villains, located across the island
Combat occurs in real-time, with the red hero jumping and slashing and collecting various bits and bobs that explode out of monsters' bodies when they die
You can switch at any time to another character, who wields a different weapon, with different enemies being more or less vulnerable to different attacks
It's pretty much Ys, ya' see?Zwei: The Ilvard Insurrection differentiates itself mostly with how seamless the combat is--even though your playing as two different characters, mechanically it only ever *feels* like one (and they share the same health pool and stats)--and through its innovative, rather transformative leveling system
To level up in Zwei (actually Zwei II; don't ask) you need experience, but you can only earn experience by eating food (which heals you)
If you don't eat, you don't grow stronger
Furthermore, once you have a stack of 10 food items, you can exchange them for 1 food item of the next tier-up
So, for example, say you have 10 Red Apples that will give you +5 experience each
If you eat them one-at-a-time, that's 50 experience
But you can exchange them for 1 Superior Green Apple that gives 100 experience
This creates an interesting dynamic where the more skilled you are at the game, but more experience you'll be able to accumulate, but consuming items for experience means having fewer healing items at hand, thus encouraging more skilled play
It's a really effective system that gives the player a lot of freedom with how difficult combat is, and the diminishing experience rewards imbue many of the harder fights (the bosses) with a great deal of tension
Beyond that, Zwei is pretty much exactly as good of a game as you'd expect from Falcom, with as good of a localization as you'd expect from XSEED
That is to say it is a very good game with a very good localization (though the default sound mixing leaves a bit to be desired--you'll probably want to turn the BGM waaaaay down before you start)
Tonally Zwei is a bit lighter than you might expect--like the Disgaea games, this is a story walking a tightrope between serious and silly, and for the most part it succeeds brilliantly
The music is catchy and memorable, the characters are all quirky and unique (w/ lots of funny dialog), and much like the classic Trails series, every NPC in the game gets new dialog after every major story beat that eventually coaelesce into these fun little miniature character-arcs and stories for those who are willing to seek them out

												Good:+ Classic JRPG feeling+ Unique Potions=EXP mechanic+ Outstanding music+ Fun and addicting gameplay+ English dub is surprisingly not embarrassing most of the times+ SubaruNo good:- No official Japanese voice acting (although there's a mod that fixes this)- Most of the lines have no voice acting in both Japanese and English (although the English version has much more voice acting)- A little old (graphics, controls, pacing, etc)- You can get "stuck" once or twice, when the game wouldn't let you leave an area until you poke around and figure it outI played the original in Japanese when it came out 9 years ago, and loved it although I understood almost nothing
I started playing and immediately remembered the addicting feeling of running through a dungeon and collecting everything I can
This game is pure fun for me, and it's great that now I can understand everything
			
Posted: 1 November
												I'll keep this really simplePros:+Main Characters are likable+English Voice Acting isn't too bad+Addictive Gameplay+Really interesting System where Food is not only utilized for healing, but also beneficial for leveling up+Awesome Soundtrack!Cons:-Japanese Audio can't really be changed in the game's menu
You kind of have to change it in the game's properties? I found that kind of annoying-Dungeons could be a little better design wiseIf you REALLY like the Ys games, you'll enjoy this
It's very similar, but done in it's own way
Falcom has always been good at making things refreshing
:^]			
Posted: 3 November
Zwei: The Ilvard Insurrection is a charming and fun action RPG
The combat is simple but really fun and fluid
You can control two characters and switch them with the press of a button, for melee and long range / magic attacks
+ Cute and charming art style
+ Great soundtrack and english voice acting
+ Great controller support
+ Iconic leveling system based on food
+ Great story (with a pinch of humor!) and localization
+ Dungeon exploring goodness
+ Lots of extras and things to collect
A must buy for RPG lovers and Falcom fans!

												This game is the best JRPG I played in a VERY long time
 This JRPG is very traditional, got that sort of tales of destiny style with mix with a little of "chrono trigger",  threads of fate

you dont see much games like this now of days

i like that Falcom live up to their name, and always make a PC port to almost if not all their games
I always love their unique style, very good storyline, amazing OST soundtrack hands down
and the hack'n'slashing :)this game is worth every penny



to really sum it all up This game Zwei: Ilvard Insurrection is freaking AMAZING
			
Posted: 5 November
												I always love the way falcom write story and their NPC, it has its own charms compared to other developer
The attention to detail is also nice
Let me give you example :~ When you explore the world and visiting a place before the main story advance to that area, there will be a small talk when the game ask you to visit that area again "Oh, that's the place we've been visiting before"
This might be a small things, but i really appreciate this small detail
It gives more natural sense to the character and story
This XSEED localizations also has more voiced lines (English) than the original (Japanese)
As for the rest of the positive point, i think other reviewer already cover it
The things i dislike from this game is the camera, you cant rotate/adjust the camera like in similar falcom title (Gurumin)
Really recommend this if you are into JRPG, dungeon crawler, game with cutesy artstyle and some funny gag(there's even an intentional cringy dad joke!)
			
Posted: 1 November
												If you like your dungeon crawling with a bit of goofiness added in, you'll love this game
The combat is fluid, the main characters are likable and have a comedy-esque routine feel to them, and the flow of the game feels great
I give the game 8 KNEEL BEFORE ME's/10			
Posted: 2 November
												Zwei II + is a pretty easy and less mature dungeon crawler than almost all its rivals and in it you control a ranged and melee character where you switch between them depending on what button you press
The music runs from ok to bland and the action is rarely intense, but there's something about it always liked
  I've been playing this game for what seems like a decade since I bought the original japanese release not too long after it came out
I guess I've very bias in recommending this since it appeals to me but I will fully admit it will bore most people
 Pick it up if you want another japanesy game where you walk around and hit things with a button press
			
Posted: 9 November
												Perhaps one of the most charming games I've played in a long time
The story, characters, setting and music is top notch
To put it simply, it gives me Brave Fencer Musashi vibes
It's a fantastic feeling that I longed for
Gameplay is good as well
It has a simplified Ys vibe going which holds up pretty well
My main gripe with the gameplay though is the late-game where things can get pretty broken in your favor if you dig too deep
It just leads to bland gameplay
With that said, I suggest leaving obvious extra late-game content for after you beat the game
I think that should lead to a better balanced and fun late-game
Besides, there is a NG+ mode with extra stuff to get
You can be overpowered in that NG+ run
			
Posted: 4 November
												It's not difficult to tell that I'm a Falcom fanboy
 Ever since I played Ys III and Faxanadu decades ago, and renewed when I saw the Ys II Eternal trailer over 15 years ago, I've been helplessly in love with the games this company makes
 I've imported several of their games over the years, but not being able to read Japanese has limited my enjoyment of them
I imported Zwei II+ 7 years ago and loved the game
 The gameplay, the music, the charm, the weird workout guy, it was the perfect package
 But I had no freaking clue what they were saying!  It was a very straightforward game so I was able to finish it and complete everything, but I was always sad I couldn't enjoy it as much as I should
Thank goodness for XSEED feeding my inner fanboy, as I can finally enjoy Zwei II the way I was supposed to the first time!  Everything that made the game wonderful is still there, but being able to relate to the quirky characters and the story has made it so much more enjoyable
 It was funny to find out that the little trio of fairies are bickering about where to open a tailoring shop! :DThere are some minor issues that are worth mentioning
 The font isn't perfect, the bottom part of some letters will get cut off
 It doesn't impact the game, but it is a minor annoyance factor (that will hopefully be patched out in the future)
 Additionally the framerate performance is not up to what I would expect from a game that released almost a decade ago
 I can play games with complicated 3D graphics like Destiny 2 at relatively high settings, but I have to turn down shadows in this to achieve 30 FPS
 This game wasn't written native to DX9 so it may just be growing pains preventing it from achieving optimal performance
I love Zwei, and I'm very happy XSEED brought it to English speaking audiences
 The game is amazing, and it's an easy recommendation to make!

												Having completed the Steam version and PS1 version back to back, here are a few things I noted:- The button layout can be confusing in certain sequences if using a controller, for example; telling you to press B2 or B5 as instructed, requiring you to remember your controllers personal button layout
- All polygons look much better in this version, obviously, but it often clashes very unnaturally with the low res backdrops
- A lot of the ported-to-midi music is noticably worse than the original, some peices sounding broken and off key- Character portraits look a lot nicer and more detailed in Steam version
- The gameplay seems to have been sped up by about 25%, which makes the frame rate APPEAR smoother, although animations still seem to be quite choppy
Particularly makes battles and traversing the world map seem much smoother!- Various scenes will load much faster, ie; card battles and the startup screen, which is a big quality of life difference!- 360 degree movement doesn't work by default, only 8 direction
I'm not sure if this can be modded
When all is said and done, I personally prefer the original PS1 version, but if you don't have access to it, this version is not a bad option either
Hope this was helpful

												Hello, my old friend
Years ago, I remember walking into a local Wal-Mart to browse through the bargain bin of Psx games
There I found a green label greatest hits game called Final Fantasy VII
The blonde man on the cover holding a giant sword tore away at my curiosity
So my allowance was spent on this mysterious game I had yet to hear about
Not very long after beating it, I realized I was in love
"Where has this game been all my life?" I asked myself
A few weeks later, after saving up my allowances for a NEW psx title, I returned to the same local Wal-Mart and began browsing the sliding door glass case
"Hmm


Gran Turismo sure looks fun


Tomb Raider



maybe


", but there at the bottom in the left hand corner it sat
Final Fantasy VIII
I must've screeched from excitement
Though none of these characters on the case looked familiar


"So the games don't connect then?" I pondered


In a rush to get the game, I flagged the worker down to open the case
Game in hand, I opened the lid of my Psx, removed Dark Stone, and placed in Disc 1


Never has a game brought as much excitement as seeing this sequel that day
It was the best, is the best, and will forever be the best
Now I am no longer a child, at 25 I have 2 children of my own and hope one day they too find their "FFVIII"

												Edit: Update to the title on 20th June 2014 added more cheats - no fixes to any of the technical issues
Before I get started, Yes I know about the mods to fix it
We shouldn't have to mod the game to get content Square Enix claimed was in the game
FINAL FANTASY VII (Yes, 7) was released on Steam a little while ago
And while many were happy, many were disappointed
Square Enix released the game with awful audio
Entire vocals were missing from some, for example, the infamous "One Winged Angel" BGM, and the audio in general sounded very subdued
A modder, Assimi, went out of his way to patch the BGM to the quality it should be
Many months came and went, and eventually, one day, Square Enix released a patch, which upgraded the audio to a better quality
We then hear FINAL FANTASY VIII will be coming to Steam, with what Square Enix claimed - PlayStation Quality Audio! Superb! They won't make the same mistake twice! Surely? Especially not after such a statement


We were wrong
FINAL FANTASY VIII Steam Edition is an almost identical copy of the original FINAL FANTASY VIII PC Port, except this time with added layers of DRM, cheats, and ruined FMVs, along side all the issues of the original port
So all the issues:1) Background music uses low quality midi
2) Sound effects uses low quality audio (Quetzalcoatls roar sticks out the most)
3) Limited to 8-way movement, rather than the 360 movement on PS14) Still uses B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 button prompts if using a Gamepad
5) FMVs have been giving a horrible filter to "upscale" them
This blur removes a tonne of detail from the FMVs
6) Linear Filtering simply blurs all the textures, and makes the world map look disgusting
So let's go through these 1 by 1
Links to any mods mentioned will be put at the bottom of the review
Issue 1) Background Music
This is horrible
My main problem here is Square Enix LIED to us
When they announced FF8 Steam Edition they shouted "PLAYSTATION QUALITY AUDIO!" from the rooftops
They did not deliver
Here's a comparison:Steam Edition:http://www
youtube
com/watch?v=93tFd5jeFbUPlayStation Version:http://www
youtube
com/watch?v=1eU0tRBHnE0If you're using any decent speakers, you can hear the massive difference
My speakers cost me about £10, and I'm not even an audiophile (hence the £10 speakers) and I can tell the massive difference in quality
Thankfully - Thanks to DLPB of the QHIMM forums this can be fixed and modded out (and the BGM can be changed to whatever songs you want, just make sure they're 
OGG and looped correctly)
But
It shouldn't need to be in the first place
Square Enix claimed the game has PS Audio
It doesn't
Issue 2) Similar to issue 1
Unfortunately here I don't have a comparison
But again - SE Claimed PS Quality Audio
They did not deliver
Issue 3) 8 way movement
If you're on KB+M This is absolutely fine since you're inherently limited to 8 way
However many people, with this being a PlayStation game, would play with a gamepad, and if you do, think again about using that wonderful analog stick for 360 movement
Issue 4) So you'd expect, with this being a PlayStation game to use X Square Triangle Circle right, or maybe they updated it to ABXY? Unfortunately not
The game uses the possibly ancient Dinput, because forget updating the game to a more modern form of input, right? Way too much effort
Issue 5) So instead of doing a proper job of editing the FMVs too look decent at high-res, like the 1080p standard, or like me, 1440p, Square Enix applied a filter to the entirety of every cutscene
It's a blur filter
It blurs the FMVs to remove the "blockiness" that would occur from upscaling and especially when in motion
Instead of putting in effort to do this, carefully applying filters when and where necersarry, they made it global
Destroying massive amounts of detail in the progress
Fortunately, someone on the Steam Discussion forums applied a better filter, though still not perfect
Issue 6) Linear Filtering is 50/50
It looks okay
In combat, it looks good
Applied to character models, it looks good
Applied to the world map? Oh my
Just look at this mess: http://i

com/p7QGH2w
pngCompared with it turned off: http://i
imgur
com/pA9jlED
png--------So
What's better about the Steam release? Well the improved hardware compatability is nice
Chocobo World is included as it was with the original release too, so if you never got a chance to play and have the benefits of that, that's a bonus
You also get achievements if you're into those
Cheats
More controversial
The cheats this time aren't as bad as FINAL FANTASY VII
Why? It's just magic
And that's a non-issue if you read up on how to use the card game mechanics and refining to get spells very quickly, and very early
Indeed, you can get many powerful spells for junction via card refining very early on that aren't even included in the cheat
All it really does is remove some of the grind


Which I guess is okay
And well slightly improved graphics due to the higher character model polygons
But that's about it
I would not recommend this in it's current state
This is simply a re-release of the old PC port, with very minimal effort put in to actually updating it
My recommendation would go out to purchasing a PlayStation copy of the game and playing it that way
You can get it for cheaper than Steam on the PlayStation store

												I don't care what everyone says, the draw system is great!


Not manual drawing, but card converting, it is so much easier and makes the game much more enjoyable since instead of spending hours drawing, you spend that time playing a really decent card minigame
The game is only difficult if you choose not to understand junctioning, it's a very simple system where you junction magic straight to your character stats, an example would be junctioning 100 pain spells to your character's elemental attack makes 90% of your hits deal blind, silence and poison damage combined
Junctioning 100 Hastes to your character's speed attribute gives them a 210% faster boost in combat, etc


I beat the game in under 60 hours (that includes deep sea facility, ultimecias castle, Omega weapon boss and all ultimate weapon ugrades 100%) on my first playthrough
If you give the game a chance to explain itself and listen to it, you will find a wonderful Final Fantasy experience
Sure the story might fall flat in disc 2 to 3 but the character evolution from an introvert, obnoxious and self centered mercenary to a broader thinker, developing genuine emotions for the people around him and conquers evil with the power of trust with his companions is told in such a realistic sense
Playing this game after playing Final Fantasy IV, V, VII and X, VIII feels very fresh and I would recommend any Final Fantasy player who has not tried it, to give it a shot

												If you've never played a Final Fantasy game in your life, then here's a great place to start
The Final Fantasy games have suffered from their ups and downs over the years, and VIII is no exception
If you take the time to search for opinions on the internet, you'll find a myriad of opinions ranging from one extreme to the other
At it's heart though, I've found the game enjoyable, replayable - and the few aspects I do not like are swept under the rug
As with most FF games, it relies on turn-based combat, but don't let that fool you
It is possible (and quite easy when you get the hang of it) to finish the game without levelling any of your characters at all
There are side quests aplenty, including the Triple Triad card game, which is fun for the most part, and the chocobo forest mini game
The story is quite in-depth, so while I don't recommend it for the very young, based on this, it is still age and gender friendly - there is romance, comedy, plot twists, and a story and world so rich you might just not want to leave it
The art style might take some getting used to, but the menu, and how magic and summons integrate with characters, may be the biggest hurdle for new players
Simply put - I didn't use magic
Summons are "junctioned" to characters to grant them abilities, not the least of which is the ability to link collected magicks to your stats, giving them a significant boost
This is the primary method of getting stronger
As you level, so too do the enemies, meaning you can't outlevel them
It is a unique system among FF games, but somehow it works, and works well with practice
If you're already familiar with FF games, you might have already decided whether or not to get this game, but if you haven't, it's definitely worth a look-see

												Final Fantasy VIII is my favorite in the series! but, don't download this though
You can't play until you make an account with Square-Enix, and you have to login EVERY time you want to play
Internet down? Tough, can't play
 It's a single player game and you have to be online 24/7 to play it

Early Access Review
								Let me qualify here, I like this game quite a bit and I think it does deserve all the praise it recieved
So why the negative review? Well for one, Steam doesn't give me the option to have a neutral review, and two I want to give potential buyers some reasons as to why they wouldn't want to buy in
Most of the negative reviews don't really do that, at least not in detail
I've been following this game for a long time, a lot of love has gone in to its development, and it really shows through the quirky spritework
The problem with the development is that it's just been so painfully slow that I can't recommend spending $15 on it at this point, because the desire to check back in after a few months when nearly nothing new has been added fades away after over two years; and that's how long I've had this game
It was first released for beta purchase around April 1, 2014
Over the course of two years, the story has essentially gained one new dungeon (of which there was only one before) along with a marginal amount of content that shows this game is going to be in development for many more years
The content that's there is good, sure, but it's not so stellar as to justify playing through the story more than once or twice
The real mode that seems to add playtime to this game is its arcade mode, which is roguelike in nature, and requires a good understanding of enemy/boss patterns to do well in
Players play through two floors representing each area in the story mode, complete with enemies from said area, and have no chances to heal except at the end of each floor
Despite having numerous floors and all of the enemies from the story mode, it's pretty light on content in terms of roguelikes
There are unlockables and such, but they only give minor advantages, and as a result adding more floors to the mode seems kind of pointless in its current state
Even after over two years of going back to this game I struggle to reach the 7th floor of what must be over 14 at this point
There isn't much incentive to bother trying to reach those floors either
So should you buy this game? Well that depends on how patient you are
After two years I'm pretty burned out and don't see myself playing this game for a long, long time
If you think you can wait for what could be 5 years to play a finished product and want to support the developers, then by all means get this game
If not, keep an eye on it and pick it up a few years down the road when it has a more justifiable amount of content to offer
Edit: Thanks for all the support guys, since this review got so much attention I want to add a little more
If you're worried about spending $15 on a game that won't be finished, don't be
This game is a safe buy in my opinion
Even though the development has been very slow, it has been extremely consistent and the team behind this game definitely has what it takes to finish the job
Secrets of Grindea has been in the works since 2011, and the quality of the content in it has only improved since
Their dev blog[www
secretsofgrindea
com] has a weekly recap that is posted nearly every week without missing a beat
So if you're interested, definitely keep an eye on this game, because it is one of the better early access titles out there, despite the slow development speed

Early Access Review
								Been playing this game now for well over 100+ hours, I'm THAT impressed with it that I have even made a guides page on my own website for it
IF your a fan of the 16bit era of 'action rpg' games, ones such as Legend of Zelda, Secret of Mana, Secret of Evermore, and Chrono Trigger THEN this game is certainly for you, you won't be disappointed
Here's my PROS for BETA 0
007b release

Graphics: The graphics in the game are very colorful, vibrant and unique to the game, it almost reminds me of Earthbound graphics for the Super Nintendo/Famicom
I would NOT change anything at all with them, it suits the game well
The icons, monsters, houses, shops, character design menu, magic spells, the menus, etc are all really great and fits in well with the game also
Music/Sound Effects: These are great, all the music fits well in the areas that are in the game for you to visit, and the sound effects for spells are great also
The minor little things like walking past NPC's as they giggle at you or HO! HO! HO! as you get near them is a great addition
Dynamic sound effects such as getting closer to fountains the water gets louder etc is also implemented into the game, another nice addition
Story: The story seems to be straight forward, collect 'Ancient Artifacts' that can help bring someone back to life, in the mean time there's someone keeping track of you gatehring these items for their own ends

probably to rule the world or destory it

(not got that far into the game where that person's reasons are revealed)
So it's a pretty basic story but don't let that stop you getting this game

it's fantastic
Additional: There is tons of stuff to do in this game

Crafting, Monster Card Hunting, Trophy Collecting & Achievements, Fishing, taking part in festival mini-games, Arena Challenges (solo and in challenge friends mode', Arcade Mode

a soon to be added Housing System

AND there is MUCH more planned for future update releases
The devs seems to be listening to the players and what they want, THIS is a good thing

trust me
Here are my CONS for BETA 0
007b release

1
For the moment there's NOT that many side-quests in the game, it could do with more
2
The areas have so much wasted space that they could do with adding more things into them, like more side-quests
3
The towns dont have much to do in them to be honest

other than 'Evergrind City', they need to add more stuff in
4
The devs need to work on getting more updates out quicker, I know there's only 3 or 4 people working on this project but it's been going on now for a couple of years, and asking people for money to buy the game should give them the incentive to push updates out faster
Conclusion: In any case, the game is fantastic as it is for the moment, it's certainly a game I will be recommending to people on my website and also to the 'Facebook Groups' i'm a member of that are old school rpg gaming based
I can't wait for the game to be fully finished so I am able to play it right through without having to stop at certain points and wait for the next lot of patches to come out
So what you doing reading THIS

? go buy and PLAY IT NOW!

Early Access Review
								Where to begin
 This game is as advertised
 It's a game similar to Secret of Mana (SNES), Crystalis (NES), Zelda-esque, Final Fantasy Adventure (Original GB)  and many other old RP games
You can customize your character physically by gender, colour of your clothes, hair style and colour, and name
 Additonally, you get a vanity part for your hat, face, weapon, and shield
The gameplay is very nice, you can be a full warrior, full mage, whatever you want to be; a combination if you want
 Although, being a healer is not an option
This is a beta game, it's not complete, from my estimation it's a little near half done, if that
You can play cooperatively, over the internet, using your steam friends list or direct IP!  This is awesome!You grind in the game, if that wasn't obvious
 (What old school console RPG didn't have you grind?  It's part of the fun!)The transition between keyboard and controller playing is seamless, you just start using your keyboard and it swaps to keyboard mode, you use your controller, it swaps to controller mode
 I found this particularly great!The host of the game's save file is progressed in the story, however - if you're not the host - you keep everything you gained
 You simply have to play through the story (by hosting or single player) to go through it
 The rewards though, you do not acquire again, you already have them!  :DThis is an awesome game!  As far as I'm aware only three people are working on it and they're from Sweden
 They have me as a fan
 The sprite animation is awesome, the artwork for the avatars is great and expresses much emotion, and the game looks very polished for a beta that is not even half done!I used to pay $50+ US dollars for games like these, and wait years for the next to come out
 I love the game very much, and I haven't even started exploring the Arcade Mode
tl;dr - Buy this game if you loved Secret of Mana or any similar games on the console or PC
 Especially if you want to play it co-op with friends over the internet!

Early Access Review
								To review this game is to review it in two parts
Story Mode: An amazing adventure akin to the days of Secret of Mana, Sword of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3
Quick swordplay with an oldschool-meets-polish aesthetic that's filled with charm
Combat is quick paced and - with over 20 skills and spells with multiple charge levels, along with 30 talents - more or less unique for every character made
Every attack, skill and spell feels as if it has weight behind it for a thoroughly satisfying brawl through hordes of monsters and challenging bosses
The story is serious at times, tongue in cheek in others without outright resorting to cheese
There's plenty of side-quests, mini-games and collectables, but contrary to the name no grinding appears to be necessary
The shield is as relevant to the gameplay as the sword is, every attack can be blocked if you know the exact timing, reminding me of the days of 'Timed Hits' from Super Mario RPG and Final Fantasy 8
The music is beautiful, the characters well written to make you love or hate them, I can't say enough good things about Story Mode
The only shame is it's incomplete, but between pet taming, treasure hunting, fishing, card collecting, playing with 4 player online co-op and duking it out in the arena, there's more than enough content to keep me busy between updates
Arcade Mode: All the rules from Story Mode no longer apply, Arcade Mode feels like an entirely different game
Less Secret of Mana, more Binding of Isaac
You start in an empty plain and delve within a randomized roguelike-esque labyrinth
Each room is different every time, filled with traps and all manners of enemies or bosses not present in Story Mode
HP is precious, mastery of skills, spells and shielding is required
Arcade Mode is perfect for sinking endless hours into as you try to go deeper and deeper into the labyrinth, gaining points and essence to level up and expand your town, unlock new NPCs to aid you, take on quests for rare and unique loot not found anywhere else
Skills and spells are best experimented with in here to see which build suits you best
With friends it's harder, but with 4 people on screen the monsters barely stand a chance once you hit your groove
The online leaderboards for Arcade Mode help to give it even more replay value by trying to do better than your friends or complete strangers to try and hit #1
If you have any doubts whatsoever, try the demo
With an hour of Story Mode gameplay, several hours of Arcade Mode and co-op bundled into the demo, it's a great teaser for what to expect moving forward
Tip: Opt into 'Frontline' by selecting SoG in your library if you want quicker updates
The normal version receives slower updates, but your experience in the game will be much smoother

Early Access Review
This review is based on the game in its current state at the time of posting and is completely my opinion
Yours may differ to mine
I also only really played the story mode and did co-op
Secrets of Grindea is an action RPG with a major focus on the story and meticulous detail worked into its environments and graphics
I just completed everything in the Secrets of Grindea that is currently available in the version out at this time and I have to say that what they have so far is fan-bloody-tastic
Things I liked Fantastic pixel graphics with fluid animations that make me say "wow" in some circumstances An interesting story with creative sidequests and lovely characters Hats and lots of them
I'm a Team Fortress 2 man and I found the choice of hats to be most adequate
The plethora of references
I won't spoil any of them, but they're there
The soundtrack consisted of fantastic tracks that all matched their locations in game
Not a single track sounded out of place in this game
Things I didn't like all that much The story was a bit short
But that can be attributed to the fact that it's in early access
The limited supply of weapons available was quite disheartening as I found myself wielding the most powerful one-handed sword in the game about 1/2 of the way through the story with not much choice on what else to use
Player customzation is unfortunately incredibly limited with the only changable things being colour of clothing, hair style, hats, and facewear
I found myself yearning for a dress but was sadly stuck with my adventurers outfit
I don't want efficieny, damn it, I want to look fabulous!Overall after I played through and 100% completed the game with a mate of mine we both left with a feeling of satisfaction and the desire to one day return to Grindea when more content is released
What I'm trying to say is buy the game already
It's worth it

Posted: 18 July, 2015
Early Access Review
								Let me start off by saying if you think this game doesn't have grinding in it


then seek help
There are people who care about you and don't wish to see you go down this path (not me per se, we've only just met
But I'm sure there are people who love you very much
Like your grandmother or that neighbor with the nice rack
Anyway, I'm going off topic here)
Secrets of Grindea is a tongue-in-cheek RPG that draws heavily on the nostalgia of games like Secrets of Mana, Zelda: Link to the Past, and Illusion of Gaia
The sprite animations and colorful backgrounds mimic classic 16-bit games and go well with the fluidity of combat
NPCs are prevalent in towns and in the overworld to the point where the world does not feel empty and that their character is not some lone warrior living on a planet full of monsters (though that sounds like an awesome game idea
Dibs)
Each area has its own unique feel that you will hopefully enjoy because the aforementioned grinding will have you staying in one area killing the same enemies for drops
The combat is extremely straight forward where your basic attack is spamming one button or having a charged skill where you hold and release one button
Let me go on record to say that I do not think this is a bad thing
Sure, you won't be chaining attacks that culminate in your wooden sword hitting with the power of a tactical nuclear device, but you will be unlocking and upgrading skills that define the way you, the player, wish to play
The skills are limited (for now I hope) to a 1 handed skill set, 2 handed skill set, and a magic skill set
The player is able to mix and match these skills however he or she wants and has the option to refund some or all of the skill points that were spent by spending gold (this is done in the menu rather than with an NPC)
There is a bow the player can get from a sidequest but so far doesn't have a dedicated set of skills to leveling up the damage
The story is pretty straightforward for an RPG of the era it emulates: You are a guy or gal that wakes up, is handing a magical bag that can hold anything without weight restrictions and are sent out to become a renowned member of the "Collectors"
It seems, from the start, that these "Collectors" are a bunch of people that go out and collect cool, rare things
It is all very prestigious
And dangerous
And sexy
Seriously, so far every NPC that isn't a Collector is jealous of you
Normally one would have to buy seven sports cars and have an attractive life mate to get that kind of recognition
This game hands that to you right off the bat (Disclaimer: The developers of this game will NOT buy you cars nor introduce you to hot people for a hook up)
My main concern with the game is that it seems too short and I say that knowing full well that not all the features in the game have been implemented; this is not the reason that I feel the game is too short
The in-game journal keeps a record of all the enemies in the game and what they drop when killed
Enemies you haven't killed yet appear in the journal as silhouettes
Upon counting (yes, I did a math) I found that there are only about thirty (30) enemies total in the game including boss enemies
This, in my opinion, is a low number which may make gamers shy away from the game
An increase in not just the number of potential enemies but different types of enemies will add more variety to the grinding while still keeping the player's interest high
I eagerly await the areas that have not yet been implemented to the game
Now, I'm not going to end this review by giving the game a number based off of 5 nor 10 nor 325745456415 (<--- not sure what this number is
It just punched my Numpad to come up with something ridiculous)
I will end this review with just a few simple words:I enjoy this game
I hope you enjoy it too
Still enjoying the game after so long

We're using our DnD characters
I love this so much
As does she
When my birthday hits I'll buy it for another friend and you know what




I will buy someone a coffee <3
Keep developing guys and gals
You've made my day with the wimsical game
It brought back good memories of playing resident evil together, zelda games, and animal crossing
We have fishing contests with each other, and when we summon our cute monsters we give them names
My friend's ice summon was named Baby Meta/ Baby Metaknight <3, and the cloud summon I use is named Malo
It seems my friend though has the heart of the cards as she finds them all leaving me in the dust
We'll play this game till we get 100% for everyone
Thank you so much for your hard work
You've made two best friends so happy

								I wasnt %100 sure about this game until i finally said screw it and bought it
It's like if legend of zelda, chrono trigger, and secrets of mana had a baby and taught it funny one liners
10/10 i highly recommend
Will edit post once ive put more time into it
Edit: So far ive made it to the second main boss
My thoughts so far is the bosses are well made and very creative
They are hard to fight and you have to learn every pattern very well if you hope to beat them
There is a little grind in the game but thats all just part of the experience
Edit: 2I have made it as far as i can in early access
Loved it the whole way through
Cannot wait for a new update to add more content

								Whats there is mindblowingly brilliant, but i wouldn't currently recommend a purchase simply because i feel this game deserves to be experienced fully
 Updates to Secrets of Grindea come in really really slowly, and while i love the game, i feel it should have been finished a long time ago
 When the game releases content complete, i will without a doubt alter this review to reflect that and recommend it heartily, if i haven't feel free to poke me on Twitter (Squishydew)

Early Access Review
								It seems that a lot of the top reviews have forgotten something important from the devs:  “Please read all the Early Access info before buying!”  So, before you read any reviews,  please  read that EA description
Back? Alright
The Concerns The main concerns I’ve seen from top commenters are amount of content and update frequency
Interestingly enough, the devs address both
First, content
Many complaints tend to stem from the fact that, if you skip cutscenes and side missions, there’s about four hours of content, and their disappointment at its limited playtime, etc
However, the developers noted this in the EA info: “it takes about 4 hours to complete if you skip most of the side content
If you want to do everything currently in Story Mode, expect to invest at least 10 hours
” Does this mean you should buy the game immediately? No
It just makes those complaints about content seem a little less grounded when they were given warning
Next, update frequency
This seems to be the major complaint with most Not Recommended reviews
Surprise surprise, the devs were prepared again
 “If frequent updates and/or a determinable release date is very important to you, we advise you to wait for the finished product!”  Again, those complaints lose a little luster once it’s clear that there was a warning
With a large development team, big and detailed games can take years
This game is being made by three people
It’s going to take a long time
However, as of today on day of writing, March 27, 2017, the devs posted an update that ends the area that will be the largest until the game’s very end, which means the update frequency should increase
(Sidenote: I don’t blame reviewers for not knowing that
I only learned it existed twenty minutes ago
But, it is important to note
) In any case, the update frequency is pretty good for three people on this intensive of a game
With that out of the way, let’s move to: The Gameplay This is the star of the game
The swing arcs are clearly defined for each weapon, the animations are smooth, it feels good to hit enemies, with enemy recoil and appropriate sound effects, and a wide variety of character expansion options
In Grindea, there is no class system
When you level up, you receive points that you can put into skills, spells, and stat bonuses of your choice
Want to be a brutal tank who crushes their enemies? Do it
Want to be a deadly mage who roasts and electrocutes their opponents from afar? Do it
Want to be a glass cannon who can crit 25% of the time for 165% of their damage? Do it
That’s where the replayability comes from: a wide variety of combat options and stat choices
I personally have all nine character slots filled with hard-hitting tanks and long-range mages and spellswords and summoners and so on
There are even a couple support spells, with more planned for implementation
You can also get a pet by taming some of the common enemies in the game
You can feed them, and they’ll give you stat bonuses if you put enough into one stat
 Grindea is also very playable with a controller, and I recommend it
While keyboard is good, a controller hearkens back to SNES-era RPG’s and feels great
This game also doesn’t want you to grind
Yes, it’s in the name
That’s the joke
The more you try to farm in this game, the more enemies that appear
You can get overwhelmed if you aren’t careful
The Story I honestly love this game’s story
While the core plot is pretty simple, get some things so the world doesn’t explode, it’s really the characters that make Grindea feel alive
Every character’s text box portraits are detailed and have multiple expressions
Their in-game sprites look good and have smooth animation
These animations give personality to the characters and distinguish them from “blue-haired dude” and “is that Cloud?” There’s growth and blooming relationships between characters
Even with the protagonist, I was pleasantly surprised
Rather than being The Great Hero of the Ancient Prophecy, you’re just a kid doing their job as a Collector, like a lot of other people
You fall into having to save the world rather than being born as the Savior of the Earth or Whatever
You end up “borrowing” some Really Old Super Dangerous and Powerful Artifacts not because a legend told you to, nor because you woke up and decided to, nor because your dead parent spoke to you in a dream or whatever
You just end up having to save the world
There’s charm, wit, humor, and no end of pun names
Singleplayer vs
Multiplayer There are arguments for both sides of this
While singleplayer is viable and the same experience, you’re just not as strong as with others
Some bosses are very tough without help
 Looking at you, Seasons Hydra
 With friends that also enjoy this genre, Grindea is excellent
As long as everyone has a half-decent router and a computer that meets the minimum on the store page, you probably won’t have issues
While large areas do take a while to load on less superb computers, it’s nothing unbearable
Unless  someone’s  ping is 30,000
So, if you’re playing this alone, it’s still fun, but you’re going to have to work harder and longer than with others simply because more people make the game easier
The Verdict If you want a finished game, don’t buy this
If you want a perfectly polished game, don’t buy this
If you want a game that absolutely positively has no bugs, don’t buy this
If what I and the store page have told you has you itching to buy this, buy it
It’s a lot of fun and a good game
If you’re on the fence, pick up the demo
It’ll give you a better sense of gameplay than words ever could
I came into this Early Access game expecting just that
I was pleasantly surprised
 I recommend this game for stellar characters, graphics, animations, music, and mechanics
It’s not finished, certainly
It takes time to make a game, certainly
There are issues, certainly
But what’s there is good
Just because it’s slow doesn’t make it bad
			
Posted: 7 March
												Note: I have spent 100+ hours on the game on PS4 (Chinese version released back in January), bought this in steam to support the developers, hence the low hour count
tl;dr : Scroll down to blue text for a quick summary
For those who are new to the Atelier Series of games,you should check out my review on the previous installment of the series  here, many aspects are similar and carry over to this game
I'll get straight to the point here, the main aspects which Atelier Firis differ from Sophie:Instead of choosing a location on the world map and "fast-travelling" there, the whole world map is now connected by paths which you'll walk through
(Some sort of fast-travelling is still available, and other methods of transport can be unlocked later in game
)Each area of the world map is now much larger than the previous game, and is one single large area, instead of a few small sections separated by loading screens
(Sophie's world system: Choose destination on world map, then "dungeon crawl" with multiple sections
)(Firis' world system : Open world exploration, though not seamless as there are (short) loading screens between areas
)There is no "home town" which you need to return to after each expedition, you now carry your home/atelier/crafting room) with you as you travel!The grid-jigsaw alchemy system is retained, but there are some changes in mechanics
The battle system is also changed, which I would not delve into the details
Weapons and gear can now grant the wielder new skills, depending on the gear & your alchemy process
The main story is divided into 2 segments, the first segment has a clear goal with a time limit, but don't fret as it is quite lenient
The 2nd half has no time limit, and grants the player complete freedom in exploration and quests
What I think is better compared to Atelier Sophie:The whole world feels much more connected, as it basically transformed into a true open world exploration system
The exploration feels more open and free as you carry your atelier/home with you, eliminating the need to backtrack and return to a main town/settlement, which breaks the "flow" of exploration
The 1st half of the story basically tells you to travel from one corner of the world map to the other, guiding the player to explore the world
Combining the above 3 points, the exploration is miles ahead of Atelier Sophie, and truly fits the "Mysterious Journey" subtitle
This is subjective, but I find the alchemy system more fun in this one than in Sophie
Also subjective, IMO the soundtrack of this one is better than in Sophie
What I think is worse compared to Atelier Sophie:Character interaction
In the 1st half of the story, interaction with some side-characters are pretty shallow (or even awkward)
It gets better in the 2nd half though, as character specific quest lines are unlocked
Battle system
The system felt less in depth this time around
The alchemy proficiency/skill level for each item
You need to craft the same item multiple times before you can use your full alchemy abilities when crafting them
This is unneccessary "grinding" IMO, a minor annoyance
Firis' outfits' abilities
Different outfits for Firis grants her different (useful) bonuses, the need to change clothing every time you want a different ability is a bit irritating
(In New Game+ all abilities are active at all times, eliminating this issue, but you need to finish the game once first, due to this fact I semi-rushed through my first playthrough
)The requirements for unlocking alchemy recipes are not clearly presented to players, players going in completely blind may have trouble discovering them
Although the game has a system which allows player to bypass these requirements (limited use) which alleviates the issues somewhat
A general summary of why I recommend this game (May contain points above):Happy atmosphere & relaxing gameplay - the defining aspects of the Atelier Series IMO
In-depth alchemy/crafting system which is very rewarding when mastered
Fantastic world exploration and sense of journey
Great soundtrack, some of which are live recordings
If you liked Atelier Sophie, you most likely would like this too
The quality of games in the Atelier Series are pretty consistent
This game's weaknesses, and other issues that you should be wary of:No strong story or epic & heroic chapters, pretty light in general
Less character interaction/development than other full-fledged story-rich RPGs
Battles system quite simple/shallow, not quite strategic
Although this is the 2nd installment, new players don't need to play the 1st, not much is lost apart from background lore of the world & some side characters
Potential UI element quality, performance & control mapping issues due to being a PS4 port, I will reference other reviewer's results, and also do some simple testing myself, and update this review accordingly
(Update : Quick test results below, mostly good news
)tl;dr : If you like Atelier Sophie, you will like this too
If you haven't played the Atelier Series before, there is no problem playing this without playing previous titles, and I still recommend this joyful & relaxing J-RPG with a great in-depth crafting system
Quick test results regarding issues in Atelier Sophie, whether they are still here in Atelier Firis & other miscellaneous findings:The CPU usage is completely normal, this is fixed in Sophie so I think it is also fixed here
(CPU : i7 2600)The launcher window now provides a section to custom map your keyboard controls, rejoice keyboard users! (The implementation is crude though, but it works
)Funnily there is no menu option to exit the game, press "Esc" on your keyboard to quit
(Took me quite some time to find out, as I normally use an XBOX controller
I had to use ALT+F4 before I found this out heh
)Framerates are at stable 60FPS during roaming and in menus, except for occasional drops to 50~ in cutscenes only
(CPU: i7 2600 , GPU: Geforce 980Ti, running at 2560x1440)The are no stutters or lags when opening the encyclopedia or the alchemy menu, so this problem is also fixed here
Currently there is only English UI, with the option for Japaneses vocals or English dub
(Update : Developers confirmed that Japanese UI & sutitiles will be added soon, click here for source
)Interestingly there is a "LanguageType" option in the launcher menu, but currently it is fixed as "English"
Perhaps future updates would bring Japanese or even Chinese UI which can be selected here?Regarding quality of 2D assets (Sophie used lower quality PS3 2D assets in the Steam release, instead of better quality PS4 assets)
(Update 2: I have checked and compareed the PC & PS4 (Non-Pro), sad to say the 2D UI elements indeed seem to be of the lower quality variant from PS Vita
) (Update: People in the forum seems to notice that the 2D assets are still in lower quality, I will recheck and verify it with my PS4 (non-Pro) once I get back home a few hours later)
It seems to me that full quality assets are used this time
It seems many of issues & problems which plagued the Sophie release are fixed & corrected nicely, I thank the developers for their work, as well as the community who discovered and reported the issues to them
Everyone contributed to a better gaming experience, and I am grateful

												UPDATE:Excelent port, I finally discovered what happened
This game was using my Intel HD to render the game -
- 



not my NVidia 



plx add a select your video card on options-------This is my first atelier series game and i liked it o/, great game, great world, many items to craft and the time limitation is a good pressure
BUT!!!! the port


the cursed port



it is sooooo good that I want to cry of despair and burn my notebook, but playable on "SHADOW_TYPE_LOW" in 1280x720 -
-" on i7-4710 2
5GHz, 24 GB RAM, NVidia GTX 860M 2 GB

Recommended because of the game not the port (trash port), if you have patience and endurance to lag, buy this game

												Do you like filler episodes or chapters where the characters just bond with each other instead of fighting their archenemies? No? Then this game's not for you
If you're looking for cute girls doing cute stuffs while blowing monsters into crafting ingredients, then look no further

												How Atelier Firis could turn to be the last Atelier game I play
In my long history with Atelier games I never was disappointed by any of them until Firis, and they never were so ambitious as Firis is, but not this, or lack of polish, or not the best port are reasons for my disappointment
So what's good about Firis:1
it's the open world in nature, for the first time in the Atelier game2
Complexity of alchemy is a notch down from Sophie, but in general alchemy feels better in Firis
3
Character endings are back4
The world is nice and monster design is great
5
It's a huge game6
learning alchemy and taking an actual exam of it is an interesting idea
7
Many interesting characters with their stories
8
Chain questswhat's not so good:1
Localization is poor2
Quest descriptions for many quests are wrong past the first step3
A game is way too demanding on hardware and runs poorly4
There are some glitches
the ugly:1
No real fast travel for 30-40 hours, depends on how fast you get there
2
Even when you get fast travel, it is limited, as there are parts of the world that allow no fast travel, and these aren't small locations, also filled with dangerous monsters (that can wipe out even strong party) without ability to save your game, of course
3
Sophie had an interesting system of unlocking alchemy recipes, which Firis ditched in favour of guessing what you should do and how many times to unlock what, yes guessing
4
Alchemy results in Firis are strongly dependent on quality, yet you can't register a single item in this game (just let it sink in)
What means creating the same items ad nauseam over and over again, what takes extra hours upon hours of playtime for no reason
5
ridiculously small initial storage space available to you (you easily get it filled in first three-four locations) and you have no ability to sell anything for a long time after that
It never becomes sufficient too
6
Many character events are pure guesswork too, and not something that is obvious, or even logical or easy to guess because of lack of options, nothing of the sort
7
the game that can't be fully finished without of use of a guide (and that's not a few things but a whole lot of them), is not a well designed game in my book
so those seven reasons are that make me think that Firis can be my last atelier game
I can't tolerate even one of those, all of them? overkill
This is an end of era
I still have a hope that Gust will get some feedback and won't repeat all numerous mistakes they made with Firis
I only recommend this game because it has redeeming qualities, but if you wanna a real good Atelier game, you should play Atelier Sophie instead

												Port ReviewThere are good things and bad things about this port
 I decided to lean to the negative side because the graphics do not justify the high requirements for this game
Also there are PS4 graphical features missing
I'll reevaluate this review if KT/Gust ever releases a patch to address some issues
If you don't have a PC that exceeds recommend requirements and have a PS4 then the PS4 is a better option even though it has frame-drops as well
Pros:- Variable frame-rate
If you have a high refresh-rate monitor and a very powerful video card you can play this game above 60 fps
- Synthesis does not have performance issue present in Atelier Sophie
 However, load is so low during Synthesis that powerful video cards may trigger power saving mode and drop below 60fps
 Workaround for Nvidia cards is to set "Power Management Mode" to "Prefer Maximum Performance" in Nvidia Control Panel
- Supports 1440p and 4k resolutions
Cons:- Really demanding game
 The system requirements for this game are no joke and won't get you 1080p60fps
 For 1080p60 you're looking at a RX 470/GTX 1060 and can still have drops in areas with lots of effects/shadows
- No Ambient Occlusion
 It exists in PS4 version
 Workaround is you can add it by using Reshade with MXAO shader, however will make game even more demanding
- Missing Lighting that is present in the PS4 version
- Low resolution 2D art assets
PS4 has higher resolution 2d assets
- Blocky character outlines make it looks like there is a lot of aliasing
Reshade SMAA doesn't work to remove them because they are too large to detect
- Shadows that disappear when source object moves off screen
- Some flickering textures
- Shadows that hit characters look broken
- No AA options
FXAA can be forced in video card control panel or SMAA with Reshade/sweetFx
- Only supports 5 different 16:9 resolutions
Prologue using Reshade on high end video card

												The game is workable and if you have ever played an Atelier game before you'll get more of the same except a few tweaks
Familiar faces are back and the plot is more towards the characters than any big world-ending problem, so don't expect an epic tale of heroes ala Final Fantasy or Tales of (again, nothing new to the Atelier franchise
)
If you haven't played an Atelier game just know that its a Turn-based JRPG with a big focus on item construction, you live or die based on how well you've prepared your items, which you make from items you collect in the world
There's a relatively large depth and variety of items and associated traits you can gather and make, and really this will be attractive to powergamers and those who like crunching numbers to get the most OP characters ever
 I love the Atelier franchise and I've gotten every one of their games since the PS2 era (Iris is the first I can remember), but this one I cannot recommend because of how amazingly bad the PC port is
The game works, but the graphical niggles are just too much
Shadows seem to pop in and out at random (just moving the camera with the character staying still causes it)
Draw distance is ATTROCIOUS, just look in any direction and move, you will very visibly see assets pop in from short distances away
The "open world" just really serves to make traversing it more annoying, as it is literally just plain bigger without adding anything new to the system
The 2D art assets like character stat pictures and such are very low res, and there is no HDR and ambient occlusion (The PS4 version has it)
The PS4 (not pro) version of this game does not have any of the problems I mentioned, and runs better FPS and detail even at 720p
I heavily suggest getting that version instead of this one, as it is as of this writing the definitive and most satisfying version of the game

												Fun game if you like crafting/collecting
 It is a pain to control with just a keyboard
 A controller makes the game much easier to play
			
Posted: 3 July
												This game is actually pretty wholesome
There is minimal outrageous anime trope/meta/fanservice/other bullcrap here
There's a generous amount of scenes between characters, and it gives them a lot of depth
It's a pretty solid installment in the series, a pretty decent Atelier game basically

com/atelier-firis/ for full archeivement and guide(it's in japanese)[link above are the guide to 100% archeivement]=beware it is in japaneseDon’t let the game’s convenience mechanics fool you, though
Atelier Firis definitely makes it a point to be particularly inconvenient at times
Perhaps the biggest example of this is the fact that you have to go hunt down characters to swap them in and out of your party even after you already met them
Pros+Open world exploration+Custom item creation top to bottom+Fun, quick battles+In-game music customizable+Easy to understand alchemy+Choices that matter+Endless replay value+Colorful, interesting characters+10 ENDING+(be sure to save and do the character side quest seperately)+Huge amount of contentCons-Slow movements-NPCs mostly static-Return of the dreaded time limit-Support Guard only protects Firis- Side characters seem a little blander than those in the previous titles
- Side characters seem a little blander than those in the previous titles
-Short on Main game story, Post game is rather long if you plan to get all 10 true endings
Neutral-Main Game seems shorter than post game-sidequest does not seems to be rewarding at all(too repetitive)-Niche gameplay-The second half of the game can be frustrating and overwhelming(if you do not have guide to help you)I admire Gust for delivering a product outside of their comfort zone
However, even though the open world is the most exciting new addition, it also tends to bring the most problems with it
Atelier Firis will surly impress fans of the franchise, but could feel dated to modern RPG fans
While still keeping its staple formula alive by maintaining the aspects of material gathering, simplistic turn-based battles, and alchemy, Atelier Firis is further improved by tweaking them in ways that’ll invite newcomers with open arms while keeping returning fans happy
While visually the game is a little rough, the sheer amount of things you can do and hours you’ll subsequently expend is endless
Atelier Firis: The Alchemist and the Mysterious Journey is a light-hearted and enjoyable JRPG where you can put your alchemy skills to the test
These are really minor complaints, though, when stacked against the fact that Atelier Firis took me back to the innocence and joy in those Arland games that got me interested in the series in the first place
Most importantly, given that this is the first time that he’s helmed the creative side of an Atelier title, Shinichi Yoshiike has proven himself to be a confident and safe pair of hands to shape the series into the future
As such, I expect that this series will continue to remain my favourite among the more traditional JRPG franchises out there
Despite its relatively flat cast, the game is a rather enjoyable experience that will feel well-rounded to fans of the series
The large map offers far more exploration opportunities than previous games did, which may help compensate for a pretty lackluster battle system
Smaller tweaks that combine older gameplay mechanics with some of the newer features from more recent titles like Atelier Sophie make Atelier Firis feel particularly special
While still keeping its staple formula alive by maintaining the aspects of material gathering, simplistic turn-based battles, and alchemy, Atelier Firis is further improved by tweaking them in ways that’ll invite newcomers with open arms while keeping returning fans happy

Atelier Firis: The Alchemist and the Mysterious Journey is a light-hearted and enjoyable JRPG where you can put your alchemy skills to the test
This title certainly takes an interesting new turn in the franchise, improving some of its shortcomings, but not all of them
Still, a very good RPG Atelier fans should try
Presentation(4)The game world is stylized very well
The character models are incredibly detailed, the world is very large and diverse, much more than the last Atelier game, making it very fun to explore
Gameplay(4)While the battle system could be improved upon, synthesizing items is still a treat in this game
Throughout the game, players will have to explore, gather, collect recipes, and synthesize items together
Lasting Appeal(4
5)One might find themselves wanting to come back for more, even after beating the main game
There is so much to do that you might have to remind yourself to eat! The game sports multiple endings to encourage continued play, and the mix of the timed and untimed systems give everybody something to enjoy
Final Verdict 4
3/5Atelier Firis: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Journey is a game that can be played and enjoyed by both fans of the series, newcomers, and even people who would otherwise not consider it
It may not be a complete return to form for the series, but It does a great job of mixing both modern and classic Atelier games
I believe that it ranks slightly higher than the last entry
The presentation of the game is strong as well, with easy to navigate menus and plenty of shortcuts
The graphics are anime-chic, and definitely won’t wow you, but don’t let you down either
Perhaps most enjoyable is the music, and again this game allows you to use music from other titles in the Atelier family in place of the defaults

												Now that I have over 75 hours logged in my main save, it might be time to write a review
For a long time before finding the Atelier series, I had been looking for a game like this
Atelier Firis is essentially a turn-based JRPG with a character-focused, mostly slice-of-life plot, but the real draw is the huge focus on gathering materials and using them to create your own items and equipment
While some JRPGs have you just buy items and gear from stores (with a lot of items not being worth it) and use different level up or skill systems to make things interesting, the Atelier games let you feel like you're making the tools you need to succeed
This entry (the 18th main game in the series, from what I hear) really does a great job of making crafting items easy to learn but still have depth for those who choose to master the system
Two instances of the same item will rarely be the same, so you have to make sure you make the right choices when crafting if you want to do well
The story of the game won't be too exciting if you want a strong plot-driven narrative, but if you can grow attached to the characters it can still be engaging
The first part of the game involves the lead, Firis Mistlud, learning to use alchemy and being given a year to pass the Alchemy Exam, which takes place in a city far from her home
Should she succeed, she then continues to adventure to try to find her calling in life
This is where the story (and game) really open up, as each companion has their own story arc and ending and many named NPCs have their own sideplots
While some characters take longer to develop than others, they all have at least a few interesting things about them to make the sideplots worth exploring
From a gameplay standpoint, Atelier Firis is an open-world game that encourages exploring each part of the large maps
While there is a chokepoint about halfway through the world map that requires a questline to open and not every area is available until after the Alchemy Exam, you'll still have more than enough ground to cover and explore
There's also a fast travel feature within maps, and after the exam you can complete a quest chain in order to get a way to warp to almost any area in the game from rest spots
There is a time limit for the first part of the game, but you are given plenty of time to do everything that must be done pre-exam with some time to spare
Even if you fail, you can load the bad ending save to get the same benefits as a New Game+ clear, which includes a few features that makes surviving the time limit and doing pre-exam questlines even easier
Aside from gathering items from the environment and making items from them, the game features combat with monsters as a big part of finding the best materials and completing some quest chains
The battles are played with a turn-based system that changes turn order based on stats, actions, and buffs/debuffs
While normal attacks and skills are available for each character (and can become powerful in the late game), the early and mid game will put a huge emphasis on item use
While only Firis and the alchemist party members can use a lot of items, everyone has access to some types of items and they are powerful for a huge part of the game (even into the endgame, if you craft them right)
Making sure you have a good set of attack and healing items is essential before getting into any fights, because Firis is not a front-line fighter and there's only so much the rest of the team can do without item support
There's also an interesting system where a meter depicts how well your team is working together (which increases when you do damage to enemies) that can be expended to protect Firis from attacks or filled to unlock limit break-esque attacks
The game also has anti-grinding measures to force you to move into harder areas if you want to level up quickly, so you have to make sure to be improving your items and gear whenever you can to prepare for the next region
Items are also useful outside of battles, as they can be used to gather materials (such as bombing a rock) or alter the environment
A few minor negative points do come up, though not enough to make me dislike the game
One problem I had early on is that fast travel between areas is not available until after the exam, which means a lot of walking when backtracking for materials (since in-map shortcut points are almost never near exits to areas)
Another issue is the poor requirements for some recipes in the recipe idea unlock system (which gives you recipes based on what you do)
Some items have absurd requirements, giving an otherwise cool system idea a bad reputation
It also doesn't help that some recipes get glitched if you complete certain quests too early, preventing 100% completion without doing a New Game+
The last, and probably least, of the issues is that I keep being annoyed by how "Atelier" is pronounced in the English voice track
The original French word sounds sort of like "a-tel-ee-ay", the Spanish cognate should sound something like "a-tel-ee-er"
The English voice track for this game uses the made-up (as far as I can tell) pronunciation "at-lee-ur", which ignores the first "e" in the word
A small issue in the grand scheme of things, but with the Japanese word being closer to proper French ("a-to-ree-ay"), it gets a bit strange when the English actors are made to mispronounce a word
Overall, Atelier Firis is a great game and, in my opinion, a good way to be introduced to the series
It has inspired me to seek out previous games in the series (particularly the game it's a sequel to, Atelier Sophie) to have further crafting adventures
If you're interested in a JRPG that gives items and crafting a big focus and tells a character-driven coming of age story, Atelier Firis might be a good fit for you

Product received for free
Disgaea 2 PC - ReviewStory:You live in a world, which is ruled by Overlord Zenon, a demon who cursed all inhabitants to become demons and slowly succumb to madness - you play as Adell, the only person not affected by the curse and you are looking to stop his family and all the people he knew from becoming monsters, by slaying Zenon
In contrast to this grim story, the game doesn't take itself seriously at all
With goofy monsters and characters, you find yourself grinning at the absurd take of theirs on this rather dark setting
Gameplay:In many ways this game feels like a typical strategy-jrpg, but it brings many new ideas to the mix
You build up your party by purchasing and by unlocking characters, the many classes that exist all specialize in different types of combat
The stages of the game are made up of squares which can be occupied by characters
This system is used for the positioning of characters, to manage their range etc
, this is quite normal in these kinds of games
What is special in Disgaea, is the addition of different heights on the map, and whilst this adds an interesting new dynamic to the movement and placement of your units, it's often enough quite frustrating, for many times you cannot see certain areas properly
There are different weapon and attack types and those, in addition to the positioning of your characters are basically what you have to manage throughout the game, to preserve as much health and items as you possibly can and kill hordes of corrupted demons
Due to the lack of permadeath in this game, most story missions feel quite easy - you can just revive all lost characters inbetween each mission
This takes away that feeling of risk and challenge that these games thrive off, at least in the first few chapters
In a different mode, which is used to improve your items, you enter the so-called item world
Here, you aren't granted respite after each stage, but you will have to efficiently manage your characters and items to push on as far as you can and gain as much as possible
This mode is the most challenging and feels the most rewarding
A key element in this game is the grinding, for higher levels and better items, and whilst the idea of grinding sounds stale in general, Disgaea does an amazing job at giving it value and making it feel rewarding, so that it doesn't lose its charm
Pros:+Many interesting units+Interesting story/Goofy characters+Strategically challenging combat+Gameplay that doesn't get staleCons:-Story missions very easy in the beginning-Stages often confusing to overlookConclusion:Disgaea 2 offers all that I came to expect from a strategy-jrpg, and much more
Only minor issues held me back from giving it a perfect score

												* Wanna play a game full of super sexy anime girls with tig ol' bitties?* Do you like stoned out penguins that obviously hit tha bong too much, and always call you "Dood"?* How'd you like listening to abnoxiously hot snobby princesses b1t(hing at the main character, just like your wife does to you?* How'd you like to ENDLESSLY grind your chacters to level 1000 and beyond?* Are you tired of Bungies Destiny and trying to get the same damned legendary everybody else has too? Like Borderlands, no 2 legendaries are the same here


* Did you love Fire Emblem, Tactic's Ogre or Final Fantasy Tactics/Advance?* Are you at least 30 years old and you know what the hell I'm talking about? Then welcome to Disgaea
It's a treasured console series from the PS2, PSP, PS3, and Vita days
The "Master Race" is indeed a very deprived race


this games over 10 years old and it just came out in 2017 on PC
WTF? Disgaea 2 PC is a strategy RPG, with countless hours of fun, grinding, hundreds of items, armor, weapons, and about "200" unit classes


supposedly
It's kinda like chess


after a few grams of mushrooms


for geeks
The combo's, spells, and basic attacks are all amazingly BRUTAL looking
When you see an anime girl throw a penguin up in the air and kick him in the sack, then she squeels in ecstasty


it's at that moment you'll realize this was the best money you ever spent
It runs on any potato, smart-phone, or laptop smooth as butter


and put away that keyboard and mouse Dood!! This game requires a controller to operate it at full speed and nostalgia
Although if the controller still baffles you after it's invention in the 1970's, you can use a KB/M
NIS did an upstanding job of giving Disgaea the HD treatment
It looks as good as can be expected in 1080p considering the games age
Don't expect top of the line graphics though! Those boobies are pixelated and you know you love it! The sprite animations are in a league of their own
The music sounds like it came from a PSP (and it did), but it's catchy and well done
The menu system is quick and inuitive
The RPG elements and statisics analyzing will melt your brain
The story is


who cares about the story? It's just a stupid fun game
You'll skip past the story anyways
But if you don't the story is a light hearted, humor based story of demons, overlords, criminals, and freeing the human race
Typical Japanese style weirdness
And the game is suitable for your kids too with no seriously objectionable content


provided your kids can handle the graphics
But hey


they play MineCraft, right? Long story short


if you're looking for your SRPG fix, and you missed Disgaea back on PS2 because you were tea-bagging bad kids in Halo 2, or dungeon crawling in Diablo 2


now's your chance
Strategy RPG's are a dying genre with only Disagea and Fire Emblem still active as franchises
That's the beautiful thing about Steam
It has a library of all the old games you wanted many years ago, but were too young and broke to afford
Console or PC games, doesn't matter, Steam has many of the gems
Now you're an adult and the games are mere dollars


Quit ripping yourself off and buy it
It's cheap
It's never too late
You got some catching up to do :)

												OK, where to begin?IMPORTANT NOTE:For the Love of all that is Good in this World, START YOUR GAME IN AXEL MODE!! GOOGLE it and find out why, and learn about all the benefits you get to carry over to ADELL MODE< ( YES THERE ARE TWO MODES)
You continue into ADELL MODE AFTER AXEL MODE

Do not screw this Up and start Adell Mode First, or you will not have Magic Change,  Throw and Receive, and Many of the DLC /New Characters, NEW MONSTERS nor the AWESOME LEVEL GRINDING Spots IN AXEL MODE, until You beat ADELL MODE, thats like 20 Chapters and the Whole main Story with none of those options, Until you get into New Game + and then AXEL MODE will be much harder as well, I warned you
START IN AXEL MODE
First I suppose I should let you know I have every single Disgaea game available for consoles


Yes even the Original Disgaea 2 hour of Darkness
As in the original Released discs PS2 Discs
Second, this version is better than the PS2 version in every way
Heres WHY>Better Graphics (Character Filters, User Interface, Resolution that plays perfectly on a 4k TV, improved Character Portraits, and again Sharper Resolution for the cutscenes etc
)This is not simply a port
They have gone out of their way to make sure this is the best version of the game available
No Joke
It includes All the Extras from Dark Hero Days for the PSP, this changes everything
(More Characters, More Story, More Grinding, and leveling up areas, more Fights, More Cutscenes, and more AXEL

( He's really stupid but he grows on ya), MOAR Monsters, more Mechanics Like Stack Attacks, Throw and Recieve, and Magic Change 1 and 2
PLUS ALL THE DLC CHARACTERS FROM BOTH VERSIONS OF THE GAME, FREE




:)In 2 weeks I have played 140 Hours


Does that tell you anything?Is it better Than Disagea 3, 4 , D2, or 5?  It has a way better story than 3 and D2 and 5, ( 4 is the best story of all of them) and it adds the Play mechanics from 3 which greatly increase it Play value and Fun factor
All I am going to say is if you have nerver played a Japanese SRPG (Strategy) then this one is a great starting point, it makes Disgaea 1 even the PC version almost unbearable to play


OMG Grinding in Disgea 1 was way way WAY slower
If you know what you are doing you can easily have a team of level 200+ Units and top end Gear in 25-35 hours
If you dont know what you are doing > GOOGLE, and save your self many mnay hours of wasted time


This is a researchers dream come true, read about strategies, tactics that other people used, Best methods for obtaining the Best Gear and massive Damage numbers, Secrets GALORE, and Character Leveling/Best Grinding techniques
Finally this is just an epic game, and you will never know the satisfaction of it unless you play it

THE PC VERSION is FLAWLESS, and plays better smoother and faster than the PS2 in every way

												PROS:-Hundreds of hours of gameplay-Colorful and crazy characters-massive sellection of character classes-A blend of action and puzzle gameplay-Deep tactics-based gameplay-Axel Storyline after you beat the main game
-Can Use Keboard and Mouse to play this gameCONS:-Lots of grinding-Occasional crashes-No ability to save in battle or autosave feature-Cannot Skip Battle SceneConclusion:I personally think the story has a tad more comedic flair, yes point for point it was horrible if you look at it as a serious work of RPG fiction (though still a million times better than most of the Final Fantasy games) but Disgaea 1 wasn't much better and all of the screen time was neatly focused around Laharl/Flonne/Etna whilst you have a more diverse spread in Disgaea 2


Though then again no one's funnier than Mid-boss
I have own all This series from Disgaea 1-5 since i own my 2nd console that is Fat PS3
It was  Disgaea Triple Play Collection if i am not mistake,Disgaea 4 vita and PS3,dIsgaea 5 PS4
OH WELL MY FINAL VERDICT IS 4/5 a must own game and this is the 2nd time i own it on PC
really enjoy the every moment in this game

												Everything I liked about the original packed into more updated sprites and visuals a massive improvement over the first disgaea:hour of darkness port to steam
			
Posted: 2 February
												Remember, "Your Mileage May Vary" in regards to this port, but I believe that this time around performance is way better on launch than Disgaea PC was
Great job NISA!TL;DR: I wholeheartedly recommend Disgaea 2 PC for $20, especially if you've played Disgaea PC
(Buy it so we can get future Disgaea games on PC :D)------------------------Let's get introductions out of the way first, dood:Disgaea 2 PC is a port of the PSP remake of Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories, called Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days
(Lots of confusing names thrown around, I apologize! Basically: PS2 - Cursed Memories > PSP - Dark Hero Days > PC - Disgaea 2 PC) Disgaea 2 PC is much more of the gameplay from Disgaea PC, but improved
From my previous Disgaea PC review: ( https://steamcommunity
com/id/cuhbrewin/recommended/405900/ )Originally posted by Cuhbrewin:Disgaea (the series) is a tactical RPG (grid-based, turn-based, action points, the usual deal) with its key selling point being the ability to grind out your stats and level to absurd highs
The caps for stats and level are insanely high (~20 million for each stat in Disgaea PC and 9999 for level)
There's a lot of bonus maps, content, and endings to access that the game acknowledges how many New Game Pluses you've done






Another highlight of the Disgaea franchise is the Item World, a completely randomized dungeon crawl generated from items you collect in the game
By exploring the Item World, you can grab more items, grind out EXP, and improve that item's stats
Each item contains an expansive dungeon of 30, 60, or 100 floors, depending on the item's rarity
I'd like to add that Disgaea is perhaps a fully-aware series (in that it KNOWS it's a series of grinding SRPGs, and that the characters are well aware they are part of an entertainment medium), and I personally enjoy fourth-wall leaning/breaking in games
I'm a sucker for being super over-leveled for a stage so this series scratches my "power fantasy itch" well
Also, this series has some crazy over-the-top attack animations that just has to be experienced
Disgaea 2 remains mostly similar to Disgaea 1
So, instead of just analyzing this title on its own, I'm going to compare and contrast Disgaea 1 (PC) and Disgaea 2 (PC)
CriteriaD1 "Normal Review" ScoreD1 "Average = 5/10" ScoreD2 "Normal Review" ScoreD2 "Average = 5/10" ScoreStory/Plot9/108/107/105/10Characters7/106/108/107/10Music8/106/1010/109/10Graphics/Art Style5/104/105/104/10Mechanics8/107/109/108/10Value10/1010/1010/1010/10Performance8/107/109/109/10Going off this table, you can see I slightly lean towards Disgaea 2 for music and characters, but Disgaea 1 for a story
On their own, I like most of the D2 characters -- heck even Taro and Hanako I don't mind too much -- except for maybe Yukimaru, zam



GOD THAT "ZAM" IS ANNO-- *clears throat* I'm joking about not liking Yukimaru :)
Anyway


the plot of Disgaea 2 that the characters are placed in is


well, I can't really express it other than "it's just a pretty good story"
Whereas D1 has an excellent story (in that Laharl finds and accepts love; trust me, play D1 it's better than it sounds), but most of the characters are all bonkers, if not a little annoying (whether on purpose or otherwise idk; in Disgaea D2 they're much more enjoyable imo)
Basically what I'm getting at is D1 has genre-savvy characters in an overall excellent RPG plot and D2 has cliche characters in a rather mediocre RPG plot
Take your pick
I should probably also say that there's a lot more to do in Disgaea 2, but the added mechanics of Magichange (monster polymorphing into a weapon), "Toss & Pass" (monster "tossing"), Innocent Towns, Mystery Rooms, and the Land of Carnage just adds on to the amount of things to learn (which is already quite mind-numbing for a newbie before these additions)
Overall, the game feels slightly faster and smoother, but not as fast or smooth as I would want it to be
Take that statement however you will
I don't use one, but I think that a gamepad is preferable for Disgaea
If you don't own one you'll have to fiddle with key binds, like I did
Or, you can try using the Mouse (I don't use Mouse but I hear it's a bit fiddly, just like Disgaea PC) EDIT: I used an Xbox 360 Controller and I can confirm the gamepad support is solid, if maybe a little unstable (the game crashed when my controller lost connection to the wireless receiver)
With regards to Graphics, neither port/re-make has improved much on/moved beyond the PS2-era graphics (you can only do so much to them)
So if you're in the market for a graphically-pleasant SRPG, don't try this one
In terms of music, I didn't think Disgaea 1's soundtrack was bad, but Disgaea 2 has a better OST than D1 in my opinion
Overall, a better buy than Disgaea PC if you already own that one
Plus, you get an ownership discount for buying Disgaea 2 PC if you own Disgaea PC! Otherwise, if you don't own D1 PC, I'd say try the demo first before getting D1 or D2

seems to have more impact on higher levels)*Field / Dungeon mobs variety is solid*Field Bosses*AW Stages with mobs (later)*Monsters also use magic*Treasure Mimics!*Dragons/Wyverns*Dialogues when first pairing 2 chars together and going out to the field
*Side Storys, also with AW x SAO chars*Kirito and Haruyuki -dialogue between hardcore gamers*Even a few funny moments / dialogues which made me smile*Data log / Information about all characters, their groups and more*Neko-Sinon*Running as Ash Roller in the city is hilarious*Gestures / Emotesfew NPC react to or mirror some of your gestureso / neutral / acceptable for me*BGM can be annoying over time, especially main menu and the snow world for me
It ain't bad though *normal light and heavy attacks lacks variety / combos - only row attack with either light or heavy attack with possibilty to throw in heavy attack to end the "combo"/row with normal heavy attacks and vice versa, like there are two attack rows and you can switch once between them when performing one
-  though not as bad as this sounds, really
BC Sword Skills are supposed to be combos*I  highly prefer to play with  the SAO over the AW ones, mainly because of their lower skill pools + the normal attack statement reasoned above*AW chars running faster even in the city, what i dislike because of the point above*can't order your partymembers to focus on healing and keeping up buffs/debuffs - although they heal you often and sometimes pop out buffs / debuffs*no option / difficult where you can turn off that your party member uses their own items, like they use heal-potions and ressurection-drops even when you dont own a single item*KI can be dumb when following you to higher levels (stuck beneath platforms)*Design of the merged field stages - too much AW influence for me here- but still fine*(Design of AW Duel Avatars - I like the anime but any robo-mecha avatar anywhere isnt my cup of tea)*Dungeon design looks great, but I would prefer "closed" dungeon-style rather than thisspace-nebula-like ambient outside the corridors*Many species-mobs in the Dungeons as already seen out on the field*Flying enemies can be annoying - due forcing of mid-air combat -mostly for AW chars and their movement - altough you can stay in the air infinitely-SAO chars can treat them with magic / bow from the ground or while floating*I would prefer some bosses to be ground only
"The Gleam Eyes"  would've been great*can't hide UI - no customizable UI - atleast SAO UI is great*can't zoom in or out - only in the city*Party Display shows only 4 buffs on your active char and 2 on the other ones( ALL are active - I tested it )*No fast-switch between chars in the city*No-fly zone - not even a double jump*Only 1 city - npc population rate is good*No lootable-changeable: clothes / visible accessoiry / Armor*No custom-chars*When sprinting while flying / floating, you can only use the skills assigned to the the same button you use to sprint, so for example as DEFAULT : RB on xbox controller for sprint and RB + X/Y/U/D/L/R for magic / skills(you got 2 profiles for the RB + " " skills, which you can cyle trough via R3 - or whatever you set
)IMO this is enough space, because mostly magic skills are suitable for attacking in fast motion
*Control Scheme is hard to get used to , even with controller- / negative / things I dislikefor me there's no real negative things, although few points from above could disturb you more than me= / my 2 centsOne of the very few games i bought on full price in my lifetime andI dont regret it

												POSITIVE NOTE! Specification requirements are way above what you need!ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING! This game uses a 3-4 year old engine! This engine has been reused countless of times in their SAO games (Fatal Bullet is NOT gonna reuse it) thus it is quite obvious (for me anyway) that the system specs are simply invalid
Need I remind you all that there is a port of all their games optimized for the PSVita
Playing this on a:- GTX 670- i5-3470- 8GBMAX settings solid 60FPS
It's SAO it's PC it's a good port what more do you want?!Been dying for a SAO or good anime game on Steam and it seems that it has finally hit!https://www

												This is a direct sequel to Sword Art Online Lost Song with numerous improvements to the gameplay
While maintaining a lot of the aspects of it's predecessor
It has a large character cast from Sword Art Online and Accel World
The story isn't bad
It start's off as Kirito and Asuna trying to save Yui who has been kidnapped which leads into a larger plot involving both the SAO and Accel World team
I have not run into any crashes, or glitchs so far and I have some hours into the game
It does, however, require a decent PC to play
I'm on a GTX 1080, Intel i7-4790k, 16 Gb of DDR3 @2400 MHz, using the latest Windows 10 and I have no issues with lag running the texture resolution (HUD rendering name in the console) @4k while running the game in borderless mode with all settings maxed out
My screen resolution being 2560 x 1440 on a XB270HU
My average FPS is between 65 and 70
Hope this helps for those wondering about requirements
For those who do have better PC's I recommend running the game's texture resolution at 4k it greatly increases the overall sharpness of the game 1920x1080 texture resolution being somewhat blurry
Also I highly recommend a controller over the keyboard can be difficult to use
I am currently using an ancient Xbox Windows Edition controller and have had zero issues at all
If you have any questions about the game feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer them

												Here is an honest review from a SAO fan P
O
V but also a PCMR P
O
VPros:- The voice acting was appealing and I actually prefered not having it dubbed
- Art Work is nice and fits the genre
- Further confirms theories that SAO and Accel are not only in the same world but that Accel directly follows the events from SAO- Fan service - Game interface is OK and the control are not as bad as I thought for a console port- The story is nice and original, but ( see cons)- hack and slash 3D fighting- Music is good- Give something while waiting for S3 of SAO (confirmed btw) and hopefully a Season 2 of Accel- SinonCons:- Not really well optimized - Sometimes when I play I get 60FPS and when I launch it again it drops to 18 - 30 in the same region
Funny enough removing my X-input controller (xbox) before launching the game seems to remove that problem entirely
Wierd!- Controls are OK as mentioned, but could be improved
Sometime flying gets more annoying than anything- Graphics are better than PS4, but I would have wanted something on par with NUNS4- Console Port that is not well optimized, average remains about 60, but major spikes sometimes, but made less obvious by FreeSync- Dialogue isn't always the best- Quest can feel boring and repetitve at time- AsunaOverhaul, I feel like this game brought a good origianl story, but fell short in their execution of how to implement that story coherently and efficitevely along with the other elements of the game, including dialogue and quests
The Graphics are not the nicest for a 2017 Anime game, however, they are not aweful
The Artwork for the characters during dialogue and the voice acting is top notch
The Gameplay generaly feels smooth on my setup i7-4870HQ and RX 480 8G (yes a 480 with a mobile CPU ---> MSI GS30 2M Shadow) but has some spikes for not apparent reason
Combat is another area where I feel this game fell short; it is good, but dissapointing
In the end, I still feel this game is worth its full price tag, but I can see why some people would like to wait
			
Posted: 12 October
												I did enjoy this game until I reached end game content and trying for online game play with other people
If you going to play only for the story and fan service then it's for a game for you
If you are also looking for end game content and longevity of the product then wait for it to be on sale
The Main Story will last an average 20 hours
 Therefore without endgame stuff, $50 isn't worth it in my opinion
EndGame issue:End Game has a dungeon call Infinite Dungeon
 It goes from Floor 1 to 1000
 The Goal for entering this dungeon is pretty much for gearing
 Each floor is randomly generated with random boss
 The game will keep your progress saved up to Floor 100
 This means that if you exit the dungeon at any given time past Floor 100, you always restart at Floor 101 when you re-enter the dungeon(offline mode)
 During offline mode, your progress and loot only save when you exit the dungeon
 If your game crash anywhere between loading screen or while inside the dungeon, your progress and loots are rolled back to last save
 During online mode with other people, you will need to go to offline to save your progress and loots
 If you get disconnect or crash, your progress and loot are gone
 Online mode can help you save progress better but not that much
 For example, you and me progress together; we reached and beat the boss at Floor 200, and you decide that you need to go offline to save your progress and loots
 As long as I stay on Floor 200, you can re-join my session and we both can press on with progression
 Now, we're at Floor 205 and before beating the boss, you got disconnect or crash, you won't be able to re-join my session since your last progress is saved when you exit after beating Floor 200 which is your highest progression
 At this point, we got two choices; either both of us start again from Floor 101 or you can join someone that is progressing anywhere between Floor 1-200 then you need to finish up to Floor 205 then go save your progress
 After that, you can re-join my session at Floor 205
 At the time I was still playing this game, finding people to run Infinite Dungeon is a challenge in itself
 On top of that, the disconnection and crashes would just discourage people from going into it
 I personally have completed Floor 1000 but I had access to two accounts and I left the game running 24/7 until I have finished Floor 1000
Trying to get support is a joke
 Steam point me to Bandai Namco EU
 I have Submit ticket there and it tells me wrong place because I'm not EU customer and send me to NA site
 NA site don't even have this game listed in their support list nor I could find a link to submit support ticket
 I don't think Bandai Namco want to support this product at all

												AW vs SAO is a charming action-rpg title for janime fans
You don't have to watch AW, nor SAO to enjoy the story
Here is my opinion
ControlsThe control is a bit awkward, need some getting used to time
It can be played with kb+m with some bindings, but the game is designed with controller in-mind, so it is better to use it
StoryIt is nothing new actually, but I am interested in how they are putting this together
I would say, they did a good job with some twists
I would love to watch this as anime too
XDGameplayIt starts off a bit slow, but getting picked up in a reasonable pace
The game is quite casual though
You can do whatever you want at your own pace
The combat is simple, and enjoyable
The AI is a little annoying though
The loots, and the grindings are there as well
The game has more detailed customization than it meets the eye
There are many characters available to play with
(~40)PerformanceOne of the decent ports
Graphic Settings, Key Bindings are featured
The performance issue seems to be a result from how the game engine is handled, not the porting
The constant loading/unloading of area, objects is clearly designed for non-PC hardware
You will notice this during gameplay, though it is not that bad as some have claim to be
My PC, i7 7700/16gb ram/gtx 970, can run this without problem
30 hours, 0 ctd, that is good for me :-)http://steamcommunity

OverallTL;DR : The game is good, yet casual
If you are fans of the series, or anime games in general, I am positive that you will enjoy playing this

												After a few hours of playing this game I can certainly say I was skeptical about how my PC would handle it
The "minimum" Graphics card needed says GeForce GTX970 4GB which, for me was out of the question upgrading from my GeForce GTX 950 2GB and my CPU is a very basic low end G3200 @3
00 GHz from the recommended Core i5
I'm very glad I didn't run to my local MicroCenter and drop 300$ for a GTX 1050 which I was debating on buying
My game runs smoothly with basic mid settings no issues on my end to report
Graphics overall are amazing the game play is above average switching in battles
Story is moderate at best don't know if its the original voice cast from both series but from my short time playing I want to say/think the whole game is voice acted
Pros:Voice ActingEasy To LevelMoney MakingMassive RosterField Platforms Heal YouCons: Flying Is Somewhat Of A ChallengeLack Of Avatar Weapons (LOL)Accel World Characters Can't Fly (Except Crow haven't used Sky Raker Yet)Leveling Is Easy Seems Pointless (Took Down A Level 200 Boss With Party @ Level 140 Each)Overall my opnion of the game is positive, I guess a lot of people are giving it a alot of dirt due to the requirements to run the game which I agree were set to high but, like most ported games PCs have superior power to consoles

												I don't write so many Reviews but for this game i just need to do it
First of all i really love SAO/ALO and i love the game too
I just Thought right at the Start it looks awesome i played it at 45-50 FPS all the time even that i don`t even had the Recommend Minimum for the game but still can play it on High for everything
The Combat System is really Good but if you lock on a enemy is really irritating sometimes if you lock the wrong one, if you got nearly all Skills Like Sword Skill and Magic Skills you just can choose for your own where you bind it and Attack with it this is really good in my Point of view and it feels really easy and good if you play with it for a few minutes
I really like that you can Choose for your own which character you wanna use and which not , sometimes you need to use a Special character but this is only for Side Quest and you don't need to do it
If you got the Game Complete (Defeat the Final Boss) you don't need to start a New Game+ or some stuff like this you just can still use the same game and get a bunch of new Quest and you even get the Unlimited Dungeon where you try to get higher and higher everytime(but don't lose)
This is the end of the Review i hope you understand everything because i am from germany and i am not a English specialist (I'm sorry ^-^) But i still hope you read everything and still enjoy the Game like i do now
(Btw
I know i only used Positive things about the game but for me it's Perfect :3)

												There are three ways to look at Ys Seven: As an Action RPG, as a PSP port, and as an entry in the Ys series
As an Action RPG, Ys Seven is stellar
 The combat is smooth, and the learning curve is very forgiving
 You acquire new gear and learn new skills at an even pace, so you're never going long periods without an upgrade of some sort
 There are 7 different characters to choose from with their own weapon styles and skill set, and you can have three in your active party at any given point in time, controlling one while the AI controls the other two
 The ability to switch between characters at the press of a button makes the rock-paper-scissors style of weapon resistances work well rather than become a hindrance, and gives the player plenty of options in boss fights
 Becoming accustomed to the dodge roll and mastering flash guard will allow a skilled player to excel even at the higher difficulty levels
The boss fights are where Ys Seven really shines, all that training and work you did with the regular monsters really pays off
 You can get by with a minimal amount of grinding (I really only do enough to buy all the weapons and learn the skills at each town as I visit), but it pays to be prepared for the boss encounters
 The first time I faced down the two headed turtle and the boss track started got my heart pumping, and I knew this was a great game when I pulled off my first super move and just annihilated it!Since Ys Seven is a port of an 8 year old PSP game, there are some minor nuances
 First, the game runs extremely smooth, even at max resolution and settings in borderless window mode; no pixelated lines, all crisp and smooth
 The colors are crisp and much more vibrant than on the PSP port, and the controls work just fine (although I would recommend a controller for the best experience)
 Now for the elephant in the room: the graphics are a little blocky, and the big bug eyes the characters have contrast sharply from the gorgeous anime-style character art
 I'm willing to grant this a pass since it is an 8 year old game, and the standards for a small screen (and an underpowered device like the PSP was) were a lot different back then
 I have absolutely no complaints in how the game performs, and it's still a joy to tuck in
As an entry in the Ys series, Ys Seven is one of the best there is
 This was the first game in the series to introduce the party concept (now implemented as well in Memories of Celceta and Lacrimosa of Dana), and being able to play Dogi and deliver that wall crushing punch was INCREDIBLY satisfying!  The game picks up where Ark of Napishtim left off, with Adol and Dogi finally arriving in Althago, and the red haired adventurer immediately tucks in to solve all the world's problems
 As expected of Falcom, the music is amazing, from the animated intro to the final credits, and I had no qualms buying the soundtrack and keeping it in regular rotation
 My only wish was that this release had a boss rush mode like other entries in the series (like Origin and Oath of Felghana), but with the level of customization in gear and party composition I can see how this would be difficult to implement
The "TL;DR" line is that Ys Seven is amazing, one of the best entries in the series, and the Steam release is a welcome addition and very well done!  If Falcom is the king of action RPGs, then Xseed is it's herald, and they once again deliver a game that is a must have for any library!

												The release of Ys Seven on steam is here, the controls and the enchanced graphics have been improve way much from the psp port gonna clear it again since I cleared the psp one worth only 20 hours with 100% gameplay and that was me taking time, people could clearly clear the game in 15 hours below but nevertheless thank you XSEED for the game but please don't release games so close together its bad for your fans, and for my personal opinion
My Personal Opinion :Graphics - 9/10 (The graphics are good in fullscreen and window mode not to mention its resolution size clearly defeats the psp version with 60 fps improvement
)Gameplay - 9
5/10 (Gameplay is really fast pace with no Flash moves from Celceta and jump commands from 8, its fast hack n slash with your skills to play
) Story - 9/10 (Mostly cliche scenes but the story seems better and better for every ys modern game
)Sound - 9
5/10 (What else to love in a good game in Ys, Town theme, Field theme and the most epic part is Boss theme especially the later bosses
)Series - 8/10 (The first Ys modern game I played since mask of the sun was my first Ys game, it improved greatly in gameplay and built a solid gameplay unique to Ys since adol can still hack n slash enemies except the bump part
)Overall rating - 8
5/10 (Really loved that fast pace gameplay and not to mention it holds one of my favorite boss theme in the game so it increased my rating for it from 8 to 8
5
)Is it worth it? - Yes and No(I got it from its first day, to show my support from XSEED but seeing as Ys VIII is gonna be released after two weeks from now, I think you should get that instead of this but if you want more hack n slash games and to familiriaze yourself with how Ys gameplay evolve, try this game it also comes with easy achievements and trading cards so buying it isn't all that bad
)Last note : Another epic adventure of Adol, Another broken hearted girl, and Another batch of amazing soundtracks, hoping for soundtrack dlc please

Ys SEVENDeveloper: Nihon FalcomPublisher: XSEED Games, Marvelous USA Inc
Introduction==========Ys Seven was my introduction to the Ys series, back when it was originally released for the Playstation Portable
After countless hours playing it there, it easily shot to the top of my favorite games list
You can imagine my excitement when I saw it was getting an official port to PC via Steam, especially since my PSP is long dead and incapable of holding a charge (rendering my physical Collector's Edition useless and unplayable)
Ys has been going as long as Final Fantasy has, and as such has quite a prestigious history and an impressive run of games
Let's take a look at one of the best entries in the series now
Gameplay==========As an action RPG, Ys Seven allows players to freely roam areas and attack any enemies that appear
Utilizing an intuitive hack 'n slash battle system, Ys Seven never feels boring
Each character can equip a weapon, a piece of armor, an accessory, and up to 4 skills
Each weapon can have a skill associated with it, and to learn that skill the character must build up SP by striking enemies or using charged attacks and then use the skill until it is learned
Changing weapons before the skill is learned halts progress on learning the skill until it is re-equipped
Each character also has an EX Skill, a super powerful technique that can be unleashed when the EX gauge is full
The gauge is filled when you hit enemies with skills
These skills differ between characters, but most deal massive damage when used
These are best saved for clinch moments during boss battles, or when you knock an enemy over/down
Players can have up to 3 members in their active battle party, and can swap between them on the fly with the tap of a button
Each character has one of three damage types: Piercing, Slashing, and Blunt
Each type is effective against certain enemies
For instance, you'll want to bring Dogi and his blunt Fist weapons into battle against enemies with a hard shell
You may even find weapons that allow characters to have more than one damage type
Adol usually specializes in Slashing weapons, but gets a Piercing weapon in the form of an Estoc midway through the adventure
Being an active battle system, you can dodge attacks with the press of a button
You can also perform a technique called a Flash Guard, which is basically a normal guard but any attacks used afterwards will have the benefit of a 60% damage increase
It goes without saying, but it's very well worth learning the timing of guards for that damage increase, especially in boss battles in the three higher difficulty modes
Along with equipment, the party also has access to healing items that can be used at anytime in battle with the press of a button
There are also special Relic that give certain effects as long as it is equipped
Most of these are required for progressing through dungeons, but some of them can be purchased from shops to provide some quality of life benefits (such as drawing items to you when they are dropped by enemies)
Lastly, Ys Seven has a simple crafting system
Shop owners will give you the option to synthesize certain items, weapons, and armor


as long as you have the proper number of materials for it
These can be obtained as drops from monsters, or gathered from certain points out in the field
Being a hoarder pays off in Ys Seven, as some of the best equipment is only available through synthesis
Graphics==========When I first played this on the PSP, I was blown away by how great it looked
Everything was crisp and clean, and extremely well animated
This transferred over to the PC version pretty well, but it still looks like a PSP game
There were some minor upgrades made here and there, such as running at a consistent 60 FPS, but there wasn't a huge upgrade overall in the visuals
For me, this isn't a deal breaker at all since the game is so incredibly fun, but some people may fault the game for having a lack of visual updates to meet today's PC graphic standards
During dialogue, each character has a very well drawn character portrait displayed when they are speaking, complete with facial expressions and little animated flourishes above their heads in certain instances
This brings each character to life and adds great detail to their personalities
There are also some very well animated cutscenes throughout the game at key points These animations look absolutely incredible and would put some anime and cartoons to shame
Sound and Music==========The soundtrack for Ys Seven is incredible
Violins mixed with rock and metal instruments never sounded so good
The soundtrack is comprised of 52 different tracks, each a masterpiece in and of themselves
I say this as a big fan of video game music in general, and I would definitely put Ys Seven's music up there as some of my favorites
It's quality stuff, and it all fits into the game extremely well and helps with immersing you into the game world
Performance==========Works great overall
My controller plugged and played with no issues
Runs at a full 60FPS consistently, even in the midst of a heated battle with a fullscreen boss
You can customize various setting via the launcher as needed
Final Thoughts==========Despite the $24
99 price tag on Steam, Ys Seven is more than worthy of a spot in your library, especially if you are a fan of RPGs
An engaging story, fantastic, lovable characters, and a fun battle system all come together to make an incredible experience
Play it however you can, and enjoy it to the fullest
You won't be disappointed
Nerd House Verdict:==========A Must Play 
Posted: 30 August
												Yet another fantastic Ys game for PC and a really good port by  XSEED as usual
Smooth crisp and responsive gameplay
Good gameplay - Check (Different characters, customization, skills and more)
Good music - Check (Which is not a suprise from the talent people at Falcom Sound Team jdk)
Good controllers - Check (Want to mention that is the ability to change the menu's buttonicons to match your controller, with the options being Xbox, DualShock, keyboard, and PC classic which is think is fantastic especially for me who have PS4 Controller hooked up)
Good Story - Check (so far!)Need fix: I stumbled upon a bug where I played in fullscreen 1680x1050 resoultion the letters for the text was moved up and outside the actual letterbox which was kind annoying and made it hard to navigate the menu in the game but fortunately there is borderless fullscreen which cover that and is not affected by this
I will continue to support this amazing series and I'm really looking forward for Ys 8
Thank you XSEED!Overall I give this game 9/10 (so far) and if you are a fan of this series you should really get this

												Reviewing Ys? Should be automatic at this point! :)Ys is one of those series which really never fail at every title (Ys I and II to me are awesome games too)
Ys 7 translates all to a 3D plain, and I can't help but think often at Final Fantasy VII for many things
Graphics are great, and as always the soundtrack is really amazing
For what concerns the gameplay - fully supported XBOX controller, no cheap USB controller though, the one I used with Ys Origins and the other older games - everything runs so smoothly and fast that I can only love it
An action RPG is not a turn-based/strategy game and to me it needs to be fast, transitions need to be fast, and here really I have never experienced a single problem
You're provided with lots of options, equipment, magic, skills, everything
And it's all scaled so that you start at level 1 and get accustomed to the world, to the new kinds of skills etc
with playing time; there's nothing out of place
You have also the standard Ys difficulty options from easy onwards (four levels unlocked from the start), just in case you're a beginner - however, being this a 3D game advanced in the series, I'd suggest to start with some previous titles available here on Steam too
All the characters have their own weapons and strength towards enemies, and you can switch between them with just one key; boss fights are more challenging than ever (ok, Ys Origin at times was very difficult XD) and here the game shines even more than during the usual fights that are scatteret through the maps
Since I'm not a console player I really don't want to say nothing about PSP ports and such; I just talk about this game on Steam, and it runs perfectly! And apart from this everyone says it's even better here than in its original vest, so

ahah :)The screen fits all - a perfect minimap, HP, SP, EXP and everything on lower right, enemy stats on the left and so on; really, I rarely saw a game so perfect in every detail and I think that a PC and not a portable console is the best way to enjoy Ys 7
It also features all my favourite things, like, a button to optimize equipment, shortcuts, skipping dialogues

everything! :)The plot isn't that thorough, but still definitely enjoyable with also hints to previous titles
You have also lots of sidequest and such; just the achievements to me aren't that greatly placed 'cos they're almost all like "get all the skills", "get everyone to the maximum level"

I think that in RPGs achievements must follow the player from his first steps to the last boss, but anyways, this doesn't affect gameplay
It's definitely a must to have even if the Ys series isn't super known at least here in Europe; there aren't so many action RPGs better than these and the Seven release really stands up at its best

Good port of a great gameBuying a console port on day one isn't necessarily a smart decision
In this case however I haven't encountered any crash, bug or otherwise unintended behavior after playing for 8 hours
For anyone who cares: Yes, it does run with stable 60 fps at least on my non-high-end computer
#Great combat and controlsThe controls are smooth and the combat system offers this overall satisfying feeling almost exclusive to the Ys-series
However, a gamepad is highly recommended
#Well aged]As far as I can tell, it is a direct port of the PSP version, no added content, no change to animations or cutscenes (fortunately no horrible 3D models like in some other ports from a well-known Japanese publisher


)
The game does look a lot better than on the PSP thanks to higher resolution textures, but it is still a game from 2009
That said, the graphics are well aged and look beautiful in full HD
#Story as you'd expect it]The story isn't bad at all, although not too complex either
Some dialogue -> go somewhere -> fight something -> some more dialogue or event, that kind of pattern
Don't expect something like Planescape: Torment, but for an action-RPG it's pretty solid
#Fair difficulty, optional grinding]Four difficulty settings unlocked right from the start should be enough to entertain everyone from casual gamer to Ys- veteran
The learning curve isn't too steep, bosses can be a bit difficult if your level isn't high enough, but they aren't unfair
I'd say most if not all of them are possible without even getting damage, if you learn their patterns and can react to them
It helps that the game lets you retry lost fights and even gives you back the items you used in your last run
If you like grinding, you should probably choose a higher difficulty setting
Besides character levels it's also possible to raise the level of different skills for each character
#Conclusion]Buying this game should be a no-brainer for fans of the Ys series
If you like action-RPGs with great and responsive controls, you should definitely give this game a try

												This is an improved version of Ys SEVEN, a PSP game
No, you can't use a number
It's SEVEN
And yes, it must be in caps
This release is twice as expensive, because it has twice the frames, making it twice as good
It also has some AA, which clearly justifies an extra fiver, so shut up and buy it, unless you don't like old school action adventures that kick you in the nuts with mean bosses
Be the man who doesn't care about petty romance
Be the expert ship-wrecking hero that defeats all that is ancient and powerful, with just a sword
Be the best friend of which is arguably the ugliest incarnation of Dogi in the entire series (you judgmental monster)
Was this review helpful?Of course not
Because this is Steam, and Steam is a meme
Go look this game up on YouTube instead
You're welcome

												This is the definitive version of Ys SEVEN, the Ys game that finally decided to modernize the franchise
Compared to the earlier games, there's a party system, a much more developed story
But don't worry, the battles still feels great like before, and the music is badass as always
It's a really great game to pick up, it just sucks a bit because it got released less than two weeks before its sequel, Ys VIII
Any great fan of the series should pick it up, it's definitely worth your time
Also, there's a lot of interactions between Dogi and Adol, which is a really great thing
			
Posted: 2 September
												one of the best falcom series beside the legend of heroes series well this is the first mechanic that let you play as party not like many ys game which is you only use adol already beat this game on my psp and this is the game that make me love YS series good music, depressing boss (Nightmare Mode) good story(plot twist) man cant wait to finish this with my first run nightmare mode !the only cons for me maybe that we need to hold attack button to release charge attack which is very tiresome especially againts boss/final boss (OH GOD) but maybe from someone else this will be very intense because you need to always evade and counter it with charge attack again and again but yeah if you like hack and slash with good music good story this is the game for you!!			
Posted: 31 August
												It's a Ys game, first of the "modern"-style ones: Party-based combat, crafting, and true 3D graphics
The good:-The upscaling from the PSP original is surprisingly good
Some of the textures aren't great, and the polygon counts are noticably low, but it looks more like a PS2 game than a PSP one
-The combat is the same fun Ys standard: fast-paced, big on combos, with difficult bosses
-Less reliance on levelling up than other Ys titles
Traditionally a Ys game requires you to level grind, since every level of difference between you and enemies makes a huge different in your combat ability, this is much less emphasized here
-Nice nods to the series history
-Stellar music
It's a Falcom game, of course the music is amazing!The Bad:-The plot stays pretty thin, as is standard for Ys games
More depth than most Ys titles, but still not going to win awards
-


that's about it, really
Overall: An excellent Zelda-esque ARPG that shines through its somewhat-dated graphics due to its excellent combat mechanics and music

My ImpressionWords cannot even begin to describe what I feel for this game
If you have ever been in love - that's the closest it gets to describe it <3
I may sound like a game-addict, but that's just not it, you have to play this game to comprehend it
SummaryFor those who don't feel brave enough to face the wall of text (warning: this game is like a wall of text itself and the Second Chapter will be even more so ;-)), still have a look at the verdict, please
 Positive Mediocre Negative   + Great story ~  slow at times     + Living world       + Interesting NPCs       + Fun quests   - easily missable   + Breathtaking locations       + Loveable characters ~ you have to part with     + Enjoyable combat ~ moving is mostly a waste of your turn     + Beautiful artdesign ~ old textures     + HD Graphics in dialogues ~ for important characters only     + Goosebumps music    The StoryOver 50h in length (it took me 52h) spans a grand story which isn't even over after this but leaves you craving for more
Basically, it is a quest to find your father, who was on an airship, which suddenly vanished from the skies
So you try to achieve this by stepping into your father's shoes and start your job as a so-called 'Bracer' - a kind of unofficial law enforcer
Therefore, you start out with your pair of siblings as 'Junior Bracers' and try to fill the hole left by your Father
This brings you closer to him and the mystery of his disappearance
Sometimes slow, just like a walk through forests and mountains with your friends,then rapid at others like zillion things suddenly making sense, events you thought might happen, come about and people do things you never thought they would do
Breath-taking and like magic keeps you in the world for hours without letting you goThe WorldIt's a big, living world; there are interesting quests, NPCs and locations everywhere
The NPCs were very special to me - some already know things about you (yeah, sounds blurry, but I don't want to spoil anything), some might remember you if encountered before
I have to add, that I really tried to speak to every NPC - whether he would sell me something, give me a quest or just chat with me
That I did every quest possible (though I failed once or twice - since you always have a timeframe depending on your main questline to do sidequests) was just natural - I was motivated to do my 'job' and help the people of the country
Ancient towers, beautiful lakes, magnificent towns, military buildings, rocky mountains, dark forests, misty valleys make up the scenery around you and there is even more to see
The CharactersVery different individuals but every one of them loveable and enjoyable
The two lead characters are Estelle and Joshua Bright, with Estelle being the main character, so to say
On your journey, you encounter multiple other characters who will join your fellowship
It was always hard for me to lose old comrades and gain new ones as I didn't know those and just got to love the ones I used to have with me (looking at you here, little T <3)
After all, that's one of the things that makes this game very special to me
The CombatFirst of - I hate turn based games
The second thing is - I loved the combat in this game
Sounds strange again? - I know, but manipulating the flow of the fight by using crafts {1} or arts {2}, just focusing attacks on the next enemy, deciding whether to heal or attack when between a rock and a hard place - it makes the turns feel exciting and gets your heart racing
Additionally, this game also features elemental-based advantages, so if you fight against a plant-like monster, fire attacks will most likely 1-hit the cabbage
Naturally, this works both ways, so don't think about attacking the water-guys with fire attacks and be wary of their attacks in case you modified your defense to fire
Nevertheless to apply this, you either need the knowledge, where the Monster Book comes in handyor a quartz {3}, that lets you see enemy stats (I used the latter for the whole game)
Sadly here is one thing I didn't like, i
e
that moving your character costs you the full turn, It was really annoying and I ended up using the moving in only 1 or 2 fights across the entire game, which is a bit sad but makes you try to position your characters by attacking certain areas
The 'Retry Offset' (downscaling on losing fights) is another nice feature for those who don't like dying over and over again without seeing any light in a difficult situation
On the whole, this game is about the story and not the combat so you shouldn't rage about it and dislike the game because of one single fight
Definition of TermsCrafts are unique special abilities of each character, they use 'CP' (Craft Points) which you get by attacking or being attacked
At 100 CP you can use an even more powerful S-Craft, which gains power as your CP-bar rises, up to 200 points
Arts are the magic in this world, you gain access to magic depending on the quartz installed in your 'Orbment' (a device for using arts)
Quartz is made of so-called 'Septium Crystals' (a secondary currency/resource), they come in different elements and strengths and feature bonuses to your basic abilities like Attack and Defence and grant you access to arts
The VisualsI won't call it graphics, this game is old and you can certainly see this
However this is the PC version, so you won't have problems playing it on 1080p, the text is easy to read, the graphics of the faces (only for important characters) are magnificent and most importantly - the style matches the game and enhances the atmosphere perfectly
You can certainly see that much thought and love was put into designing the whole world and every interior
Well, to be honest, the trees in the forest don't exactly look hand-placed, but who cares about that anyway?The SoundYeah, this gets an extra bullet-point, because every time I start up this game I immediately get goosebumps - I think that's enough to describe it
Moreover 'The origins of light' (or 'of the stars') is just a beautiful soundtrack and by far not the only great one in this game
The sound really adds to the atmosphere in the game
The VerdictLast but not least, the game is extremely fun and at the end of the day, that's what matters in a game  - having fun
I finished this game with a smile on my face and tears in my eyes, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry - the best ending ever in the video games I've played
I advise everyone to get this game and enjoy the magicical journey of the Trails in the Sky[www
trailsinthesky
com] :-)NoteIf you have read this far - thank you
I hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like
My review for Trails in the Sky Second Chapter

Posted: 29 July, 2014
												Alright, kiddo, here's the deal with the deal
You want more JRPGs on Steam, right? Of course you do
You have your Final Fantasy, you have your Agarest, you have a few others, but you want more
I want more
We all want more
Guess what Trails in the Sky is
That's right; a JRPG
You buy it, you tell publishers "hey dudes look there's a market for this genre
"And are you the type of person who sees a bunch of games starring rugged white guys with guns and gets sad that there aren't more female game protagonists? Well, you see that person with the staff and the ponytails up there? Guess what that person is
Female? You bet your sweet buttery biscuits she's female
Her name is Estelle
She's pretty interesting
And there are three other playable ladies in the game
They're all interesting also
And there's four dudes as well, and all of them are interesting
Everyone is really frigging interesting
"But I don't want to give money to some jerky big-name game publisher
Who is getting my hard-earned regional currency?" Wise up, you dingus; your hard-earned regional currency is going to XSEED
You know how awesome XSEED is, mofos? Really really awesome
More awesome than you and I put together
As for the game itself? Alright, fine, let me serious up for a minute
*ahem*Call me odd, but when it comes to JRPGs, I'm the type of person that prefers strong gameplay over a strong story
Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with video games as a storytelling medium (hell, the entire genre of visual novels exists for this exact purpose), but if I really want a good story, then I have both a library card and a Netflix subscription to take advantage of
I play video games because I want to, you know, *play a game*
Because of this, I'm much more likely to enjoy - as well as replay - JRPGs that favor complex gameplay over a compelling story (Pokemon, Golden Sun, Final Fantasy V) than JRPGs that favor a compelling story over complex gameplay (Lunar, Earthbound, Final Fantasy IV)
The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is one of the only exceptions
That's not to say that the gameplay is bad; think of the battle system as a cross between Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy Tactics
It's fun, it moves at a good pace, and it features the *classiest* damn battle music I have ever heard
The thing to be aware of before diving in, though, is that the game is broken up into five chapters, with each chapter having its own locations, dungeons, sidequests, enemies, and so on
Once you complete a chapter and move on to the next one, you can't go back, meaning that anything you missed is now completely inaccessible
Even within the individual chapters, the sidequests (of which there are a TON, a plus in my book) have relatively small timeframes; there are also a bunch that aren't even listed until you happen to bump into them, including a couple that make me seriously wonder how anyone at Falcom could think that players could complete them all without a guide
While the sidequests are, of course, optional, they do offer some nifty rewards, challenging battles, and humorous cutscenes, and if nothing else, it's frustrating to be at the endgame and be missing only one or two entries in the bestiary or recipe book
But Trails in the Sky features quite literally the most vibrant, detailed world of any JRPG I have ever played
This game has an immense amount of text, and XSEED did an absolutely wonderful job translating it for English-speaking audiences
Be aware that the story is not fast-paced in the slightest - it's a slow burn with an emphasis on character interactions and world-building
Because of this, the cutscenes in Trails tend to take a long time, like many other entries in the genre, but the writing is so strong and the characters so likable that you won't mind at all
Even beyond the main characters and story, you rarely have to go far to find an NPC with something interesting to say - not a whole lot of "Welcome to Corneria" or "Press Start to open the menu" here
(Protip: reexamine each treasure chest after opening
)Interesting characters

												Unbelievable world building and detail, well-developed characters, careful deliberate pacing (although slow due to having to set up a huge saga as its first entry) and a well-written script all contribute to creating a world that pulls you in and is populated by characters you care about
Despite the huge amount of text in this game (yeah by the way, stay away if you don't like reading) I found myself savoring each and every line in the game, even those by random NPCs
It's like reading a good fantasy novel, it really is the best world building and such work that I've seen in a JRPG, most likely ever
That would be reason enough to jump in, but the RPG underneath that world is also fun, balanced, and somewhat nostalgic
Battles have that "everything matters" feeling, a sort of mix between a strategy game and a traditional RPG system
Character progression is tied to the story, but gets really good after about the midpoint in the game, and battles ramp up in strategic scope as you go along
Overall, this should not be missed by fans of JRPGs, or anyone that enjoys good narrative and world building in video games, especially the more literary types who are accostumed to diving into fantasy novels and taking in all the details and workings of a fictional world to heart as it slowly unravels in your head
By the way, the random NPCs who roam around the village and such? The soldiers? The innkeepers? They have character arcs
Character
Arcs
That's all
There's no overstating the narrative and world detail that goes into this series
Get it

												Should you buy this game? So glad you asked
Yes!Should this be your very first JRPG? Yes, but


read on
*My recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€)
The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG
This was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned


*****  World of Zemuria: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich
(5/5)For this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries
Cliché much?This game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning
Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available
(You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job
) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative
Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts
The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever
XSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game
With the problems they faced[xseedgames
tumblr
com] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed
Warning for the easily offendable: This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West
When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect
Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger
That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground
The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him
***** Playable characters: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery
(5/5)You get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids
The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own
Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well
Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites
In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas


You'll love it
So what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way
The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class)
You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize
You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle


I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds
All in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot
And there's ample room for experiment, which is great
Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint
Warning for the lazy: The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually
Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't)
Warning for time-constrained: Beware the walls of text
Seriously
It's a living book
 It eats players
Warning for the romantically inclined: There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson)
Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit
***  The gameplay : a rocky ride to get through the story
(3/5)What I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from
The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers
I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!With that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation
The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a guide[www
gamefaqs
com] to get them)
In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus
Warning in general: achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly
As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!Warning for time-constrained:  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it
Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff
The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can
And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre
Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows
You can miss so much with only a click
I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect
The re-run was worth it
*TL;DR: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated
Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements)
*Thank you for reading this review
It was my first, and I hope it served you well

												Trails in the Sky, or Sora no Kiseki, is an expansive RPG trilogy with massive content - very well done world-building and well-paced characterization
The story begins slowly and quietly with Estelle and Joshua, along with a couple friends
The pace picks up during mid-game before ending with a fantastic finale
The story does well in holding an epic scale while at the same time remains personal where it’s needed, as Estelle and Joshua travel together and develop themselves
It’s pretty clear that Falcom’s ambition is to create a tasteful unified world for all of their Kiseki games
That is something I really value
Estelle is pretty annoying, to be quite frank
But regardless of that, she’s a very well-developed character with a lot of personality depth
To compliment her stubborn and hot-headed nature and balance out the personality chart, there is her ugh … partner, Joshua, who is usually quiet, calm, and very clever
Their interactions and relationship in general are a pleasure to watch
The rest of the cast consists of very well-distinguished characters too, but I’m going to let you decide that
SnK isn’t the only game with well thought-out characters for sure
All I’m saying is, Estelle and Joshua are one hell of an enjoyable pair
The battle system is a mixture of traditional turn based and grid based battle system
Aside from the usual RPG combat elements, the grid provides the players with a lot of depth for strategic combat decisions, regarding space and sometimes even time
In terms of combat abilities, the characters are also very well-varied and well-balanced, allowing a lot of customization to suit your playstyle
Not to mention that the Quartz system plays a big role in determining each character’s combat abilities as well
If you love JRPGs, you should definitely give Trails in the Sky a try
Despite the slow beginning, I promise the deep world-building and character interactions will keep you engaged

												Final Fantasies, Front Missions, Suikodens, Saga Frontiers, Vandal Hearts, Chrono Trigger, Shin Megami Tenseis, Fire Emblems, Breath of Fires, Grandias, Tales, Xenogears and Xenosagas; in all I've played easily over 50 jRPGs
And if I had to name the best jRPG I've ever played, there's no doubt in my mind- it is The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky
Forget about cult classics Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 7- they were very good games to be sure, but just don't measure up to this little gem
The only jRPG that comes close as far as I'm concerned is the original Suikoden, and even then I'm aware that's mostly my nostalgia speaking
On to the game itself: its combat is serviceable
I know that's not much of a recommendation, and it shouldn't be; the tightness of their combat systems has never been a main draw of jRPGs
In this genre, combat is usually more relaxing and cathartic than engaging, and while there are exceptions in harder games or game modes, the way to beat those is more brainy puzzle-solving than high-octane action
Combat in jRPGs mostly serves as breaks between storytelling segments, and the combat for The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky does an excellent job in that regard; you can dodge encounters when you don't feel like fighting, if you're underleveled you'll earn a lot of experience and catch up quickly, and if you're overleveled combat will provide very few rewards, signalling that you're more than ready to advance the story
Tip: Speed is the best stat, seek to boost it with your orbments
The cast of companions is good but not hugely memorable; besides the two main characters, there will be high points in your cast of companions like the devious Scherazard and low points like the dullard Agate
This works just fine, because the spotlight throughout the game is shone on protagonists Estelle and Joshua, and the mystery surrounding their father, Cassius Bright
I won't go into detail because spoiling the story would be criminal; it is hands down the best story I've ever seen in a jRPG, and probably the best story I've seen in a videogame, period
It is full of intrigue, misdirection and foreshadowing; in a fantastic deconstruction of jRPG tropes, not everything foreshadowed ends up coming to happen, as your group only sees an incomplete picture of a complex puzzle, and their interpretations of events and what's going on behind the scenes are merely educated guesses- which sometimes hit the mark, and sometimes don't
When the end of the game comes along and the storylines unravel, I was flabbergasted; I couldn't stop thinking about the game for weeks
The game's writing is delightful
In jRPGs, we've grown to expect either shoddy translations or faithful translations of shoddy original dialogue
Not here; the lines the characters speak always feel authentic, like something people would actually say in their situations
When Estelle and Joshua are playing the part of the rookies, travelling alongside a more experienced Bracer, it is brilliantly reflected in the story and the dialogue; there's a myriad of small details which Joshua and (especially) Estelle might miss, but a more experienced Bracer like Scherazard wouldn't
When a more senior bracer pulls rank on you, you can tell that they have good reason to do so (except when Agate does it
He's just a jerk)
There's a bunch of optional quests to complete throughout the game in the form of Bracer assignments; some are fairly straightforward, others require more lateral thinking, and one in particular just about requires looking up the answers on the internet
Yes, the stupid library quest for finding the missing books
These side quests are okay, but nothing to write home about; the heart and soul of this game is in the story and the writing
The places you visit, the people you meet


it seems straightforward, but then it hits you in the face and you realize it was a curveball
Not always
But just often enough to keep you on your toes
If you have any interest at all in jRPGs, do yourself a favor and play this game
It is the best the genre has to offer

												Now this is one of those games that scratch that nostalgia itch, nostalgia for times when I was a decade or two younger and all I could ask from a game was to tell you and let you participate in a story that's worth being heard
You will find no shiny loot to show off to your acquaintances with, you will find no quick instant gratification here
If you seek that, go grab the current flavor of the month blockbuster
What this game has, and in spades, at that; is the world, the characters, the story, the music and a lot of subtlety
Oh, and a boat chase scene
It has a boat chase scene
Moving along, this isn't a game to be played with half your attention elsewhere
You're going to miss on a lot if you don't really pay attention
And when I say you're going to miss a lot, I mean both quests and entertainment
The character interaction, while scripted, is a lot more natural than is typical for the genre, with off-hand remarks, interjections, under-the-breath murmurs and such
The protagonist duo, again, not typical for the genre, does well to avert the usual "Brooding Bishonen with Baggage" protagonist problem with JRPGs to a large degree
Also, it is not a story about a couple of kids saving the world of useless adults; It's more about a couple of kids getting swept up into more than they bargained for, and doing their part
The combat can get a little repetitive at times, hair-pullingly frustrating at others, and just plain annoying at others still, because, dammit, I was in the middle of something and now this bunch of mobs is trying to interrupt me! Still, the possibilities with the customization of every character's magic setup along with the option to interrupt an enemy turn with your own limit break makes for quite tactical combat that can get you away with your skin even from a surprise attack
The storytelling is detailed and at times quite persistent, there are several scenes that last for about ten minutes before you're back to the gameplay, but again, with how naturally the characters converse, it doesn't feel off
 Now, the story itself does get a bit overwhelming at the halfway point, but if you've been paying attention, you can see many of the twists coming; or rather, you will figure out that there will be a twist; the twist itself is still likely to sweep you clean off your feet
Oh and by the way, NPCs travel around the world too, and remember you if you met before, and the subtlety of the worldbuilding is amazing
For a minor example, at some point there's a restaurant where you can hear that recent problems with monsters are making it hard to get ingredients for their dishes
If you don't take care of that problem, they  will actually go and change their menu (and the items you can buy there)
The music is simply amazing, but that's nothing new for a Falcom game
Now excuse me, I have a New Game Plus to play
On Nightmare

												Most of the reviews out there touch upon technical details of the PC port, leaving the substance of the game alone
I aim to fix that
First off, let me confirm everything you heard so far about the quality of the port itself - it's really the best one by far by Square Enix
It's smooth, it looks better than on consoles, there is a higher variety of visual options
The port includes all DLC and both English and Japanese audio
Now, let's move on to the reason I even decided to write this in the first place: the game itself
Is it good? In short: Very
At this point, I've spent a little more than 6 hours in it, and I already feel like it managed to justify the price
The story is pretty good so far, that said, it is very important that you play FF XIII and XIII-2 first, otherwise many many things will be lost on you
The combat system is probably the most dynamic and player-inclusive in the FFXIII trilogy
It feels quite responsive and your own skill matters quite a lot
The music is very good, unlike XIII-2
I am yet to find a piece that drives me nuts, like Unseen Intruders, which is a good sign
The world is gigantic in this game, and it's very non-linear at that
Now, the dreaded time-limit
I understand that many of you hate the very idea of it, and I was one of you, but now that I tried it, I have to say: the feature is solid
The need for time-management grants the gameplay a sense of urgency and pacing that translates to you feeling on the edge
You experience something similar when you have a last sliver of health in games like Dark Souls
The tensions is exquisite
Completing quests in the game actually allows you to postpone the timelimit, which gives you very real insentive to be efficient
Every day at 6 AM (game time) you are returned to the hub area, and you can see your progress
Let me tell you, when you get there and see that all your actions were not in naught, all the tense gameplay of the day pays off tenfold
So, yes, I do recommend this game, the only caveat being: "If you played XIII and XIII-2 first"
9/10 so far
Will edit if my opinion changes
Edit #1
28 hours in
The gameplay is still solid, as is the music, however, I want to add some important things
1
The side quests are divided into two categories - normal ones that you find in the world and boring fetch quests that you find on special boards
Initially, this was ok, but now it seems somewhat repetitive, as I am running out of quests that don't descend into tedium
2
The culmination points for each story arc are mostly very good, but the build up to them can be somewhat lacking
3
The time limit is a joke now
I have 5 days left, and it seems I did most of the content available
This might be because I heavly used the game mechanic allowing you to briefly freeze the clock for special points you get form battles
4
That said, some of the achievements and many items, and even gameplay mechanichs, seem to only unlock on NG+
5
I like where the main story arc is going so far
Rating: 8
5 because I hate fetch quests and pointless grinding
Will edit again, possibly
Edit #2Beat the game
100% achievements
Took me 51 and a half hours
Final thoughts:1
The game stability is faulty in a certain large underground story-related location in the Dead Dunes
Aside from that spot, it ran smoothly
2
The main story arc did not disappoint
3
The game offers some surprisingly good end-game content, including the superbosses
4
The time limit IS a joke
I had 4 days with nothing to do towards the end of the game, so I just slept in the in-game inns
5
NG+ on Hard felt easier than NG on Normal
I'm still glad I picked Normal, it wasn't as hard as people say it is
Final rating: 8
0-8
5
It was a solid game

												It is clear that the extra time they put into the pc port of this game was worth it
The graphics settings are much greater than the two prior iterations, however at least in the first hour of gameplay, there have not been any bugs or glitches
The game runs at a consistant 60 fps on maxed out 1080p settings on my GTX 970
So far, it seems that holding off and waiting for the pc release of this game was certainly worth it!

												[Please note that I'm posting this review for all 3 games of this complex bcause it applies to them all and contains no technical nor spoiler-kind of information]So here's my recommendation for everybody who things about getting this game and heard negative comments regarding story line and characters
Content based comments
I'll not refer to the technical side of the game, since I'm not gamer enough to comment on it
If you consider buying this game, get them all
All 3 of them
FINAL FANTASY® XIII, FINAL FANTASY® XIII-2 and LIGHTNING RETURNS: FINAL FANTASY XIII
And play through them all in this order before you judge the storyline
This set of games has a complicated storyline with lots of details and temporary endings that won't be resolved until the very end
THat's what I really like about this series
I've heard a lot of people saying the main character Lightning is cold
Not only can I not agree with it, it's also resolved at the very end
Final Fantasy - as far as I could grasp the concept so far (I'm no expert) with it's games, movies and series - deals with the topics of things coming to some end in some sense (as in "Final") and the dreams, hopes, illusions people have (as in "Fantasy")
What hope is left and born when you reach the end? So naturally there's a lot of complexity involved
A lot of "reading between the lines" is required
And the very best of it: as much as there's "good" and "evil", in the Final Fantasy stories there's like a TON of "in-between"
The developers show the light and shades within everyone and everything
So, if you are not scared and interested into diving into the complexity of mankind, this game is for you
If you want to learn and see what potentials "drama", "bad luck" and "tragedy" can bring forth, this game is for you
If you like beautiful scenery, music and character design, this game is for you
If you like a bit of fighting (which can be adjusted in difficulty and frequency by personal taste) but mainly enjoy stories, this game is for you
This game is probably NOT for you if you ar hardcore gamer loving overly difficult gameplay, grinding and so on
You can dive into the complexity of the game and find out about all of te effect and how to use them best and you can go out for hunting for hours BUT you don't need to
I really enjoyed that part!Have fun, everyone!

												Man what a game



me and my friends used to make fun of Lightning and Co
Out of curiosity, I picked up the first game on steam during the amazon black friday deal for $4
I had no clue id play through the entire trilogy
I loved every moment of it
Part 3 is hands down the best part out of the 3 games
It has the best battle system, and tons of side quest that feed into the overall main story
No more linearity of the first game or the convoluted plot of the second
They took the best of the previous two games and nailed it here
Also its a great port, running at a silky smooth 60fps as it should on the glorious PC
These three being my first FF games, so I cant account for how veterans may enjoy these titles, but I def gve it a thumbs up!   9/10

												Following FF13-2 and 13-1, Lightning Returns with a new battle system and an open world concept
It features a day/night cycle that dictate npc interactions and serves as a constant reminder of how much time has been spent
The story was mediocre and aimed too high
However the cinematic story rendering was fantastic and the voice acting was well done (English)
Small gripes I had with this game - Firstly I felt the day/night countdown timer really made players hardpressed to find efficient quest completion routes
If you are a relaxed and slow player like myself, you might not be able to progress far enough into the game to defeat the last boss
My second issue was with the characters and the actual story
I felt the storytelling in Snow's and Noel's storylines were languid
Their motivation in the game weren't realistic and didn't support their original actions against the protagonist
Lumina's behavour was also perplexing, her attitude flip-flopped and you couldn't tell when she was was lying or telling the truth
The story becomes even more unrelatable when you're forced to trust in something she says, given her history of messing with you
Finally the overarching story aimed too high and simply fell short of my expectations
The final boss and the the wrap-up all felt a little too forced as Lightning, storywise, was shown to be more impressive in comparison to the final boss, a notion that wasn't conveyed properly through the cinematics
However, despite these gripes, Lightning Returns does conclude the stories of FF13-1&2 in a meaningful satisfactory manner
8/10
Pick this game up only if you've invested in the first two installments
			
Posted: 3 January, 2016
												This is a very tough negative review for me to write, because Lightning Returns does so many things right but it also narrowly misses on some very important things
Lightning Returns succeeds on every technical level
 The graphics are gorgeous, the music is good, and LR has received the best PC port of any Square Enix game to date
It runs flawlessly and even has full Japanese interface available for bilinguals like myself
It is by all means an excellent game on many fronts, and a drastic improvement over its predecessors
That said, Lightning Returns is direly lacking in both story and gameplay depth
Let's start with the story: It is quite simply eye-rollingly bad
Almost every single line of dialogue is hopelessly contrived at best and laughable at worst
In the interest of avoiding spoilers I'm not going to go too far into details, but my eyes start to glaze over when the major characters are all constantly making melodramatic monologues about how they've been lovesick for 500 years
To make matters worse, everyone's problems that they've been dealing with for 500(!!) years are MAGICALLY resolved by Lightning Ex Machina because all it takes is a 10 minute chat with Lightning and maybe a fight or two and all 500-year-long issues are instantly resolved
There is no nice way of saying it: it's awful writing that makes Lightning come dangerously close to Mary Sue territory
Which is a real shame because I love Lightning and she has some genuinely great moments
Another massive issue is that the game is very short
Imagine my surprise when I checked a FAQ to see my progress about 10 hours in and discovered I was over 40% done with the main quest
The main story is astonishingly short and then you're supposed to spend the rest of the time running around doing random side quests before the final boss
Then there's the battle system
At first blush it seems quite engaging and deep but the problem is that this is actually a massive façade
There is in reality very little strategy or depth to the system at all
I kept waiting for them to introduce new elements that mix it up or keep things interesting but it pretty much stays the same way through the entire game, and that boils down to this:A) Read stagger conditions/try to stagger the enemyB) Block when they attackThat's literally it
Stagger conditions and weaknesses vary depending on the enemy but for the massive majority of the game you can get by just spamming whatever and blocking occasionally and you will be fine
I really feel like if the player had been given FULL control of Lightning in battle instead of very limited control that it could have introduced a new dimension of depth to the game that would have kept it feeling fresh
Overall I have to say though that Lightning Returns is a beautiful game that does so many things right but falls tragically short of being a great game
It may be the right game for someone else, but it just left me wanting more

												I was very impressed when I bought this game earlier
This is the final series of the entire Final Fantasy XIII series
Unlike the Crystarium system from previous Final Fantasy XIII series, it is gone from the game
Instead there are numerous schematas that have different abilities
Previous Final Fantasy XIII series Lightning garbs are aslo available as a reward (Guardian Corps and Knight of Etro)
Main, side quests and Canvas of Prayers is required to strengthen Lightning for more difficult battles
Abilities can be farmed by fighting enemy monsters and they can be upgraded as well
Game ahs 3 difficulty options: Easy, Normal and Hard
Once you select the difficulty, it cannot be changed in the game
Hard mode becomes available once you have compeleted the Main Story on Easy or Normal difficulty
Hard Mode allows you to upgrade your weapons, shields and accessories
2 optional bosses are also included on the game
I really enjoyed this game a lot and have quite a few hours in it
The only downside of the game is that you will always need a live internet connection if you want to play with it
Also there is no mouse support for the game too
You have to use keyboard buttons for the controls
I would rate it 10/10

 After playing FC and SC you'll know that the TC (3rd Chapter) will be fantastic, no matter what
You're trapped
After finishing SC you'll know that something is hella wrong
That Floating City "Liber Ark", is destroyed and still


something is hella wrong
There is something more behind the Name Kevin Graham
In 3rd Chapter you're trying to find out, what's the Story Sequel after Finishing SC
Third Chapter is more like a "big Expansion pack", which is NOT bad at all! Through your journey there are:5(6) - Moon Doors15 - Star Doors5 - Sun DoorsEvery Single one of them included a Special Detail of a Story Part you discovered through First Chapter and Second Chapter
For Example:After finishing SC, Tita tells Agate, that he has to visit her at the end of each month and Agate accept her invitation
One of those doors is exactly about that
So no matter what you're doing you'll find yourself in MUCH Flashbacks and I LOVE that so damn much
I, for myself, discovered every single one of them, becuase I want to know what's happening
Some Doors on the other Hands, are completely new and offer a Mini-Game for example
The Main aspect of the Third Chapter is the main story tho, but I would suggest to open every Single one of them and fulfill their requirements
While the story is the star of the show, the game shines in other areas, too
The combat system is a turn-based system that borrows a lot from JRPGs that were typical of the era, but it adds in a tactical, grid-based positioning system, and each character's abilities are fairly customizeable
The game also has multiple difficulty settings, and if a particular fight is too hard for you, there's a handy option to retry fights that also temporarily lowers the difficulty level
The game's soundtrack is also great; it's exactly what you'd expect from the same developer who created the critically acclaimed Ys series or FC / SC
Really the only complaint I could make is that the graphics are a bit dated by modern standards, but hey, it's a ten-year-old Japanese PC game
They still do their job as intended, and you're going to enjoy the game enough that you won't care
At last, some players may wonder about the game hour of this game
Well, it varies according to player style
On average, it should be around 40 hours
However, if you attempts to find out all secrets, exploring the hidden area and trigger hidden events, and read all NPC dialogues whenever the game world changes, then expect the game will be as long as 70 hours or even more
Why not clock in more hours with it? It is a game with lots of attention to details, which is one of the standard of high quality RPG
Hope this help some users wondering why this game has so much praise

												Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series
This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title (which I won't specify for a good reason) into a blender machine
Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors
I cannot stress this enough: If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors
There is a good reason this game is named "the 3rd" instead of "Third Chapter", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC
If you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here
If you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story)
If you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here
This game is first and foremost a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler, one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes
The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero (which is ironic considering the name of this series)
This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter
There are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game (16 in total)
Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of "NPC dialogue" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games
You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation
There are sidequests which serve to further flesh out the characters and the setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in
To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them
These sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game
Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves
Word of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a good reason why the console version of this game was censored (don't worry, the Steam version isn't)
Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i
e
Star Door 15, Renne's story
There is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle (I'm looking at you Mr
N)
Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games
Oh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?------------------------------------------------To end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the "semi-fandisc" nature of this game:There is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story
There is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games
Though this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy
They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game
Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons


----------------------------------------------P
S
Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare
Seriously, don't
P
S
2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the "Falcom" logo animation; just sit back and watch
There's a bit more after that

3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers inbound for those familiar with the SH franchise: Silent Hill 2
Just how deep the similarites run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself
			
Posted: 10 June
												Before you consider buying this game, it is of the utmost importance that you play through Trails in the Sky FC and SC first, as this game contains heavy spoilers for both and you will be very confused on the plot from the get-go
The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 3rd, the last game in the Sky trilogy, tends to be a rather controversial title among fans, as it is a "capstone" game of sorts, tying up the loose ends of the previous games and introducing plot points/setting up for the future games, namely the Crossbell and Erebonia arcs
Because of this, it lacks a couple of the things that caused fans to love the first two Sky games
That would be because this game has no board side quests or open world exploration; it has been described as a "dungeon crawler" of sorts
The game is set in an alternate dimension called Phantasma, which is influenced by the thoughts and emotions of those inside it, and therefore recreates replicas of many iconic areas from the original games as devil-filled dungeons, treasure and all (which seems to me like a very convenient excuse to lazily reuse maps from the earlier games


)
That's not necessarily a bad thing, though - it still maintains the two aspects that cause the Trails series to shine so bright among almost all other JRPGs - its soundtrack and storytelling
An interesting mechanic introduced in this series is the concept of "memory doors"
The party will periodically find magical doors hidden throughout the dungeons, which tell a riddle or offer a challenge in order to open
Upon solving the riddle/defeating the challenge, it will play a "memory fragment", which is essentially a long cutscene based around one particular character or story aspect, adding additional depth to the existing characters' development as well as introducing new plot points to be expanded on later
The 3rd is also a bit odd as it shifts focus from the main characters Estelle and Joshua Bright to a party member introduced in SC, the wandering priest Kevin Graham
The game focuses on him as he and his companions descend deeper into the heart of Phantasma, uncovering the mysteries of the dimension and bringing his tragic past to light in the process
The 3rd's storyline is also noticeably darker than the original games, which were relatively lighthearted in comparison
One particular memory door stands out to me as a testament to the game's change in tone, that being Star Door 15 (the implications of that memory combined with the music choice is extremely creepy and depressing at the same time, and the fact that it centered around my favorite character was a little heartbreaking)
There were also some minor edits to the combat system
The EP costs of some arts were changed, cooldown timers were adjusted for certain arts and crafts, and a few new turn bonuses were added
The elements of time, space, and mirage also are now relevant in battle, as enemies will have resistances and weaknesses to these elements, as opposed to the standard earth/fire/water/wind (which means you can't spam Dark Matter on shining poms to kill them anymore as they resist it now


)Trails in the Sky the 3rd is a very linear game, going from dungeon to dungeon with next to no sidequests at all - all side missions and activities are achieved through the memory doors
One of the things that I liked about this particular game is that it allows you an extremely high amount of party variety - at the end of the game, you will be able to mix and match your party from 16 possible party members
However, getting the mira and sepith required to gear up all these characters is rather taxing on your budget, so you are forced to choose wisely what you buy and who you give it to
Finally, it is noticeable more difficult than the previous games, so you actually have to have an idea of what you are doing to make reasonable progress
While some Trails fans have stated that the 3rd is significantly worse than the first two games and is an unnecessary addition that does not need to be played, I beg to differ, as it has proven itself to actually be my personal favorite amongst the three
It wraps up the plot of the Sky games very well, and has left me very anxious for the following Crossbell arc to be translated
Sure, you don't get to go exploring or do entertaining side quests often, but the slight difficulty spike, additions to the OST, and myriad of interesting dungeons and bosses make this one a must-buy for any Trails fans
If you've played and enjoyed the first two games, there is absolutely no reason not to pick up this one as well, for while it may not have all of the charm that FC and SC had, it still maintains the excellent storytelling that defines Trails and manages to cement itself as one of the best JRPGs on the market
I cannot praise the Trails in the Sky series enough, and wholeheartedly recommend it to any fan of JRPGs or story-based games
Cuteness is justice!

												With every purchase we're one step closer to the potential localization of the Crossbell Arc
			
Posted: 1 June
												Amazingly enough it's one of the best dungeon crawl games! or it could be but only if before playing it you've spent ~150 hours on previous games and there is no way around it, reading summaries won't cut it in this case
It also has: nice cozy dungeons with plenty of healing spots, teleporting and a home base full of books
Like other Trails games, it has superb mouse controls
Will mouse paradise end with this game? That is the question

												A continuation of Trails in the Sky: First Chapter and Trails in the Sky: Second Chapter, which were two games telling a single story, the Third is less of a sequel and more of an epilogue for the Liberl arc as well a prologue to the rest of the series, part of which has been released in the West as Trails of Cold Steel I and Trails of Cold Steel II
The main story is told as the player progresses through the dungeon, but the actual relevant world-building mostly takes place in flashback scenes- of which there are plenty
It is unmistakenbly very different in setup compared to Trails in the Sky FC and SC, where the player moves through a living, breathing world, while this game can be characterised more as a dungeoncrawler
While this can be disappointing, the overall world leaves no room for the playable characters of FC and SC to gang up for another great adventure in the continuity established there
Only by stepping outside of this frame of reference can we see them once more as a group, which is exactly what this game delivers- and with copious amount of flashbacks, too, to deliver extended glimpses into the world we've come to known in the first two games
This all makes the 3rd a very different beast compared to FC and SC- but with all mechanics remaining in place, a familiar one nonetheless
People coming in expecting more of FC and SC will be disappointed, but the game has enough charm of its own and is instrumental in broadening the scope of the world beyond Liberl that it remains a highly recommended, even essential, game to fans of the series

												On October 26th, 2014, I was stumbling around Steam, looking for some RPG to spend some time on
A game by the name of Trails in the Sky caught my eye, so I decided to try it out
I wasn’t prepared for this series to completely blow me out of the water and change my outlook and give me so many new possibilities of the awesome world of Falcom
After the ending of FC, I scoured the internet to figure out when the sequel of this great game I just played would come
Sadly, it seemed that it would never come, through a series of events that could only be described as Murphy’s Law
About a year later, Trails in the Sky Second Chapter came out in English
This game again blew me out of the waters due to its amazing characterization and world building
I played Trails of Cold Steel I+II on the PS3 in the meantime
Then finally, around a year and a half after SC was launched, Trails in the Sky the Third, the final game in the ‘Sky’ arc of the Trails series, and I have to say, it is definitely the best
Firstly, this is the Third game of the Sky series, and not much will make sense if you start here
 Trails in the Sky First Chapter  is the place to start
The Third is pretty different from the average JRPG, and certainly different to the normal Trails game
It could best be described as “dungeon crawler” but that doesn’t do it justice
The Third mostly takes place in one giant area called Phantasma, and it includes doors that when opened with the right character or situation, will grant a memory fragment
These memory fragments are essentially huge amounts of development for characters and the world around them, and it wraps up well on how everyone is doing after the events of SC
There is so much more that gets explored in Phantasma, but it’s hard to include what they are without spoilers
The only negative here is that there are much fewer chances to talk to NPCs, but inter party interactions rise up
Battles are in the same grid system as the first two, and plays similarly to SC, but with a few new arts added in
It’s nice, fun, and difficult at the higher difficulties
The Third's difficulty is juuuust rightSC had some pretty bad difficulty spikes, especially in the beginning of the game, but the Third hits the spot of being difficult, but not too difficult in certain areas, and is generally a much more internally balanced game than FC or SC
With the end of SC, it is also the end of Estelle and Joshua’s main story, but they do appear as side characters in the Third as well
Instead we have Kevin Graham, the somewhat mysterious Gralsritter Dominion of the Septian Church
It’s hard to go into explaining him without spoiling anything, but he has quite a few secrets up his sleeve
Also with him is the newly appointed Knight, Ries Argent, a childhood friend of Kevin’s
She’s probably one of the few characters I could complain about, but that was mainly due to her being one of the few new characters and without the development of previous games
Luckily, by the end she is definitely a very dear character
Kevin and Reis gain much of their development through the main story, where the rest of the original cast is farther looked upon in the doors
 Speaking of the doors, they also offer insight on the continent of Zemuria as a whole, and bring up some plot points that come up in later Trails games
 The Third has much darker tones than the other Trails games
Chapter 7 as a whole and star door 15 were absolutely beautiful, in a horrifying and depressing way
The music is up to Falcom’s high standards, and I’d argue it has the best soundtrack out of all the Sky games
I mean, who wouldn’t want to overdose on that heavenly bliss? XSEED’s translations are amazing as always, and they didn’t even censor a scene that could've been
Thumbs up here
All the things I love about the Trails series is here; lovable characters, excellent and detailed storytelling/worldbuilding/writing, awesome soundtrack
I could gush on about how some random NPC mentions a jewelry store in a city in Erebonia, in which game was made 6 years in the future, or that the literature of the game has some surprising backstory to them, or the cynical, sarcastic, 4th wall breaking, or reference creating empty chest quotes
Thank you Falcom and XSEED for this fun ride of a series
I hope Trails to Zero and Azure can be localized, but that will require these games to get good sales
Please at least try out Trails in the Sky First Chapter, or Trails of Cold Steel, coming soon to Steam
I’d appreciate it

												If you're a complete beginner at making games, this is a fantastic place to start
 There are tooltips for practically everything to hold your hand with anything that isn't already straightforward enough
On the other hand, if you already know programming you can try your hand at scripting completely custom game systems
Lastly, you get a commercial license for everything which alone pays for the product if you ever intend to try to sell one of your creations

New RPG maker engine soon! RPG maker MV is currently advertized on the main site
Some may preffer to hold onto their $ to buy the newer engine
Newer does not mean it will be better in all respects but as they have had a fair while to develop a newer engine it should be superior on the whole
http://www
rpgmakerweb
com/products/programs/rpg-maker-mv (fixed the link)The upcoming rendition will use a different programming lanugege (Java instead of Ruby
) Its main features include the ability to make games for multipul platforms as well as touch screen and mouse support
-windows-mac-android-ios-Browser (html 5)Back to my reviewLove the program
I have used it for a long time now and can say that most of the things I can't do with it aren't needed anyway
In addition to the DLC there is a lot of player-generated content avaliable on the steam community (but be respectful of those who made them) That said, the engine itself is plug-and-play and thus has many practical limitations
There are things it can do and things it can't and not a lot of in-between
Because of this and because of the built-in script editor knowing Ruby languege will greatly enhance your ability to make use of this engine
Notes to potential buyers:because of the cost, I would caution casual buyers to be sure this is a program they would actualy use
As I recall there is a demo ("lite" version) avaliable on the official site for this program that you might want to try
I have not tried to use it myself
It is also available here on steam if you search for it
Some of the music packs also have sample music avaliable on the game's official website: www
rpgmakerweb
com/a/musicMost DLC expands your avaliable content; it is not nessisarialy a straight-up upgrade so don't just buy all of it without looking at it first
Not all of the content shown in the trailer exists in vinilla: spesificaly I noticed the pop-up immages of characters are not included and the "name bar" for character conversations dosen't exist in vanilla
They can, however, be created and added
They might also be avaliable in the DLC or from the community
One last note: I have seen several people buy this engine only to lose interest a couple months in and never finish a project
Make sure you are comitted to completing your game and set reasonable goals based on your current ability
To use this engine you need to know how to work
Although my own goals were overly ambitious initialy I don't plan on quitting until I have at least completed one project
Look at my number of hours, consider that I haven't completed a project, and tell me why you'll need to be comitted to work before you can use this program

												This software is an excellent introduction to game-making
While many people don't like RPG Maker games, it's still a great way to start your game development journey - or just to sate your hobbyist tendencies!I recommend this without reservation - I may never release a game for public, but I love writing short little in-joke games for my family and friends
For instance, I once wrote a short Kingdom Hearts-themed game for my daughter, which also used characters/settings from Beyond Good And Evil and Final Fantasy 7 and 8
As I understand it, under the terms of the RPG Maker license, the game I wrote WOULD NOT be allowed to be released (even as a fan creation) without paying for all of those character's usage rights - but I didn't make it to sell, I made it for my daughter
And SHE loved it
PROS:- Easy to use
- Fairly easy to understand
- Anyone who's fiddled with game editors before should feel right at home
- Plenty of tutorials available
- Great, helpful community, especially on the official website and forums - this was the main selling point for me
- Design is modular (meaning you can work on one aspect of your project at a time, or all at once)- Don't like the Final Fantasy Style battles? Find and download a battle engine to change it to something more like the Zelda games!- Importing custom data (inc
sound and graphics) COULD NOT BE EASIER
- The asking price *includes* a license, meaning you can legally sell your RPG Maker VX Ace game the second you've made it! (there are some understandably strict caveats to this, though)- includes a character maker, ideal for those of us who suck at art (like me)
- ACTIVE devs and community!- Don't have the sprite/sound/script/whatever that you want? Try requesting it in the official forums - chances are, somone else has already requested it! - One of the few pieces of software that I own that has NEVER crashed
- Steam Cards! Hey, it matters to me
;)CONS:- License is included in the price, but some may consider it limited - for instance, if you make a sprite in this program, that's basically the only place you're allowed to use it (exceptions: or other programs in the RPG/Game Maker stable that you own the license to)
So, you can't make sprites in this, then export those sprites to be used in say, a self-made browser-based game
And so too, for ALL the stock assets
- Importing the custom data itself is quite easy - but knowing what to do with it can be confusing at first
For instance, importing a new tileset can be done with 3 button clicks
But then you have to go over the tileset and tell RPG Maker VX Ace which tileblocks the player can walk through, and which they can't, and so on
This makes complete sense once you think about it, but it isn't explained anywhere in game (that I saw)
- The DLC isn't like traditional DLC, it can require some real work to set it up (see above for a basic example)- Advanced Developers (I'm not one, so this is a guess) may find certain aspects of the engine restrictive
People who should buy this software:- Amateur devs- JRPG hobbyist- people curious about the game development process- people who have good ideas for stories- IDEAL for people who want to make their 'first real game'
People who should avoid this software:- Uh


people who hate JRPGs, I guess?- People who refuse to play nice on forums (because that's where most of your questions will get answered)- People who are allergic to cuteness- People who are allergic to lists- People who actively hate maths and other forms of 'thinking'
I'm not trying to be snide, I swear
Some of us just aren't designed for calculations
Having said that, I actually fit into that category - and I love this software
But it is a fact: planning is part of game making
Conclusion:I would basically recommend this software to ANYONE who shows even the slightest bit of interest in it
An excellent and very affordable way to get into game developing - it does exactly what it claims to, and does so quite solidly
I award this product 9/10, without hesitation
*BONUS COMMENT*This software is the best version in the RPG Maker series
It's the Arkham City of the RPG Maker series - it's maybe not the prettiest or most powerful, but it's the one with the least of amount of hoops to jump through and that makes it the most fun out of all of them

												An excellent tool for creating your own role-playing game!  Lots of fun to use, especially if you have your own dream RPG in mind!RPG Maker VX Ace is for you if:- You love single-player 2D role-playing games!- You are new to game development
- You want to create an RPG for fun or as a hobby
- You want to sell your game
- You have little or no programming experience (or, if you do and enjoy scripting!)
- You want your game to be single-player (no multi-player capabilities)
- You are OK with your game only running on Windows, not on Macs or mobile devices (see RPG Maker MV if you want Windows/Mac/mobile support)
Choosing Your Game Engine:RPG Maker is a clear excellent choice if you want to create a single-player 2D role-playing game
 That is what RPG Maker does best, and it is wonderful to work with such a powerful, easy-to-use tool when developing an RPG!However, if you want to build a 2D game that is not an RPG, such as a platformer/jumping game or an action/shooter game, or if your dream is to make a game like Zelda III, you may prefer Game Maker https://www
yoyogames
com/studio or Unity https://unity3d
com/unity (although impressive things have been done with the RPG Maker "Zelda Engine"; but if you embark on such a project with RPG Maker, you need to be a scripter)
 But if you'd like a few jumping puzzles, adventure components, or other features like those in Final Fantasy IV or VI, Dragon Quest IV, or Chrono Trigger, or even a free-movement battle system like Secret of Mana, RPG Maker's base features along with community scripts together allow for a variety of possible game types using RPG Maker!Unity is great for both 2D and 3D games, and a great choice for somebody planning a career in professional game development, but takes longer to learn than Game Maker
 Both allow for multi-player games, which RPG Maker has not yet done
Also, Unity and Game Maker can run games on any platform (Windows, Mac, mobile)
 If you want a multi-platform version of RPG Maker, check out RPG Maker MV!Which is Better, RPG Maker MV, VX Ace, or XP?If you have never used an RPG Maker product before, and price is not an issue, I recommend RPG Maker MV:http://store
steampowered
com/app/363890/MV supports game editing in either Windows or Mac, and supports playing in Windows, Mac, Android, iOS mobile, or web browser
If you are looking for an awesome bargain, get VX Ace on sale!  My experience has been with VX Ace, and I've loved it!  VX Ace only edits and plays on Windows, but it has many established scripts already, providing your game great versatility!Also see RabbitGaming's video for a great comparison of RPG Maker VX Ace and RPG Maker XP:https://www
youtube
com/watch?v=6ZrOmGtrIKUSelling Your Game:RPG Maker VX Ace games can be sold, and do not require the purchaser to have bought an RPG Maker product
So, you can sell your game! However, if you use art, music, or scripts not included with the base product, their terms of use might prevent you from selling your game
 Keep track of what you add to your project if you intend to sell it
Note: You might not make any money with your game
So, do it for the love of your game
Don't quit your day job!  If you make money, congrats! Your game is among amazing titles like "Skyborn" and "To the Moon", among many other games made using RPG Maker that are available in the Steam Store:  http://store

com/tag/en/RPGMaker/Original Art:There are many talented artists who sell their art specifically for RPG Maker VX Ace designers, so you can purchase art that allows you to use it in a commercial product
Or, you can create your own original art or music and add it to your project!Learning Curve:RPG Maker VX Ace requires about 5 hours to learn the basics
 You can save yourself some trouble by looking up an intro YouTube video, such as: https://www
youtube
com/watch?v=SneWwiI5v1k To become familiar with all the advanced options (event commands, parallax mapping, etc) that come standard with the software, it may require 20 to 30 hours, but your game may only require a handfull of these advanced features, depending on the game you make
 Finally, RPG Maker VX Ace has a built-in scripting feature, and it may require 5 to 10 hours to find online and test some free (or purchased) scripts from talented scripters/programmers
Free Scripts:Scripts can add an awesome unique flavor to your game
For example, many developers add scripts to customize the default battle system, and there are many excellent scripts for various styles of battle system
Other scripts add lighting effects, while others add adventure-style jumping, weapons, or puzzles
There are many scripts already created and available, and many of those scripts are free to use in commercial projects
Using freely available scripts is recommended, such as the popular scripts by Yanfly https://yanflychannel
wordpress
com/rmvxa/ , or Theolized http://www
theolized

com/ , among many others
I also highly recommend the Fullscreen++ script by Zeus81 http://forums

php?/topic/14081-fullscreen/ and the word-wrapping script by KilloZapit http://www
rpgmakervxace
net/topic/6964-word-wrapping-message-boxes/ 
 Scripts by different developers may or may not be compatible
If you have a solid programming background already, you can also script basically anything you want within a 2D environment
The scripting language is Ruby and an experienced programmer can learn using online resources for RGSS3
How Multiple Developers can work on One Project:If you have multiple developers, you could take turns working on the same project on one computer
 Or, you could split up the project into components, and have each person work on only one component, such as one on scripts and one on maps, and then bring the files together to see them in action
 However, I recommend using a subversion system, such as TortoiseSVN, used in conjunction with a file sharing system, such as Assembla or DropBox, so multiple developers can work on a single project simultaneously or from different computers/locations
An Example Development Team:Our developing group has used RPG Maker VX Ace to develop an indie game
We are three developers with various roles in the development process, and only rarely able to meet in person
 We share our work easily by using TortoiseSVN linked by Assembla, so that each developer always has the latest update
 Rarely, when using DropBox (which does not host), our team member who is our TortoiseSVN expert had to fix the files
Now we use an Assembla Repository, which hosts and so works smoothly, no hiccups
Completing Your Game:If you are imagining yourself creating an epic RPG like Dragon Quest IV, Final Fantasy VI, or Chrono Trigger, you have found one of the best tools for accomplishing your dream!  (The other is MV!)  However, expect it to take about 10000+ hours, at least, to accomplish your goal; if you have multiple developers in your team, this obviously can cut the workload down to size!  But if you are imagining a game like Dragon Quest I or II, or the original Final Fantasy, you could be done in more like 1000+ hours
 Search "RPG Maker" in the Steam Store, and you will find amazing titles to use as examples
So, for your first game(s), think small!  See this video for tips: https://www

												Never have a spent so much time with a computer game/program of any kind
The time spent alone makes this the best value for my money ever spent
But it gets better



much better
I first bought this to make a game for my daughter when I was unable to find a fun computer game with reading as a main component
Naturally I made her the main character
I have always enjoyed writing, and now I had a whole new platform to craft a story
In time I became attached to my game, even with the default assets
As an educator, I thought this could be a good story-based game for other kids as well
Thus began my attempt to gauge interest
It fared well on Greenlight Concepts


but receieved a lot of criticism on the actual Greenlight, mostly due to using default assets
They liked the concept (a family-friendly RPG), but hated seeing the RTP
Now here is where the versitility of RPG Maker really shined
I was able to import custom made characters and sprites, cutscene art, and original music (bonus: if you compose, you get to use your own music!)


even voice-acting
With the new assets in, my votes increased dramatically, and my game was Greenlit
It was by no means easy
The amount of time and effort is monumental to create a game that others will pay for and enjoy
There are those who will tell you that your first game will never make it commercial, and they are usually right
I had a lot of support from the very helpful RPG maker community
I had some money to invest in the assets
I listened to my crtics, even the ones who blasted me
I had kind people (familiar with rpg maker) alpha test,; their suggestions enabled necessary improvements over many different versions
Having my RPG Maker game Sydney's World up on Steam is an accomplishment I am proud of
But irregardless, the personal satisfaction I had when I played through my final version was priceless

												RPG Maker VX Ace is software meant to help facilitate users in creating that RPG they have in mind
It's not without it's complexities, however, and they are there
Back when RPG Maker for the PSX came out, a friend and I got it
We had to have it mailed to us, since no stores sold it
I honestly don't remember how, since it was before I was really on the internet
In any case; it was weeks of anticipation, for what equated to a memory-card hogging, confusing system of software
I think the best we did was have an event that was basically an arena, where one monster at a time would walk to you and start a fight
It was a lot of money for something we quickly found kinda


hard
Today, though, we can use a keyboard and mouse! Other then that, it's still hard
Like really hard
Not because it's challenging, but because it requires not only putting things together, but learning EXACTLY how to do it
To some, it comes naturally, it's fun, and they put out a couple games
You can find them on the marketplace, too, and play and enjoy them!But be honest, do you buy RPG maker to play RPGs? No
You buy it to work
You buy it as a swiss army knife with a few thousand different tools, with a house to build
It's all there, but you need to learn how to use it


and that's without worrying about content (Want a sprite not there? You can make it, but it's work!)I wonder how many people bought it without making even a simple, but complete game
Count me in!Why, yes, I do have over 2000 hours
It's because my main way of working on my own project is by keeping RM open all the time
Staring at me
"


Hey
It's not done yet
""Yea, I know
Here, I'll make a skill I had in mind
That's something done
""Good, good


I'll be here when you want to make something else
"I've found that RM's forums and Youtube in general have been very helpful
But be forewarned
You're not buying a game
You won't have a great, or even good game just kinda


fit together
You're buying work
In short, I love procrastinating, and RPG Maker VX Ace is a really fun piece of software to tinker with

Ever
			
Posted: 28 February, 2014
												This is a solid tool that will enable you to create JRPGs with relative ease
And I would love to recommend it because it really IS a good and solid piece of software
Putting together a small game is a breeze- maps are designed in a WYSIWYG editor, there is a good default library of graphics and objects
And everything works just fine
Random encounters, multiple characters, shops, turn based combat, it's all there right out of the box and even a newcomer will quickly see his idea turn into something playable
In addition, you're free to release your game whichever way you see fit, even a commercial release is possible
There is a lot to like here
Still I find it hard to fully recommend RPG Maker VX Ace
This is why:1) It is very expensive
60 Euros are a lot of money, especially if you're just curious and maybe want to make a small freeware game
The program has been on sale quite regularly though, dropping to 15 Euros, and that is a good investment indeed
But before you shell out even THAT money, consider getting the freely available "limited" version, which has everything the commercial release has, and only limits the number of objects that can be used
It's still absolutely possible to make decent games with it
2) It is highly restrictive
You can make "classic JRPGs" with ease, but as a newcomer, you're truly stuck with the template RPG Maker provides
The interface, combat rules and attribute system are very, very basic and apart from a quick paint job there's not much you can do


until you're ready to dive into Ruby scripting
3) Scripting is a pain
On the pro side, the Ruby SL is powerful enough to change virtually every aspect of a project
You can create your own combat system, you can create your own attribute system, you can create new interfaces and really make something unique
But the editor is so barebones that you can't really do it comfortably, and especially if you have ever used a more advanced code editor you'll soon wish you could write your code THERE
4) It doesn't take advantage of ANYTHING
Multiple resolutions should be a standard these days, but here you're stuck with a relatively low native resolution that looks charmingly retro or crude depending on your personal opinion
Large games tend to stutter occasionally
And what about a decent options menu? Not to be found
So that's the gist of it
If you like JRPGs, see RPG Maker VX Ace on a discount and feel you can live with the limitations, I daresay you won't be disappointed
It's really fun to make a plot-driven game and see your ideas walk around the screen
Then there is the vast amount of resources available; if you put some effort into it your game can look downright stunning
And there clearly IS a lot of quality in the product- it's not been around for so long for nothing and the Steam version with its Workshop support will defenitely prove worth your while
But it could, and should, be so much better, more accessible, more comfortable to use- and that's where the tool lets you down

												It’s alright
Tales of Zestiria is as middle the road you can get with a modern jRPG, which is probably the game’s major malfunction by the end of it
Mediocrity
In this day and age where giving a game a 7/10 score makes it bargain bin material where does Zestiria fit in?Story & Characters (no spoilers)- The narrative is as basic as it gets, an energetic and sheltered country bumpkin is suddenly confronted with an ancient evil where he learns he’s the chosen one to bring light to the darkness
Expecting something grandiose? Tough luck, you’re not going to get it
In all seriousness, a generic story doesn’t bother me much as long as the game built around it is good
In the end what separates video games from other media is that it’s interactive with many different facets to enjoy, it’s just a shame that Zestiria didn’t bother to innovate much on generic fantasy tropes when there are plenty of games -- even jRPGs -- that do
- Characters are a mixed bag, there are some that I genuinely like while there are others that feel a bit inconsistent or even underdeveloped
I think a prime example that a lot of people like to point to is Alisha, who is arguably the poster-girl of this game yet she’s not even active through half of it
Without any spoilers, the gist of it is that a portion of the characters are either one-dimensional and/or riddled with tropes
This is honestly the most painful detriment to this game considering how the journey for most RPGs is dictated by character arcs and character interactions
While Zestiria excels at having believable character interactions there are a couple of characters that really needed fleshing out
- The skits are good, not really much to say
They keep you entertained and are generally very cozy
I feel like a good majority of the writing budget went into the character skits rather than the actual characters themselves
While it helps make the characters more likeable the skits don't really make up for the lack of character depth
Overall the largest positive this game has going for it
Gameplay Mechanics & Combat- I personally prefer turn-based gameplay more than the ARPG hybrid most modern jRPGs are shooting for
Zestiria can definitely be satisfying to play, but it’s not perfect
Things that really hamper my enjoyment of the combat system would include:Inconsistent ally AI, even with a good build they will go out of their way to get themselves killed, this wouldn’t really be an issue if your overall “grade” after an encounter didn’t factor in how many times your allies got knocked out
Most of the time getting a good grade in this game depends on how well you can babysit your ally, and less on how many flashy combos you can pull off
Frustrating level gating for area bosses
Call me entitled all you want but I never liked the idea of “if you can’t beat that boss then do it later” mindset, it’s especially frustrating when the only optional bosses that follow this mindset are in the starting areas
By the time you feel like you’re “good enough” to take them on you’re 10+ levels above them
”That” fight
the optional Rose/Zavied boss fight - Don’t even get me started on equipment fusing
Sure, it increases the longevity and replayability of the game, but it’s too dependant on RNG and grinding to be feasibly useful outside of NG+
The whole skill chart system makes getting loot a pain in the butt, you’ll get some really cool looking end-game gear but later you realize the stats don’t coincide with your build
Throughout the entire game I stuck with the same sword for 40+ hours simply because the bonus stats I got from it were too useful to ditch
This really hinders the ecstasy you get from acquiring new loot in RPGs
Technical Issues- Port quality is garbage, it feels like I'm emulating the game rather than playing a proper PC game
Most of the issues disappear with the community fan-patch, however some of the cutscene physics can glitch out
Either way, simply because there's a patch that makes Zestiria playable doesn't mean I should give the devs a pass on this one
- English voice acting is extremely meh, stick to the original Japanese dub if you don't mind playing the game in a foreign language
- Too much localization, this is mostly an issue during the less serious moments of the game where the localization team thinks they have free reign to "westernize" some jokes
Immersion breaking pop culture humour isn't funny, stop it
~tl;drZestiria is OK and will entertain you if you have the time to invest into it
The main crux is that there are a lot of better games and/or better jRPGs to play than Tales of Zestiria
If you're playing Zestiria to get into Berseria in the future then I think it's a fine investment, if not then your money is better spent elsewhere, if you're already a Tales fan


then I can only assume you already own this game

												gonna review the game after i finish it but for now here are some troubleshooting for common problems (i didn't encounter any of them)1
Screen tearing: Force v-sync through nvidia/amd control panel2
Audio issue: Set audio frequency to 48khz or below, 98khz will give you the problem3
AVG issue: AVG is detecting false positive for Zestiria files, put the game folder to whitelist4
Crash issue: switch to Windows sound Config or take off your headphones5
No voice when character speak: turn the audio to stereo not surround and it should work
6
Rebinding keys doesn't work: try restarting the game after rebinding
don't rush into refunding, try those fixes for now till the devs patch the game soon
			
Posted: 6 February
												first off: i can see why this game got average reviews
i've played two hours and so far it's a very basic set-up with a very basic story and very trope-y characters
the thing is: i don't play jrpgs to have my mind blown
jrpgs are the comfortable, cozy blanket i cuddle up in, when everything else is too stressful
and that is exactly what tales of zestiria can do for you, if that's your jam
even if the characters aren't the best ever written, i'm still having fun with them
it's anime, not the witcher
if you don't take it too seriously, you can even find yourself chuckling at yourself, as you sway along to the amazing soundtrack, or as you listen to the cute (and over the top) japanese voice acting
 in short: if you're expecting "the next big rpg", then this isn't it
but if you enjoy traditional jrpgs with anime tropes, something relaxing and not too demanding, a world you feel like you already know a little and that you can disappear into for a while, then this might be the game for you
maybe don't pay full price for it, though, if you're not certain

												We Need more JRPGs on Steam
Please
			
Posted: 24 November, 2015
												This is a great game for JRPG fans
This is NOT good for casual gamers
If you're already familiar with the "Tales of" series, you know exactly what you're getting into
For those of you who only know Tales of Symphonia, this game is very similar, with a very improved combat system, and a bit shorter
If you liked other entries in the series, you'll probably enjoy this one as well
It's a little bit more complicated than the others, though
If you like JRPGs and aren't familiar with Tales games, this is a good place to start
Fun: 8
5/10Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 10/10Audio: 10/10Replay Value: There's a New Game+ option with extra difficulty modes and other options that you can change from one playthrough to another, so if you're a completionist, you might want to replay up to 3 or even 5 times
There's also a DLC chapter focusing on a minor character
10/10 Let's get this out of the way first: Tales of Zestiria is a JRPG, but it does not have turn-based combat and is not a grindy game
In fact, your characters' levels matter much less than what equipment they use and how you control them in the real-time battles, both of which are based on some systems that are difficult to understand at first and brushed a lot of people the wrong way (see below for an overview)
The lack of a need to grind, the presence of a good Quick Travel system and the lack of needlessly big, empty regions (except for one) mean that the game flows very well, and except for a single bit near the end which doesn't even take 15 minutes total to clear, it never feels like battles and simple puzzles are being tossed at you just to increase play time, as it often does with so many other games of the genre
The game's localization was very well-done
One particular character has a thing for puns and "dad jokes", which are very hard to localize because often they can't be translated and you have to come up with a new one along the same lines
The English versions of those might be one of my favorite parts of the game
The English voice acting is also very good for the most part
I don't know Japanese, so I can't compare, but the English language audio and text are on point
The story is nothing exceptional, but good enough and well-told
The soundtrack is really good
The game world is immersive, there are interesting NPCs and sidequests, and I had fun just going out to explore places instead of actually following the story on several occasions
A big part of the game are the correlated Skills and Fusion systems, which I enjoyed playing around with, but which also frustrated many people
I'll get into those below
There's an unofficial patch that allows the game to run at 60fps if you care about that sort of thing
SPECIFICSAs I mentioned, character levels aren't as important in Tales of Zestiria as they are in the average JRPG
It's possible to take down an enemy twice your level or to be defeated by an enemy half your level, all depending on how you fight and on what equipment you have
Equipment stat boosts are much larger than your stat growth when you level up, but even more important than that are the Skills that your equipment comes with
Two otherwise identical weapons that happened to drop with different Skills on them can be significantly different from each other, depending on what other equipment you're wearing
In the beginning of the game, Skills aren't that important, but as the game progresses, they become more and more relevant
Certain bosses simply can't be beaten if you don't have the right Skills equipped
THE BATTLE SYSTEMWhen you encounter an enemy, a wide circular area will be closed around you to form the field of battle
You can move around freely,dodge, block, attack and defend in real time, and issue generic commands to the party members you're not controlling directly (spread out, focus on the same enemy, focus on attacking, focus on defense)
By pausing the battle, you can enter a menu and order any non-controlled character to use a specific "arte" (the game's name for attacks, special moves and magic)
You can also change which character you control mid-battle
There are five elements (Void/Non-Elemental, Fire, Earth, Water and Wind) to which enemies can be weak, neutral or resistant
In addition, each element is associated to a status ailment (e
g
Water to Poison) and a character stat (e
g
Void to Attack)
Every single arte you use will have one or more elements, and every arte of a given element has the potential to cause the respective element's status ailment or give you a buff to the corresponding stat when used
Enemies also have Types (e
g
Flying, Armored, Beast) against which certain attacks are strong
An attack that's strong against an enemy type will deal bonus damage even if that enemy is strong against the attack's element
There are three numbers to keep an eye on during battle: your HP, your SC (Spirit Chain) and your BG (Blast Gauge)
BG is used for certain especially powerful artes and for a unique mechanic called Armatization
SC is what you use for actually fighting
Your maximum SC is always 100 and everything you do in battle except running and blocking costs some SC
SC recovers over time during the battle, but if you attack too quickly or too often, you'll run out and have to wait
The lower your SC goes, the slower it recovers
SKILLSEach character has five different equipment slots, and each piece of equipment has four Skill slots
There are a total of 50 different Skills that can give you anything from stat boosts to increased HP recovery, protection against an element or status ailment, added damage against certain enemies, etc
 These Skills are organized into a 5x10 grid where each of the 5 lines corresponds to an element and each of the 10 collumns corresponds to a theme (e
g
the first collumn is stat boosts, the 9th collumn is increased damage of the respective types)
Every Skill from currently equipped gear will be active on that character's Skill Chart
Skills can be combined for added bonus effects, which can be even more dramatic than the basic Skills themselves (such as reflecting 30% of all damage of a particular element, having an extra Blast Gauge or gaining a 20% Max HP increase)
The Bonus Skills depend on where skills are on the 5x10 Skills chart
There are three types of Bonus Skills: Stack (multiple copies of the same Skill), E-Union (two or more adjacent skills in the same horizontal line) and G-Union (all five Skills on the same collumn)
Equipping two of the same skill, for instance, reduces the time you spend staggered by 6%
If you have multiple stacks of two, their effects add up - a stack of stacks, if you will
This means you can become completely immune to certain status ailments by equipping the right skills
FUSIONEvery piece of equipment you get will have at least one skill and up to four
In weapon shops, it's possible to fuse two pieces of equipment and combine their skills, while also improving the equipment's stats with each fusion
Slots that have the same skill in both fused weapons, or any skill in one weapon and a blank slot in the other will keep that same skill in the resulting fused weapon
Slots that are empty in both weapons will continue empty
Slots that have different skills in each weapon will end up with a third skill that is different from both
Because of this mechanism, through fusion you can create equipments with the Skill set you want, to match your play style or enable a specific strategy against a particular foe
CONCLUSIONIf the above description of game mechanics didn't scare you, and you enjoy JRPGs, you'll probably enjoy Tales of Zestiria
If not, then you've probably stopped reading already anyway, but don't buy the game
That is all

												Great new JRPG addition to the Steam Library and here's why:Pros:+ Equipment efficiency system for learning skills on your gear
+ Cool fusion system to upgrade equipment with same name and get newer skills
+ You don't mindlessly equip stronger equipment over your old, weaker ones due to equipment having synergistic skills that boost character stats or gives specific advantages in battle
+ Character personalities and interactions are enjoyable
+ Music and Sounds are fantastic to listen to- alot of wind instruments, drums, and an orchestra-esque style
+ Scenery and environment are refreshing and nice to look at
+ Action Battle system is fantastic (running around chaining combos and using magic)
+ Removing the TP system (MP in other JRPGs) and replacing it with a resource that all your attacks and magic use
+ Combat is pretty fluid
+ It feels rewarding to time attacks with allies to lock an enemy down instead of mindlessly attacking with your character alone (in higher difficulties anyway)+ Encountering an enemy triggers a fight right there in the environment which adds great immersion to the gameplay
+ Last but not least, the option of dual audio (Japanese/English) as well as English subtitles
Cons:- Because battles take place in the environment instead of a seperate battle screen, sometimes the battle camera derps and zooms in really close so its hard to see when fighting in small areas or backed against a wall
- 30 fps locked (I personally don't find this to be an issue as the original was 30 fps and Namco Bandai has stated multiple times that they tried but the costs (gameplay performance) of upping to 60 fps outweighed the pros)
- Some graphical issues like a little screen tearing (can be fixed by tinkering with graphics card settings and V-Sync)
- Story is a little slow at the beginning
My rating: 9/10

												"Zestiria" is a mixed bag
Ultimately, it's a fine piece of work - yet it's very much a "Your Mileage May Vary" sort of experience
In terms of the macro game (the way the whole experience builds to the conclusion), this title works beautifully
The difficulty curve is a steady slope that leads to the final, epic encounters in an entirely natural way
Getting around in the world and unlocking new areas makes perfect sense in-game
Every place you visit has some sort of recognizable, unique flavor
To be brutally frank, if the overall experience had been married to Square-Enix art, "Zestiria" would have been a great "Final Fantasy XIII
"The individual bits are where the good/ not as good balance comes in
The combat system is basically fun, but only in smallish doses
There's supposed to be a lot of "finagly" stuff you can do, but in the end, you'll probably just find one particular, repetitive, button-mashing routine that works 95% of the time
It actually can get rather dull, and in my case, I went through a bout of falling asleep during fights
I'd nod off for a few seconds, and then reawaken to Sorey (the main character) running at nothing in particular
The "grade" system is particularly odd
It does indeed offer an explanation of itself, yet it still remains opaque
There were battles that felt like they went very smoothly, yet awarded very little grade, and encounters that seemed a bit more fraught, but yielded high grade
The equipment skill-sheet


thing is a nifty idea, but it ends up being overwrought, fiddly, unnecessary, and ultimately ignorable
Much is made of the equipment-fusing system, especially in light of skills, whereas the reality is that actually optimizing your results appears to mostly be a waste of time
There's a pretty darn good story, along with lots of excellent worldbuilding, yet the pacing seems to bog down in spots
The endgame is a major example of this, where there are 2 - 3 times where you think the whole thing is going to conclude, and - nope! More walking! Here's another puzzle-dungeon! (It would have been better if, at that point, the battles were more interesting and you still had a chance for some real character progression, but that wasn't the case
) There's a point where fighting legendary creatures for high-level equipment actually manages to become completely pointless
And the ending is a bit of a weak payoff for a 60+ hour project that encompasses world-shattering events and truly interesting characters
The dramatis personae in this game are THE strongest point, and I was disappointed in not getting a better sense of how they ended up
But please don't get me wrong if you're seeing this as a negative review! "Zestiria" is worth the price of admission
The flaws can be easily forgiven, because the gestalt experience is very strong
The basics were gotten right; Everything else is commentary on details
			
Posted: 19 October, 2015
 I'm updating to remind everyone that this review is just my opinion
There is no need to defend yourself against me
If you have a differing opinion on the game, I encourage you to write a review of your own
I do NOT encourage you to leave nasty comments and/or personal attacks on this review (nor does the Steam SA)
You're welcome to disagree with my opinion, but please be civil and decent
First of all a lot of the Tales combat will feel very familiar
Characters have regular attacks, special moves called Artes, and magical spells
Regular attacks and Artes can be chained together while magical spells require charge time, so the caster must be protected from enemies who want to interrupt their spells
The CC system appears to have been replaced by something called the Spirit Chain system, which looks like a mix of TP and CC
You spend SC to use Artes, and they replenish as you attack
As with CC, precisely timed side-steps, blocks or dodges can fill the SC gauge
One of the more interesting elements of the game is Armatization, a super-powered combat mode that is similar to the Chromatus in Tales of Xillia 2
Armatization requires Sorey and one of the Seraphim (Team Members)
Each of Sorey's Seraphim pals is tied to a specific element, and when Sorey uses Armatization, he fuses with them to gain access to new moves and weapons based on their element
For example, Mikelo provides a bow and magic-based arts while Edna gives giant stone fists and earth-based arts
Instead of the traditional Tales character swapping (Like in tales of Symphonia for example), there is a focus on different fusions to change Sorey's play style
When you hit an enemy's elemental weakness or elemental resistance, the game displays a big glowing icon to notify you
This also makes me suspect that enemies can swap resistances on the fly, requiring Sorey to do the same
The dungeon exploration in Zestiria feels very familiar
You'll probably have a good idea of what to expect if you've played recent games in the franchise
This game lacks any sort of puzzles in the dungeons, similarly to Xillia
So, for anyone hoping to a return to dungeon puzzles like Symphonia, will once again be disappointed
However, the dungeons are spacious and well suited to the game’s “Real Map Battles” system
Tales of Zestiria doesn't look to reinvent the wheel
The core Tales combat system that people know and love is still there, and while there have been some changes to the basic design, longtime fans will still enjoy the game
There are some new features, such as the Armatization fusion mechanic and the new on-field battle camera, to keep the game feeling fresh, and the story is hella intriguing
There are two last things to call attention  to before closing this review out
First, the cutscenes
Every scene with dialogue in Zestiria is actually more like a cutscene
Text bubbles have been removed in favor of the text showing up on the bottom of the screen like subtitles, and the entire scene has motion and acting to it
However, even with that all being the case, you can still press buttons to skip through lines quickly
It’s really implemented incredibly well!Second, are the anime cutscenes
Ufotable handles all of the animation for the game, including the cutscenes (of which there are surprisingly many that are animated) and the opening sequence
Every single bit of animation that Ufotable handled in the game looks stunning and absolutely gorgeous
I'd DEFINITELY recommend it if you are an Tales of fan or newcomer!, unless you find yourself allergic to the typical trappings of such games (you can see the typical zomg 30 fps outrage on the forums already)
But it’s still a Tales of game… isn’t it?

												THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME!I never quite got into JRPG (because I'm no good at turn-based games) and this was also my first Tales of game, but a few hours into the game, I was most certainly sold! After watching an LP video of the game, I was intrigued by the animation and the non turn-based aspect of the game, and when a Steam friend had a pre-order copy to let go at the original price, I jumped at it
+ Great animation, the world is just so beautiful
+ Great soundtrack
+ Top notch voice acting
+ Characters are so likable and lovable
I was hoping for more back stories though
+ Immersive plot
+ Vast world to explore
+ Different skills in combat for each characters
+ I've put 68 hours into this but I still wish it was longer
- A lot of long running between places in a vast world
- Camera is wonky during fights
- Repetitive lower level enemies
Also, about the heroine in the story,  I'm glad they changed the heroine, because I really love Rose
She is just so awesome! I'm really glad that I picked this up
Since a lot of reviewers rated the story as 'meh' while I really loved it (note: ToZ is my first Tales of game), I really look forward to Tales of Symphonia in 2016
Meanwhile, I think I still have one side quest to finish (Katz Korner) and Alisha's DLC to complete
My Rating: 10/10

 Useless bit of trivia first
 The amount of times these games have been redone is truly mindblowing, but then again Ys has been around since 1987
What we have here is an enhanced port of a PSP port of an enhanced edition of a windows remake of a combined turbografx-16/pc-engine remake of a pair of games on an ancient japanese pc
Rolls right off the tongue and I'm not even gonna get into how many ports the original games themselves got
I'm fairly certain this won't be the last remake either
Now that I got that bit of nonsence out of the way let's move on to the review
Story  The island of Esteria which is known for its trade in silver has been cut off from mainland Europe by a phenomenon called the stormwall for the last six months
Enter Adol Christin, a 17 year old young man with a passion for adventure and measuring women and little boys
He sails to Esteria from the port town of Promarock (or Promalock depending on the translation) but his boat gets caught in the stormwall and he shipwrecks off the coast of the island
He is found by villagers and taken to the nearby town's clinic
This is where the game starts
From here on cue battles with monsters, ancient civilizations, saving the world and the usual business when it comes to JRPGs
Overall the story is not a groundbreaking epic that will shock you with amazing plot twists, but it is really well written and will suck you in if you take your time with it
Even the most trivial NPCs usually have something new and interesting to say as the story moves forward (this is something Nihon Falcom does a lot)
Ys II takes place immediately after Ys I, so my recommendation is to play both games in one go
There's also a bit of humour added by XSEED which fits quite well since it's put in the right places and doesn't feel forced
muh grafix  If you've read the nonsence at the top or looked at the screenshots you should already know what to expect in terms of graphics
Enhancements or not you're looking at slightly improved visuals from a 1997 Windows game
That said Chronicles does have a nifty feature where you can pick from the original PC interface or the PSP one as well as picking between the original late 90s anime artstyle or the more modern artstyle for the character portraits
That's all there is to be said about the graphics, wether you like them or not is up to you, but I wouldn't judge the game based on looks alone
PS: There is no FPS lock, so stop whining, you babies
Music  INCREDIBLY BIASED OPINION INCOMING   As far as I'm concerned Falcom Sound Team JDK are musical gods and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise
With that out of the way, you have the option to pick from three different renditions of the soundtrack in the options menu (or just mod in whatever the hell you want because PC)
The original PC-88 soundtrack from 1987, the PC Complete soundtrack from 2001 or the new Chronicles soundtrack from 2009
All three are great, though which one you go with depends on you
My personal recommendation is to mod the turbografx-16 audio in and enjoy one of the best versions of the soundtrack (why they never bothered to use it again is beyond me), some dude posted a mod for both games on the forums, you can find it if you look around
Long story short: Music is 11/10
Gameplay   While the rest of the games in the series are more traditional in terms of combat, Ys I & II are more of an acquired taste
The reason for this is because unlike most action RPGs at the time here you don't press a button to attack enemies
Instead you ram into them (slightly off center), that's it
In Ys II you get some spells which allow you to attack at range but the meat of the combat is once again dryhumping things with your sword (hence why a lot of people call it the bumper cars system)
Personally I wouldn't call the lack of an attack button a bad thing since in this case it makes the combat LIGHTNING FAST
I'm not even joking, you'll be murdering masses of monsters with such rapid speed it'll make someone like Guts look like a pansy in comparison (you don't mess with Adol Christin, the guy's a walking apocalypse)
It also makes the usual grinding in JRPGs almost nonexistant which for me is a plus
I don't hate it mind you, but it gets stale fast if the game relies on it too much
Anyway on normal difficulty you'll be swimming in cash and exp before you know it
The boss battles are the highlight of the series
In Ys I they are mostly hit and miss
Some are really good and there are others like Vagullion aka THAT !@(*$^ BAT and Dark Fact known as Dalk Fukt in Japan (if you manage beat him on nightmare mode you have the full right to rub that in everyone's faces because you earned it)
Things get much better in Ys II, but it's also the better game
Ys I is essentially a glorified prologue but you shouldn't skip it since you'll miss half the story
TL;DR  This is where the Ys series started from
The games are great but they are not for everyone
However if you do try them out and end up liking them you'll be in for one hell of a ride you won't soon forget
PS  I've started a slow project of making as many versions of Ys I & II's soundtracks as possible usable ingame
Download links for the ones I've done are on my profile
If you have any specific requests feel free to let me know

												Ys I is a simple, fast-paced action game disguised as an RPG
Maybe too simple for a generation who're used to combo systems, collecting a dozen new abilities, and other new hot features adopted by the genre (and later games in the series)
But I like that simplicity! It's a comfortable old friend of a game, with just enough interesting use of its one mechanic (ram the other guy off-center) to last the duration of the adventure
And then you can play Ys II, which throws in a bunch more toys to play with in a larger world!Make sure you play in the original 4:3 mode: the zoomed-in mode doesn't quite match the aspect ratio of the original game window, and areas designed around it will feel cramped if you have to scroll more

												Ys 1 and 2 are essentially 2 halves of one game, and for the purpose of this review will be treated as such
The Ys series is a collection of niche JRPG games from Falcom, famous for their difficulty and their blisteringly fast pace compared to almost every other RPg game coming out at the time (and to a degree, even today)
The games are known for their heavy, intense guitar scores and serene orchestral music, as well, and these two games are the ones that began the trend for everything above
The Ys games are notoriously polarizing - either you REALLY enjoy the gameplay, the almost bullet-hell difficulty in bosses, or you absolutely hate it and toss it in the garbage
I luckily fell into the first camp
Ys 1 and 2 utilize the "Bump Combat System" which is a buttonless fighting style that relies on you running into enemies that are not facing you, or at odd degrees or angles (basically anything other than head-on) in order to do damage
There are ZERO i-frames in both games, for both enemies and you, so combat is swift and incredibly lethal
The only slowdown is if you have to stop to regenerate, and consumables in the second game make it so you don't even need to do that
The second game also greatly increases the power of a diagonal angle attack, making striking without taking recoil damage almost trivial after playing the first game
Ys2 also adds magic to break up the rushing bump combat formula, but for the most part you're going to be running around like a madman auto-swinigng your sword, and it is incredibly fun
The dungeons in both games are large and pretty winding, and you do a lot of running around back and forth to collect items, but your runspeed is so high and there'sa number of fast travel options, so it never seems *too* bad
There are a few points that definitely come off like blatant padding though, especially in the second half of both games
As a JRPG, there is some degree of grinding
If you're in the game for achievements then you won't notice any extra grinding aty all - as you'll already be killing way more monsters than necessary in order to fill up your bestiary entries
If thats not your thing, be aware that in both games there are a few hard walls that will require a bit of grinding, especially the last boss in the first half of Ys 1
Ys 1 assumes you are max level halfway through the game
Luckily levelling is quick and the grinding will be pretty minimal
Ys 2 makes things much easier, and towards the end of the game there is one particular enemy you can grind about 10-12 levels off of in 15-20 minutes
Luckily combat is realtime and so swift your grinding always has you doing something rather than "press A for turn based combat"
The music switches between soft town themes and serene temple themes, to pulse pounding electric guitar riffs in dungeons and combat zones
It's great music if that style is your thing, and is it ever my thing
Can't say enough great things about the music
The story is interesting and intriguing, but won't knock your socks off like, say, a Witcher game, with crazy political intrigue
It's a JRPG about being a redhead anime warrior getting into adventures, and that's exactly what you get
The world setting is explained and the locations you go to across games are varied
The supporting cast exists but doesn't get a ton of screentime just by virtue of the game's style
The games are about Adol and that's made clear
There are some parts where it's not immediately clear where you need to be going - this is worse in the second game, but made a bit easier by the game giving you an item at that point that lets you 'phone a friend' for some NPC assistance on where to go next
Strongly recommended if you can handle the game's inherent difficulty - boss battles verge on frustrating to downright unfair feeling, especially in the first game
The second game's bosses are much, MUCH more manageable - the last boss of 1 in particular can just feel like a luck based grind
As a side mention: play with VSync on - it affects one boss in Ys1 in particular, and with vsync off the game breaks and the boss becomes actually, physically impossible to damage
I have also heard some people comment that a lower resolution can help make fights easier, especially the last boss of 1

												Ys I & II, being the first two games in the long-running Ys series, have had quite a number of releases over the years
It’s hit a number of different platforms, including the PC88, TurboGrafx, PC, Nintendo DS, Sony PSP, and now PC, each with their own tweaks to the game to fit the platform they were released on
XSEED Games and Falcom, who started their partnership  with the release of Ys Seven, have set out on bringing the definitive version of Ys I & II to the PC
The question is, how does this port in the long list of existing ports fare?Originally released in the late 1980s, Ys I & II definitely shows their roots in their story presentations
You play the role of Adol Christin, a (now very well-known) red-haired adventurer who sets off on a journey of excitement and ends up washing up in a nearby coastal city where he learns of demon attacks which are driving the country’s citizens into hiding
As you progress through the game, it becomes clear that things aren’t as simple as they seem, with items called the Books of Ys being collected as you progress through your journey
These later become important to unraveling exactly what is causing this country’s plight and showing how to set things right
Most memorable for its combat, Ys I and II combine all the elements of a traditional JRPG: towns, shops, NPCs, equipment, character levels, exploration, and even some minor side quests and secrets
Ys I is more simplistic than its sequel, but both games are strikingly similar and tell two parts of the same narrative, even if those parts are two nearly identical story arcs
Each game can be beaten in less than ten hours, both have moments of great frustration, and they both climax in thrilling and memorable bosses
Ys I and II may be most well known for their shared "bump" combat system in which our hero Adol collides with enemies to injure them (and to be injured by them)
The lack of an attack button and Adol's swift running speed make the action so frantic as to be absurd, and at times I found the red-haired sprite's action downright hilarious
I was skeptical and critical at first, but I learned to enjoy the simple combat, particularly during boss fights, which require much more thought than the dull standard enemies
Unfortunately, diagonal attacks are so overpowered in Ys II that regular enemies are slain with ease, and both games suffer from clumsy menus and balance issues
Being that this is an older RPG, there are some grinding issues present in this release
Ys I, being merely a prelude to Ys II, only allows for Adol to level up to Level 10
Levels control whether you win or lose in Ys I, and at times you’ll have to grind in the initial dungeons to get through some of the bosses
This issue becomes a bit worse in Ys II, which ups the level cap to 55, but lessens the EXP gained from enemies as you level up
This requires players to, at times, spend time farming enemies in one area of a dungeon, lest they get instantly killed by enemies in a later part which Adol can’t touch with gaining more levels and grabbing enough gold to get the best weapons for that period in the game
Some of the latter bosses are particularly unfair in this regard, forcing players to gain 3-5 levels above what the enemies are at just to get through the boss fight with a sliver of life remaining
While this only occurs in a few parts of the game, it’s still an annoyance that could have been fixed with a few slight tweaks by Falcom for this release
Players who enjoy a challenge will find no problems with this though
As both titles were released back in the 1980s, the RPG mantra of including key items in obscure places holds true
Numerous times in Ys I players will be unable to progress through the story because they forgot to talk to or walk into a specific story event that was either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all
While Ys II fixes this for the most part, there’s one key item in one of the final dungeons which requires players to go to a unmentioned room instead of a house in town, which is where players would assume it was located due to the game’s dialogue
The game could have greatly benefited from some streamlining for newer fans of the series
Even with those negatives, as with most Ys titles, the first thing players will notice is the game’s soundtrack, which like in Oath and Seven, runs circles around most other games
The soundtrack, composed by video game music legend Yuzo Koshiro of Etrian Odyssey fame, along with Falcom stalwart Mieko Ishikawa, is easily the shining gem of this compilation
As explain before, Ys I & II have appeared on numerous platforms in the past, so the game compliments this by allowing players to choose between three different versions of the music
One of the most impressive parts of Ys Chronicles outside of the soundtrack has to be the game’s storyline and translation
For a title which was released back in the 1980s, the story still stands shoulders above many other titles of that era, as well as some of the RPG hits of the 1990s
This combined with the music and the general artistic presentation of the game makes for some very heartwarming moments
The main storyline was translated in a way which feels authentic without falling into the “ye olde” trap that most remakes of classic RPGs fall into
XSEED also threw in a couple pop culture jokes in some of the more obscure areas of the game for those who take the time to check out everything
Despite some of the negatives I've listed here, I thoroughly enjoy playing through these adventures
Being a long time Ys fan I owed it to myself to play the adventures that started them all
There is magic in Ys, and everyone should get a chance to see it
Highly Recommended

												Another remake of the old Nihon Falcom action RPG classic, which finally brings this great game to english speaking PC gamers
This version seems to improve everything beyond the previous versions (at least the ones I played, that is the Sega Master System version from the early 90s and the Turbo Duo release from a few years later), with one exception - it doesn't have voice acting, unlike the Turbo Duo release, which did have some (not much, but still


)
The control is great, the graphics are up-to-date, and the awesome soundtrack is at its best, as usual
The game is relatively short (8-10 hours if you've beat it before, but could take much longer for first timers), but offers plenty of fun
This is really one of my favorite games
			
Posted: 14 June, 2014
												Even on the easiest level of the game - it still has a high level of challenge and difficultly but the way you attack enemies is different - you must bump into them
A plus is that you can recover HP if you are standing still in most places
If you are familiar with Y's Book 1 and 2 on PC Engine, you have a pretty good feel for this story , however some elements have been reworked to provide an element of challenge in order to advance to specific portions of the game
Some early bosses - You will find out quickly that you have to level up so high in order to beat them
That may take a long time but in the end, your Gold Level will rise high and you can buy some of the more expensive items from the get go
Another plus of this game is the choice of soundtrack
You have Chronicles, Complete and PC-88 to choose from
For nostalgic purposes I turn it on PC - 88 because I love the retro music
Being that I own Y's Oath in Felghana and Y's Origin , I had to play this
I had realized that this was also released on PSP but never owned a PSP
Beginners and seasoned Y's players will find a variety of stuff to do in both of these games and its a bargain for the price that was paid for the game
You don't see quality console  RPG Games like this on PC that much

												These 2 games are very good
The story is connected from YS Origin, YS1, and YS2
I suggest you play from YS Origin
Finish Toal Cain storyline to reveal the hidden plot
Then, you play YS1 and YS2
It's been a long time I haven't played games with such good story
Good job, Falcom!PS: Please bring the YS4, YS5, and YS7 to Steam too
I will definitely buy and play them !

												The Ys games are small, short JRPGs
What really makes them stand out is the combat
Instead of turn based, selecting your move from a list, Ys instead adopts a mechanic wherein you “bump” into the enemies
This is done by walking into the enemies either off centre in the first game or at a diagonal in the second game
The games overall are relatively simple
Bump into enemies, level up, continue on your quest
If you can no longer damage enemies you need an equipment upgrade or to level some more
The story is also pretty simple in both games as long as you pay attention to where you need to be heading, otherwise you can find yourself getting one hit killed by encountering certain enemies too early
Both games have a great soundtrack, are bundled at a cheap price and are JRPGs that don’t take 60+ hours to complete
A warning though, the bosses in the second game are more bullet-hell so make sure you are prepared

												Final Fantasy III for steam is the pretty much the same version that was released for android and DS
It works very well and automatically maps the controller which is great
There haven't been any bugs as far and work as you would hope
The game itself is a gem and one that any RPG fan should have a go at if you haven't already
One downside is the price, I feel putting it higher than VII or VIII on steam is unfair due to the small amount of work they must have done to bring it to steam

												I recommend Final Fantasy III as a game, but I do not recommend the Steam Port of this game
It's a beautiful story with beautiful gameplay
The spells and job systems are wonderful and I enjoyed what I could of it
This version of the game is a very good game and brings back memories for me of the NES version
However I can't feel good about recommending this port
There are a LOT of game-breaking bugs in this port
Things that set back your story several hours of gameplay, some that make it so you have to beat a boss twice, thrice or more times, etc


I've managed to make it to the second-last area and can no longer continue forward because the game won't register that I have a key item that's clearly in my inventory, for example
I've run into several bugs and until the port is fixed somehow, I don't think I'll actually be able to complete the game
I know many other people have run into these bugs as well

												Final Fantasy III has seen many make-overs, and this one is pretty much a port of the one on the DS with just a bigger resolution
But still, if you're a fan of Final Fantasy or love JRPG's, then you should still pick this up, especially if you haven't played this game already
Here's a quick look video so you can see for yourself what this game is like
But if you'd rather have a simple pros/cons/unmentionables list of the game, continue below
http://youtu
be/4O4xZ0HE56kAs promised, the pros and cons breakdown
+Good, relaxing music
FF has always been good about this
+The ability to customize your party to your playstyle with the flexible job system
Anybody can be anything
Why not girl warriors and guy white mages? Break those stereotypes!+Strategic, turn-based combat
Some may prefer action, but I count this as a plus because you play at your own pace and the battles can be close sometimes
+Great exploration
There's hidden passages to treasure, optional dungeons, and mazes to loot littered everywhere, even at the beginning of the game
Did I mention you get an airship early on?+You can quick save anywhere
Super handy for any RPG and a person always on the go
?Because of the exploration, you can wander into places you're grossly unprepared for and get stomped into the ground
?The story is your typical "you're the chosen one to save the world and help people along the way
" I'm not really bothered by it, but some people who want something different may be turned off by it
-No options menu besides changing resolution
Square-Enix actually makes really good option menus for PC, so I was a little sad to see that there wasn't even AA to get rid of some of the jaggies
-Because this is an old port, though a good one, the graphics aren't exactly breath-taking like the opening CG cutsceen
Personally I don't care since the good gameplay matters to me over graphics, but a lot of people get turned off by dated graphics unfortunately, even more so when they expect more from Square-enix
-It's pricey for what it is
But that's the FF brand for you
-No voice acting
While not the end of the world, it certainly does help immerse you into the world
Overall, it's a really good game, and it's nice to have an old-school RPG every now and again
Remember that childhood, my friends
Remember it

												Even though basically a port from the Nintendo DS version, this is much worth playing if you've been lagging like me and waited until now to play this classic
If you already played the DS version, nothing new here
Please note this is the true III sequel and NOT the III that NA played on SNES
My only two gripes are these: 1
If you play with a controller and it loses connection/power, reconnecting won't register with the game and you're forced to restart the game
2
The last areas of the game
Not only is there no save point, but you get the final batch of new jobs so late in the game
You're forced to grind for a few hours
Otherwise, still worth playing if you're a Final Fantasy fan and have yet to play the earlier games in the series

												I have always enjoyed the first two Final Fantasy games, but their stories were sparse, relying more on conversations with random town folk to help fill in the blanks than to tell a proper tale
While Final Fantasy III still shows its age and might not have the sophistication found in later RPGs, it is still a worthy look back at a game that helped to continue to redefine the genre
This version of the game on PC is based on the graphically updated version that made its way onto the Nintendo DS back in 2006
The visuals got an 3D overhaul, with a widened aspect ratio and some new features as well
If you are familiar with the DS or iPhone/iPad versions of the game this PC release will feel very familiar, but it still plays out nicely on a bigger screen
Themes that persist and remain familiar in future Final Fantasy games such as the Warriors of Light and job class systems help populate this story
The job system is bare bones compared to what we are used to now in the series (and other games that use similar systems), and the game uses it more as a second experience system
On the one hand the characters have conventional experience systems that level up their physical attributes, and then there's the job levels which represent their skills
Managing both is easy, and the system does encourage players to jump their characters through multiple jobs, though there is some grinding involved as there is a warmup process where a character needs to fight a certain number of battles with a role before they're comfortable with it and can use its skills properly
You don't want to be fighting tough enemies in such a state, so you'll generally grind through easy battles each and every time you change classes
This is a classic Final Fantasy title, which of course has both good and bad connotations
It means lots of menus and level grinding and of course chocobos and Cid and things
It is a welcome rush of nostalgia to come back to a game like this, which has aged well despite being nearly two and a half decades old
I'd be lying if I said that the graphical overhaul didn't make the game far more palatable (or the fact that the original game was never released in English), but the core mechanics should also appeal to old school JRPG fans
The game gets off to something of a slow start, with a lot of story and limited exploration during the first dozen hours or so, but once it opens up it is every bit the exploration-filled adventure Final Fantasy is known for, filled with little secrets to find and fun and diverse characters
Having just played Bravely Default a few months ago and seeing familiar themes such as the four different adventurers brought together by circumstance and the presence of crystals as a focal point to the story, I could not help but be amused with how timeless the narrative themes are
That being said, Bravely Default showed just how much further game storytelling has gone in making something rich out of the basic thematic construct
That is not to say that Final Fantasy III has a poor story, but compared to the more modern Japanese role-playing game, it is fascinating to see how far the medium has come
If you have already played the DS or iOS version of this game, there may not be enough of a reason to purchase it on Steam now
However, if you missed that opportunity before and want to experience an important part of Final Fantasy's early evolution, this is an excellent way to do so
The character depth and story detail might feel somewhat lacking compared to newer JRPG titles, but there is an expansive world here that begs for exploration as you grow your characters for future challenges
The overall package is an easy one to recommend

												I played all the way through this game back when it released on the Nintendo DS, including all side stuff
Final Fantasy IV (2 on the SNES) was one of my earliest gaming memories, and remains one of my favorite games of all time
The game basically taught me to read as a child
I've played every iteration of the game to ever release in the US, and this version (the DS version) might by my favorite
The character models do justice to the original sprite designs while also being fresh and charming, though the textures look a bt worse for wear in high resolution
The voice acting is well done and befitting of the revamped script
The handful of new story elements serve the original plot well, and flesh out some things that were only touched upon in the original script
The combat is one area where this version (the DS version) of the game shines
While the battles in the original game, and most of the various ports were uninteresting, this one demands a more varied use of tactics and status effects
Gone are the days of being able to mash A to kill bosses
Now you must employ things like Sleep, Slow, and Dark, things that typically haven't ever worked on bosses in the series, to survive
This specific version of the game though, being a port of the iOS and Android versions, isn't without new problems
The most glaring issue is the UI
There is no reason the large, ugly UI designed for touch controls should have made the trasition to the PC
There is no reason the UI should take up half of the display during combat, and there is no reason you should have to scroll to see all of your options in battle
Definitely play the game in "Wait Mode," as the need to scroll through your options may get you killed in "Active Mode
"Less of a complaint, and more of a nitpick is that the camera now seems very zoomed in due to the increased resolution, and general size of PC displays
A zoom option would have been nice
Another thing that would have been nice is true analog controls, but I guess this version of the game was never designed with that in mind anyway
Though I hope (but don't expect) some of my issues will be addressed in a future patch; like the midi soundtrack of FF7's original steam release was, I still recommend this game whole heartedly
In my opinion, Final Fantasy IV is one of the finest JRPGs ever released, and despite the hideous new iOS interface the 3D remake is arguably the definitive version (the PSP version being the other contender)
-P
S
Calling it now, The After Years will appear as DLC in the near future
I do not recommend playing that at all

												This version of Final Fantasy IV is not the original, but a PC port of the Android app
The android app is a port of the DS version with improved text and sound and neat speech bubbles with character thoughts
It removes one DS feature, a little customizable eidolon named whyt
Whyt sucks anyway
The game is good
I will say that
You don't need more then 30 frames to play in this style of game, and the resolution and graphics are pretty decent
The menu's are obviously designed for a phone, but the game plays great with a controller
The story is THE BEST of the final fantasies
You will soon forget this is a port or any stupid problems you thought you had
I won't spoil anything but this version adds some unique post game challenges to overcome in the form of some superbosses
Also this game is hard as crap
Leveling and grinding isn't as important as smart boss tactics
The pricetag is a bit crazy high for a port though
I reccomend grabbing this baby on the upcoming christmas sales, because we know it will be there

												Some explanation before a brief review -> This is a PC port of an iOS/Android port of a Nintendo DS remake of an SNES game (which was originally known as Final Fantasy II in North America)
Whew
This charmful 3D remake is an oppurtunity for one put off by 2D graphics to check out one of the true revolutionary JRPG classics
While not the best the series, Final Fantasy IV was one of the first video games to contain an epic story filled with multiple characters (albeit one-dimensional)
This is also the first Final Fantasy game to have the ATB system, which gives the turn-based combat a sense of urgency
In terms of replayability, the game features a New Game+ mode that allows players to retain certain items and seek out new ones
Not a necessary remake, but a fun one nonetheless
Note -> The English voice acting is rather horrible
There are ways to mod the PC version to feature Japanese audio
Inquire within the Steam Guides

												Final Fantasy IV is a great game
This port however is an embarrassment - I can not bring myself to defend it
A quick bit of history, this is a PC port of a phone port of the (excellent) DS remake of the original SNES game
What I wanted was just to be able to play my DS copy on my TV
With this I got that


and some further changes
The aspect ratio, I've not seen anything like this done by a developer of SE's caliber
The 4:3 aspect from the DS, in order to fit a 16:9 display, has had the top and bottom cut off and then black bars added to the side to fill the rest
The result is that you actually see less than you do on the tiny DS's screen, and that animation can actually move large creatures and bosses awkwardly off the top of the screen a little - you can notice this early on with the Mist Dragon's idle animation
The UI is horrendous
It is the phone UI with its big round buttons and overinflated scale that takes up half the screen in battle
Important if you're trying to mash your finger onto a screen to perform an action but an eye-sore on PC
Icons are scaled up and bilinearly filtered - resulting in a big ugly smeared and edge-clipped hand cursor in the menus
The characterless arial font that they've replaced the DS's font with is even poorly clipped itself with little white dots appearing between certain arrangements of letters
A real disregard shown for any polish
There is a gameplay adjustment as well
An auto-save before every battle
So, now, gone is the whole point of dungeons in a game like this; where you would struggle on to the next save/rest point, the compromises you might have to make and rationing of items and MP
Now, if you fail, you're simply started right where the battle last began, to continue on as if nothing had occurred
Through that hacky aspect-ratio induced letterbox and under all that horrible phone UI


is still the wonderful game of FFIV
What a port though

												I hadn't played FF4 in over fifteen years, and I wasn't sure how well it would hold up--in the end, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it
The cast is full of likeable characters, the boss battles (especially on hard mode) are very fun and require far more strategy compared to most FF games, and a full playthrough clocks in at a very reasonable ~25 hours
It's worth pointing out, however, that this port is marred by several significant technical issues
This version is a port of the iOS/Android version which itself was a port of the DS version--both of these elements are very, very obvious
The in-battle menus are clearly designed for touchscreens, the character models are extremely low poly with the original DS textures, and battle scenes are locked at 15FPS
If you can manage to overlook these glaring, highly obstructive issues, though, you'll find a wonderful game underneath the surface
One aspect that, to me, stands out above the rest is the rebalancing of magic spells
Unlike most FF games, where status ailment spells are close to worthless, there is a use for every single spell in the game
Aside from Cure spells, Slow is perhaps the most important spell in the game! Most bosses will be suspectible to Slow and one or two other status ailments, and each fight becomes a puzzle to determine how to mitigate the boss's most powerful traits and abilities
Once you get to the absolutely punishing (in hard mode, at least) final dungeon, this applies to every random battle as well and forces the player to come up with winning strategies on the spot
Here are some spells that I cast on enemies that were crucial to completing the game: Slow, Stop, Silence, Reflect, Break, Berserk, Bio, Confuse
Seriously, how often do you cast those in FF games?I only played through on hard mode, and aside from three specific fights it was very well done, striking an excellent balance between challenging and fair
One early fight, Mom Bomb, took me more tries than any other fight in the game, including the final boss; it was an absurd early spike in difficulty that felt completely out of place
Dr Lugae relied partially on chance to beat, due to the confluence of his randomly cast Reversal Field ability and cast timers for your party
Finally, while the rest of the game required no grinding whatsoever, the final boss was actually 100% impossible to beat without gaining about 3-4 extra levels at the end, and even then it was reliant upon perfect execution of a very specific strategy
I know it's the last boss of hard mode, but they took it just a lil bit too far!This is just nitpicking, though, as it's worth reiterating that the entirety of the rest of the game was very well-crafted and well-balanced--just don't feel bad or get disheartened if you get stuck on those same fights
Just like most FF games, you'll always be at an appropriate level as long as you just fight whatever battles that pop up as you explore dungeons, no need to go out of your way to grind
If you mess up and die on a fight, you can hit Continue and it'll bring you right back to where you were, so no worries about losing progress
Cutscenes are skippable, summon animations are skippable, and there's a Quicksave option in addition to save points
Sadly, random battles still exist, and that admittedly will be a deal breaker for many
Technical issues aside, this is a textbook example of how to remake a game: keep the basic framework (plot, designs, etc), and update the gameplay in a way that provides a new challenge while feeling very familiar
In a word, this is a game that is respectful: of the original developers, of the source material, and of players both new and old
With the caveat that this is a poor port of an excellent game, I highly recommend it (and play it in hard mode!)

												What you should know: 1
Non-battle gameplay is locked at 30 fps
Battle's are locked at 15 fps
This is because the PC version is based on the Android port that is based on the DS port
Kind of like an emulation
The 15 fps isn't too debilitating given this is a turn based game but there is noticable input lag that can be annoying and the animation looks stiff
2
I tested resolutions from 1920 x 1080 all the way down to 800 x 600 and you really don't notice much of a difference in game
The textures up close (usually during cutscenes) look terrible and neither an increase nor a decrease in resolution seemed to help much at all
1080p DOES however make the excellent FMV's look even more stunning
Seriously, those are friggin beautiful
3
The game itself has really hooked me so far
Cecil is way more interesting then any other protaganist I have played as in quite some time
Really makes you wonder how SE could have screwed up so badly with the more recent iterations of Final Fantasy
For some reason, I never got around to playing this even though I've played every other FF that's come stateside and am really glad I picked this one up
As I have not played any other version of this game I can't give a good comparison review to other versions
The good is the game itself is great and looks pretty great most of the time
I enjoy the story and despite the 15 fps lock in battle after you get used to it it's not a big deal HOWEVER, If you port a game to PC it's pretty inexcusable to lock framerates so low
As PC gamers, we want to play the game as silky smooth as possible and I can understand why people are upset about this
Hopefully someone can mod this quickly
All in all, I'm glad I purchased this game
I can finally play the FF most people praise as the best one ever made
So far, this game really delivers and I'm having a-lot of fun
Take care all I will update my review if I have any further info or thoughts on the game as I continue playing
Peace!

												I love FFIV
 It's probably up there in terms of games I've spent the most time with
 Twenty-two years, and I generally find time to play through one of its multitudes of ports and remakes every year or so
 It's a remarkably well designed RPG and for what it lacks in freewheeling customizability it makes up for in perfect pacing and balance,This is a port of the Android version
 Actually, from what I've been reading here, it's an EMULATION of the Android version, for a double lazy point multiplier (lazy points can be redeemed for valuable prizes but eh too much work)
 The Android version is a port of the Nintendo DS version, which was excellent, though pushing against the limits of that system
 This remake was designed as something of a love letter to long-time FF4 fans, that showed a deep understanding of the original game
 Difficult encounters and bosses were tweaked to be much harder, and their stats and scripts were cleverly turned around to make the old, well-worn tactics ineffective - yet every boss now has a trick to it, and it's immensely satisfying to discover those tricks
Plus the graphics are really cute (all y'all boneheads who think this game should look like FFXV or whatever are smokin' some loco weed), and the cutscenes are really well done - almost exactly like I envisioned the scenes of the game in my head as a child
The Android (and iOS) versions were basically just the DS Version, but in a higher resolution with uglier interface assets and the utterly mediocre system font
 While most of the game runs at a smooth framerate, as it should since it's not exactly pushing the limits of the hardware, the battle scenes are jarringly choppy
 Initially when I played the Android version I was thinking that they must not have optimized the game very well - but no, it's completely intentional, framelocked at roughly 10-15 FPS
 This is probably due to Japanese developers still coding like its their glory days on the PS2, like so many Al Bundys dreaming wistfully about those four touchdowns in a single game in high school
 All the animation is most likely keyed to that irritatingly low framerate, and bumping it up will either make the animation look really bad or play it way too fast
So yeah, the PC version is that version
 Unless they (or hopefully some intrepid modder) fixes how choppy the battle scenes are (and how dull the interface/font is), don't bother
 There are way too many other versions of FF4, all of which you can play on your PC somewhat less legally, but it's hard to feel bad when Squeenix can't even put in a cursory effort to give us a good experience

												The Last Remnant is my favorite JRPG of all time, and definitely holds a place of my top 10 games of all time
Here's why
This game is wholly unique
Usually, when one says "JRPG", you have a good sense of what you're getting into
Cliched characters (whether you like those cliches or not), quirky personalities, a turn-based battle system, a long convoluted story with plenty of twists, and be prepared to roll your eyes or shake your fist at the screen for some character antics or story twists you saw coming from early on
In The Last Remnant, little of this is true
The story is unique, the art style and characters are unique, some of the twists and story archs are surprising, and the battle system is so unlike anything else you've ever played, somewhere between a JRPG and a large scale strategy game with army simulation elements
This game is known to be quite challenging
I bought the Xbox 360 version on the game's release date, and have beat the game a few times and put a couple hundred hours into it
After completing my first PC playthrough tonight after about 90 hours, I can say for certain the PC version is about 3000% easier
An update was made to the game that made a few changes that made the PC version exponentially easier, though it is still more challenging than the average RPG
So if you happened to try the 360 version and were turned off by its difficulty, I urge you to try the PC version
The Last Remnant needs to be commended for its ability to have realistic and relatable characters, and multiple characters you care about and will remember forever
In this game, you are able to literally build up a small army to take into battles with you, where enemies and your people are separated into "unions" rather than each person being separate from one another
It is here where the game brings in large-scale strategy type battles, allowing the unions to act as one unit
Strategy fans will delight in the ability to hire soldiers and characters for their army, picking and choosing people based on their unique skill sets and abilities
You are able to hire people you've perhaps done quests with, or people you've never met that happen to have a skill you've never heard of, just because you want to see it in action
You then pick and choose which people to put with whom, how to set up your unions, etc
, giving limitless possibilities for your army
Also, your followers will often ask for certain items, ingredients, etc
throughout the game, which they'll use to upgrade their equipment and become even more badass
(And trust me, this game is full of badass characters
) You can also dictate how your soldiers level up, as they ask you from time to time if you want them to delve into a different skill set or art style
Even if the game had a terrible story and cliched characters, the battle system would keep me crawling back
Battles are by far the best part of this game
While some will say that some boss battles can be "cheap" or "unfair," I'd argue that your characters also unlock plenty of abilities and special moves that are just as if not more cheap or unfair to the enemy (Blackout is ridiculously powerful, for example, and that's a move my unions ended up using frequently)
In summary, fights can be nail-biting, because you are constantly reminded that you are fighting enemies that are just as skilled and able as you
Will you still scream at the game in frustration? Sometimes, yes
But I've personally also nearly broken things with excitement when a single decision or a stroke of luck turned the tide of battle
Also, I'll let it be known that I find games that are hard just to BE hard quite annoying and to be little to no fun
This is not a game that is consistently cheap or unfair
It can be extremely challenging, and you'll call BS on a fight from time to time, but with strategy, that same fight on your next try could be immensely rewarding and much simpler
The Last Remnant is a refreshing game in a genre that is usually predictable
It has a gritty realism that is usually reserved for western RPGs
It also respects its characters
You'll find no little girls with parasols fighting in battle, nor will you have a guy insist on being shirtless while on the battlefield (seriously


whenever I see that, I think about how easy it'd be to take them out)
The characters--while they can be quirky and humorous at times--are never walking cliches
Each woman or man has her or his own personality, back story, goals and motivations--and YOU get to decide whether or not to add them to your army and help them grow over time
This game is a true gem
It is nothing less than a crime that a game of such originality is not mentioned in conversations of JRPGs more often
This is the JRPG that I hold every other JRPG up to--and until we get another game in this universe, I see no other game coming close
I cannot recommend this game enough
			
Posted: 3 September, 2015
												I bought The Last Remnant for $3
74 in 2011, and it took me four years to finally get around to playing it
 It took me 99 hours to get to the end because I went out of my way to do all of the important sidequests, so if you're not interested there, you can be done much faster
 There's also a demo if you want to try a bit of the game out for yourself
 I played the game entirely with the Xbox360 controller and did not try keyboard and mouse
 The Last Remnant is a type of strategic RPG that masquerades as a standard JRPG
 There's a lot that it does differently than compared to a JRPG, but then it's also pretty different from your standard SRPG too
 Or tactical
 Whatever
 I've seen it compared to Ogre Battle and I've heard that TLR was originally a SaGa game, but I haven't played anything in either series so this game stands as quite unique for me
 The story is kinda all right, I liked being able to go back to the city sector screen from anywhere in town, and there are a few catchy battle themes
 Combat is a fairly different affair compared to the typical "everyone stands in a line and makes hitting motions at the enemy" kinda game
 Instead of having between three and five people out at once to save the world, you field a max of 18 in the second half of the game, though it's not entirely as though everyone's running around doing their own thing
 You put your characters into small parties of up to five members each, or unions, where everyone pools HP and AP for special moves--but the enemy does it too
 This is a game where positioning and attacking the enemy's side is important, but unlike grid-based strategy RPGs, you can't directly order your your unions into a position to trap enemies
 The game works on a Deadlock mechanic
 Basically, two opposing unions meet on the battlefield and fight it out until one of them is dead
 At least you can break Deadlock to attack another group or heal, and the enemy can't
 But the idea is that both groups are focused on only the other, so you can have another group attack that preoccupied enemy group to flank them, and continue to gang up on them to get further damage and morale bonuses
 Of course you're vulnerable to being flanked, so it's generally a good idea to assign everyone their own target, and to target the flunkies in boss battles first since everyone focusing on the boss first leaves everyone's back open
 There's also the morale feature to keep in mind
 Unions have their own Limit Break-styled morale meter, but there's one at the top of the screen that affects both sides of the battlefield
 Most battles start with it in the middle where neither side benefits, but one side getting an advantage will result in better combat performance
 Enemies appear in the field and you're given an opportunity to initiate combat (on top of trying to draw as many into one fight for a higher challenge and more rewards), but if they catch you, they'll start with a free turn and the bar in their favor
 A stat buff for the majority and a stat debuff for the minority sounds insignificant, but it's very noticeable in practice
 Some tougher enemies will use devastating attacks when they control the morale bar, so shutting them down is a top priority
 There are QTEs during battles
 I know some of you are rolling your eyes already, but I like to think of it closer to a timed-hits mechanic versus "press this button to not die" like in some games, since the prompt comes up during the same part of the animation
 The chance for the prompt is tied to the battlefield morale, and during an attack, you're given one of five buttons (default A, B, X, Y, and right trigger for X360 controls)
 Successfully press the right button in time and the next person on your side in that Deadlock will leapfrog to the top of the action queue and do their move, getting another prompt
 Hit all of the prompts to finish the combo and the last person on your team will attack with a guaranteed critical hit
 There's a prompt when being attacked too--parrying results in a stun, blocking with a shield results in a damaging shield bash, and evading results in a heavily-damaging counter attack
 Given battles are largely an affair of picking orders and then watching everything play out, this does keep things kinda engaging, though you can also set the game to handle the prompts for you at a lower success rate
 When it comes to control, there's not a lot that's in your hands
 You're given a choice of up to five orders per union, ranging from "attack with your weapon!" to "use Combat Arts!", but you may not get the prompt to heal or revive somebody when you really need it
 And even if you do pick "use Combat Arts!", that doesn't mean everyone in the union actually will, even if they have enough AP
 Some of it is down to union composition, though there's also union morale to consider
 You can at least turn off individual arts if you don't want people using them
 You can't directly give any equipment to anybody except the protagonist, Rush
 There's an 
ini edit to circumvent this, though that has its own hangups
 There's a pretty robust item creation/upgrade system, but your characters can only request things you have in your inventory already and they may not ask for or even use things that logic states they should
 You can assign unions their own formations, but you can't exactly move people away to avoid the big boss' area-of-effect attack, so you have to hope that everyone is standing in the right place to not get torn apart
 The only real problems I had with the game were texture pop-in and laggy gameplay, even on a solid-state drive
 Cutscenes weren't immune to this either, but at least you could pause to let everything load, or pause and then skip them if you wanted
 The game was also more difficult than I'd consider other JRPGs or the like, though I wouldn't put it up there with the hardest games in the genre
 A lot of it can be avoided by setting your teams up well, though there's still a luck element involved
 This is also one of the few games I've played where trying to do all of the major sidequests makes the final boss significantly harder
 Given you have to beat a very difficult boss for that 100% completion before a certain part of the story, it's not really suggested to attempt this on your first time through--there's a New Game Plus feature so try it on your second loop
 I kinda hurt my enjoyment of the game by having to grind out because of my unknowing mistake
 But despite all that, I really did enjoy my time with The Last Remnant
 I've never quite played anything like it, and while there isn't as big a drought for JRPGs on PC now as there was in 2011, this game is certainly unique enough to be a keeper in my book
 If you have any interest in the game at all, you really should try the demo out
 It manages to be a fun experience without falling back on established Final Fantasy references or the like

 “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win
” The Last Remnant is a great role-playing game with a unique take on combat mechanics in form of a turn-based, command-based system using symbol encounters
It is definitely the most interesting part of this game providing a lot of fun especially in the larger-scale battles
Originally released for Xbox 360 the PC version of this game features numerous changes from the console, including enhanced graphical settings, a Turbo Mode that increases battle speed (very practical when farming for weapon components), and a New Game Plus option, that allows the player to start a new game with the gold and unique items from their first play-through
And for the hardcore gamers among us there are of course challenges like super boss battles and the component farming for the endgame weapons
On the other hand the sound is a mixed bag of partially epic orchestral music and sorely limited voice-acting
In addition the protagonist Rush is sometimes a little bit uninspiring as a leader figure
 Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements

												It's a very deep game, and unfortunately it requires you to plan ahead and optimize
 For your first playthrough go nuts, on the second playthrough look up some strategies :]
I hate it when people give reviews and they've only played a few hours, so I figured I should leave my opinion
There's no grinding in this game, although there's a LOT of content for you to miss
 Don't be in a hurry on this one, but also don't try to be meticulous and look up everything on your first playthrough
 Enjoy the cheesy Rush cinematics!  And then familiarize yourself with everything you missed on the first playthrough and make your second one badass!

												I originally started this game on the 360 but never was able to finish it, partially because of the ridiculously skewed leveling system and partially due to a red ring of death
Despite my inability to get past a boss fight around 80 percent of the way through the game, I really enjoyed it, so I was glad to see this game on Steam
I was even more glad when I started to play TLR again and realized a couple of things: it's a lot easier if you understand the skewed leveling system (and I'll get to that in a second) and the PC version has made a lot of interesting quality of life improvements to the game
Really, it feels like the only thing missing from the PC version is


achievements
(Okay, actually, my other complaint would be that whomever did the cutscene animation has apparently never watched a living person walk before because the modeling is terrible but -- that's minor
)So back to the leveling system
TLR is really interesting in that it removes all control from the player in terms of leveling characters and, to a certain extent, control over a character's actions in battle
So while the lack of control will take some getting used to I actually think the battle system is really fun, if unique
The leveling system, however, causes problems
Essentially TLR has two leveling stats: individual units/character stats (which the game auto-levels/assigns for you) and battle rank, which levels your entire party/army
What I didn't realize the first time I tried the game on the 360 was that having a high battle rank is


actually really bad
The higher the battle rank, the longer it takes for stat increases and the harder the enemies are to beat (to the point where if you have too high a rank, like I did, a boss battle literally becomes a one-shot and completely impossible encounter)
So, I'm definitely having a much better play-through on the PC because (a) the PC version seems to have reduced some of the connection between battle rank and difficulty and (b) despite how counter-intuitive it is to NOT level in a RPG, I've managed to keep my battle rank pretty low
That said, the game has an interesting storyline (that I'm eager to finally finish) and is definitely a completionist's nightmare
The main questline is actually fairly short but there's a MILLION sidequests and a couple hundred challenge quests (e
g
, kill a specific monter, find a particular item, gain a specific level, etc
) so there's a ton of stuff to do
If you have a good 40-50 hours to kill, you like the idea of transhumanism, and you like SquareEnix, or just JRPGs, I definitely recommend this one

												Okay so as someone who I just checked has over 500 hours in this game


 I think that qualifies me to write a review on it
 With that many hours I like the game
 I will break it down into the pros and cons for new players deciding
ProsHands down my favorite large scale battle system
 It balances controling multiple squads facing off against armies without being to micromanaging and yet with still a bit of flexibilty
 Their are some frustrations and a steep learning curve to it though
 You rely upon the computer to bring up your selections and there is a lot of mechanics that go into it from your class, to your formation to your party leader
 Outside of combat selections and even your party build up can dramatically effect your combat
 But when you do finally get the hang of all that you can lead your forces into some truly epic looking and feeling battles
Scenery is lovely in the game and has held up well
 Some areas get repetitive when you are still hunting for rare monsters but usually the areas themselves look pretty
The leveling system i enjoy but it might not be for everyone
 Basically when you begin the game you get to decide how to equip your main character
 The rest of your party you can only choose one of three focuses so they are less customizable
But overall I like the fact that one game I can make him an assassin leading an army, the next a ninja and a combat hog, and a third game an epic healer magic user, and if you have enough patience you can master them all
NegativesThe main character truly has an annoying voice and personality
 How can i play a game so much that I hate the main character?  Well because I truly love the epic battle system it is relaxing and a lot of fun and it gets better and more epic as you go through the game
 And the first time you pull of a synergy or you start busting out the remnants it truly does have an epic feel to it unlike many other games
So just suffer through the main character and enjoy the fights
The storyline

This game was built to have sequels
 It does not to the best of my knowledge have any in the works yet
 Would love to explore more of the world
 This one has a lot of potential
The learning curve


 You will hate or love the game for the first few hours
 At about hour twenty your going to find someone trick in battle that you didnt realize you could do and things will be easier
 And then youll starting finding combos you can use for end game
 Or formations and specializations
 So the learning curve on this game sucks
 At a hundred hours your still going to learn new tricks and techniques to make the battles more interesting or fun
 Yet while it sucks to take forever to learn it means that there will always be a new little trick you can pick up that will help you later
 Or someone to add to your party in a combo you didnt think of
So the grind is what will get most people though
 Doing all the side quests takes time
 And the first time you have to run across the great sand sea you will appreciate ground transportation that other games have
 This one you have your feet
 No way around it sorry
Overall seems like there is a fair bit of negatives with the postives
 So why do I recommend it so highly?  Because like legend of dragoon the combat is interactive
 The effects in it have stood up the test of time and truly capture the chaos and epic feel of army combat
 Some games will capture that but this lets you control your army in a more fluid manner
 I wish other games had a similar UI
Basically even after 8 years since its release


 The game is still unique in its play and fun to engage in
 Hope some others will give it a try
 That they will be able to suffer through the learning curve and the challenges and find some enjoyment  in it
 And if enough like it hopefully they will make a sequel one day
Thanks for your time and the short novel read
 Have fun my friends and best of luck to you

												I personally would not recommend this game because of it's "leveling" system
First all, I should note that I don't mind grinding and I hate JRPG's that have the moster's scale to your level, I hate being confined to how strong the developers think I should be at any given point in the game
Needless to say this game has the enemies scale to your level but then goes a step farther to make it even worse with it it's "battle rank" (BR) system
The game increases the stats of enemies and decreases the xp received and the chance to increase one of your characters stats
This wouldn't be so bad but the BR sticks no matter who is in your group (or union or whatever they want to call it) so if you level up your main character and the first couple party members in the early part of the game then every party member you get later will be ridicilously weak with no real way to level them up to where they should be
Honestly, google "the right way to level up" (skipping the fact a game shouldn't need an explanation of how to freaking level up) with The Last Remnant and they will all say to "avoid as many fights as possible"
I do not want to play a game where the point of the game is to not play the game as much as possible

												I adore this game
 I picked it up on PC as soon as it went on sale, but I mostly play on Xbox 360
 I really wish people would give it a chance and soldier on through its learning curve beacause if you do, you'll fall in love with this game's amazing combat system, great voice acting by my man Johnny Yong Bosch, and some awesome music
Pros:- Great Visuals- Unique, and rewarding Combat System- Interesting Characters- Interesting World full of different races- Execellent music, especially during combat- Great Voice acting, save for a few individuals- Johnny Yong Bosch as the main voice actor- Good length- Interesting side questsCons:-  Story is meh, just background stuff but some of the characters are indeed interesting-  Steep learning curve

												Steam turned into Dlsite so gradually i didn't even notice

												Few weeks ago, they released Dark ElfToday, they released The HeiressIn a few weeks time, they will release Cat Girl & Killing TimeAnd there goes my friend list

												*Ahem*ONEONE1 is known for making good Ero-RPGs
SakuraGame is known for making the worst translations in recorded modern history
When combined, sadly not even the quality of ONEONE1's handicraft can save their own game, because the translation ruins everything
The game works, but the language is so bad that you more often than not have to actually guess what's being said
It's frustrating and takes quite a toll on the player
This is because SakuraGame relies entirely on machine translation, and most likely doesn't even know English language themselves
When a language is directly translated, as machine translation do, it often doesn't make very much sense because idioms and sentence structure isn't the same in different languages
You need human skills and intelligence to make sense of it all, and make it into something that relays the same message
SakuraGame doesn't do that, and ONEONE1 knows, but they still asked them to translate the game instead of someone with actual translation skills
Why? Who knows, maybe ONEONE1 doesn't really care much for gaijins, but still want our money, and SakuraGame works cheap and fast? It's hard to say
No matter, the fact still remains that "The Heiress" has language that's so bad that it completely destroys what's good about the game
EDIT: The in-battle H-attacks doesn't work in the Steam version
It's probably broken because of the translation work, and it's still not fixed
This game just might become the first Steam game that makes me ever want to ask for a refund
ONEONE1: Please choose a better translator in the future, or go away from Steam and never come back

												I am simple man
I see add to cart I press Boobs
			
Posted: 15 August
												Played it for about 10 minutes and gave up
Unable to bare reading the translation
			
Posted: 13 August
												good for jerking off but it keeps crashing			
Posted: 15 August
												Buy this if you have a lot of patience with the translation, or if you're decently fluent in reading Japanese with a decent grasp of understanding it when you hear it
The gameplay is less of a goal to get porked, and more of a goal to be "What if a normal JRPG had consequences where sometimes the enemy takes your hoo-hah if you lose
" So it's more than some internet pronz game, less than a well polished JRPG
The Japanese version makes a LOT more sense
But again, you might not understand it
I do, so I enjoy it
Mechanics-wise the battles are very easy if you fight decently
I've found that I level up even without fighting too much
The combat really isn't the bread and butter of the game
What IS, is the H-System
Each smexy times action that successfully happens to your character builds up a system
If things happen enough times your character developes certain attitude adjustments
She starts off an honorable uptight warrior of justice but if enough things happen to her she developes to enjoy or not enjoy certain things
Not something I was expecting to happen
Unfortunately the English translation is so terrible that I only recommend it if you're willing to skip that, or if you can understand a bit of Japanese
			
Posted: 15 August
												The game overall has terrible translations and a boring quest system with story that barely passes as interesting
I'd LIKE to say the H-scenes are nice but in truth I just ended up feeling bad for the character and fights are a complete joke in this game
I've never felt so bored in even the most text book of RPG's but this one FINALLY bored me so much I couldn't handle it
			
Posted: 26 August
												Interesting game from Oneone1, saddled with a machine translation by a lazy Chinese company
I'm conflicted on recommending it because I'd love to see more stuff coming to the west, but no right-minded person should support such an abyssmal effort
Incidentally the game is riddled with bugs due to the machine translation altering much of the triggers from firing due to flipping slashes around in the script files
And no, you can't fix it because Oneone1 encrypt's his scripts
Edit: The people responsible for the 'translation' forgot to reencrypt the script files, so you CAN fix them
Have at it
Extracting the original japanese to more easily effect a real translation would require breaking the encryption on the non-steam release however

												Ok so out of all of the latest Atelier games this one plays with the most freedom of all of them
 No weekly deadlines
 Freedom to explore when and where you want with a seamlessly inserted storyline
 To top it off the storyline in this Atelier game is one of the best since Iris
 One of the most fun things I found in this game was actually the ability to use songs from some of the older atelier games as music and most of the music selections in the game are changeable (you can do this from the book in the atelier)
 I found that "That Kid's Shop Is Successful?" from atelier Iris 2 was very well suited to the main character and thus have it as my Atelier theme now
Only Two negatives I encountered first being my directinput controller was not well implemented (not expected to be even working to be honest tho so no shame there) and the required installation of the 32 bit Runtime libraries on a 64 bit computer were kinda missleading
 (the launcher is 32 bit the game shell itself is 64 bit and these are forced into those modes meaning you need both the x64 and x86 vc packages included in the redistributable folder installed
)All negatives aside If you don't have this GET IT
 I can't reccomend this game enough
			
Posted: 23 June
												Are you ready for a stream of consciousness review at 6:00AM in the morning? Great! Let's get into it
What is Atelier Sophie?Atelier Sophie is a game about alchemy - but not just that, the effects a single person can have on numerous others through good intentions and hard work
You see, Alchemy is the art of fulfilling the wishes and desires of materials to become usable items
It is listening and figuring out exactly which item works with which other, which trait will work best for which situation, and which things fit together harmoniously
Your job in this game is to create harmony between items, people, and situations
And the main character, Sophie Neuenmuller, is a perfect example of this quality
She is bubbly, upbeat, but flawed
She is earnest though, and nearly always owns up to her mistakes and failures, letting her good nature guide her through each and every situation
There is a lot as people that we can take from her
Though Sophie is simply an alchemist, she shows the importance of how just one job, one role, one chance, one opportunity, filled with good natured intent - done to your fullest - can help the other people around you, lift you up, and bring happiness and joy to the places you least expect it
This is a coming of age story - a girl becoming a woman
Learning the human condition through the only thing she knows well - Alchemy
But enough of my ranting, lets get into a more objective break down
Story - 5/5The story in this game can likely be explained in just one sentence
"You are an alchemist, and you make items to better the town you live in
"And Gust could have just left the story there, but it didn't
While you won't find yourself drawn into Atelier Sophie's story like say, the Witcher 3 (haha), you will be drawn in by the charm and the vibrance of the characters
I've already spoken on Sophie, but her companions are just as fun, and each shows enough character and story line to avoid archetypes that plague this sort of game all the time
As an Alchemist in the town of Kirchen Bell, you feel like a daughter of the town
You know everyone, and everyone knows you
You gradually help them to see you grow up, grow out, and gain confidence
Childhood friends -feel- like childhood friends
The local market -feels- like the place to go for basic items
The lounge -feels- like a small hole in the wall - but one with charm
The town of Kirchen Bell is alive and well, and you certainely feel (even isolated up in the Atelier doing Alchemy) that you are an active part of the community
And helping people in Kirchen Bell expounds outwards
By helping them, you help yourself, and you go on action filled romps through dungeons, which are simple in design but fun to visit again and again
Why? Because they offer new materials and new chances to test out your plethora of items
(You can hold 5,000 back at home!)The story is light, fun, and never feels forced
It has emotion, but isn't heavy handed
It has depth, but only if you go searching
It's as cute and as fun as you'd like it to be, with as much depth as you'd like to assign to it
It's your story, my story
We are Sophie
Graphics - 4/5I'm an Ultrawide Nerd, so obviously a lack of native (or hacked) support stinks
But I'm also a resilient little princess, so I'll survive
The game runs up to 2560x1440p, and if you can reach that, it looks amazing
The artwork is spectacularly drawn
The animations and areas look -justlikeanimeomg-, which is a big plus for me
Sure, some areas are small and kinda plain, but their vividness still pops out here and there
Atelier Sophie gets the job done in the graphics department, giving the world a Storybook feel
No one is expecting anything amazing, though 4k would have been nice to see, and UW support would have been a blessing from the PC Gods
But Gust is working on those things, and I trust them
I rarely encountered bugs or anything like that
Controls - 5/5The controls in this game are simple, and they are already mapped for you
They are explicit and easy to learn, and you won't have any mystery with this one
The easiest 5/5 I've ever given
Gameplay - 6/5I cheated and gave an extra point
Sorry! The Gameplay is what really makes this macaroni cook
I'll start off with Alchemy
As someone who thought this game would just be about boring crafting all day - BOY WAS I WRONG
It's about super exciting crafting mixed with neato turn based combat and cute designs!The crafting in this game is the main selling point
It is fun, easy to learn, and feels a bit like playing a game of Tetris in a Cauldron
It's a game within a game! Sometimes I spent 2 or 3 hours just fiddling with traits and things in the Cauldron, trying to get my Alchemy just right cuz, omg, I wanted to be the best like no one ever was
To make Honey was my real test, and to not get failure ash was my cause
I hate crafting normally, but this game made me a fan
Instead of bein a crotchety hag about it, I really enjoyed shifting and mixing and matching colors, qualities and values
To all you hack and slash players, trust me, this is a fun little diversion that will change the way you look at crafting and sitting at a cauldron
It's a major part of the game that feels like a fun mini game every single time
CombatCombat is amazing
Amazing why? Because it doesn't try to be more than what it is
It's turn based fighting, with two stances- Offensive and Defensive
Sound simple? It is! But another element is brought in with chains, combos, and different party formations
Explosive bombs crafted in the Atelier cause devastation and make the game a demolition test on cute little critters
It's engaging and fun even during grinding
Grinding itself is never tiring, never boring, and never is at a lack for excitement based on which items and party makeups you use
The animations feel like a shonen anime, and it really gives you a great feeling about fighting
That's a big plus for a primarily crafting based game
Quests/Running AroundThe Quests in this game usually require you to make something or finding something, which is standard fare
Once again though, this is never boring or lacking for intrigue
Sometimes you are rewarded with really pretty cutscenes, cute dialogue, and silly interactions
Other times its just cold hard cash, which is fine too
It doesn't take you long to figure out how to get the money money money, and soon Sophie is a whale at the Bellagio
Even when you have money though, trust me, you'll be spending it on constant improvements and new gear, and each time you create something (you craft weapons and armor too, through your buddies) you have a sense of pride
That's what this game gives you - a sense of accomplishment
What gamer doesn't want that?Sound - 5/5The sound in this game is amazing
With the DLC, you can even change all the sounds to your liking (From all the older Atelier games!) With that said, the default tracks are great
They aren't overbearing, but if you take time to listen and just sit back, they are soothing when they need to be, and up beat when they need to be as well
Combat tracks never get repetitive or bland, and boss fights feel epic in all their epicness
You can feel Sophie getting stronger as the fights scale up, and dramatic points of the story have the proper sound for the event they are placed in
It's not some riveting orchestral masterpiece, but it is incredibly pleasing and cute
That,and no sound is out of place or awkward
ConclusionAtelier Sophie was my first Atelier game
I'm no crafter, I'm a person that loves mashing buttons and cutting things to pieces while eating eggs whites and drinking cranberry juice
But guess what? I ate my eggs whites alot slower and drank my cranberry juice alot more delicately after this game
Engrossing, enriching and cute, this game is highly recommended and a must have for your Steam Library
Don't miss out!

Finally, the Atelier series has come to the PC!This is my second playthough, after having completed the game once on PS4
GameplayAtelier Sophie starts out slow; there isn't really a story until the middle of the game
Instead, Atelier Sophie has lots of slice of life events that gradually unfold as the story progresses
The game revolves around Sophie, a budding alchemist living in Kirchen Bell
Having inherited her grandmother's Atelier, Sophie wants to become a better alchemist
Unlike previous Atelier games in the series, Atelier Sophie lacks a time limit
All the DLC available on the PS4 version is included with the Steam version for no extra cost, along with the Steam price being only half of the digital version of Atelier Sophie on PS4
There are four available difficulties, with harder difficulties providing increased experience and rarer item drops, along with harder enemies, increased enemy health, and lower damage dealt
For those wondering, you can select English or Japanese voices in the settings, with the Japanese voices containing more voiced lines than the English voices
Alchemy SystemAtelier Sophie's unique crafting system is where the game shines
New items to synthesize are unlocked as you explore the vast world that lies before you, and these recipes can be discovered through a variety of different methods
Using alchemy, Sophie can synthesize useful items, such as medicine, accessories, and explosives
While traveling around the outskirts of Kirchen Bell, Sophie can gather materials to be used for alchemy
These gatherable materials have unique properties, which are known as "traits" in the game
Synthesizing materials together with different traits can result in items with unique effects, such as adding more healing benefits to medicine
The revamped alchemy system from the previous Atelier games is a key feature of Atelier Sophie
Gathered materials come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and each material has a certain element, such as fire, water, or earth
The alchemy cauldron involves placing materials on a grid in a tetris-like form
The size, shape, and element of a material can change how you place materials in the cauldron
Placing enough of a certain element in the cauldron can result in more powerful bonus effects, like increased damage in throwables or enhanced healing in medicine
However, filling in more space of the cauldron's grid will result in a item with higher quality
As you place materials down, some tiles around the material can light up, resulting in an increased amount of progress to a bonus effect
Some materials with odd shapes might not even fit with the other materials you placed, causing you to reconsider where you place materials in the cauldron
As the game progresses, new cauldrons are unlocked
These new cauldrons can change how you synthesize items, such as increasing the available grid space, allowing the materials to be rotated in the cauldron, and increasing the amount of bonus tiles gained
CombatThe combat in Atelier Sophie is not as fleshed out as the alchemy system, but comparable to other JRPGs out there
Atelier Sophie is a turn-based RPG, except that all attacks are decided before a turn starts
The speed of a character determine who attacks before another charater or enemy
There are two possible stances a character can take, either an offensive or defensive stance
An offensive stance causes more damage, while a defensive stance can reduce damage taken
Stances can be changed on a character's turn, and depending on the current situation, can change the outcome of a battle
As a character attacks, a "chain link" gauge increases, which allows characters in the same stance to execute special attacks as a group once the gauge is filled to a certain point
An offensive group skill can deal massive damage, while a defensive group skill can grant defensive buffs for allies that can potentially change the outcome of a battle
PerformanceAtelier Sophie was developed by Koei Tecmo games, a company known for inferior PC ports in the past
However, Atelier Sophie has native 4K resolution support, 60 fps, anti-aliasing, and adjustable shadow quality
This is arguably the best PC port Koei Tecmo has done so far
Finally, a Koei Tecmo port that's superior to the PS4 version!On my GTX 1070, I was able to run Atelier Sophie at the highest shadow quality and 4x anti-aliasing(launcher allows up to 4x) at 4K resolution at 60 frames per second with VERY minimal stuttering, to the point where you would need to try to actually look for any stuttering to notice it
Unusually high CPU usage and "shimmering" shadows are a bit glitchy as of launch day, but hopefully a future patch will address these issues
The anti-aliasing and 4K resolution eliminates aliasing, which plagued the PS4 version
Along with potential modding support, Atelier Sophie's PC port looks promising
ConclusionOverall, I rate Atelier Sophie an 8
5/10
The story could have been improved in many ways, but the new crafting system somewhat makes up for that
The combat is decent at best, and the combat of the previous Atelier games are considerably better
Keyboard support is not the greatest, with keys being rebindable only in the configuration files, while controller support is as good as other PC games out there
Hopefully, the sequel, Atelier Firis, should improve on the weak aspects of Atelier Sophie
Koei Tecmo is also improving in port quality, and hopefully future Koei Tecmo ports will be as good or better than Atelier Sophie's port

												Let me preface this by saying that Atelier has been one of my favourite JRPG franchises for a very long time, basically since Iris on PS2 -- that's A6, this is A17
It was also a primary reason for me to keep consoles around
For those unfamiliar with the franchise, a succinct way to describe it would be as non-linear, character-driven slice-of-life JRPGs, with a significant focus on alchemy as a gameplay mechanic
Alchemy is basically crafting, but unlike the crafting implementations in most RPGs doesn't suck -- it offers significant player agency, lots of choice and optimization potential, and has a huge impact on everything else you do in the game
The series is very long-running (as the incredibly terse Steam description indicates), and it has lately been grouped into mostly independent trilogies
As luck would have it, Sophie is the first in a new such trilogy, and as such it is a great point of entry for anyone new to the series!Other than the gameplay, a main charm of the game (and franchise) are its fantastic character models, that offer an amazingly direct translation from anime-style concept art to in-game 3D representation
Beyond that, as with all games developed by Gust, the soundtrack is fantastic and varied
When the game was announced for the PC, I was very concerned about its port quality, given some of the previous efforts by Tecmo-Koei
Luckily, while not perfect, this port offers everything I personally really wanted on PC: 4k resolution support, MSAA (which is easily upgraded to SGSSAA with the Nvidia driver), and 60 FPS [Edit: actually, it seems to happily support arbitrary FPS -- good news for owners of high-refresh-rate monitors!]
The biggest issue is probably its lack of mouse support, which makes a controller much preferable for playing the game
If the idea of a non-linear JRPG with a large focus on (great!) crafting and lack of the usual driven "save-the-world" narrative sounds enticing to you, do give Atelier Sophie a try! You might be surprised at how addictive it turns out to be

												Great game, a lot of fun
Alchemy itself is a fun intricate puzzle mini-game with a lot of depth
The story is not a literary height, but its a nice feel-good story
The game also has a nice habbit of introducing new mechanics even quite a bit into the game, with great pacing
Giving you new mechanics at a welcome moment
Music is quite good as well
My biggest gripe is with the combat
You don't get to see the strength of enemies untill you are already in combat with them and the game has a tendency to have a huge range of mob power in the same area
You can go from beating packs with a single hit and barely getting xp, to getting absolutely demolished by the next pack in the very same area
Can be a bit frustrating but the penalty for losing isn't very severe, you lose some of your gathered materials
I'd happily recommend this game
Runs well, works well with a controller
			
Posted: 7 February
 We need more Games like this here on Steam Yes I'm a huge JRPG Fan and since I've left Console behind me, I couldn't "Test" Atelier Sophie
I waited for this to come to Steam, since i've heared of it
And let me tell you something straight forward: This Game is Great! I can't and wont talk much about the Story so far but steady 60fps, no Drops so far, I LOVE the Artstyle, Camera is a bit slow with Gamepad for me but that's just crying on a high level
Please
More
Now

												In short: Buy Atelier Sophie, if it's the kind of game you like
It's amazing
But it's not for everyone
The draw of Atelier has never been exhilarating combat but a more laid back style of JRPG play
Much attention lies on presenting likeable and cute characters and exploring the relationships and backstories between Sophie and her companions
Then there is the actual alchemy which is pretty much a game in its own right, mixing and matching the right items to create the best bombs, killer books or whatever else you can make, as well as crafting the best equipment possible
The dollmaking system in particular is very fun to experiment with just to see what sorts of good looking or silly (or slooty) outfits you can end up with
Combat is functional with a lot of flashy effects but not too much of a focus
There is some tactic involved with bringing party members with different strengths and setting up equipment, as well as balancing the attack and defense rolls in the otherwise fairly standard JRPG battle system
For GUST's first port they did a fairly good job
There is a noticeable sort of lag when navigating the menu of all things but the cutscenes, general open-world gameplay and combat moves fluid even at the highest settings on my mid-range rig
The game certainly isn't for everyone
It strikes an odd line between casual players through fairly easy standard combat and making up for the lack of excitement with character and whimsy and the super-hardcore players on the other spectrum through the high difficulty levels which necessitate a lot of crafting, making the best equipment you possibly can and using tactics effectively in combat, though the challenge hererin lies more in the pre-battle prepwork than the actual fights
If this appeals to you at all, Atelier Sophie is definitely worth a recommendation, if only so GUST starts paying more attention to the PC market
			
Posted: 14 February
												PROS-Great interplay between exploring and crafting-Lots of depth and you will need to be patient-Great music-Comprehensive encyclopedia feature is very useful-60fps and well ported to PC-Much Longer Story than the previous Atelier Series and have many events to trigger
CONS-Mediocre combat-Tutorial heavy-Mechanics lack polish-You will Lost Track On What To Do -Crafting Alchemist Potion to progress the story(early game) For Unlocking Plactha's memory-You Only Get 1 ending no Matter what you do (i've play it on ps4 and vita as well)ConclusionThe crafting system has had a major overhaul and is now much more fun to play
The game is also easier now that you don't have to do multiple playthroughs and there is no time limit
We can also finally change camera angles at will
On the downside, there is now only one ending  and you can only battle with 4 characters (Shallie allowed 6)
So if you interested in buying this game get this with bundle that is also include with Night Of Azure
Although i can say this is much better port from Tecmo Koei ever released to date much better than Night Of Azure which has mess up controller mapping
I recommend playing this for the series if you have been follow the atelier series since ps3 era or psvita
Atelier Firis were also about to debut next month as well
kindly pick this up while still can
My Final Verdict4/5 it is a great game although the story progression is a lil bit harder if you have never play this series before

FinallyAtelier is finally on Steam, YAY! This is my second favorite jRPG after Final fantasy and i have waited very long for this to come to PC
I feel like a baby who got an awesome present on Christmas
Yes that's how happy am i to play this on PC
It would be nice if previous Atelier games would come to PC, but i'm not too optimistic about this
This game is about alchemy
The story is nothing like most of the games, it's not about saving the world, it has a nice lighthearted story
You play as Sophie who own an Atelier
A flying book named Plachta appears and it seems she has lost her memory and you must think of new recipes and write it in the book to help her remember who she is
Your job is to mix various ingredients in the cauldron and make cool items
You get requests from your friends and townspeople and you must venture outside to gather ingredients for alchemy to fulfill these requests
Alchemy is the key, it's only putting the ingredients into a cauldron it's much more
Various ingredients have different traits, by combining ingredients the outcome can be different every time and crafted item can have different traits
Other than doing alchemy you'll be talking to your friends, fulfilling their request and increasing friendship levels
After some time you see each character's event
Combat is pretty simple and easy to understand, i love it
I don't like when the combat is too complicated
This game has a turn based combat, you choose your actions (attack, skill, use item, run, defend) and your stance (offense/defense) click ok and watch the animations
For being stronger in battles you'll need to craft some items, better bombs, better healing item and so on
In short, everything you use you make yourself or make ingredients, give them to other characters and they craft the weapons or armor for you
What monsters and ingredients appear in the zone depends from the time of day and week
You can get different items or encounter tougher monster at night
Voice acting is pretty good for such a game, i can't say anything bad about it
Music is awesome as always, it creates that good atmosphere, which makes you happier
Graphics are nothing special, same as on PS3, but that's not a downside to such game
Performance is great, 0 problems
Port is well done
If you love jRPG's, funny dialogues and situations, deep crafting system, good story, lovable characters, fulfilling requests and exploring - don't think just buy it and support the developers so that we could get more Atelier games
ProsDeep and well thought crafting systemNice storyRelaxing gameplay and musicNice graphicsConsHaha nope

IntroductionThe first Evoland was fun and unique, but at the same time also very short, linear and, dare I say, even a bit boring
So, has the game evolved into something better with Evoland 2 or is it just more of the same with more of that gimmicky gameplay? Read all about it right here!GameplayTo be short and to be honest it really is more of the same
But it’s done way better, for the most part
While the first one was to-the-point and focused (maybe a bit too focused) this sequel takes the time to expand on pretty much everything
But, like everything, this has some positive and negative effects
First of all, the script has been upgraded
This in turn makes the story much, much longer and more fleshed out and it might possibly make you feel for (one or more of) the characters that accompany you on your journey
There are some funny moments and a whole lot of references to popular movies, TV shows and other games
It all still is rather linear, though, so I guess that hasn’t changed, and it also feels too ‘old school’ at times, but just wrapped in a more modern package
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531355732The engine has also been upgraded to allow more types of gameplay to be shown
While there are still gameplay sections in it that you have also already played during the first game there are now many more
I can’t list them all I’m afraid, partly due to the character limit and my memory, but a few of the new gameplay types included are puzzles (clearly inspired by Professor Layton), music segments (clearly inspired by Guitar Hero), shoot ‘em ups (‘bullet hell’-like games) and stealth (clearly inspired by Metal Gear Solid)
I personally think it’s incredibly impressive to have an engine that can handle and show all these different types of gameplay and graphics without breaking a sweat
And I haven’t encountered any loading screens either, now that I think of it (except for the initial loading screen, but that speaks for itself I think)
The problem with having many types of different gameplay is that, even though there are a lot of fun ones, there will always be genres that people just dislike and maybe even hate
Now that most of these gameplay types have been expanded upon it’s possible that parts of it might start to drag or bore sooner than the developer had hoped for
I personally hated the shoot ‘em up part; it felt that it took too long and it was also quite challenging
But, then again, you can’t please everyone
But they certainly tried, that’s for sure
However, none of the added gameplay types really add anything to the game, but like the first game it’s a fun ride if you’ve been playing games all your life or if you are just interested in game history
You will see a lot of different types of gameplay come by during your playthrough
But I can’t help but wonder if the game would’ve been even better if they had focused on just a couple of gameplay mechanics (the ones you would normally see in other RPGs plus a few unique ones) instead of adding tens of different, sometimes even useless, genres and mechanics
Probably not, though
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531355768And even though it’s just a small part of the game the puzzles are, everything considered, well done, except for one or two
Unfortunately one of them even ‘broke’ the game for me as it became unsolvable
I am talking about the mammoth puzzle, which I was unable to solve on my first try
It’s actually really easy, but I did something (read: chose poorly) and wasn’t able to solve the puzzle because of it
With no way to reset the puzzle or fix it I had to load up my previous save game, which was fortunately just one or two minutes earlier
A bit sloppy, but I can forgive them
Audio & VisualsThe music is exactly what you would expect in a game like this
It has a modern, symphonic soundtrack, similar to a lot of other soundtracks from years and games gone by
Rest assured: it’s not plagiarism
And somehow it also still has that retro feel
The sound effects are also great, with a lot of beeps and ‘plings’ that we all should be familiar with I think
There is no voice acting, by the way
Like the many genres included the game also has many (although not as many) different graphics
These range from 32-bit 2D and 2
5D to 3D, and each has its own style
It all runs at a solid 60FPS, too, and the colors just pop off the screen; they’re very vibrant and sharp, which I always love
But in comparison it looks mostly the same as the first Evoland, with naturally some improvements added here and there
All in all Evoland II manages to keep the graphics quality very consistent for the entire duration of the game
Another impressive feat for such a lengthy game!http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531355823 Length/Replay ValueWhere the first Evoland took roughly 3-4 hours to complete the length of the sequel has been increased to at least 19 hours, and most of it feels like proper content and not just filler content
You can put in even more hours than that if you want to collect absolutely everything so all things considered it’s definitely worth the asking price
It might not be interesting for the entire duration, but almost every game suffers from that problem in my opinion
It’s also not a game that you will replay often; once you’re done with it it’s likely you won’t play it again until at least several months/years later, and most of you (including me) probably won’t ever play it ever again
Still, absolutely worth the asking price if you ask me
ConclusionWow, Evoland II sure managed to impress me
I expected more of the same to be honest, which is definitely true, but the sequel pretty much improves on every aspect of the first game
It doesn’t make the game perfect – there are still a few flaws here and there – but I absolutely like the direction it’s heading into
There are also still a few too many gimmicks gameplay wise, but if they promise to take care of this in Evoland 3 (either by removing them or fleshing them out) then I’m sure it will be nothing short of amazing
An amazing love letter to videogames (as well as other media)! Bravo!Too long, didn’t readPros:+ The game engine can handle many different types of gameplay and visuals which is very impressive+ Plenty of variety in gameplay+ Visually breathtaking/Excellent art style+ More fleshed out and longer than its predecessor+ Collectibles and secretsMixed:+/- It’s a little more open but it’s all still a bit too linear+/- Because of the variety there may be certain parts that you wish were longer or shorterCons:- No freedom in upgrading your character; feels a bit tacked on- You may dislike one or two genres- Some bugs and glitches  Please note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer

												Okay, I'm gonna just say it:This is one of the best games I've ever played
Now, I loved the first Evoland
And I even saw plenty of reviews that said that Evoland 2 went beyond their expectations, but never did I expect this
Not only was this a great story, a great game and a great experience, but the work that went into this must have been completely ridiculous
Not only was the entire world created, but (SPOILER!!!)  it was created four times over with different graphicsI can't believe how many different gameplay sections were in this game
References to all my favourites and more :)The ONLY single thing I can point out is that right near the end of the game, I noticed a couple typos
So I'm going to go ahead and give this a 99% rating
I definitely do not regret buying this and I hope the creators will continue to create great games <3Can't wait for the next one
EDIT: Completely forgot to mention the fantastic soundtrack
Definitely worth it
EDIT2: I can't remember the last time I was this sad to actually know that I completed a game

												Evoland 2 is a love letter to classic JRPGs and some of the greatest games of all times
Evoland 2 is Zelda, it's Bomberman, it's Double Dragon, it's R-Type, it's Street Fighter, it's Fire Emblem and so much more! All the games within the game are created with love and depth
They're not just a gimmick, they're not just there for a quick, cheap laugh - they're really good! They're really well-implemented and work with the fantastic story, as well
Because Evoland 2 doesn't just copy and mimic other games - it develops an identity of its own
			
Posted: 25 August, 2015
												You see, I enjoy the first game as a guilty pleasure
It never really did anything with the "changing game types and dimensions," and its story was bare bones simple, and at times non-existant
It was all a vessel for a continuous joke, or reference, that if you didn't enjoy, would not keep you engaged
This game manages to out-do what the first one did by having a solid foundation with its gameplay, and story that actually means something
I'm 2 hours into the game and it has yet to throw any of the previous progress I've put into it out the window for the sake of a joke
Any reference they throw in, whether it be Professor Layton, Zelda, or Final Fantasy feels surprisingly in place with the type of game this is, and far from forced like in the first one
On top of that, the writing is really enjoyable, and so is the musical score
The only part I didn't really enjoy so far was a stealth section, that lasted a bit too long, and wasn't even that enjoyable to begin wtih
Overall, the game is just a really enjoyable experience so far, and I highly recommend giving it a check, even if you weren't such a fan of the first game

												I didn't play the first Evoland game, but when I had the opportunity to meet up with Shiro Games on gamescom 2015, the first thing they told me was that they took the time, over a year, to analyse what could have been better on Evoland and make sure that their next game would show an improvement
I just finished the game, and I can clearly tell you that they did, all in all, a good job with this new Action-RPG title
One of the most critical points for Evoland was that it was far too short and it somehow let people empty-handed
My first playthrough, played very casually but still trying to unlock additional content, just clocked at 23 hours, in-game time
Even if some stages or scenes can feel a bit lengthy, there's always something to do in this game: you can progress through the story, you can explore the world and try and find hidden chests or new items or you can spend hours trying to defeat tough opponents in their card game
You are never bored when you explore the world of Evoland: there is always a hidden reference for you to catch
You will be meeting up with characters from your favorite video games (Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite, Sakura from Street Fighter, Lara Croft


), you will notice items coming from different universes (mention to the Valley of Wind shop with Captain America's shield on a wall just next to a Buster Sword and Link's Hylian shield)
To be honest, at first, I even thought it was too much, all the time, and I had the feeling that this game might even get sued for being just a huge pile of copyrights infringements
But when you decide to play the game for what it is, a sort of homage to past glories like Chrono Trigger or Secret of Mana, you are just having a blast
Nicolas Decasse, one of the developers, introduced himself as a huge fan of Chrono Trigger, and the scenario of the game clearly shows it: the plot of the game will have you travel through time, using magic stones erected by a now disappeared civilization, while making sure you learn that this power shouldn't be messed around with and that your actions can have dire consequences
As every hero, Kuro, your avatar, will meet new friends on the way, and create special bounds with him
They will help him explore his environment, and he will be able to call on their power to progress through the game, by removing obstacles or creating paths for him
Once their power is fully unlocked, you will be able to use special summons for each of your three partners, like you would be able to in Final Fantasy 6 or 7
Time travel is represented in a way that a lot of retrogamers are going to enjoy: depending on the era you're in, the more old school the graphics
8 bits for the past, 16 bits for the present and isometric 3D for the future, you won't be able to forget in which era you're wandering
To explore certain areas, you will have to switch very regularly from one era to another, as some of the puzzles will involve removing obstacles or getting specific items in a different era to progress in the timeframe of your mission
This feature is very nice, but to be honest, from times to times, it just hacks the story telling: backtracking to one of those special stones to change something in another era before going back to the original era you come from and go back where you were is just a pain, at least in the first hours when you have no way of transportation
However, Evoland 2 always finds a way to renew your interest, by breaking the habit and having the player to explore regularly new video game genres: you will have for instance to defeat a boss in a versus fighting mode, you will try to save an entire civilisation playing a tactical RPG mode, you will have to escape a mountain fighting your way through a bullet hell


You never know what to expect in your first playthrough, and I certainly didn't expect to have to play a mix of Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero in an Action-RPG! My only problem with that is that it reinforces the general impression that the game is just a pot pourri of references and that it lacks a bit of personality: you play a game that talks and shows more of other games than itself
One of the main criticisms I'll have for this game is that some of the puzzles it offers are just extremely hard to solve, and not because you need a master's degree to solve them
 No, I'm just referring to some tricky hitboxes or silly point of views that actually make you think you're stuck when you just have to move a couple of millimetres to see where you need to go or finally manage to destroy something that was blocking your way
I spent one hour looking for an exit in a forest, knowing where the only exit was, and not managing to open it because of the hitbox of the bush I was supposed to destroy was very tiny and made me think that I couldn't go there just yet
But all in all, the puzzles are kind of tricky in the game and you will have to think for a couple of minutes to solve most of them (just have a look at the discussion boards on Steam and check the numbers of "Blocked in XXX" threads)
All in all, I can only recommend this game to all players who are somehow nostalgic of the golden age of Action-RPGs, who have a massive geek culture or who are just looking for an enjoyable game to entertain them for about 20 hours
It has some downsides, for sure, like the fluctuating rhythm in the action or the fact that allies are reduced to a very supportive role (you never get to fight as one of them), but the diversity in the gameplay and the many references, served with a brilliant soundtrack, are making Evoland 2 a very enjoyable game

												A massive improvement on the first Evoland in length and quality
Still a mediocre game which screams fan-service throughout though, lacking much character and substance in its narrative (which seems to be hugely derivative of Chrono Trigger) and many minigames
And while the increased length of the game and things to do were greatly appreciated, the developers missed the sweet spot between quantity and quality, leaving an empty feeling and a yearning for everything to hurry along and wrap up
Would still recommend if you have some spare time and want to play a game which doesn't take itself too seriously, but if you're looking for something a bit more substantial beyond nods and references to other games, a playable narrative with some light jokes throughout, and gameplay which consists of an amalgation of many different genres of games in the form of minigames, you should probably keep looking

Evoland 2Developer: Shiro GamesPublisher: Shiro GamesNote: A key for this game was provided by the developer for the purpose of writing an unbiased informative review
No other compensation was given
Introduction==========The original Evoland was somewhat of a surprise gem, utilizing some of the best features and gameplay from RPGs of the past
Expertly blended together, Evoland was a fun unique experience
Evoland 2 does nothing less than the same, crafting a wonderful experience using gameplay elements and mechanics from not only RPGs, but many other genres and series as well
You will see a lot of influences from many games, and many direct references scattered throughout
Even some pop culture references!Gameplay==========Evoland 2 is an action RPG first and foremost, but at times it changes up its style for periods of time
In one segment of the game, you are able to explore the field much like in the classic Secret of Mana style, attacking enemies that wander around the field
In the next segment, you will be platforming through a dark dungeon very reminicent of the old Super Mario titles
This change of style helps keep Evoland 2 fresh, and it lends this feeling of excitement to the game where you press on to see what type of changes come next!As the style changes, so do the graphics
You will start your adventure with what looks like the classic Game Boy look, black/white/grey pixels makign up your character and the world
This quickly evolves into a better 2D top-down look, in full color and a bit more detailed
Further progression sees full 3D being implemented, increasing the depth and overall look of the game
The original Evoland was all about going through the history of video games, and Evoland 2 still retains some of that feature
The original Evoland had a traditional turn-based RPG battle system, with a few changes here or there
In Evoland 2, combat is much like Secret of Mana or The Legend of Zelda: enemies are out in the open--you can walk up to them and whack them with your sword while avoiding their attacks
Much like Secret of Mana, you also get a few companions as you progress
But unlike Evoland, they do not join you in battle directly and take their own turns
Instead, you can charge up a Focus Attack that will cause your partner companion to unleash a special attack
After using this, a short cooldown occurs before it can be used again
These Focus Attacks are not only ways to battle enemies, but they are also used to interact with the environment
Menos' attack, for example, can be used to damage groups of enemies or destroy blocks, boulders, or other such obstacles on the field
These abilities can be upgraded as you progress and collect Maana
Graphics==========The overall look and feel of the game changes as you progress the story
At first, it's very simple: pixelated and colorless
But as you progress, it goes full 3D and filled with color and detail
No matter which stage of the game you are in, even the very beginning, the game looks amazing
It just keeps getting better as you go!Character sprites at the beginning look nice enough, and when they hit 3D mode you really notice the little details
Attacks looks better, environments look better, everything just looks so much better as you go! It's really amazing how well the art direction of this game was handled
Sound and Music==========One of my favorite parts of Evoland 2 is the soundtrack, especially in the Haunted Forest
The soundtrack perfectly matches each situation you encounter, the town you are visiting, or the dungeon you are exploring
Cheery, playful tunes for the towns set the mood for them well, and the dark, foreboding songs of each dungeon really make you feel like you are really there in the damp darkness
There is some very light voice acting, at least thus far, in the form of shouts, grunts, and other similar sounds
Swinging your sword is satisfying, as is the sound when hitting an enemy
Performance==========Evoland 2 runs flawlessly on my rig, which I like to call a low mid-tier build
60 FPS at all times, with no lag or slowdown
No frame drops whatsoever were observed
It plays perfectly with my Logitech F310 controller, with no prior setup
The default controls were spot on and easy to acclimate to
That being said, a controller is highly recommended
Final Thoughts==========If you enjoyed the first Evoland, you will undoubtedly enjoy Evolnad 2 as well
It's a great nostalgic throwback to the games it draws some of its features and mechanics from, and you will surely recognize where a lot of them come from
Tons of easter eggs and references are scattered throughout too, making it an even more nostalgic experience
A must buy for fans of the original Evoland!Gameplay Demo==========https://youtu
be/FS6R3o6Q3yUNerd House Verdict:==========Highly Recommended 
Posted: 28 January
[Introduction]This right here is an underrated gem from the pitch black depths of steam
Initially I was very skeptical considering the first Evoland lasted only about 4 hours and was horribly linear
I liked it, but there was something missing


a great story![Story]Luckily this time around, Evoland 2 got it right! The story lasts between 15 and 25 hours, and many new mechanics have been added (trading cards, time travel, power upgrades, etc)
There’s plenty of game-related references and fun easter eggs that should please any experienced gamer, and there are some TV and Anime references as well![Gameplay]Evoland 2 is blessed with a great story about time travel and it's consequences, through which you’ll meet many different characters each with their own backgrounds and ambitions
There’s a big world to explore, minimizing the linearity that plagued the first game
Each of the time periods feature their own beautiful, hand-crafted pixel or 3D graphics, different styles of gameplay, with soundtracks to match! Hack and slash, turn-based strategy, Bejewled-style match 3, beat-em-up, you name it
Many more waiting to surprise you!In terms of pacing the game had some problems with 2-3 areas dragging on for far too long and I had to look up some puzzles, but beyond that there’s little left to complain about! I couldn’t find and bugs or real problems throughout my playthrough
[Conclusion]Evoland 2, A Slight Case of Spacetime Continuum Disorder uniquely combines so many different genres and ideas in a way that no other game has really done before, and i can recommend it to anyone who is interested in an RPG/Hybrid that is doing something that no other game has done yet
Solid gameplay, a great story, and videogame history all over the place; what’s not to love about that?Enjoyed this review? Curious for more recommendations by Excurious Curations?

												When I played the first Evoland game I enjoyed it and thought it was a nice little parody but really nothing more
That is why I was pretty hesitant at first at buying the second game
Then I saw some videos of the game and decided it was worth a shot, and boy am I happy about that decision
First of all, Evoland 2 brings back some of the main unique elements of the first game, mainly the mashup of many different video game themes, and my god does it do a good job at that! From 2D top-down perspective to 3D navigation, from turn-based battle mechanics to real-time fighting and puzzle solving, from card games to shoot 'em up, this game excels in variety
In addition, unlike the first game, Evoland 2 has a solid plot which in my opinion was very nice and enjoyable (no spoilers here)
For completionist this game is pretty much ideal as it offers many not-so-easy-to-find collectibles (non of which are missable, hurray!)And finally, one does not simply write a review of this game without mentioning THE SOUNDTRACK
The music is so, so good! I find myself sitting and listening to the soundtrack of this game over and over again (including now as I'm writing this review)
So, what are you waiting for? JUST BUY THIS GAME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! You won't regret it!

												There are games you want to play and then there are games you have to play
 This is a game you have to play
 This is my first experience with the series, but being a huge fan of FFT, OB, and Xcom I have always wanted to give this a shot
Roughly 100 hours later, my S/O hates this game, my front lawn is a little over grown and I have a sink full of dishes
I still have a lot to do in the game but I think I can say without hesitation that this is the best tactical RPG I have ever played
At first I was worried about the geo panels making me feel like I had to play each fight a certain way, but most of the time you can just kill them and go about your business
The comedic story, beautiful sprites and endless game play make this one a real keeper
I can see myself playing this one for years to come
The only gripe is that you WILL need the strat guide AND gamefaqs to understand all the systems and mechanics in the game because, holy hell, are they neumerous and complex
A few hints to make your life better:Turn off Anti Aliasing if you get a multicolored rainbow line in the middle of your screen
Turn on Vsync if your screen is tearing
Leave the edge blur effects off
You can throw enemies onto geo prizims to 1 shot destory them
Dont worry about leveling up more than 4 or 5 characters your first time through the story
Do not mess around with the item world until you beat the game (unless you have to for the story)
Ditch your starter prinnies asap, and level a male fist user, a mage, healer, a theif, and male warrior  with your main characters these will all you need on your first play through
Do not worry about starting new characters with perfect stats or better versions of the class you currently have, you can restart them later as any new class and carry stats from their current level over as many times as you want (google transmigrating disgaea)
On first playthrough, angelic main character is the best one to ask the assembly for a healer and a mage because of next tip
Once a character creates another one at the assembly, it can learn all of their spells by standing beside the new character in battle and casting the new character\'s spell(s) 5 times; this works with all spells at all levels
Bribes in the dark assembly are cumulative, that is, the more you bribe, the higher your influence gets over time
The dark assembly can be entered and exited at no penalty to re roll influence for that session
Talk to your all of your castle's vassals in each chapter, they sometimes reward you

IF YOU ARE SEEING WEIRD GRAPHICAL ISSUES: Turn off SSAO and Depth of Field
This got rid of FPS, black line, and other odd graphical issues
There are also varying degrees of success by turning on/off VSYNC and the new textures
Try it out
Video for fixing these issues if you're having trouble finding them : https://youtu
be/hSIgtrwvFOYOverall: I've been playing the game for the last couple hours or so, and if you like Disgaea at all and want it on PC, then get this
I have found almost no issues with this port
I had to turn off SSAO and Field of Depth due to some weird graphical bugs, but outside of that

the game is running at 60 FPS, the new textures look great, and it's as fun as ever
If you want a JRPG with some funny quips, mildly different strategy combat and good story, then this is for you
Controls: Mouse and Keyboard work just fine, albeit a little wonky at times
Controller support is definitely here and works flawlessly
You can switch between the two at any time without switching options
Gameplay: The core gameplay is just that of any Disgaea; filled with plenty of leveling, story, items, characters, laughs and more
It's a basic strategy/tactical JRPG with some added in features like colored tiles that change the tide of battle when stepped on
Current cons/negatives: There are quite a few graphical issues as well as performance issues
I was personally able to resolve these issues as detailed above
Outside of that, the keyboard and mouse combo can be a little off at times
Some textures might be a little low-res compared to others
Currently playing, will update when more information is available

Disgaea is 13 years old by now, and I've played every version of it before
And by now(after it was being patched by NISA) I wholeheartedly recommend this version as well
If you are intersted in SRPGs like Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem or Tactics Ogre, then Disgaea might be up your alley
In fact, I believe its one of the best franchises of the genre, especially due to its endgame
Since this is the first title in the franchise(PC version is based on the PSP port), it is a bit dated in comparison to it's succesors, but it still features all the core mechanics that make the series great
And some of them are really unique
They're already featured on the store page but some of the most noteworthy are those: Item world - The item world is probably the most unique feature of them all
A randomly generated dungeon inside every item, which you can use to level the item up or change how certain items work
There are two basic mechanics in the item world
1)For every floor you clear, the item gains a level
It gets tougher the further you go
2) Every item has residents that change the item's stats if you subdue them
For example, a "Marksman" raises the item's HIT stat, a "Gladiator" raises it's strength, and so on
You can even combine and transfer residents between items, so there's a lot to do here, if you want to create the perfect item/weapon
Transmigration - The max lvl in Disgaea is 9999, and on top of that you can use transmigration, which is basically a "rebirth" of the character to the same, or another class
It's back to lvl1 but it'll be stronger when leveled up
This way you can build strong characters with lots of abilities
Geo Panels - GPs are colored areas in the field, which have different effects on characters standing on them(like 50% bonus exp
) You can change the effect or even remove the Geo Panel completely by picking up and throwing the crystal causing an effect to another place, or by destroying it
There's quite a lot to play around with here, especially in the item world, so these are just the very basics
So these are the three features I think are most important to mention
There's definitely more though(such as multiple endings and other unique gameplay mechanics
) The biggest draw for me though, is the over-the-top and comical story
This game does not take itself seriously
So if you're into any of that, give it a go
Even though Disgaea is often regarded as pretty "grindy", if you only want to clear the story, the grind isn't really that much if you focus on a core team
The real grind of Disgaea lays in the possibilites you have as a player
Be it strengthening an item, or turning it into a tool that suits you; be it transmigration or the mentor/pupil system
There's always something to do, if you want to
The PortEdit: Since release, NISA put in a good effort to patch the game
Not only did they root out the biggest problems, but they also added the bonus characters from the other versions of the game
Before, in this section I mentioned a lot of problems, but according to the patch notes and reports from people, they are now pretty much gone
A couple of people still report occasional crashes, but the main issues have been resolved
Other than that, the port doesn't feature any fancy settings
Just the options to switch between original and new textures, shadows, V-Sync, SSAOand a weird Depth of Field effect
No resolution options either, just fullscreen or windowed
They patched in bubonic filtering which is a nice addition
But thats pretty much it in terms of settings

												Please more disgaea ports?			
Posted: 26 February, 2016
												Performance issues are fixed by unsubscribing the Steam Client Beta!			
Posted: 23 June, 2016
												==Tech Stuff==Day 1, it was broken mess for many
Month later, it was getting better but there were still random crash here and there
Now today ( FOUR MONTH after the release ) , it's been fixed and it supposedly run without crashes
==Music Stuff==Probably the best point of the game
Music from NIS / Tenpei Sato are of excellent quality==Graph Stuff==10+ years ago, it was acceptable at best
nowadays, it's the kind of thing you'd expect from low budget indie game
While there has been a few enhancement here and there from the PSP version, it's still far from being up to nowadays standard==Scenario==Mostly comedy with some seriousness here and there
Decent but nothing exceptionnal to see here
==Gameplay Stuff==Basic is a good word for it
There's nothing exceptionnal here
If you played a more recent Disgaea game on PS3/4 or Vita, then you'll most likely find this installement horribly lackluster
==Replayability==Wholly depend wether you intend to grind for the post game or not
10 to 15 hours top are plenty enough to clear the storyline
Add 15 to 40 hours of stats/item grinding/leveling to defeat the last Ex Boss depending of wether you know what you're doing or not
==Overall==10+ years ago, this game was a solid hit and worth its price
Today, it's decent
Not exceptionnal since the system itself is badly primitive/poor/outdated , but it's decent
Give it a try during a sales period, you might enjoy it

												I'm still waiting for Disgaea 3 and 4 for PC,dood
But really,buy this game,it's really damn cool			
Posted: 2 March, 2016
												WOAH THEY FIXED THE GAME WOAH
After starting out with poor optimization on some PCs, even higher-end ones, NIS finally patched the game and it runs fine on my end! I've played through this game on the PSP release, and can definitely recommend it to lovers of tactical RPGs
It's filled with great dialogue and characters you will love

 Review For Valkyria Chronicles PC Review by : Joell Joelly & Meguca 2
0Pros- Great story
- Lovely anime art style
- Great voice acting
(English and Japanese)- Unique blend of real time and strategic gameplay
- Challenging
- Tons of management/upgrade options
Cons- Matches can take a long time
(not necessarily a con)- Frustrating menu system
- Enemy turns are not skippable, or able to be sped up
- Some 'strategic' choices have to be made without the necessary information
- No mouse support in menus
Review :Valkyria Chronicles is a largely story based, turn based strategy game
The story itself is extremely enjoyable, with well written characters and a compelling world
The story is set in the 1930s, in the continent of "Europa," with two super powers (The Imperial Alliance & The Atlantic Federation) who are at war with one another over a mineral called ''Ragnite'' which is used to power all technology in this world
The Imperial Alliance makes the decision to invade the small neutral country of Gallia during this conflict, because Gallia has a lot of the Ragnite under its soil
During the story you will follow Welkins (protagonist), Isara (Welkins's sister) and Alicia
 All 3 were just normal people living in Gallia, but were conscripted to defend Gallia upon the Imperial's invasion
The game features rich character development, or background information for both the main characters and for side characters
Every character has entries to read indicating their  backstory, strengths, weaknesses, people that they work well with, and more
This information helps to make each character feel more 'real,' and can give you a sense of connection to them, making things such as their deaths far more significant
The army is made up of both soldiers by profession, and by militia
As a result, there are people of all ages, races, genders, social standing, etc which causes some interesting interactions
In terms of gameplay, you control a relatively small squad in turn based strategy missions, somewhat comparable to XCOM Enemy Unknown
Each turn you get a limited number of 'command points' which you can use to move your units, make them attack, and a range of other things
When you use a command point on a unit, you take control of the unit and control them in real time
Enemies with a line of sight to your character will open fire if you are in range, you will need to aim and take your shots yourself, and so on
This makes the game feel like small segments of real-time action, limited by ammunition and by the number of command points you use
For a good rank at the end of a mission, you need to minimize the amount of commands that you use
This game features permadeath, so any character of yours which dies remains dead forever
There are limited story central characters who you will be required to keep alive, but the rest are expendable
The game starts off feeling rather easy, with limited options, but it opens up and increases in difficulty as you go
 This involves larger battles, more variety in your squad, leveling up unit types, researching upgrades for your army, taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of each unit, and so on
This allows for you to learn new mechanics slowly as they're introduced, rather than being overwhelmed at the start of the game
Along with the interesting story and the character development, this results in you becoming quite addictive, with you constantly wanting to try out new things
Additional information :This game was originally released in 2008 on the Playstation 3, but on the PS3 it was locked at 30FPS  and 720P Resolution
The PC version is a port, but was upgraded to 60FPS with HD resolution, remappable keybindings, adequate mouse and keyboard support, and anything else that you could need
An excellent port, which stands out amongst many sub-par ports in recent years
For the price of €19
99 it is quite worthwhile, especially since SEGA bundled all the DLC in to the PC Version for free (2 extra stories to play, and a hardmode for the main story)

												Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, the best port
The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008
The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP
I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014
That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more)
Sega has my attention and I will present this review
Valkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance
The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre
Does this game deserve your attention? The story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense)
Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite
Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources
One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received
The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others)
The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts
The character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist)
The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on)
Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war
Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game
The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story
The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”
The gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar)
Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money)
However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them)
With the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals
The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story
The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did)
The game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes
Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back)
Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative
There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story
PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank
There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them)
The game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay
This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view
The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well
I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales
The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal
Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization
I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3)
This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful

												I have played this game fully several times on the PS3 and feel it is one of the best turn-based, strategy RPGs of the last generation
This game is a must own
They have included full 16:9 resolution support (up to at least 4k I believe), japanese voices and monitor refresh rate matching FPS
Unfortunately the videos are PS3 quality but that is a small complaint for an amazing game
The story is based in an alternate history 1930's Europe where a mineral called ragnite is used to power vehicles and other items
You are members of the militia of the small, neutral country Gallia which is rich with ragnite and sandwiched between 2 superpowers
You are forced to defend and try to reclaim your country after one of these superpowers invades Gallia for its ragnite
The story is told through cell shaded cut scenes and missions and advances beyond this basic plot as time goes on
At the start of each mission you pick and place your team on the map and then are provided with command points at the start of each turn which allow you to take direct control of your units
You then move them throughout the map to achive your mission
The mix of strategy and third person controls works very well
Buy if you would like to see VC2 and VC3 (VC3 unfortunately has never had and english release) come to PC
9/10

												It’s hard to figure out where to even begin talking about Valkyria Chronicles; there’s so much to say
Sega’s brilliant take on turn-based tactics is one of my favorite games of the genre, but beyond that I think it’s a very important game
It’s important because the story touches on some of the darkest moments in human history – moments no other game has dared to touch – and does so in an intelligent and sensitive manner
It’s important because of the innovative ways in which it manages to systemize its characterization and themes
It’s important because it marks the last time that Sega put in the care and effort needed to make something unequivocally excellent
Fans of Japanese games have been let down time and again by PC releases, and when Sega announced that Valkyria Chronicles would be coming to steam we had every reason to expect a buggy, slapdash port
And that would have been a real shame, because with its sketchy watercolor aesthetic the PS3 version is one of the most enduringly beautiful games of the last generation
Fortunately, not only does the PC version of run at 60 frames per second in high definition with nary a hiccup, it also makes several significant enhancements to the original game’s effects
Even better, it condenses the PS3 version’s excruciating loading times to a fraction of a second
Valkyria Chronicles has a very dense narrative, but to sum it up it’s a steampunk fantasy take on World War II set on the fictional continent of Europa
Europa is embroiled in a conflict between two superpowers – the Atlantic Federation and the Imperial Alliance – over a miraculous mineral fuel called Ragnite
The small, neutral principality of Gallia is invaded by the Empire for their rich deposits of this precious resource
 The Empire is also running a campaign of extermination against the Darcsens, a race of pale-skinned, dark-haired people who have become scapegoats for the bulk of Europa’s ills
They kill them indiscriminately and even – here we get to the part of the war that no other game talks about – toss them into concentration camps and work them to death
It’s a little ridiculous that an anime fantasy game is the only AAA title in history with something to say about the Holocaust, but to this game’s immense credit it speaks with the care and respect such a sensitive topic deserves
Furthermore, it covers all of its subject matter with that same care
If Valkyria Chronicles can be said to have a single overarching theme, it’s that we are all human
The characters under your command, who together comprise Squad 7 of the Gallian Militia’s Third Regiment, are among the best-realized and most likeable characters in gaming history
Squad leader Welkin Gunther is a little socially awkward and obsessed with nature – a trait that sometimes gives him ingenious philosophical and strategic insights
Alicia Melchiott, his second-in-command, is steadfast, caring, and strong-willed
The way that her relationship with Welkin blossoms into romance over the course of the story is positively heartwarming
But the game doesn’t let us forget that there are people on every side of the conflict
Early scenes in the game which depict the Empire rolling through Welkin’s idyllic home town are framed almost as propaganda, but as the story unfurls we see more and more humanity in the enemy forces, and more evil outside the Empire
When the Federation gets involved in the conflict it causes no end of trouble, and some of the more officious ranking officers in Gallia’s own military pose as much of a threat as the enemy generals
Instead of seeing this conflict as it happens, we view it through the eyes of historian Irene Koller in her book “On the Gallian Front,” which covers the war from Squad 7’s perspective
Interestingly, Irene’s writing is a little biased, and the game leaves you to wonder how reliable a narrator she really is
Not only is this book a solid framing device for the game’s narrative, it also serves as its interface
A good interface and good story wouldn’t matter if the game itself was not good, and Valkyria Chronicles is great
On a surface level the game has a lot in common with XCOM
You take command of a military unit comprised of different classes – scouts, engineers, shocktroopers, snipers, lancers, and one tank – and take responsibility for their training as well as their mission performance
On the battlefield success is all about making strategic use of cover and positioning soldiers for the best shot or an effective ambush
In Valkyria Chronicles soldiers are always on “overwatch,” so they’ll automatically fire on any enemy that enters their range outside their own turn
If you’re smart you can set up ambushes on the enemy’s turn, taking soldiers down before they have a chance to attack and costing the computer an action in the process
Of course if you’re careless the same thing can happen to you
This dynamic makes each of your turns feel almost like an action game
Anyone who’s played XCOM knows how aggravating it can be to open fire on an alien with a 95% hit chance only to miss entirely
Valkyria Chronicles handles accuracy by putting a circle around your crosshairs representing margin of error, and on top of being more intuitive this creates a wider potential range for success and failure
Instead of assigning a binary hit/miss condition to an entire burst of gunfire, Valkyria calculates each shot individually, so even if you don’t hit enough times to take an enemy down you’ll probably take a chunk out of their health
Painstaking effort has gone into crafting every aspect of Valkyria Chronicles’ world
This comes across in obvious ways, like the pages upon pages of lore in the glossary that flesh out the setting’s ecology, cultures, and economy, but it also deeply informs the mission design
Every single level is full of little details that help to sell the reality of the world
This isn’t all that surprising considering that the same team created Skies of Arcadia but it’s appreciated nonetheless
Acting and sound design are just as great as the music
More strict fans of JRPGs will be happy to know that the game includes both English and Japanese voices, but this is one of the few games where the option doesn’t feel needed
 The performances for every member of the cast – including all 49 unique, non plot-essential members of Squad 7 – are of the same caliber as you’d expect from the core cast of an Atlus game
 Sound effects always make it clear what’s going on and where it’s happening, even if you can’t see it
The art style in Valkyria Chronicles isn’t just beautiful, it’s enduring
Valkyria Chronicles has aged remarkably well, and in a world where computer graphics advance every other month that’s quite an accomplishment
Another big contributing factor is the game’s animations, which are smooth and very well-crafted, conveying personality through subtle body-language and facial expressions while giving every object and character a correct sense of weight and presence in the world
In its music, writing, art and acting ,Valkyria Chronicles is brimming with the emotional potency to bring a man to tears
It would make an excellent movie if that were all it had going for it, but the story is told in a way that could only work in a video game, and built on a rock-solid framework of deep and challenging tactical gameplay
Valkyria Chronicles is a timeless classic, and this exceptional PC port only manages to improve upon it

												A port much deserved and actually kind of late which offers the player the ability to lead a squad into battle
If you've enjoyed squad based tactical games such as XCOM, The Fire Emblem Series, FF:Tactics and etc
you will no doubt enjoy this
It brings to the table a very interesting gimmick which allows the player to move their pawns in something called Action Mode
Action Mode puts the player in a third-person perspective control of the pawn allowing the to move them freely as if controlling a character in a third-person game
Despite this it still sticks to turn-based tactical game laws such as a limited amount of movement points and actions within a usage of a 'command Point'
You're offered these 'command points every turn and they can be saved up (there are also ways to get more from the beggining)
There are a large range of characters to add to your squad and it's a pretty large variety, not only in terms of classes but also specific personal traits that affects them on the battlefield(e
g
Pollen Allergy slowly decreases the HP of a character when standing on an are filled with plants; country born gives them more confidence when fighting in the country side; hatred of men discourages them when near male characters in your squad; and so many more)
They may also all be equipped with various uniforms and their weapons can be upgraded (but all weapons of that type are upgraded at the same time)
Armours adn uniforms too can be upgraded and your squad's tank may also be outfitted with new gear and upgrades
To take out needless hassle the game's level up system is class based
What I mean is that it levels up the entire class and all the characters of that class rather than you having to upgrade each and every one of them
This also means that you won't have to deal with new recruits being underleveled once you've progressed far into the story
To get extra money and experience points when you feel underleveled in the plot missions the game also offers you the option to do skirmishes
Skirmishes are missions that are not attached to the plot and can be done and repeated any time at a difficulty set by the player (soldiers that die in skirmishes will also be out forever just like in story missions so you might want to be careful)
The plot is definitely quite interesting and takes a lot of inspiration from our world's second world war, covering topics such as life during war time, desire for resources and even racism
I won't talk too much about the plot since I'm still going through it and it's usually more interesting to head in knowing as little as possible
I might return to this review and edit it later on once I've completed the game but from waht I've experienced so far I do not regret buying this at all and wish to see more titles like this be brought to the PC platform in the future
