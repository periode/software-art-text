SECOND PARAGRAPH
I traveled to your silence.
It felt as pale as the grey ocean waves.
I fell where life could no longer be found.
And I sailed without feeling alive.

RANDOM PARAGRAPH
I traveled to your yakety-yak.
It felt as exceptionalistic as the countryside Indian waves.
I fell where bounce could no longer be found.
And I sailed without feeling opinionative.
