["Here's the problem:\nFind the extreme values of f on the region described by the inequality g\nf(x, y) = x2 + y2 + 4x - 4y\ng(x, y) = x2 + y2 \u2264 9\nWhat I've done so far:\nI solved for the partial derivatives of both f and g, getting the following,\nfx(x,y) = 2x + 4\nfy(x,y) = 2y - 4\ngx(x,y) = 2x\ngy(x,y) = 2y\nSo, using the Lagrange method, I've set up the following system of equations:\n2x + 4 = \u03bb2x\n2y - 4 = \u03bb2y\nx2 + y2 \u2264 9\nBy setting \u03bb = 0, I've come up with this critical point: (-2, 2).\nUsing the 2nd Derivative test, I've determined it to be an absolute minimum with a value of f(-2, 2) = -8.\nI figure this is acceptable because plugging that into the inequality g(x, y), I get 8 which is less than 9.\nHowever, I'm not sure I did this correctly. In other similar problems in class, we've set up the third equation in the system by making x2 + y2 = 9, not as an inequality. This makes me think that there may be more critical points on the boundary g that I haven't found yet. \nOverall, this is a tough problem for me. Even worse, the solution isn't in the back of my textbook so I'm not sure if I'm correct or not. Any help is appreciated, thanks!", "However, I'm not sure I did this correctly.

This makes me think that there may be more critical points on the boundary g that I haven't found yet.\n\nVery well-spotted. The Lagrange Multiplier method fails to work when your equation is an inequality, though in that case you can just use the critical points since you'll be looking at the extreme points in a region of the plane.\nSo now you also need to find the minima/maxima for the problem when restricted to the boundary of g. It does, after all, ask for the extreme values of f, not just the minimum value of f.", "Ok, so I've solved the first two equations for x and y in terms of \u03bb, and came up with the following:\nx = 2/(\u03bb-1)\ny = -2/(\u03bb-1)\nBy plugging these into the constraint function g, I have found that:\n8/(\u03bb2 - 2\u03bb + 1) = 9\nBy reworking this equation, I came up with:\n\u03bb2 - 2\u03bb + (1/9) = 0\nHowever, I am having trouble solving this for \u03bb, as this class is a no-calculator course. This makes me think there is a better way to solve for \u03bb, but I'm not quite sure how.", "However, I am having trouble solving this for \u03bb, as this class is a no-calculator course.\n\nNote that 8/(\u03bb2 - 2\u03bb + 1) = 9 implies that (\u03bb-1)2 = 8/9. Feel free to leave a surd in your answer.", "Ok, so using that, I have found that \u03bb = ((2 * sqrt(2))/3) + 1.\nPlugging that back into the first two equations, I get x = 3/(sqrt(2)), and y = -3/(sqrt(2)). Then, plugging this point into f(x,y), I get an answer of 9 + 24/(sqrt(2)). This would be the absolute maximum value. But, since (-2, 2) satisfies the boundaries, would that still be the absolute minimum?\nIn other words, when I do these kinds of problems, should I initially solve for the first two equations for x and y and check that the point is on the constraint? Then, compare that answer to the critical points found on the restraint? Thanks", "\u03bb = ((2 * sqrt(2))/3) + 1.\n\nYou forgot about the other solution!\n\nBut, since (-2, 2) satisfies the boundaries, would that still be the absolute minimum?\n\nWell, assuming that the other solution doesn't change things, yes."]
