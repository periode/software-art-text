 Hell, even if you hate the game to bits and want to kill everyone, buy the game, do so, and at least have your own personal experience before refunding it
(Mostly spoiler-free review)I hate turn-based RPGs
 I hate one-life mode :))
I hate myself forever
 The only thing i hate about this game is the poor CV for certain supporting characters and not all the characters got their voice
 Fast paced, colorful and sometimes hard to keep track of yourself, AAC toes the line of making you hate your friends and having a genuine good time because, while one person cannot finis hthe co-op version of the levels alone, having that one guy (me) who is not as good as the rest does not doom you to failure
 No matter how much they hate you, they will bury the hatchet
 Probably gonna get a lot of hate for this one - please note it's just my opinion
EDIT: I was wrong about it being the next Undertale but people hate it anyway so whatever
