I have always hesitated to use live wallpaper applications since they used to be very performance-draining
 When researching for perfomance-tests of "Wallpaper Engine" I didn't quite find a review that was useful for me so i decided to get the software and test it myself
 It should be noted that this review will ignore other apsects such as the content of the software
Hardware Specs: CPU
i5 6400 (no overclock with BCLK)CPU cooler
AIO watercooling loop from NZXTGPU
GTX 980TI (MSI - no manual overclock)RAM
16GB DDR4 (GSkill - 2133MHz - dual kit)Motherboard
ASUS ROG Maximus VIII RangerSSD
Samsung 850 Evo (Only for OS, Steam and apps on HDD)OS
Windows 10 ProfessionalTest: The software (run in non 64-bit mode) will be tested in two scenarios
 Arsenal wallpaper will be used for all tests
1) Hardware usage will be observed while the System sits idle for 10 minutes without any other applications running in the background
 The tool for HW monitoring is "OpenHardwareMonitor"
 This testing scenario will be repeated for the wallpaper presets Low, Medium and High and a standard windows desktop background as reference

GPUMemoryUse 180MB 185MB 230MB 260MB Furthermore the RAM usage has been tested, but did not show measureable differences
Ram usage was always at about 2
2GB
2) This test will show the impact on gaming performance
 Again, Arsenal wallpaper is used, this time on preset High
 As there are different options to choose, which define how the wallpaper will react to an application being run in fullscreen (Keep Running, Stop, Pause) a benchmark will be done for every mode and as reference with a standard windows desktop background
I chose the Benchmark Scene from Rainbow Six Siege with the graphics on ultra preset
 Here are the results: FPS in RB6-Benchmark
RB6S MinFPS AvgFPS MaxFPS
None 102 173 327
Stop 93 172 264
Pause 100 172 296
Keep Running 58 171 299 Conclusion: As we have been able to see, there are slight differences in terms of hardware usage
 I was surprised that the software did much better than expected, but the results may differ, considering community-made wallpapers may use more resources
 The CPU temperature values may not be very reliable due to the CPU being watercooled thus these values are at the very low end of the scale
 Wallpaper Engine does also have an impact on gaming performance, which can be kept to a minimum using the "Pause" or "Stop" behaviour for fullscreen applications
With a hardware config as "enthusiast" as mine, i doubt that there will be serious performance issues with this application, but if you are gaming on a much weaker rig, i recommend turning down the settings of the live wallpapers a bit
 At the end of the day, you will have to decide yourself wether you want to sacrifice resources for cool a$$ (a$$ can be taken literally) wallpapers or not
I do not regret my 4 bucks on this software and will be using it from now on

Early Access Review
I purchased this software hoping it would return the same functionality Dream Scene (Live Wallaper) did in Windows Vista that was later removed for performance issues
 The truth is this software is what Dream Scene should have been and is far more complex and configurable then the official feature ever was
 I did a full review of this software at http://barnnerd
com that will be published on 3/9/2017 at 6AM PST
I am in no way affiliated with the company that makes this program and purchased the program for full price from Steam after discovering it
 I would however love it if the author of this program contacted me as I would love to speak to him/her about some other features moving forward since I come from a software development background myself

This is basically a 1:1 port of the PS4 game, with all patches, DLCs and add-ons (which all add their impressive share of post-main story content)
SAO:HR follows a different continuity from the anime's canon
 See below
What I likeThe combat system is reactive, and actually gets better with time
There is a lot of content, even and especially once you clear the main story
It's in English AND it's voiced
 I am a simple man
You can party with and customize pretty much everybody, and you can influence a character's AI and actions through the feelings system
The cast is great and well-rounded
What I don't likeThe PC port is passable
 I hope you have a controller
 See a port review below
The game might seem too easy until you finish the main story
 It gets much harder when you hit Warriors of the Sky and Abyss of the Shrine Maiden
There's a lot of information, sometimes dumped all on you at once (especially post-main story)
 Fortunately, the game provides a means to re-read the tutorials as much as you want
It's a MMO-like: there's only one save, and most events aren't replayable (some of them are)
 It's not as bad on PC since you can copy-paste your save directory, but still
At some points, the translated text is completely replaced without keeping the original intent and meaning, failing at both translation and localization
 It's still better than what we got in Hollow Fragment
The affinity/affection system is a chore, as in all Aquria games before
 Exacerbated by the translation: the english text sometimes invites you to say Yes when you should have, in fact, said No
Regarding the portPC key bindings aren't ideal; this game was made and is still made for controllers
 You're going to be very frustrated if you use a keyboard
Borderless window resolution is locked, and windowed mode manages not to work with Borderless Gaming
 Full screen works as expected, however
Performance is okay
 Loading times are abysmal (same as PS4, really), but I haven't tried on a SSD yet
Gameverse continuity detailsSAO: Hollow Realization is a sequel to Infinity Moment, Hollow Fragment and Lost Song, all of which follow a different continuity from the anime series, and aren't ported to PC at time of writing
There are a lot of new characters and differences, including:Kirito did not defeat Heathcliff on floor 75 and abort SAO early: Heathcliff was defeated on floor 100 as the final boss, like he initially planned
 (Infinity Moment)Leafa, Sinon, Yuuki all join the SAO death game, for various reasons
 (Infinity Moment, Hollow Fragment)Strea, a MHCP like Yui, joins the gang after having her own arc
 (Infinity Moment)Philia, a self-proclaimed trasure hunter stuck in a closed-off dimension of SAO, met and was subsequently freed by Kirito
 (Hollow Fragment)Rain and Seven, idols in real life and in-game respectively, join the team
 In ALO, Rain saved Seven after Seven attempted to absorb everybody else, posing as the final boss
 (Lost Song)Hollow Realization also includes other characters that are technically part of the SAO universe, but not portrayed in the anime:Kizmel, a NPC close to Asuna and Kirito, from SAO: Progressive (manga and LN)Argo, an intel expert
 She's briefly seen in the anime, but has a somewhat larger role in the games
Alice and Eugeo, characters from Project Alicization, which follow the SAO light novel canon after Mother's Rosario
 Anime adaptation (SAO S3) in 2018
The SAO arc was covered in Infinity Moment and Hollow Fragment, and the ALO arc in Lost Song
The GGO arc did not happen yet but will in SAO: Fatal Bullet (2018), which follows this continuity
 Most of Sinon's backstory was already covered in Sinon's quests, howerer
Closing wordsConsole-exclusive ports are getting less and less bad, but there is still a ways to go
 It's nice to see Japanese console developers trying to get on the PC scene, but when it comes to port quality, BNEI/NBGI and partners are still lagging behind other publishers like Square-Enix
SAO:HR is by no means a triple A, and does have a substantial amount of fanservice, but it has way too much work and content behind it for me to classify it as a bad or fanservice-only game
I recommend it to people who:like the SAO universedon't mind heavy-handed fanservicelike visual novels or VN-style events, because there are a lot of thoseThe game has a fully-featured multiplayer mode, with PVP duels and mission/combat cooperation, which I will not review since I have no friends the game can be played solo in its entirety
Review revisions and erratumI originally posted that controllers do not work outside Big Picture mode
 That was false
 It does however need to be properly configured within Steam

 This is only true for the Warriors of the Sky part
 Warriors of the Sky was a game update that leads to Abyss of the Shrine Maiden, and Abyss of the Shrine Maiden is a DLC that is properly voiced

After already 30 hours of gameplay non stop + streaming it, this is what I'm about to say
First of all, I'm a huge fan of bandai namco jrpg games
 Mostly been a huge fan of tales and god eater games and some other naruto game that are hack'n'slash one
I haven't bought any SAO games in my vita, so I only try AW vs SAO and SAO:HR on steam
Pros :- I love how every SAO game aren't 100% the same mechanism with the other SAO games
 The game isn't like the previous one that is available on steam, is not like an hack'n'slash only, but they try to make like some kind of a MMO game
 - The feel of being like playing with real players
 Since they try to create something that ressemble like a real MMO, is pretty impressive that you feel like you're in one even thought you're just playing the singleplayer for the story
 If you get into the game+story like I do, you can threat other npc players as if they were real players
 You'll see many in town, and also in area, you'll see them fight in group
 Of course is not perfect, you can't really choose a topic you want to talk to since they are just AI
 But you can interact with them, and while interacting with them more and more, you can create some kind of bond like a real MMO, that's how you make friend
- Big and interesting story, like many of bandai namco games such as the tales series, god eater, and even other SAO, you can guarantee that you'll have tons of hours before completing the story (unless you skip the dialogue)- Good amount of customization for your character, some people will say there isn't enough, but I find it pretty cool
 Plus, your clothes change depending on the armor you put
 Sadly sometimes you will feel that the armor name just don't fit on how it look xD
- Japanese voice, I know there is a huge debate in the anime about dub vs sub, both have their advantage, and everyone can have their own preference
 In my case, I love the japanese voicing more, which you have here
 Is not like many JRPG that you just read
read
read
with some few sound like : "ah", "eh", "oh"
 But you actually hear the character speak, which is something I really enjoy from the tales and god eater games
 Since I'm not a big reader, just listening to the voice/reaction and reading the translate, it feel like watching an anime in subs, way more enjoyable then just reading
- Amazing map, as expected from bandai namco games
 Map pretty detail for a JRPG
 Of course is not comparable to many shooter game that require high graphic such as destiny 2 that just came out with amazing view/map, but for a JRPG, I'd say is pretty amazing
 The details on a rock or jumping between branch, you don't feel like much invisible wall
 Of course there will be some invisble wall, like an island surrounded by water, they won't let you start walking on water or swimming for 1 hours non stop
 If you play AW vs SAO, you'll see that the map is gigantic, amazing flight range, you can fly anywhere in one area, the only invisible wall are like the edge of an area
 While in many other game even in some online MMO, you'll feel invisible wall while trying to jump on a rock where your character jump higher then the height of the rock
but you'll slide straight down @
@
which doesn't happen in SAO:HR, where you can jump on every rock, even the one stick on wall as long as your jump is higher then the rock height
Cons :- Not for players that will just skip the story
 If you don't care about the story happening in SAO:HR and just want to play the game and kill monster
 I probably won't suggest this game for you
 Unlike AW vs SAO where the flight system is something really impressive and smooth compare to many other games, in this game, it will be your average killing mobs and visiting place where you can do in many other MMO or other games
- Not being use to control (since I suppose most people will be using a controller to play this game), the control can be pretty weird at first due to it not being your average hack'n'slash jrpg, but they try to make some kind of MMO
 I use a controller to play this game, and usually MMO are being play with a keyboard and mouse on keyboard
 Some that play MMO with a controller might be more at ease when they first start this game
 On keyboard you have a lots of button which you can set all kind of skills, while on a controller you have to hold button (which is not new) to do some kind of skill, but mostly the select button open you a bar of hotkey
 Now this is where it get a bit rough
 In some JRPG game, we use select a lots in the middle of a battle of course, like god eater where you need to use select to use healing or bullet change
 But in this game, since an MMO usually have a lots of skill, mostly when you advance on class, in here you can have all kind of skill, and there isn't enough button on a controller, so you might be force to press select for other skill + buff + potion
- Create your kirito
 The cool thing about most of bandai namco JRPG, is that there is voice with the character instead of just reading and hearing some few sound from your character
 The problem here is that, unlike AW vs SAO where you actually see the story of Kirito and his friends, and you can control any premade character, in this game you will be able to custom your character (which should be a pro)
 The thing is you will be kirito, that mean you will be the hero of the story of course
 I'm a girl, so I created a girl character, but in the story, your character will be speaking as kirito, so you'll have a man voice which can be kinda weird xD
 - Bad translate, if you understand at least a few decent word in japanese, you'll notice there is many mistake in the translate, including grammar or some few typo
 Question I've receive that isn't part of my pros and con:Q : Is the game worth the price
A : I'd say yes, I heard the game deluxe edition was 80$ when it first came out, of course is cheaper now since this game been 1 year old
 I always buy most of bandai game in full price, mostly because I'm a huge fan and I would love to see more of their game being imported in the western
 It really depend on you if you want to buy it in full price or on sales, afterall steam sale happen pretty often
 I buy it full price to support the compagny, and because how big the game is compare to many other games, you can see that they put tons of work into it
Q : Would you recommend this game for someone that never try a JRPG
A : Probably not SAO : HR to start with due to the fight mechanism being really different then many JRPG, I'll probably suggest to start with the tales one, or AW vs SAO, due to the flight system being really smooth and easy to control even while fighting
Q : If we don't like the anime, will we enjoy the game
A : To be fair, is kinda a hard question, I wouldn't say : because you don't like SAO you won't like any other thing related to SAO
 Just like god eater, I started from the game, I was a huge huge huge, a REALLY big fan of god eater, I'm also greatfull I got the chance to meet the creator of god eater as well (THANK YOU BANDAI), but the anime
The anime wasn't as enjoyable as I expected
 I loved the character in the game, and I loved the small anime special "God eater prologue" that came before God eater the anime
 For SAO, it might be the same thing, just like people loving the VN but hating the anime (but that mostly due to poor adaptation)
 If you love JRPG game, but dislike the anime, you can always try the SAO games, there no harm, except only harming your wallet depending when you buy it
 But I find the game more enjoyable due to me liking the anime + movie + character
 But SAO game are mostly story focus, unlike naruto fighting game, you don't need to watch naruto to enjoy playing a naruto fighting game
 You'll probably put more time into the story in SAO games, so if you didn't enjoy the anime/LN, there is a huge chance you might not like the story in the game as well
Posted: 29 October
After some hours of playing I am ready to write my review
Some may dislike the game mainly because it's SAO
 I do agree that if you don't like SAO to some degree you might not enjoy it AS much
The game runs fairly well; I have terrible specs for now generation's games and I can play this game perfectly fine
My primary specs are: I3 Core, GTX 645, 6GB Ram
I am running the game at 40fps (I haven't touched the settings since installed)Assuming most people reading this have way better specs than me since I've had my pc for like 7 years, you should be able to run the game well if that is one of the reasons you are reading reviews
The story is quite fascinating and it's not a game you can complete within a couple of hours which makes it enjoyable to grind
There are apparently a lot of people having issues with using controllers so that there is a con
I am using keyboard
The character creation isn't really good since it's very limited but I managed to create a fairly easy char that resembles Kiyotaka from COTE
(I'm going to update my review after further progession and understanding)
Posted: 3 November
Have you ever wanted to swing your weapons around for countless hours, possibly the rest of your life
Do you enjoy seducing other women, including your cousin, while in a relationship
This is the game for you
Posted: 1 November
Guys, the "exit" button has disappeared, I don't know what to do =\\\
Posted: 6 November
First of all, I'm a fan of the SAO stories (Read the books and watched the anime), however, this is the first game I've played of the series (Mostly because I don't own any consoles atm)
 The story is similar but it does goes on a tangent and follows it's own series of events
The story in the books/anime has many faults in terms of game mechanics, being a gamer myself it annoys me once I get out of the 'let's enjoy this story' and into 'game mode'
This game has some really good things, and some really bad ones
 Just like the story in the books, it leads me to believe that whoever designed it is not a gamer themselves
Good Aspects1
 The world
 They made a very believable MMO setting with NPCs acting like players would in the field and in town
2
 Unique NPCs
 You'll see them in town and in the field
 You can befriend them and eventually take them with you to the field or date them, etc
3
 Quest Board
 A good way of making Col (Currency) and getting some extra XP
 Hunting quests, boss quests, mob drops quests (which come mostly from the Unique NPCs and help towards befriending them)
3
 The Sword Art system
 The active abilities are fun to combine in combat to use your combos and enhance your own playstyle
 Use a weapon (sword, dagger, axe, etc
) to raise your skill level with it, which will give you access to new arts and buffs that you can learn by spending skill points
4
 Multiplayer
 Is very simplistic
 Play with friends or strangers to grind for gear or levels
Grivances1
 NPC quests
 They are monotonous once you start getting a lot of them
 You pick them and then have to confirm every single one of them, even if they are 150+
 Is very annoying
 QoL (Quality of Life) would be to have a way to pick them and turn them in in-bulk
 2
 Buffs/Debuff Skills
 I rather have smaller buffs or debuffs turned into passive skills or reactive skills
 Than having to buff myself every 30 seconds
 And also they become completely useless towards end game
 As passives/reactives they wouldn't become as useless
3
 Controls
 Gamepads don't work well at the moment
 At least I couldn't get mine to work
 It took me a few hours, but I got used to using mouse + keyboard
 I don't think I'll use a gamepad even if they fix the issues at this point
 Another thing, with so many keys, there is no need for toggle keys
 It should be Optional, not enforced
4
 Difficulty
 It starts good and challenging, but it doesn't scale well
 I got to a point around lvl 20+ when I could one shot trash that should be my level, world bosses (the lvl95 and above) were beaten with ease, and Zone Boses were done in under a minute
 I went into the multiplayer at around lvl 30+ on Nightmare difficulty
 they should rename it 'Stroll through the Park' difficulty
 Bosses do decent damage, they just need to be more spongey
Overall is a fun game, even with the grivances I have with it
 However, it also is a niche game
 Is not for everyone
I'm not done with it, I'll continue until I finish it
Posted: 28 October
Sword Art Online : Hollow Realization Deluxe editionComes with the season pass and all DLC
Character creation, create the avatar of kirito, even if its male or female
You can change the name, hair, eyes etc
Huge world to explore, fanservice, Lots of quests, Boss raid battles, All in a singleplayer experience
Enough skills to unlock to keep you bussy or
hours, enough armors to find, weapons to try etc
There is co-op and pvp
 You can replay almost every quest
60+fps, looks good, plays like a Jrpg, VN style conversations
If you have controller problems -> go to steam Big picture mode and select controller configuration
Check all the boxes from ps4 to xbox input -> restart steam
 and voila, controller will now work
Its a great game for Jrpg/MMO style gamepley/Sao fans
It has a little bit of everything, and i really like the world that is crafted so far
Enjoy the game, LINK START 
Sorry for the bad english

Pros:+Solid port runs 4k 60fps (even in town which was locked only to 30fps on console) +Great story and full of side events represented in visual novel style+Nice Soundtracks+Many things to do +Combat is greatCons:- Controller configuration problemOverall:9
5/10Update:After playing 60h+End game content is big and it has it's own storyi noticed some bugs in game like:-Your character get stuck sometimes and cannot move (Seriously
 you'll be forced to exit)-The game does freeze during loading or when you switch back to the game after using another app

My bf and I purchased this game with the intention of playing it multiplayer, only to be extremely disappointed that the multiplayer is only for fighting boss battles, not actually playing the game
 The story is also pretty uninspired and just feels like their only goal is to beat you over the head with nostalgia
 They really just need to make SAO into a real MMO
Posted: 5 June
So I have bought this game on 05/25/17 and have been only playing this game till 06/04/2017 with an accumulate of 139 hours
Update: 06/22/2017 accumulated about 235 hours and I have payed a month of my Subscription :)
 I am reupdating this for the Summer Sale for people who want to try this game and also for the StormBlood DLC update
 Positive:-Noob Friendly-Tons of content (heavensword content might be needed if u want to max to 60)-Chocobo-The godlike music-Multiple classes to choose from
-The community seems better than most MMO'S that I have played
-New DLC for more new content
-Heavily Story relient
 Most mmos have faied to make a decent story line but this game manged to pull it off
-Fun with friends
-Options to change your HUD settings
-Dungeons/Trials/Raids
 Probably the best thing in this MMO with each bosses being unique and it does require everyone to cooperate
Update: Graphics: Even with a Low end PC you can still run this game smoothly
 For Medium-High End PC the game looks gorgeous from Cutscenes to the most simplest flower it looks amazing
Free Companies: Aka guilds- If you can find a dedicated Company you can obtain tons of benefits and some can help you run dungeons
 (Just joined one so not much info there)Enternal Bondings:
So there is something called the enternal bonding (sorry if I am saying it wrong)
 Which are marriages
 With an actual Wedding
Why not lol
 Not fully detailed about this but I find it kinda suprising to have in an MMO bc this is the first I have heard about in an MMO
Fates: Open World Events that can award you EXP if you can find a good amount of people to run with
 (Gotten popular since a StormBlood Update)]-Tons of Mini games that can let you obtain costumes/mounts and cards for tripletriad(Similar to Gwent)Gear: Pretty easy to obtain high end gear that can be obtained from Raids and other methods
 Also Relic/Anima Weapons (aka legendary weapons) for a specified class that could take you probably days to weeks to obtain the highest stat
(Looks pretty cool)Classes: Not sure if I was specific with classes in this game, You will have a single character with multiple classes to change into
 There are 9 DPS,,3 Tanks,3Healers, 7 Crafters, and a class to obtain ores/fishing
 This helps prevent anylack of endgame content
 And they can be all maxed out to lv 70
Negative:- Past 50+ the story just feels somewhat dreadfully long, It's mostly for you to unlock more dungeons and trials (bosses), But the story starts to take a much better turn after 
-Targeting system when your in a 24 vs 24 vs 24 PvP Match
 (still figuring out how to fix/improve on that) update:
Targeting is difficult because being able to just find the target you want to click will end up clicking your own teamate
 Even the random targeting system is random sometimes not sure how it works
 (still figuring it out)
Update: Ok its pretty difficult for me to even find any negatives in this game
 It doesn't mean its flawless
-lv 1-40: This could drop off alot of people playing this game from probably the story or the amount of content unavailable until you reach lv 50
Neutral:-Monthly Payment: Even I didn't know about this but, It is possible to pay your monthly subscription with Steam Credits
 And yes you can pay through steam if you have purchased the game from steam and its connected to your final fantasy account
 There is constant update and content just given through this game so I can see why its monthly and I can say its worth it
-Servers, I don't really have any problem with this but if your in an empty server and your asking for help, it might be difficult for you
 So its better to do some research
 You will que up with other people in different servers if your doing dungeons or any other instances
Also a paywall if your planning to transfer servers with your character
-Leveling: Took me about maybe 50-70 hour just to max out 1 of my classes to lv 50 then an additional 12-18 hours to max out to 60
 I don't have any problems with this but sometimes I felt that the gap between 50-60 just makes you want to murder your own chocobo
 But its generally worth it if you reach end game
-The story: This is probably the most important
 The story took me about approximetly 2-4 days just from the standard edition
 I haven't finished Heavensward and that took me about another 2-3 days just to finish 60%
 The point being is that YOU will feel rushed and proably feel like skipping cutscenes,texts and other moments in the story
 The cutscenes are amazing and the story is good but It felt like the mistake being is that I rushed it just to reach end game
 The story could probably take you a month or 2 if your mostly on and half the time
 Which is good
Update:-Queue times: This just happened at the Launch of stormblood probably because the amount of Players switching from Tank to DPS
 Of crouse it isn't an issue if you are either a healer/tank or if your group at least one of the 2
 The Queue times could sometimes average around 20-30 minutes
 (Square Enix might plan to fix this issue so this might not be an issue later on
)-Pricing: Not going too complain but for most people they might be stingy about this, If your planning to buy this game I would extremely suggest you to get the complete edition for the standard and stormblood(comes with heavensward) that will be about 55-60$
 Reason is because if you were to buy this game individually (like I did) your going to pay more
Free trial: I want to suggest you to play on the free trial before starting this off but it feels like its going to be difficult to get into until you reach the first dungeon trial at 20
 I want people more people to play this game but some of my friends dropped from the free
trial probably because they didn't have any dedicated commitment from leveling 1-19
 The Free Trial is capped at lv 30 but I get the feeling you still won't be able to experience all the features in this game
 But you can max out to 30 before purchasing the game
Updated:I am probably missing out more information about this game than I am right now but majority of it is positive
This game is highly underated and I wish that people would at least try the game at see the amount of potential this game has
 To be honest this game feels like what WoW became popularr when Wrath of the Litch King was released
(Not a hate rant)
 This game feels like it has more content than GW2 endgame
 Both are amazing MMO's but, Final Fantasy 14 feels like the MMO that I was missing in my life
 If Square Enix keeps up the constant updates I am willing to keep playing
Rating: 10/10

Ruined my life
 Five stars
Posted: 19 October, 2014
I've lost control of my life
Posted: 18 November, 2014
I gave up WoW (or World of Warcraft) For this game
 Why
 You only need one character to play every class
 The classes build off of eachother to add diversity to your play style as well as to upgade into more role focused jobs
 You can craft your own gear, you can make your own food and you can play 90% of the game ALL BY YOURSELF
 You don't have to be in a guild or part of a click
 The people who play this game are shockingly friendly and supportive
 Dungeons are part of a finder in game
 The story line is epic and the cinematics are breathtakeing
 The opening video almost had me in tears just because I knew what was happening without any words
 Square has really outdone themselves with this title and I can't wait to see how they wow me with FFXV
Edit: As per a commented question, The sub options come in 30/90/180 day increments and can be set up as recurring (thanks Pasty858)
 180 days is roughly $78
Also, anyone who would like to share in the recruit a friend benefits, message me
SO
 Its been a while since I've played
 after logging over 200 hours that weren't counted on here, and doing everything short of Savage content, I have to say that I never thought I would play a game that would tug my heart strings so much again
 But this game
 The most recent MSQ line just keeps the punches coming
 It was amazing
 If you love FF games, you must give this one at least a one month (or 14day) trial period

its ok

9/10 - Would Manderville again
This review was written based on version 3
0Pros:Consistent, large patches about every 3 months
Gorgeous graphics engine
 Deep crafting system
Probably the best storytelling in an MMO I've ever seen (but it does take 30+ hour to really get into the meat of it)One of the most friendly gaming communities around
Cross-platform play with the PS3 and PS4, excellent controller support for PC
Possible to play casually and still enjoy/experience the game with hardcore friends
Hildebrand - Game doesn't take itself too seriously and just has fun
Neutral:Game doesn't reinvent the MMO wheel
 It is a pretty standard "theme park" MMO
 That being said, it is extremely polished and everything in the game is executed very well
Subscription model, I was almost tempted to put this in the Pros column
 One of the few games to do this model well in a sea of F2P MMOs
Cons:Tens of hours of monotonous fetch quests sprinkled throughout the game
 Usual MMO fare
Long PvP queues, slightly unbalanced
 (Not enough people play PvP)Endgame content can be very grindy at times
 (Ex: Relic Weapons, and "Run the same 2 dungeons over and over to get currency to buy gear"
)Gil sellers - I realize this happens in pretty much every MMO
 This didn't make the list because it happens, it is strictly on the list because of advertising chat spam
 On an average day you will see a lot of messages (unless you're like me and are so fed up with it you go /away)
 Expect the spam to be cranked up to 11 whenever a large piece of content is released
 I really feel SE could implement better countermeasures with respect to advertising
 It does seem worse than in many of it's other AAA MMO competitors
 On a side note, I'm told the JP servers are practically gil seller free
 I've never tested this myself however
 Overall, not a huge con, but an annoyance none the less
 
Posted: 19 January, 2015
I've never been an MMO player
 Briefly played Tera - liked it but found progression slow - and briefly WoW - disliked the combat, just felt like button mashing
 I also played Mabinogi for a short while and really disliked the game's mechanics
 One day I felt the urge to play one and I knew a friend was planning to start this so I bought it but neither of us started
 9 days ago a friend of mine was looking for people who wanted to start and I decided that if it was in my steam list I may as well try it out
 I am now 95
9 hours in according to steam and I love it
 I've just hit level 50 and got my Paladin armour and I'm still looking at all the content coming up
 As I speak server is going down to patch even more content into the game
 So here's the detailed review:StoryThe story is a good one as far as MMOs go (based on my limited experience)
 I'd equate it to WoW in some ways as FFXIV builds off of an already established lore but is still extremely easy for new players to get into
 I don't want to say much about it but Square Enix really put work into making a good story
 It teeters a bit at times, especially around the middle (lv30-40 is a bit slow) but it's very enjoyable if you get into it
ClassesCombat classes are fairly traditional: tank, support, ranged DPS and melee DPS
 Still within these wider definitions, each individual class is fairly unique
 To add to this you are not restricted to the classes that you pick at the beginning of the game
 You will unlock the ability to train any and all classses as you wish which allows for a lot of flexibility
 But "Oh, the grind ¬¬" you say
 Nope, all classes trained beyond the first receive exp gain bonuses which really speeds up the process
 This is alongside the quick levelling options which I'll discuss in a later section
 There's more though
 All combat classses have a progression called a "Job" which is earned by reaching a certain point in the story, getting a class to lv30 and the corresponding second class to lv15, and then finishing the job quest
 It's actually really easy to do and it encourages you to try a different role
All combat classes are unique and don't overlap much at all which is great
As for crafting classes, there's a fair few of them and I have limited experience of them right now but crafting itself isn't just sit there and wait for things to appear
 There's an active process and is fairly enjoyable
 Just like the combat classes, new skills are unlocked and it becomes a sort of strategic minigame
 Quick synthesis for bulk items is available as well so you don't have to do it for each item
Still I can see crafting becoming tedious
 repetitive and boring at some point but that's no different from any other mmo
 Also, unlike the combat classes, the crafting classes aren't really unique
CombatThe combat system is targetted, which honestly I was sceptical about when first going in as I'm not a big fan of targetted combat but it grows on you
 This is mostly to do with how the game feels since you really have to think about movement, positioning, skill orders, skill timing etc
 from more or less the beginning of the game
 This is a big deal and playing the first 20 or so levels in WoW feels boring and just mashing buttons in a certain order
 The 2
5sec global cooldown adds to the strategic element of it too
 You have more time to think and decide what move would be appropriate, but you also have a longer window to be punished for choosing the wrong skill
 I honestly think this is way more fun and interesting compared to other games with a much smaller global cooldown
Another important point is that this game is very controller friendly
 It's on the PS3/PS4 with cross platform support so that would be why
 I personally play with a controller and it feels very smooth
 I don't feel too overwhelmed with skills and I've unlocked all of them for my job with 3 cross skills in use as well (I have 2 full hotbars but it's very easy to switch between them)
 It's down to preference in the end but the option is really nice to have
LevellingThere are so many different ways to level it's crazy
 Though the main story quest is compulsory, there are loads of side quests available
If you think quests are repetitive you can switch over to doing FATES which are events that spawn that give gil (money) and experience to everyone that completes them based on the level of participation
If that's boring there are many different dungeons to do with solid exp gain on all of them
 Duty roullete will give you bonus exp once a day so deffo worth doing that
No
 Then you can do levequests which are contracts to do certain things in certain places which you can get by using one of your levequest allowances (which refill regularly)
 Levequests are available to crafting classes too and are considered the fastest ways to level them
Still not enough
 Then Guildhests might be for you
 These are very similar to levequests but you're put into a duty (instance) with a party and asked to do it as a group
 There's a daily bonus on guildhest roullete as well so that's good
Also, the first time you do a certain dungeon, levequest or guildhest you'll be granted bonus exp which is always a definite plus
Still too slow
 Not enough content
 Too repetitive
 Well if you're that hard to please then I guess I should tell you that there are these things called logs which grant bonus exp for doing certain things
 A hunting log will ask you to kill x number of y, while a crafting log will give you the list of everything you can craft
 The king of all these is the challenge log which refreshes weekly and gives you a lot of exp for completing tasks like "complete 3 dungeons" or "complete 5 levequests"
Honestly there are so many different ways to level that players can pick something that suits them and though some can get repetitive they're fun for the most part
EndgameYou only need to google the game to see the amount of post lv50 content
 The game's been out for about a year and there are things constantly being added
 The first expansion is coming out soon so keep an eye out for that
 Most people will tell you that lv50 is just the beginning, and they're probably right
 I'm only just getting into the endgame and I look forward to everything coming up
PriceWell
 This is the one major downside I see to the game
 It's very expensive
 Though nothing new for an mmo, it is a pretty heavy financial commitment compared to most other steam games out there
 Especially considering you can get Tera, Mabinogi, and loads of other mmos for free now
 You can buy gametime online from other sellers for a bit cheaper but it's still expensive
 I suggest playing the trial to give you a better understanding of whether you'll enjoy it
 I highly suggest it and will be playing it, but I can appreciate that a few years ago I could never afford to play a game like this
ConclusionI honestly think this is the first mmo to seriously impress me with its ability to keep you interested
 It doesn't overwhelm you, nor does it leave you with nothing to do
 Bosses are often really cool and have interesting mechanics, even from an early point in the game
 I really do feel that besides the price this game is practically perfect
 It's a great game - buy it if you can

Like a dealer pushing drugs, a friend referred me to this game as part of an elaborate scheme to get a mount
 I haven't seen my family in months
 10/10
Posted: 6 July, 2015
I was a WoW player
 I played every expansion, I did HC/Mythic raiding, I spent thousands of hours playing it
 If I could go back and get this on launch day instead, I would do it in a heart beat
If you are an MMO players, this
is hands down the best MMO on the market
I've played every major MMO since Ultima Online back in the 90s
 FFXIV has every element you could want in an MMO and executes them extremely well
The class system, all classes being available on a single character, is amazing
 No alts, not that you can't have them, you just don't need them
The story is captivating, you actually want to read the quests and see what happens rather than just click through to get the objectives
Speak of quests, there are a ton, even without the myriad of side quests, and only completeing the main story, you can reach level cap on a class
 Then roll in dungeons, raids, leves, hunting logs, challenge log, etc etc etc there is never a shortage of things to do, and they have made all of them entertaining
If you like MMOs even a little bit, stop reading and click the buy button
 Really, stop
Why are you still reading
 Stop it
 Go play FFXIV, seriously

Final Fantasy XIV, the original one, was a mess
 The servers were terrible, payments were unfair and confusing, and the game just made it so difficult for you to enjoy
 Square Enix realised, "holy hell, this is bad" and revamped the game, leading to the release of A Realm Reborn
 And boy did they do good
A Realm Reborn is not only a more polished FF XIV, it is a new game
 It offers so much more than the original
 Better service, better gameplay, more engrossing quests, everything an MMO can offer is in this game
 A Realm Reborn is by far the best Final Fantasy of the last console generation, and it is perhaps the best FF I have ever played
 It stays true to it's roots, but still manages to not be a total copy cat of previous FF games
 It borrows alot from the orginal series, when Final Fantasy was at it's best, but adds a sense of freshness so that FF new-comers could pick up the game and play it as their first FF and still have a wonderful experience
Detail is where this game excells
 The amount of effort into making this as refined as possible is staggering
 You could honestly sit at the character creation screen for an hour, picking the tiniest things about your hero
 The environments are fantastic, and it's hard to believe that an MMO looks this good
 As well as being the best Final Fantasy in years, it is also groundbreaking in the MMO genre
 It offers so much to the genre as a whole, it has made a name for it's self as one of the greatest MMOs in recent years
 It is addicting
 It is enchanting
 It is simply bliss
Square Enix have really made me regain my faith in them, and I hope that they let future Final Fantasies learn from A Realm Reborn
 I cannot wait until more content is added into the game, and clock in a few more hours
 Get yourself this game now, even just for the free trial, it's worth it
 Even if you're a hardcore FF fan, or a newcomer looking for a game to start with
 This is the one
+ Essentially has it all
 Near enough limitless gameplay hours+ Environments look stunning, attention to detail is incredible+ Smooth gameplay, easy to learn mechanics+ Makes great homage to previous Final Fantasy games- A lot of fetch quests- Occasional bug here and there10/10
 This is a fantastic game
 Get it
 Now
Patch 4
1 brings a multitude of additions and refinements to the realm
 Band together with your friends in search of the legendary land of Ivalice, explore the ancient city of Skalla, or face an old foe in a reimagining of your battle with the legendary dragon Shinryu
 Whether youre relaxing in the new residential area, Shirogane, or testing your mettle in PvP, theres something for everyone in this exciting new update

Final Fantasy game that is like a MMORPG
Or a MMORPG that is like a final fantasy game
Despite the word, there is a difference

Played the game for a little, Pretty fun
Posted: 8 November
I love this game, it's the only one I have played this much
It has a touching story although it starts off really slowly in the beginning, being mostly fetch quests and bringing you around in all the areas to unlock dungeons for your MSQ
 But later the Heavensward story and especially the Stormblood story are really goddamn touching
 I started out with a friend of mine a year ago
 He started playing in 2010 when it first released and was an utter disaster
 but now, this game is indeed one of the best MMO's out there
 I don't mind paying 35 euros to play for 3 months
 And now after playing for a year myself i became a mentor
 Helping people who are just starting out in the game
 And don't hate on all mentors
 Some do it for the crown, but most still do it to help other
Now for the gameplay, it starts off slow with maybe like 1 to 10 skills total before you unlock the job for your class
But after a while hotbars tend to fill up
Graphics are good, even though I have to put them lower because of my older laptop (AMD Radeon HD 7600 graphics card)
 But the game still looks surprisingly nice
And lastly apart from alot of fetch quests you just have to watch out for RMT (Real Money Trading) bots in the 3 main cities
 Just report them and be on with your day
 Since if you do buy gil, the ingame currency from those sites you can get banned

The premier MMORPG on the market right now
 Even though the quest design is a fairly rote affair, the level of polish is top-notch, and immediately evident in the graphics, gameplay, and music
 The community is mostly friendly to new players, and the old content is completely doable even years later, ensuring you sink hours into this game before even thinking about the first expansion
 With the promise of much more to come, Final Fantasy XIV stands head and shoulders above everything else
 World of Warcraft
 What's that
is the gil cap for the free trial 20, 30, or 100k atm
 seen multiple posts in different places at different times, and the official site just says theres a cap with no specific number that i can see
So, it wants me to enter a CD-Key in order to try the Trial Version
Help
Hi, I am looking to get into this game, but I am curious on the gear customization
 Can I change the look of gear, but keep the stats
 For example, GW2's wardrobe system
 Can I customize each peice or what

I played the GU series back when in the PS2 version, and I am primarily getting this for the nostalgia
 So far, I do not regret getting it
Two things I want to point out:1) I find the price pretty fair as it is 3 (or 4 if you count the newest one, not sure how long vol 4 is) games into one
2) People in the forum are saying this is a copy of SAO, I just want to refer those people to re-watch the intro
 This game is being released as the 15th anniversary of 
hack, which means the original 
hack series goes all the way back 15 years ago
On the otherhand, SAO is from 2009 (light novel)
so yea
Posted: 4 November
Congratz Bandai Namco and CyberConnect2
 You made it
 Now can you do all of us a favor
 Port the Rest of the Franchise to Steam
 Oh by the way we also need more Tales of Games
 Gameplay is 10/10
 If you've played the Game on PS2 you can't go wrong
Oh and the Price is also a huge pro argument
 For 50 you'll get 4 Volumes and each of those are 20-30 Hours long
So feel free to put in atleast 100 Hours of Playtime to complete all 4 Volumes
Soundtrack wise this Game is pure
 heaven
 Like
 Sometimes I just stand still and listen to the music
You can't go wrong with

Welcome to The World
Intro to 
hack//Franchise For those unfamiliar with the 
hack (or dot hack) franchise, I'll start with a basic, spoiler-free introduction
 Dot Hack is a now 15 year old multimedia franchise with books, graphic novels, anime, and games, regarding a fictional MMO known simply as The World
 This franchise started in the early 2000's, just following the early days of MMOs, inspired by titles such as Ultima Online and Everquest, successful MMOs before World of Warcraft popularized the genre in a more mainstream level
Each entry in dot hack tells a self-contained story about the fictional MMO and covers topics pertinent to online interactions, online indentities vs
 real identities, identity politics, virtual reality, social media, urban legends, and so on
 Very forward-thinking for a series conceptualized in the early 2000s
 Each entry is also fairly self-contained, not necessarily requiring someone to pay attention to every book, game, anime, or movie to understand the one they are currently on, although consuming more of the franchise does paint a wider picture
 It's kind of like Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear franchise in that way
 On to 
hack//GU: Last Recode This game is a remastered package of 
hack//GU, a trilogy of action RPGs for the Playstation 2 console
 It is the second series of games in the 
hack//Franchise but this is an ideal package to start with
 The reason why is that it contains a series of 'Terminal' videos that explain the events of the first game series, so while it's not a replacement for sorely needed remasters or remakes of those games, it's a great alternative to ponying up $200-300 for that series, as it's been long out of print
 The videos covering the first games are not necessary to watch for 
hack//GU but it provides some extra context and lore for those who care
As for the game itself, from my experience so far it is a competent port
 Not a lot of options on this PC version, but it runs well at seemingly a locked resolution of 60 frames per second, ideal for any high-motion action game
 The graphics are way better and less muddy than the PS2 originals, although obviously polygons are still obvious, especially on rounded objects
 The style of the graphics are in a cel-shaded style, however, so that aspect has not aged as poorly
 You can jump into any Volume you want, including a new 4th Volume created specifically for this remastered set
 There is also a parody mode I have no experience with yet, but it allegedly contains spoilers and is not meant for anyone who hasn't completed the games
The gameplay of 
hack//GU: Last Recode is a story-driven action role-playing game, framed as an MMO
 You have 'servers' which function as hub towns and another parameter to keep in mind for dungeons
 Dungeons are accessed through key words acquired through your player character's emails, the message boards of the world, or story events, and the dungeons generated with the key words change from server to server, so trying the same word combination in different servers will give you different dungeons to complete
The Server hub worlds themselves are filled with shops, quests, events, and NPCs that roam around as if they were player characters in an MMO, and you can trade with them
 A lot of effort was made to try and immerse you in the idea that you're in an MMO
 The combat in dungeons is honestly very simple; one attack button, a block button, and skill triggers
 It plays out like a basic brawler with repetitive combos
 Do not expect depth of gameplay akin to Dark Souls
 Dungeons are generated with differing objectives, but honestly from my memory it's just different floor layouts of maybe 3-5 specific types of dungeons with different aesthetic tile sets as you go along to at least change up the visuals from time to time
If there's two things that make this game (and usually, the entire franchise is strong in these regards), it's the story and the music
 If you read my summary of the franchise, the story part wouldn't be too much of a surprise
 It holds up pretty well with the topics and themes presented in the plot of these games becoming more and more relevant over the years
 Again, I must compare the story to Metal Gear
 Specifically, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, except with less pseudo-politics on a national scale
 The music is very well-composed and catchy in GU, a large improvement over the soundtrack in the original dot hack games in my opinion
 Not as stellar as the soundtrack for the first anime, 
hack//SIGN, though, but it fits the action of the game well
 Conclusion If any of what I have said sounds appealing to you, I would say that this package is worth the price of admission as it is at $50
 Previously, the games were only on PS2 with no ports to other systems, and physical copies long out of print and produced in limited numbers in the United States, where I live
 Saying that, before this I was only ever able to get the first two volumes, and a complete set nowadays of the physical copies would set you back over $100, WITHOUT the extra volume, Terminal videos recapping the original (also rare) $300 
hack//Games, new stuff like the Parody mode, difficulty options, and upgraded visuals
 All that said, you could argue this is a way to get roughly $400 value of previously hard to acquire content at the much cheaper price tag of $50
 Although I would still very much like it if Bandai-Namco and CyberConnect2 would just invest in remaking the original dot hack game series already
If you're on the fence, I would say wait for the eventual steam sales to take their course until you feel ready to take the plunge
 This series has a long history and can be overwhelming for newcomers, so buying it on a sale is much less of a risk if you are unsure
 As a fan of this often-ignored franchise I would definitely reccommend everyone to give it a try eventually
 This franchise is especially fun to people with experience or interest in games and their development, tech, and AI, even if the series often takes creative liberties with the subject matter

Great remake of a great game series
 Good port to PC and runs well
 If you are a fan of the series/games get this
 I heard volume 4 is really short but I got this for the first three volumes so all the extras and the 4th volume is just a bonus for me :)

Having beaten

 Vol
2//Reminisce, and eagerly awaited Vol
 3
 My PS2 broke, first it went black and white, then it failed to start and eventually never even turned back on
 I still purchased 
hack//G
U
 Vol
3//Redemption in hopes I would one day own a PS3, or buy another PS2
But that never happened
I lent a buddy my original series games, and after he finished he wanted more
 After some reluctance I let him borrow the entire GU series
 I never saw them again
 I assume he found out how much they were worth, I haven't spoken to him in years either
Now its been 10 years since I purchased Vol
3 and I am finally able to finish the story, better yet they came out with an entirely new game
 I am very grateful they came to steam as I don't own a PS4, I have been waiting for this for so long
 Thanks

A solid port of a classic RPG series
 As a veteran of the games, it took me 16 hours to beat Vol
 1's main story, plus an additional 10 hours of (fairly repetitive) grinding for 100%
 Volumes 2 and 3 are similar in length to the first, so expect 45-75 hours of playtime depending on how much you want to invest in completion
 As for the fourth volume, I hear it's shorter than the first three, but haven't yet gotten to it myself, so I can't comment there
A few comments, take them as you will:-Except in certain instances, characters' mouths do not move when they talk
-There are a few very minor glitches and I have experienced the occasional crash while playing; not nearly enough to stop me from continuing
-The previously-limited-edition Terminal Disc is included, which will help bring you up to speed on the lore and the story of the original series for new players, and expand on the existing lore for veterans
-The trailers claim to have taken the various improvements made in Volumes 2 and 3 and applied them to the first game
 This is only partially true; some features from the 2nd and 3rd Volumes are still not present in Vol
 1, such as the improved combo mechanics of the twin blades or better charge attacks of the broadsword, or, perhaps most importantly, the quick-switch mechanic
-Some of the Bonus Content cutscenes are not updated to HD, and are displayed in a small window within the game
 This does not apply to the cutscenes seen throughout the games themselves; only the extra ones you unlock at the end
-The game's EXP, Skill Points, and Attack Power have been rebalanced to provide a much smoother leveling curve
 This version, therefore, is much easier than the originals
-Features a "Cheat Mode" that allows you to play through the story at max level
 Considering the point above, this is mostly inconsequential, as you will rarely have to grind in a normal playthrough anyway
-Textures and models still look decidedly old, but passable
 The lighting engine and cel-shading go a long way to help this
-The game was made for the PS2, as such it is meant to be played with a controller
 It does support DirectInput, as well as all the modern controller APIs
-Keyboard controls can be re-mapped, but mouse and controller cannot
All-in-all, I think this collection has been well worth my $50 so far, and I haven't even beaten half of it yet

10/10 GOTY
Posted: 21 June
I can't explain this without getting emotional, but every gamer has that one game
 that one memory, where it was just you, some friends and an absolutely great time
 For me that time was Tekken 3, with family back in '97
Now 20 years later and this is ther first game in a decade that has recaptured that feeling
 I got teary over the past weekend playing this at a convention, I get emotional writing this review, because this game is not just a high quality PC port, it is an amazing port of my childhood, my memories
The game plays like Tekken, in every way that is a good thing
 The game looks like Tekken, only prettier than ever before
 This game feels like Teken, and honestly, there is very little that I as a gamer appreciate more than a game genuinely crafted with passion that captures a memory
A game that allows me to relive some of the happiest moments of my life and make for great new stories
If you do not have this yet, I highly recommend you get this soon as you can

 Let's hope Soul Calibur is next
Runs in 1080p 60fps on Ultrawith GTX 970 and i5-4690K CPU @ 3

Finally a release that is playable and you know what you are paying for
Pros:Same old Tekken;38 playable characters;New character customization system;Earnable Loot boxes (treasure chests);Great practice system, you can easily train with on-display character combos;Great performance (max settings 60fps easily);Awesome graphics for this generation;New type of story mode;First Tekken game on Steam / PC
Cons:Same old Tekken (for some this is a con)Nothing really game-changing new compared to old Tekken games;The new character customization can make your character look like an alien with weird colored particles, clothes that don't really fit character style
8
5/10, Finally a Tekken game for PC
Posted: 4 June
No micro-transactions
 Very well balanced and optimized
 Offers a better Akuma than SFV does
Posted: 1 June
Well, now that since Tekken is on PC
Consoles have officially died, atleast for me
As part of intial impressions are concerned, the game runs great with no issues thus far
Posted: 21 June
Overall, I can't say I'm in love with this revision of the Tekken series
But if you're looking for a good 3D fighter to play, especially if you're able to have local matches with friends, it'll get the job done
+ Seems well optimized, I think it can run on a lot of the hardware that's out there in the wild
No problems whatsoever on my i5 3570k with a gtx 970
+ When I could find matches for online, the connection seemed alright
+ Akuma is a really interesting addition to the cast and is a great representation of the Capcom character
+ Rage Drives -- a technically complex mechanic that allows for some great (and impressive looking) combos if you can manage to find the execution necessary to pull them off
- Rage arts
Tekken did not need the equivalent of super/ultra moves from other fighting games
It tries to add a comeback mechanic that wasn't really needed for some reason and doesn't really add anything or help casuals pick the game up
- Not in love with the character redesigns either (for the most part); at least Bandai Namco gave alternates that could be used that were more like the Nostalgia costumes Cacpom charges for
- Surprisingly, it was possible to somehow pre-order and not receive Eliza
Not only this, but she is apparently not available in the Season Pass or as part of the Deluxe Edition overall
 However, she appears in game during the Treasure Mode as AI
- Online already seems dead
If you don't have friends to play against, you may have trouble finding a match
Arguably the best 3D fighter on Steam, but it leaves me longing for a port of TTT2 or Tekken 5/6
Posted: 23 June
+ Tekken finally has a PC-port and it's fantastic
 The entire version is objectively the best with fantastic graphics, short load-times and tons of peripheral support
 This is a perfect example of a series transitioning to PC
 If you like fighting-games, this is an absolute must-buy
+Fantastic mechanics that are fun for allTekken has a low barrier to entry, but a massive skill-ceiling
 You can buy this game and have a fantastic time even if you have never played a fighting game before
 For the serious player the game features insane depth and a lot to enjoy
 Tekken 7 has changed things such as throw-breaking and made things generally more streamlined, but maintained it's complexety and depth
 This really is the best Tekken has ever been
 +Optimized rosterWhile not perfect, the roster is tightened up
 Your favorite is most likely still in the game and the newcomers are generally good
 Each character feels unique and I feel Namco has made good decisions on which characters to keep

Early Access Review
Another match-3 game from SakuraGame, mixed with short visual novel segments
 I assume it's similar to Hell Girls, although I don't have much time playing that one so I can't make good comparisons
 I'm writing this review after playing the first 2 1/2 chapters of Mirror (out of 8 total in the current build)
Bottom line: For a day-1 Early Access game, this is easily worth two bucks
 Even if development stopped today, I would have expected to pay between $5 and $10 for what's there now
The artwork is very high quality, both for the characters and the backgrounds, and there's a lot of variety for both
 The visuals overall are the best part of the game, on par with some of the more expensive VNs on Steam - Example (SFW)[steamuserimages-a
akamaihd
net]
 The only fault I could see is that the style isn't always consistent - some backgrounds have a watercolor-style appearance while others are crisp and CG-like, but it didn't bother me at all
 Music is okay - mostly unmemorable but it fits the game fine
 The title track is a standout
The English translation is not great, but it's better than most other games published by SG on Steam
 There seems to be at least some human involvement in it - not completely done by machine
 I didn't have any trouble understanding what was being said 80% of the time
 Hopefully they will make another pass or two and by the final release it could be relatively polished
Each chapter of the game appears to be a self-contained story, with unique characters and plot
 Although the gameplay is primarily match-3 in the style of Puzzle Quest and the like, there are also short visual novel vignettes before each battle
 They are a few minutes in length, and each one has a dialogue choice that results in gameplay modifier (e
g
 -10% enemy health, +20% enemy attack, etc)
The modifiers don't seem to have much impact so I wouldn't worry about making a bad choice
 This is because there isn't a lot of strategy involved in the battles
 There are only 4 primary icons on each 8x7 board, so you'll be getting a lot 5x and higher combo chains without really trying
 These battles are the weakest aspect of the game
 I hope they take the time to add some more variety and make them less luck-based, but I don't think that's likely to happen by the time the game is finished
There is an in-game shop where you can upgrade stats and get new abilities, but I haven't spent much time experimenting with it because I've only lost a single battle so far
 Again though I don't think it would make a difference
At the end of each chapter is a slightly longer VN section with a sex minigame with the opponent you defeated
 The sexual content appears to be mostly bondage-related - nothing unusual for these sorts of games
 The explicit portions are censored and there's no patch to undo it at the time I'm writing this, but pretty much every other SG release has one so I would expect it to appear before too long

If you liked Huniepop but thought to yourself, man, I wish the scenes with the girls were slightly animated and more lewd
 This game is for you
 Since it is early access there are a few things I hope can be improved before the game offically comes out, mainly the dialouge/ translation, its a bit off here and there, but overall the art is beautiful and I love the 'intimate' scenes
 Not so patiently waiting for a patch so we can see more than flowers and rabbits
Overall 9/10

Early Access Review
First ImpressionMy first impression is that this game is that the games will be full of nudes, just a linear elimination games
 That's all
 I bought it since the early purchase will entitle customers to 2 more free gift games
 Maybe sooner or later will start having cards, so it is an investment
Playing Experience	But, I was wrong, not about the nudes things, yes there a lots of them
 Few of them are somehow a bit too much for me
 (maybe i am a bit conservative)
 I was wrong that this game is just a game that use sexy anime girl to attracts weebs
 They offer more than that
The animation is nicely done, story lines created are interesting and different for each of chapters/levels/girls
 The elimination gem games combined rpg character skills builds so that the gems eliminated will have difference effects
The music is pretty good
 It is enjoyable to play this game while listening to them
 Character voices are good and such and ear candy for me
Since it is just early access game, i hope they will add more contents, more characters, and more diversity in the game play
 I personally would recommend the game
 It is not a waste will worth every cents spent

Interesting puzzle game
 I thought the back story is rather interesting too
 You have a little choices matter sort of dialogue
 I have a few SakuraGame titles, lives up to their art style, to put it simply
 A little on the lewd side
 R rated but not completely full frontal, but then again its more echi than adult manga
 Honestly I'm very surprised they charge so little for this title
 And
with a promotion of 40% off at launch, its a no brainer

Early Access Review
Already played it for a while and I am already intrigued by its fascinating features
Want the nude patch though 9/10
Posted: 2 June
Weeaboostone is a significantly better game than Moneystone
 With how generous cygames is, having a viable ladder deck takes no time, and the gameplay isn't who gets the better RNG
 There's lots of skill and counterplay, and TL;DR I highly reccomend this game if you like CCG's
 That being said, the game does have its problems:Power Creep: the devs have stated they want this card game to be very high-powered, but balance is still important
 I feel they still have a few lessons to learn in regards to card design and balance, and I'm very curious to see what the game will look like in a few years
Art Style: I'm really not a fan of anime, and the in-your-face sexuality gets to me
 Some of the art is really cool, but if this game ever wants to reach a bigger audience, this probably has to be addressed
 Don't play this game at workValue of Real-World Money: I'm the U
S
, so this will be written with that in mind
 The value of purchasing packs with IRL currency is extremely poor
 The daily deal is great, but most people who want packs want to crack them here and now, myself included
 Currently, there's a deal for what is essentially 76 packs for $80 USD, which I feel should be the default price, with like 100 packs for $80 being a good deal
 This IS offset by cygames giving out free packs like pedos give out candy, but still
These cons are, I feel, heavily offset by the pros of the game
 Very fun and unique gameplay, generous devs (have I mentioned this enough yet
 Coming from Hearthstone this was such a huge, huge difference), quick balance updates, and card design that makes even control mirrors take no time makes this game one of the best digital CCGs on the market
 Definitely a game to watch for the next few years, especially if the competition (read: Blizzard) continues to treat its customers like garbage
Posted: 12 November, 2016
Just to clarify
 I almost got cancer reading the negativ reviews to this wonderful game
 If you come from games like yugioh, Magic or even Hearthstone, you will have a real blast with this game
 To clear up some of the negativ comments i red which are just untrue, I decided to write a review myself
 1
 You cant play in fullscreen
Posted: 2 January
If you're looking for a decent CCG, then you've come to the right place
 Casual play
 Competitive play
 Card Collector
 The game is able to provide all of this without the need to spend money
I have been playing this game since June 15th, 2016 and my biggest fear was needing to cash in to keep up with the meta
 Thankfully, I never felt the need to spend money
The catch
 Just log in every day and do your daily quests and in 3 months you could gain a whopping 10,000 rupees
 That's 100 packs
 That's 800 cards
 In a month they give out 640 rupees + 6 free packs + 2 Arena tickets just for logging in
Maintenance extended
 BAM
 5 more free packs
Special events
 The new year's event alone gave everyone 1100 rupees (11 packs) just for logging in
 For the one year anniversary they gave away a whopping 40 packs
New expansion
 10 free packs
New player
 It varies, but you are guaranteed at least 30+ packs just for creating an account
Defeating Elite AI
 Seven different classes, 200 rupees each
 1400 rupees
 When will the generosity END
What
 Private matches with unique players give you 100 each
 YOU CAN DO THIS 20 TIMES
 2000 RUPEES
Playing story gives you rupees (280 rupees)
 Ascending ranks gives you rupees(100 each)
 Arena runs gives you packs and rupees
You're guaranteed a pack even if you lose all 5 matches in areYOU CAN REROLL ACCOUNTS FOR BETTER LEGENDARIES
 (Actually important, pls research more about rerolling)How can a game be so generous
 Is it failing
 Is that why they give away so many free things
WRONG
 Shadowverse is originally a Japanese mobile game, the mobile game market in Japan is EXTREMELY competitive
 Shadowverse in Japan is massively popular and even has TV commercials
 You don't need to worry about the future of Shadowverse
Now, just talking about the generosity makes me run out of breath
 Onto the most important part of a good game
Is the game fun
Yes
 That is my answer
 Why
You can easily get into the game through free packs alone
 Allowing you to make competitive worthy decks
 You start winning
 Sounds like fun
Time crunch
 You only need to spend 1-2 hours doing daily quests to enjoy at least 1 free pack a day
 (I enjoy pulling packs a lot, shhhhh)
Wins are extremely satisfying when you predict each of your opponent's moves and then swoop in for the kill
 *Vania: Yummy
*Whoops, I guess I should start formatting a little better, right
 Sigh
 Sorry for hurting your eyes
 Please bear with me
 
 
Story+ClassesWhoaaaaa, it's been a while since I played story
Uhhhh, there's 7 different classes with 10+ missions each
 Heh, I'm not going to spoil it though
(It's also voiced in English/Japanese/---Korean
)Before playing multiplayer I *highly* recommend finishing all of the story to get a feel for all the different classes
 All the free stuff is great and the story provides vital cards that are actually meta in ranked play
 I SEE YOUR WEAKNESS
A little joke for veterans of the game ;)This is also where you pick your favorite class
 Every single craft can hit B3 rank with no real problems, just have fun and learn how to play the game
 Though be wary of jumping into A rank, meta decks rule from then on
Unranked+RankedUnranked is the land of meme decks, all the non-competitive worthy decks roam the lands of unranked just to try to fish out the hilarious (usually inconsistent) win from their off-meta deck
 This is also a great place to finish your daily quests for those sweet sweet rupees
Ooo, ranked play
 A daunting task awaits you
not really
 Everyone is considered a noobie until they hit A rank (others debate the real game begins in AA rank)
 The ranks are as follows: D, C, B, A, AA, MastersAlso, in Master rank they give out rewards to the top 10000, 1000, and 100
Arena (Take Two)"To arms, there is a battle underway
"I'm no expert of Take Two, but it's sure a fun gamemode
 30 card decks that is made through tough decisions in the drafting
 Costs 150 rupees to enter and you can surely make those rupees back and run off with a card pack as well
 Decks+CardsThis is where you can build up to 27 different decks
 You want to make more than 27 different decks
 There's also the official Shadowverse portal that lets you store up to 200 different decks
 There's also a neat deck code function that instantly puts together an entire deck that you st
found online
The cards page holds your entire collection of cards and also has filters for you to look through certain crafts
 You can also view the art more closely AND listen to the delicious voices of certain cards ;)Skins+SleevesThere are leader skins for each craft, all of them costing 2800 rupees/gems
 Or just 500 for each
 I recommend getting Vampy-chan because nobody likes Urias buuu
All the card sleeves in the store are free
 The better sleeves are usually obtained through rank rewards of hitting 4,000 and 12,000 ranked score
Pulling PacksAKA your benign gambling addictionEach pack has 8 cards, with the pull rates that follow: Bronze: 67
50% Silver: 25
00% Gold: 6
00% Legendary: 1
50%With 4, soon 5, different places to pull from, I recommend doing a little research on what legends are staples in meta decks
 The general rule is that standard packs are the best packs for new players due to the best legendaries being the standard packs
 Please refer to REROLLING guides
It's fun to pull, but I don't recommend spending money to pull
(more on that later)Private MatchesYou can fight with your friends
 Test out decks and what-not
 Streamers could even open up rooms and fight against their viewers if they really wanted to
 You can also practice in Take Two formatted matches
 Meta Many players at this current time are very concerned about the state of the game where each expansion there is a feeling of a "powercreep
" While this feeling may be prevalent, people just need to remember that each craft has a certain counter
 If a craft does not have a counter, Cygames goes out of their way and makes really detailed meta reports and nerfs the appropiate cards
 Issues with the GameBad UI
 (It's a direct mobile game port)Censors + Lack of changing voice settings
Expensive Gems
 ($80 for 5000 gems)Japan exclusive offers

Here is what shadowverse does better than its competitors:Actually free to play, not free to grind
 20 free packs for the first 20 times you play against a friend
 Cygames gave us 1100 gold in new years, 10 free packs when an expansion was released, free packs when the pre-schedule maintenance takes longer than expected, 6 free packs when game achieved 6 million downloads plus 7 when 7 million plus 8 when 8 mil this month
 Achievements, with rewardsFree story mode, with rewards for completing it (gold and "arena" tickets), with actual cutscenes and dialogue3 daily quests each on their own timers, 1 free quest reroll, which gives you enough gold for 1 pack or a bit more per day if you complete themDaily login rewardsClasses with completely different mechanics and themes, not just a different hero powerExtremely customizable: Auto-squelch, reduced animations, profile, flair, flag, emblem (which unlock from achievements) Custom heros can be bought with gold not just money moneyGreat balance, nerfs don't take a long time to come when they are necessary, and they come with actual developer commentaryNerfs are reasonable, they don't make cards unplayableComplete battle log, you can scroll and see the entire gameReplay systemStatisticsModdableTop player rankings for "arena draft" and ranked playLore, much more than just one sentence flavour textAI practise mode is actually not a joke
 with 6 difficulty levels, and no ridiculous misplays
 rewards for the first time beating every class add up to 2800 gold (28 free packs
)Easier to catch up to the meta game, even as free to play playerBetter card designRanked ladder, with no division drops for losing games
 less ladder anxiety (Hearthstone will also do this soon)Actual board clearsNo broken 1 dropsEvolve mechanic in the mid game favours good trading more than going faceCan only have 5 cards in play^ LESS AGGRO ^The effect of the card is less tied to it's rarity
 A common card can have a complex effect
 Unlike HS where fun decks cost a ton of currency because you need epicsBetter art
 You might not like anime style, but the art is much more detailed and higher qualitySO MUCH LESS RNGAlternate win conditions and play styles, learning a deck is not playing different minions on curve
Better and more generous "arena" game mode, ex: if you draft legendaries, they show up first, so you can choose the rest of your deck around their effect
 easier to go "infinite"Deck code system allows easy peasy import and export, like you would copy paste somethingDECKSLOTSMEMESYou can play with anyone from any part of the world, not just your serverWhen buying packs, you can skip the animations and simply see a list of the cards you got from the packs
If you choose to put money, there's a daily deal of half price
 ex: buy enough crystals for 5 packs, open one per day at half price, you get 10 packs
 basically another login rewardSo if you like card games, try shadowverse

I highly recommend this game
 I've read quite a few reviews criticising this game for its overly heavy RNG, and its "pay to win" nature, and i disagree
I picked up this game during TOTG (Tempest of the Gods, the latest expansion), and I've loved every minute of it (much more than 20 hours worth as this game lets you play on the same account on mobile)
 I especially enjoy the evolve mechanic, which allows the tempo of any given match to swing back and forth
 The art is also gorgeous, although some may certainly disagree
 And thats fine, because art is inherently subjective
 But lets tackle the two big criticisms mentioned above
Overly heavy RNG: There's undoubtedly RNG in any card game
 The main issue is the extent to which RNG affects the game, or the user experience
 In shadowverse, apart from the inherently luck-based nature of card draws, there are indeed some cards like Jolly Rogers (who randomly gains 1 of 3 effects whenever he's summoned) that are heavily RNG based, but the presence of a few cards that rely on RNG doesnt render the game unplayable, or even bad
 It gives the game diversity
 If the majority or a substantial number of cards operate on such a basis, then there would certainly be good reason for this criticism
 But there isnt
"Pay to win" nature of the game: Lets put this upfront, there are powerful legendary cards in this game
 If you put them in direct comparison with other non-legendary cards, they certainly look stronger
 But to argue that the game is pay to win is simply ridiculous
 Many legendary cards are expensive (in terms of mana cost to play), and take time to set up
 They can also often be removed by various cards that outright destroy, banish, or transform enemy followers
 You can play around them
And the developer Cygames is extremely generous
 RIdiculously so
 Upon playing a tutorial (which you can skip), you're awarded with something akin to 50 free packs
 If you were so minded, you could open all of them, dust the cards that you dislike, and immediately create a cheaper version of a meta deck to climb the ladder
 If you start playing right now (in June), you'll reap the benefits of double rewards for completing daily missions, and a plethora of free packs (in the upcoming days), due to the anniversary of Shadowverse
This game isnt perfect
Posted: 27 October, 2016
*IF YOU ARE ON THE FENCE ABOUT PLAYING SHADOWVERSE* The Take Two (arena-style draft) mode played against a friend is COMPLETELY free, and you can play it as much as you want
 This is the best way to play with some of the neat legendary cards and to get a diverse feel for some of the classes with the least amount of investment
 If you at least have a little cardgame knowledge (enough to draft with a friend and have fun), then this part is at least worth every bit of your time to download it and try it out
 Anyways, Shadowverse is neat little collectible card game with a few unique mechanics, low RNG variance, and easy to learn cards that aren't written in Lawyer's Prose but have a layer of finesse to them, on top of a very, erm, deliberate choice of artstyle
 You start with a rather generous amount of free card packs at the start, and is riddled with ways to earn packs/arena vouchers/gold/dust through the achievements system
 Each of the classes feels very distinct from one another, and have rather strong identities, along with at least 1 mechanic many class cards are tied to
 As an example, bloodcraft's minions are often tied to Vengence, which activates when a player hovers at 10 health or lower, making health management very important to that class
 One of the most interesting aspects to Shadowverse is its Evolve mechanic which serves to make the midgame rather vibrant and adds a lot of extra decisions to consider, even when you may have few cards in your hand
If you're at all interested in playing, I'd recommend giving it a shot and, at the very least, dicking around in the Take Two mode
The PC port is better than the phone/emulator, but is little lacking in some ways; the interface is largely the same as the phone one, but the art on the cards looks much crisper and clearer
 It's a lot better than on an emulator, but could be improved upon
 Make sure if you're playing for the first time to fix your resolution and you toggle the option for 60fps instead of 30fps

"Like Hearthstone, but better" is pretty much the simplest way to explain this to most people
 The game takes a lot of the core design elements from HS to make for smooth online play
 Each player has their turn, there are no interrupts, etc
 Where HS leans heavily on RNG and has questionable balance between classes, though, SV goes very light on the RNG has has multiple viable decks for all classes at all levels of play
 SV also trades in a lot of HS staples like Weapons, Hero Powers and Secrets for new tricks like Countdown Amulets, Necromancy, Spellboost and the biggest mechanic of all: Evolve
 Evolve is a game-changing, tempo-gaining mechanic that seems simple at first but has quite a bit of depth
 You start the game with a few Evo Points and starting on turn 4 or 5 you can Evolve any follower you control which typically gives it a buff (usually +2/+2) and Rush (like Charge in HS but it can only attack other followers) but special followers will have other effects when evolved
 Evo Points are POWERFUL and really set SV apart from HS and it's other clones
 As for the business model, it's F2P and very fair
 At least on par with HS, if not better
 Newbies get a lot of freebies and there are login rewards, daily missions and monthly score rewards that all feed you a steady stream of cards
 There is also a crafting system much like HS's whereby you liquefy cards you don't need and use your vials to create new ones
 I'm quick to knock bad F2P practices but I have nothing to complain about here
 Did I mention free friendly Arena matches
 There are also free friendly Arena matches
Verdict: Try It
 It's free

If I was to review this game a year ago, I would have recommeneded to anyone who wanted to play a free-to-play card game that is very similar to that other card game that you may have heard of before
However at its current state, the game has turned into trash with every expansion with insane powercreep that turned once 7 balanced classes into one or two tier 1 decks, and everything else is unplayable
This all because Cygames won't nerf broken rare or legendary cards
Once in a while they nerf problematic cards, but it's only once every three months
This means ladder is filled with the latest cancer inducing play for 3 months and only 1 month of "fair" and "balanced" play before the next expansion comes out with even more powercreep than the last
Post Wonderland Dreams review:Wow congrats to Cygames by introducing yet another INTERACTIVE card in Spawn of the Abyss, a legendary card basically kills your opponent by turn 7 and there's nothing they can do about it
One online deck later and EVERYONE is playing the SAME deck
 No variety, no fun, just cards that make Yugioh levels of powerplay with the requirement intellegence level of a five year old
It's a shame too because the neutral push for the game is pretty acceptable, if a little bit too aggressive
If Spawn of the Abyss didn't exist I would give my approval for the expansion

I need Cold Steel II right now
Posted: 5 August
In the early hours of Cold Steel, I was worried
 worried that it couldn't live up to the lovely standards set by Trails in the Sky
 However, after my first year spent as a student of Class VII, I can confidently say that it has, and knowing that this is just the beginning of a new series fills me with great anticipation
 If you've played Trails in the Sky FC, SC and TC you'll know what to expect
 A great story, compared with wonderful Soundtrack, depth when it comes to characters and a wonderful Gameplay mechanic
 Cold Steel is a game in its own, you dont have to play FC, SC and TC to understand the story
 However if you HAVE played those Games, you'll get a better view at some point in the Story
My Specs:i7 7700k @ 4
2ghzGTX 1070 EVGA SC @ 8GB VRAM16GB DDR4 RAMI play on highest available Settings possible and on 1920x1080p and FPS unlocked to "Limitless"
I get 144 FPS constantly without any drops so far and it feels really good on my 144 Hertz Monitor
Performance-wise this is a Gamers Dream
I'm crying just because I'm able to play this on my PC without having to buy a "Console" for it
The Game has so much to offer and if you really wanna play this Game - take some time
 You have to invest around 60 Hours (Depends on your playstyle) to finish the Game
 *RECOMMENDED*

I've never posted a game review in my entire life, however, this game made me feel things I haven't felt from a RPG in a very long time
 Not since FF7 have I felt a twist in a story this hard
I'd like to think that I am pretty savy when it comes to RPGs especially JRPGs, but, I geniunely felt surprised if not totally shcoked by what this game has presented me with
I talked to every character I could (after I got the hang of the social aspect of the game) and not only did the dialogue keep me interested, it made the game so much richer because of it
*Gives developers and designers a standing ovation with tears in his eyes* BRAVO I SAY, BRAVO

How can one game have so many best girls
Posted: 7 September
This game singlehandedly sets the standard for all future Japanese PC ports
 By recruiting optimization modder Durante to actually provide optimizations and post launch support, Xseed has proven that PC porting isn't as expensive or difficult as major publishers like Square Enix pretends it is
 On top of optimizations are PC exclusive features like Turbo Mode, an FOV slider, and autosaves
 Xseed and Falcom are proving to be the CD Projekt RED of JRPGs, and their games happen to be of that quality as well
As with every Trails game, this game is just as phenominal as the Trails in the Sky trilogy was
 It's one of the only JRPGs I could ever immediately start a NG+ on minutes after the credits roll
 The characters are well written and fleshed out, the world is meticulously handcrafted to be unique and interesting, and the major story beats sets up the incredible sequel very well
This is an excellent game to get into the Trails franchise
 It was designed with newcomers in mind, yet still retains everything veterans love about the franchise
 The amount of quality hours you can put into this game makes the full asking price worth it, and all purchases of this game is directly making a statement about what PC JRPG players want out of their ports
Posted: 2 August
I put many many hours into the PS VITA version of Trails of Cold Steel by XSeed when it originally came out in the UK last year
 As a fellow player of the previous two Trails in the Sky games, prior knowledge is not nessicary in order to start this game
 Those who have played the previous iterations will find a deeper meaning and some fun references through characters and mentions however, but nothing that will take awaty the experience for a newcomer
 This game, while an engine at fault, suffered frame issues on the VITA so being able to play this in a better quality, not only 60 FPS appeased me to get it once again
 Falcom themselves, the original developers of the game have something unique in the craft of their games in this series, as once finished, you'll be yearning for more
 That being said, first installments to a new adventure are usually slower than most
 However, unlike sky, Cold Steel has an argueably more hooking beginning
The battle system is one of the most refined in the Trails series yet
 We lose some features like Rush, but we also gain a different way to do battle in the way of Master Quartz, to furter augment the skillsets and stats of your characters and the ability to swap them lets you build your characters in interesting ways
Overall, a highly recommended title
 Please tell your friends so we might get Cold Steel 2 next
10/10
Posted: 20 August
Trails of Cold Steel is part of the Trails/Kiseki series, of which there is also Trails in the Sky on Steam
 Cold Steel is set on the same continent and 1½ years after the events of Trails in the Sky, but in a different country and with a new main cast
 Having played Trails in the Sky is not necessary (but highly recommended, they are awesome games after all
), it's fine starting with this one
Port: Ported by Durante (you might know him as the one responsible for DSFix if you played Dark Souls) the game runs on a toaster and offers a wealth of graphical options
 There is also a Turbo Mode, which allows you to speed up the game with the press of a button
So, what about the game itself
- GREAT story and writing
 It starts slow and steady as you get to know the world and its inhabitants and events slowly and slowly escalate and escalate until it culminates into an explosion of awesomeness that blasts your jaw to the ground while you scream internally (and externally) like a little child and then it's over and GIVE ME THAT SECOND GAME NOW
- Characters are pretty good
 Not as good as the Trails in the Sky cast, but still pretty good
 Some of them make a terrible first impression (looking at you Machias) but all of them get a ton of growth and character development over the course of the game
- NPCs: If you take the time and talk with them (all of them offer new unique dialog after every little story progression), you learn a lot about the world, their lives, relationships, problems,
 Many of them even have
their own little story arcs going on over the course of the game and at the end I knew the students of Thors Military Academy as good as the main cast
- Combat is turn-based with a maximum of 4 active party members
 It has elements of positioning and turn-order manipluation and the challenge level is pretty good
- Music: It's a Falcom game, of course it has an awesome soundtrack :P- Length: around 60-80 hours depending on how deliberate you are- Voice Acting: No Japanese voices included, but there is a mod for that if you want
 The english dub however is very good and has around 5000 more voiced lines than the japanese one
 
Posted: 3 August
Don't be fooled by my play time as I played this game and its sequel on ps3 and bought it again here to support this series on pc
The port is very good in terms of performance and graphical settings and launcher thanks to Durante
 I have a GTX 760 and I am playing the game at maximum settings @1080p
 I am getting between 50 and 60 fps unlike the 30 fps on consoles
 It has a turbo mode to boot to save plenty of your valuable time in battles, saving your game and traversing the fields
The following is my review of the game proper:This game is one of the best jrpg'sI played in recent memory; it's very long though and has huge replayability factor due to its game plus mode and the need to play it more than once to get all achievements for their hunters out there
Despite the above praise, this game presents no real innovations in the jrpg genre, but it excels at what it does
 It spends so much time in world building and making you so much attached to and invested in getting to know the characters
 The characters are, for the most part, unique, complex and have interesting back stories
 Even the countless NPC's are unique and have their own personalities and problems
 I was reminded of persona sometimes when I played it, which is a good thing, due to its social-link like mechanic with your fellow classmates and exams
The graphics are a slight letdown but this is more than compensated by its great gameplay, beautiful music, nice English dub, which isn't full but much more is English dubbed than many other Japanese games
The battle system is turn based in the tradition of classic Japanese rpgs like persona and the earlier final fantasies and utilising enemies weaknesses, delaying enemies' (particularly bosses' turns) and performing links with your party members play a crucial role in securing your victory in battles
 Also, despite spending a long time grinding for levels and items in this game, I never really got bored or annoyed by the battle system, which is a huge plus in a long game in my book
Despite being long and very detailed that it makes you feel part in its universe, the game ends on a cliffhanger, which prepares you for its sequel as it is part of a trilogy
This is the definitive edition of this game due to the excellent port and its various enhancements, which made me want to replay it despite my huge backlog

Welcome to "The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel" (ToCS)My review is based on my PS3 experiences (Cleared ToCS I and II twice), early PC insights and my personal opinion about this game
 Trails of Cold Steels:-J-RPG -Turn-Based -Flexible skillsystem with a lot of strategy-Not the hardest but really pleasant difficulty [Normal]
(Go hard if you would like more of a challenge) -Story rich (Can drag on a bit at the beginning but it's getting really epic and interesting once you are hooked)-It's quite linear but you have time to discover various places and towns (You have your freedoms) -No prior knowledge needed (Trails in the Sky or the other titles - Just light references) -Great and illustre characters and character development-Motivating to deepen the bonds (Similar to Persona) -Almost every character (NPCs included) has his/her own story -A lot to do (amsuing sidequests, minigames, discovering and collecting various stuff)-Average graphics in general-A lot of love put into details, characters and environment -Graphics are still way better compared to PS3
-A lot of improvements over the PS3 version like higher resolutions, higher frame rates (60 FPS), depth of field, shadows and so forth-Really great OST which is underlining situations and the mood greatly (Still listening to them from time to time)Playtime: Between at least 80 hours and 120+ (Average for my first time was around 110 - PS3)-It's the first game of a trilogy -ToCS II will come later to PCs and ToCS III will release in Japan this year +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ It's pretty difficult to recommend this to everyone depending on what you like
and if you have some experience from games like Trails in the Sky FC/SC/TC and Persona At best I would say it's a mix of the previous Trails in the Sky and "Persona" in general -It's a mix because like in Persona you have your everyday school life and mysterious battles/characters-You are deepening your bonds with the "main characters" and getting to know their personality
 This depends on the time you are giving each of them individually (Pretty similar to Persona)The rest of the game is how you know it from Trails in the Sky -A lot of text-based conversations with spoken dialogues (way above average RPGs)-A lot of details put into the story, the chraracters, background information and collectibles-A lot of different things to do (next to the main story) like fishing, playing cards, quests and so forth
The basic story (without spoilers) is best explained in the short wikipedia description I'm quoting here: "The game's plot is centered around the newly formed special class "Class VII" in Thors Military Academy, composed of both aristocrats and normal Erebonian citizens
 Class VII is the only class in the entire academy that does not segregate the two different social classes
The game follows Class VII throughout their school year, mainly around the times when Class VII receive special field training that takes them all over Erebonia
 Throughout their training across Erebonia, Class VII matures and casts aside their preconceptions of the two social classes and witness first hand the reality of the empire; The power struggle between the aristocracy led by the four noble houses, and the working class reformists led by Iron Blood Chancellor Osborne which threatens to lead to a civil war
" +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So who would I recommend it to
=> People who like Persona and are into spending time to develop bonds with various characters=> People who like to play turn-based games with deep strategy (You can abuse every system
)=> People who are into longer games (Average time = 90-100+ hours)=> People who are seaching for a great story where everything feels connected (Characters, Story, Backgrounds)=> People who don't dislike certain clichés +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++POSSIBLE LIGHT SPOILERS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Some random notes at the end (Just for me or maybe you even like it => (My Personal opinion)-Rean is a great chracter for me [Realistic - Intersting - Mysterious] -Rean is human/kind and may come across as your "typical" hero [He is not - but he tries]-His schoolmates come from various societies and families-They have all their traits and quirks -They don't get along too well at the beginning and even later-Problems will arise among themselves-They are at odds with themselves-The different reasons for their behaviour/quirks are explained well and make them loveable -The battles are fun and interesting-The characters for battle are changing depending on the school trips and where you are in the story-Even if you are not leveling you don't have to fear to be underleveled and to grind endlessly because you are getting more EXP the lower your average level is compared to the current monsters you are fighting-You are even getting less EXP when you are higher compared to the average level of the monsters you are fighting -It was a pleasure catching all kinds of fish (Fishing), to play Blade (Card Game), to collect certain books and read a novel from time to time and to get to know more about the society and the world around ToCS-A lot of German words mixed into the game (I'm from Germany so it's quite funny how they use different terms)-Fun scenes: School trips, schwimming, awkward/funny situations the characters are getting into, school festival
 One of the best J-RPGs in recent years
 ;o)

After watching the Steins;Gate anime, and becoming a little bit obsessed with it, I thought that I would purchase the original game
 I am glad I did
 It adds a lot of depth to the story and the characters, and helps to explain several parts of the anime that I thought were a little odd and inexplicable
 If you have seen the extremely popular anime, I would not say this purchase is essential by any means
 But for those like me who want to experience the story again with a little more depth and expansion, I highly recommend it
For those who have not seen the Steins;Gate anime, watch it
 It is currently streaming on Funimation (in the US) and can be watched for free is you sign up for the 14-day free trial
 It is really fantastic
 For those interested in the story but wary of reading a visual novel, it is a good option
 Although, be forewarned, the first half of the anime is kind of slow
Anyway, for those who are not aware of Steins;Gate at all, I would purchase this game if you enjoy a cast of quircky characters, well-researched science fiction, and an awesome, complicated plot that somehow manages to avoid the plot holes that plague most time travel stories
 Higly recommended
Update (6/28/17):My computer locked up a few days ago and I had to reset it to factory settings
 After a day of updating Windows and all of my drivers, I tried to play Steins;Gate today
 And
 it gave me an error message in Japanese and did not start
So, just FYI, the game is not packaged with all of the software dependencies required to play it
 If it fails to start, try installing another recent game or two and then try again

I love Steins;Gate
 It's unique visual style is something that's always a breath of fresh air
 Every character that you come across feels very human
 Each of the routes are finely crafted
 The soundtrack is beautiful
 The mood of the story is captured perfectly through it, and I can't be more happy with it
 Enough gushing, though, I have to say that I should bring up that I have 2 issues with this game, neither of which are a very big deal
 The first issue is how long it takes to kick off the ground
 This can be a turn off for newcomers, as the first few chapters are paced fairly slow, however, I feel that the slow pacing is necessary to build on the impact that the tone shift has on the player
The second issue that I have with the VN is the requirements for the true ending
 You aren't going to get the true ending on your first blind playthrough of Steins;Gate unless your looking it up
 That isn't an issue, and I don't think it should be seen as one, but the problem comes that the flags required to achieve the true ending can be seen as a little convoluted
Aside from those two things, which may or may not even be an issue for some people, I loved this visual novel
 Totally worth the price
 I'm really glad to see it finally made its way onto Steam for others to enjoy the same way that I have

I've never had a story destroy my heart this many times
 I've never fallen in love with a tsundere genius girl
 I've never been so conflicted on which waifu is the best
It's not a visual novel
 It's not a game
 It's required playing
Posted: 7 December, 2016
This is amazing
 Mindblowing
I was a Steins;Gate maniac since i saw the the first anime episode and i really enjoyed it
 It is actually in my personal top-3 list of the best anime of all time
 I have re-watched it a number of times, so i practically know everything that happens there, like the in's and out's of the infinite time loop
 So when i started to play this VN i was qute sure that it cant really surprise me, since i know the anime version of the story so well
 Oh boy
 i was soo naive
 Let me start with the obvious fact that compared to the anime - here we have a lot more details even on the events that has been shown in the anime
 Time travel theories explaind deeper, we have some additional lines, scenes, etc
But the main attraction point is definetly the ability to reach scenes and endings that were never shown in the anime
 And
the way the choices needed to reach the different world lines are made is so smart that it actually got me very confused
 I was even going to comply that this game is not a visual novel at all, but just an interactive book
 Because in the course of the game there were no standart "choose 1 of 3 actions" popups
 The thing is that there ARE choices
 But they are camouflaged and the game itself never teaches you about that - you have to figure is out for yourself
 Now since i dont consider that as real spoiler i am going to say that aloud:
you make choices when you interact (or dont
) with your phone
 Emails, calls, replys(or not
) - this all matters
Honestly i didnt get it until i have finished up my first playthrough
 I just interacted with the phone as i felt natural and in the end i have reached the Amane Suzuha ending
 When the actual scenes started to divergence from the original canon anime i was really, really surprised, since i wasnt expecting that at all
The feels hit like a truck
 VERY COOL, SUNUVABICH
 Now since i have figured it out i will go for the new playthrough, paying much more attention to what i do to the phone
 Currently i am very excited to see what else the game has in store and which outcome will become the new choice of the Stains Gate
 I am sorry if this review feels a bit scrambled, but i just had an urge to immidiately inform every original anime fan that this VN is a must buy thing, since it adds so much to the Gate world
Also i strongly advice you to not read any guides on your first playthrough, and just see for yourself where you will end up
 Let us meet again in the world of the Gates, comrades

If you read this review you are probably like me and watched the Steins;Gate anime before for whatever reason stumbling across the visual novel on steam and are asking yourself now "Is this game still worth buying even though i know all the major plottwists and the true-route
"The short answer is in my opinion: yes it is
 If you enjoyed the anime as a whole and not just the first or the second half, it's definetly worth buying for multiple reasons
First of all the game gives you a lot more information on the time-travel stuff that's going on and even discusses some theories that are actual theories in real-life and it's pretty well researched by the devs
 However it never goes that deep into science that you, as a normal person, cannot understand what the characters are talking about
 So it's really well blalanced and gives you something to think about while reading
Second the characters get a lot more depth
 I guess that shouldn't come as a surprise, that a visual novel with around 50 hour length develops the characters much more than the anime with around 8 hours
 However not just that the side characters like Faris, Lukako, etc
 get more depth they also get their very own ending route, that, even though it's non-canonical, is worth experiencing
Third the art and the soundtrack in this game are awesome
 But if you've watched the anime and checked the screenshots above the review section you should know that already
Fourth the inner thoughts of Okabe gives you a lot more insight on how he goes through this whole journey
 Even though the anime does a good job in portraying how he kinde descends into madness because of the constant time-looping, reading about his inner thoughts gives you a much better picture about the whole situation
 Also having his phone accessable and reading his e-mail exchange with the fellow characters is pretty well done
Fifth you support the devs
 I mean even if nothing from the above convinced you to buy the game because the price is too high or you are still not sure, just wait for winter-sale or something and buy it then, even if it's just to support the devs
 They just recently released the Steins;Gate 0 visual novel and it might get a steam release as well, if the support is big enough here
 Who knows
All in all it was a really nice experience to read through the novel, even with prior knowlege of the anime
 Sure it does spoiler the major plottwists for you, however it shouldn't hinder the enjoyment you get out of the game
Also sorry for possible grammar-typo mistakes, english is not my first language
Posted: 21 August
Anime was 10/10, perfect in every way
This VN is 11/10
 You get to experience the anime from Okabe's perspective, get ready for some feels

Hands down one of the most intense and mind wrecking visual novels/anime I've seen

*holds cellphone up*"It's me
 Yes, I've tailed the chosen one
 They're at the Steam store page, ready to enter Stein's Gate
but the Organization has sent its most fearsome enemy, a price tag of $35
 Yes, I've told them that the fate of mankind depends on their purchase
 The adventures of the great Hououin Kyouma, insane mad scientist and ruler of space and time, await them
 Should they proceed with their destiny and click 'Add to Cart', I will meet them at the final battle of Ragnarok, where chaos will descend upon Earth
 With the assistance of the chosen one, nothing can stop us
 Even the Organization will cower in fear
 Such is the choice of Stein's Gate
 El Psy Kongroo
"*puts cellphone down*------Oh, hi
Steins;Gate is an excellent visual novel about time travel, consequence, fate, and a crazy protagonist who spews fantasy conspiracy babble that you can't help but be entertained by
 Seriously, I'm not much for the "mad scientist" trope, but the protagonist (Okabe Rintaro, or "Hououin Kyouma" as he goes by) won me over with his crazy dramatic nonsense and wonderful voice acting (for those wondering, he's not actually a mad scientist, that's just his alter ego fantasy)
Along with its humor, Steins;Gate is also a very heartfelt and complex story that explores themes that are often barely touched by time travel stories and visual novels in general
 It's well worth your time, trust me
Posted: 18 May
I thought that time travel could only be a cheesy plot device that inevitably led to unsatisfying contradictions and unresolved questions
I was wrong
I thought that I wasn't really the sort of person to stay up until early in the morning playing a visual novel game
I was wrong
I thought games with multiple endings were generally just trying to recycle limited content and couldn't deliver a meaningful experience
I was wrong
Any game that shatters that many preconceptions is a great game in my book
Posted: 17 June
An absolute masterpiece
 I never thought I would like this as much as the first game but boy was I wrong
 The third game cannot come out faster
Posted: 5 June
Overall better cast than the first game
 But it has a few problems that DR1 didn't have, which to me was what made the game fun in the first place
DR1 spoilers:
All of them seem capable of killing which I couldn't say about the first game where it was obvious that weedman, the giant and donut girl wasn't a threat to you
 DR2 spoilers:
However unlike the first game where Kirigiri, Byakuya and other characters were arguing during the trial and bringing up interesting points
 DR2 has a lack of persuasive characters
 There's effectively just Nagito (who argues in your favor half the time anyway) and Chiaki
 The other characters never challenges you in a convincing way

Sooo, I met the Danganronpa franchise last year (2016) through the rushed anime adaptation, and since then, I've been a fan of the series
 The farthest I got in this game was the 4th chapter which I didn't even finish since I lost my save files but I think that 20+ hours (I played an illegal copy and decided to buy the game on steam when it was on sale) playing this are enough to give my opinion about this masterpiece
Yet simple, the visuals are stunning, the theater feeling you get from the scenes is pretty cool and the music that comes with it just makes the perfect mix, the cast is lovely (Just avoid getting to close to one of them as he/she will probably die lol) and is full of waifu material
 The class trials are satisfying as hell to solve and the references in this game are EVERYWHERE

Your favorite character is going to die
Posted: 18 April, 2016
Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair, developed by Spike Chunsoft and published by Spike Chunsoft Co
, Ltd
 themselves
 Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair sequel to Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is not your typical visual novel where you will find romance and everything goes smoothly
 Characters will die whether you hate them or love them
 It has the touch of mystery, horror, point and click and detective work all in the mix of this visual novel not to mention the story is very interesting with and filled with unexpected twists around
The StoryThe story is definitely one of the most interesting mystery and crazy story I have read
 It has many plot twists and it is very confusing in a sense that it manages to conceal the truth until the very end of every case
 I always end up suspecting the wrong character as the murderer, which surprises me and the cases are very detailed 
 [Especially for the final case]The story takes place after the events of Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc
 You will be placed into the shoes of Hajime Hinata
 Who appears to be in front of Hopes Peak Academy a government funded school for the privileged elite of society
 A door then suddenly appears in front Hajime Hinata which leads to a classrooms where he meets his classmates that has also ended up in the same situation as him of not knowing how they ended up in the class room
 After some verbal exchanges in between them, their teacher named Usami revealed to them that they are on a school trip on Jabberwock Island a paradise-like island
 Usami then tells them they are on a school trip and they are to befriend each other to gain hope fragments and make their hope grow
 What could go wrong here
 Right
:) Of course not
 What are you thinking
 Upupupupu Monokuma suddenly appears and takes control of the island, announcing that the students must participate in his murderous game if they wish to escape
 Leaving them in despair, being placed in a game where they are being pressured subconsciously to kill their friend or not to kill in order to escape
 But if they do not kill they may become the next target with all these pressure building up around them it is bound that someone will give in to it and it starts to turn ugly for them
Characters are very memorable, each of them are unique and have some special traits about them

(No spoilers)Let me preface this review by saying that you shouldn't play Danganronpa 2 without playing the first game
 Danganronpa is a mystery series, so you'd want to play the games in release order for maximum effect
 That said, DR1 and DR2 pair together very nicely so you should try to get both of them if you can afford it
Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is an excellent followup to DR1 that excels the original in almost every respect
 Memorable characters, a soundtrack worth shelling money for, a unique/bizarre gameworld and story, and to top it all off, the PC port is pretty great
 I can't think of any reason *not* to recommend DR2 if you even remotely enjoyed the first game

I wanted to wait until I beat it to write a review but at 60 hours in, the game is already so good I feel compelled to
This is probably one of the best action JRPGs you will find on PC, and certainly the height of the Tales series (disclaimer: I've played a handful, but not nearly all of them)
 Let's dive right into what makes Berseria great, and where it's a bit lacking:- The story is engrossing
 Yes, it's JRPG, and it's Tales, so there's bound to be clichés and tropes, but Berseria strikes the perfect balance of not taking itself too seriously while presenting you with relatable characters in genuinely compelling scenarios
 You can have fun, but still feel invested, and there's enough sub-plots to keep you interested in ALL of the main cast
- The combat is bleeding edge, joyous, chaotic mayhem
 It's super fast paced, and between juggling enemy types to trigger status effects to fill your Soul Gauge to use Break Souls to feed your Mystic Artes (which you'll want to properly time to get grade bonuses, among other things), there is always a strategy to be refined on the battlefield if you are a grinder, min-maxer, or whatever
 That isn't to say mastering the mechanics is a necessity
 There are plenty of tools and difficulty settings to tweak the combat difficulty to your liking
 Me
 I crank that **** up to Intense ASAP and get to work melting wave after wave of demons in Dangerous Encounters (and all the better if you get a Dire Foe afterwards - seriously, these are some of the best, most heated moments of the game
)
- The cast is fantastic and the writing is strong
 This is hands down the biggest strength for me
 Despite being yet another title in a genre as saturated as JRPG (in a series as dense as Tales, no less), the main characters manage to have very distinct personalities and motivations, and are just the right amount of "morally grey" to be likable without being obnoxious
 They start off as somewhat standoffish misfits, cooperating only to pursue their personal opportunistic goals, but over time you will see them grow together in a way that is believable
 There's also something deeply satisfying about being able to play as a team of blatant criminals, as opposed to the white knights, royalty, and chosen ones we've grown so tired of
 And beyond that, even the side cast of characters does a great job of complementing and bouncing off of the main cast
 The villains do seem a bit one dimensional, and I fear the "big bad" twist is going to end up being predictable, but it's a small bump on an otherwise fantastic journey
 Final note on this - the themes and the tones are appropriately adult
 The language feels natural and there is swearing and innuendo in all the right places, never beating you over the head with it
- The pacing is good
 The intro/tutorial segment is the perfect length (some Tales games have ones that drag on ENTIRELY too long, not the case here), and you will periodically unlock new mechanics to keep the gameplay fresh
 You will actually acquire all the party members pretty early on in the game, although this is preferable due to how the equipment mastery system works
- Great customization options
 The arte pools are huge, and the trees are fully customizable
 I've used Velvet almost exclusively for the first 60 hours, but I can tell there is still plenty to unlock for her and the rest of the cast seems to have their own fun, unique playstyles as well
 Because of how fast paced the combat is, I don't find myself switching primary fighters as much as previous Tales games, but Berseria actually makes it even easier by allowing you to swap mid-battle, mid-combo
 Lots of fashion options, lots of equipment flavors, and a mastery system that makes it fairly compelling to keep different sets of equipment around (and tweak until your playstyle is content)
- The world map is expansive, but the areas can be a bit samey, and the puzzles are definitely nothing groundbreaking
 Pretty middle of the road for JRPG, so just don't expect anything impressive there
 I find myself constantly looking back to Symphonia as the holy grail of Tales world maps, as I've yet to see that one be outdone
- The voice acting is good
 I've only listened to the dub, as the English VAs are more than serviceable
 The main cast are all great
 The NPCs are not as varied as I'd like or as I have seen in previous Tales games, but again a pretty small nitpick
 Nearly all cutscenes and skits are fully voiced, though, so there is a truly dense amount of lore and worldbuilding going on, if you are into it (I am)
- The visuals are aesthetically pleasing
 Watch some videos
 It should be clear that Berseria is not pushing next gen graphic fidelity
 Instead it goes for a colorful, eye-popping art style that does the game justice
- The music is good
 The tracks set the appropriate moods, and have enough depth to be enjoyable from moment to moment, but I honestly didn't find much in the way of "holy **** I need to go download this right NOW" kind of songs
 Still, I would say a bit above average in terms of video game music
In summary, this is a must-buy for Tales fans, but still a heavily encouraged purchase for JRPG fans, action RPG fans, or someone looking to try out the genre
 If you haven't tried the series before, don't worry about needing to start at the beginning
 You can jump right into this without any issues and you'll find yourself getting giddy with glee as you literally hack through swaths of demons like they were hot butter in no time: I guarantee it
Posted: 24 June
I think the only bad thing I can say about this game is that a lot of the environments just seem pretty bland and the dungeon layouts can be irritating at times
 I also wish that it looked nicer overall
 Velvet could also use some better costume options :sThat aside, the game has a wonderful story and the entire group of characters are all lovable
 The combat is somewhat deep and also quite fun
 You can definitely tell that a lot of care and love was put into this game
This was my first Tales of game and now I'm definitely going to be looking to play more
 Easily my favorite game of all time

Once every few years, a JRPG arrives that blends together good world-building, a story that is both fascinating and thought-provoking, challenging your own worldview, philosophy and beliefs and a combat system that, while simple at first, makes you feel like a glorious badass having fun killing hordes after hordes of enemies
This is Tales of Berseria
 Review is spoiler-free, minus the intro stuff
The game puts you in the boots of Velvet - an average village girl that one day gets to see her little brother being murdered right in front of her by her own brother-in-law, she turns into a daemon and then she gets thrown in prison to feast on other daemons for 3 years
 As she manages to escape with someone's help, she learns that her brother-in-law now is mankind's greatest hope against daemons, and the whole world praises him as a saviour
 Filled with rage for the injustice she and her brother tasted, she embarks on a journey to kill him
Let me start off with the world-building
 I was having a discussion with a few friends over how games stopped bothering with giving attention to details due to how gamers nowadays tend not to care much about information that gives you a clue on how X village works, how they survive in Y conditions etc
 For that I'm glad that Berseria doesn't do that
 Here, in the form of completely optional NPC's, you'll find stuff like a father looking for his lost son, a group of teenagers who become interested in music and decide to start their own band and dogs that are criticizing humanity
 For that I praise the creators of the game who decided to not restrict themselves to "what information is useful" but also to "what information makes you immerse"
 I found myself returning to a city wondering whether a couple of NPC's got married
 I can't criticize the English voice acting because I play the game in Japanese voice acting, and there's some great quality to be found there
 One of the characters in the group, for example, is the same voice actor behind Jojo's bizarre adventure part 4 antagonist, Yoshikage Kira, and he's doing a glorious job here, too
Combat system time
 People will bash the game for having "button-mashing combat"
 And they are right, combat is button mashy, BUT
 It would be wrong to stop here
 See, this is first and foremost a JRPG that has an "exploit weakness system"
 Your typical dungeon/area visit will be
to first identify the enemy population's weaknesses, compile combos that hit every weakness they have then mash that button against them
 For example (oversimplified), if an area has worms, knights and bats I end up identifying and crafting 3 different combos so I'll mash Y for bats, X for knights and B for worms (Xbox controller)
 This is the equivalent of scrolling through menus in a turn-based JRPG to find the ice spell versus enemies that are weak to ice, the armor penetration move for armored enemies etc
 Later in the game the enemy variety becomes large enough that not only you craft combos for each but you make sure you can weave them
 So you'll start with X for the first move of the X-combo then Y because the second move of the Y-combo works not only for bats but for armored, etc
 Then you get moves called mystic artes that make your characters go full blown crazy killing machines
 All in silky smooth 60 frames per second, even for my poverty rig (there's a demo on Steam that you can check out if you're not sure about your PC's performance)
 Add to that the amazing A
I
 behind your teammates, which is also one of the best, if not the best in a Tales game ever and can easily play better than 70% of the players
 I can even put everyone on "auto" and go to the bathroom knowing that we will almost certainly win a fight
Now for the downsides: So far, I find the game quite linear - on rails, so to speak, and the optional areas that I have unlocked so far (I haven't finished the game yet, have mercy) are simple arenas that lack in the difficulty and satisfaction department, compared to the rest of the content
 I found myself visiting them once, go "is that it
" then leave in disappointment
 Maybe this will change as the game goes on
 I heard very good things about the post-game content
 There are also the occasional sidequests and mini games that (thankfully) are so many and diverse that you can "play favorites" without losing the rewards (you win coins that let you buy stuff, but its shared across mini-games, thanks Namco)
The difficulty settings are Simple - Normal - Moderate - Hard, with Intense and Chaos being unlocked after you do something in the game
 On the other hand, there's a way to make fights so hard you'll almost always get a couple of party members or everyone dead
 To give you a clue, my winrate in normal fights is around 90% but for dangerous fights it's at 10%, but that's just me not accepting winning a fight with people being knocked out left and right (the game rewards you with in-game score, called Grade, if you win fights without deaths and without using items, who would say no to that
)
 Maybe it's also me being used to JRPG's throughout the years
 Someone can also play the game with the combat system in full automatic mode - AI doing everything - in case you just want to experience the story without bothering with learning how the combat works (I wouldn't do that but some people could)
 NINJA EDIT: Something else that I noticed and I gotta say: Contrary to most JRPG's, on higher difficulties the enemies not only get the usual stat increases but also different attack frequency and in bosses it can be a change of movesets and spells
Overall, this isn't simply one of the top Tales games ever (and easily the best modern Tales game - RIP Zestiria) but a great JRPG
 I said it on my Zestiria review and I'll say it again: "Tales of" games are the only JRPG series on Steam that combines fast-paced flashy combat system with immersive storytelling
 Does it worth paying full price
 For me that's a resounding yes
 But I hope that my review was informative enough to draw your own decision
 Meanwhile, I'll be finishing my playthrough and prepare for my next one
 And if you choose to get into it, I would advise you to take it slow and savor every minute, instead of speed through it
 JRPG's like this one deserve to be enjoyed like good wine or chocolate

Do you like great story telling
Do you like JRPG's
Well, there's a reason you see "Overwhemingly positive" on the reviews
Treat yourself

A JRPG in which your starting party is an angry vengeful demon, a psychopath with a sword, a merciless pirate and a brainwashed child you literally kidnap and take on dangerous adventures with for endgoal to kill King Arthur because he made the world a better place and you just can't accept saving the world was worth one life
Also the battle system is majorly improved over Zestiria and Xillia/Xillia2

So after about 70 hours i finished the story of Tales of Berseria
 I did not download any item packs and played on normal difficulty
 I´ll just jump right into the review
GraphicsIt fullfills its purpose
 It is not espeacially good or bad
 The characters are well designed and the animated scenes are beautiful
 But tbh, i don´t really care about the graphic quality in this game
SoundFirst of all the soundtrack is amazing
 No other than Motoi Sakuraba composed the soundtrack
 It really has a big role in the atmosphere of the game
 This is what i call art
 Every scene is accompanied by a track, that fits perfectly
 Joy, happiness or sadness, even the funny parts feel authentic
Now the dub
 Everything in this game is dubbed
 The dubbing actors did an amazingly good job
 I have no reason to play the Newgame+ with japanese dub
 The english dub is by far better than expected and i´ll stick to that
 BUT this game has a bug
 Many people cannot hear certain sounds when using 5
1 surround sound
 In this case you also cannot hear the dub
 Using the stereo mode fixes this problem, but can cause other sound issues
 I recommend using a fix for that (just google it and you will find it)
GameplayThe battle system is in realtime and pretty good, but not well explained
 You have to figure out some stuff on your own
 Tbh, i liked figuring stuff out, but i can see people being annoyed, because certain actions/skills don´t work they way they expected it
 The items and ability system is easy to understand and the game is beatable without focussing too much on optimization
 If you want to master every equipment or make very effective combos in battles it becomes a little bit more complex
Outside from fights in dungeons you have to walk a bit until you unlock certain teleportation points
 Outside from dungeons there is a quick travel system that is bound to a consumeable item
 Since you should have absolutely no money problems, it is no problem to buy nearly endless of this stuff
At a certain point ingame i nearly stopped caring about anything that has to do with gameplay, because the story gets such a strong peak, you could have given me 2d jump´n´run gameplay and i would have enjoyed this game
AtmosphereNow some of the more important parts
 The atmosphere in this game is convincing
 I felt like i was part of the world ingame
 This is achieved by the amazing soundtrack and also by many other little things
 For example small conversations between characters (which are also dubbed) or even some background noises
The characters all have their motivations to do whatever they do and no one feels out of place
 There are many scenes where i thought: "Oh god no, why did you say that
" The first time was the point where my mindset changed
 These characters HAVE a personality
 Each of them
 And the game is not afraid of showing this
The characters develop while progressing in game
 Everything happens for a reason
 To fully understand what happened with some characters i had to rewatch scenes or let whatever happened rewind in my head
 I paused the game many times, just being stunned, waiting for my brain to comprehend the situation
StoryWow, what can i say about the story
 I don´t know, i am speechless
 The story in itself is kind of sinister and gets darker, especially when you understand why certain things happend
 While the game starts a bit slow it quickly gets to a point where i stopped thinking this is a game
 I stopped "playing" it and started "experiencing" it
 My emotional state was decided by the happenings in game
 I felt joy, i laughed, i was angry, i even cried a few times
 This story hits you hard with emotions
 And this is coming from a guy who stopped playing story focused game long ago and thought he was more of a cold, emotionless guy
tl;dr: All i can say is i am absolutely overwhelmed by this masterpiece
 Don´t get scared away if you think the beginning is slow or boring
 If you are only interested a little bit in JRPGs or just want want to experience a great stroy, because most of the animes released nowadays are boring, i definetly recommend this game
 I also recommend watching the trailer "The Calamity and The Blade", which is english dubbed, since steam only has the "The Flame" trailer
This is the best game i have ever played

Pros-Fast paced intuitive combat
-Solid visuals and animations
 Cutscenes are nice
 Character models and expressions are great
-Interesting story theme
-A lot of content, very long game even when you're moving through it at a fast pace
-Great HUD for finding points of interest and next plot point
-Tag switch mechanic is fun
 Soul Break mechanic is fun
-A good amount of side content with interesting rewards
 Unlocking some costumes felt rewarding
Cons-Bloated and repetitive dungeon design as you progress in the game-Arena is beyond average-Weakness/Resistance/Stagger system is really wacky
 Combos feel super RNG unless you heavily spec yourself with stats and hitstun modifiers-Lack of good ways to enjoy the combat system post game-Combat is fun, but becomes very mashy at times-decent songs in the soundtrackNeutral-Minigames range from simple and fun to grindy-Game is long and packed
-A lot of the recycling, but that's a tales standard at this point
-Difficulty is average overallNote:this may seem like a backstory for Tales Of Zesteria if you ever finish the game till the end and do every side quest to know the full content of the story
 Should You get this game, only if you are Tales Fans and i certainly this game will be worth your time and money and pack full of content than the previous Tales installment beside my Favorite Tales Of Symphonia

A game I wish I could forget entirely so I can go back and play again for the first time
 The world is large, the quests are plentiful, and the story reads like a top teir play
 The usual archetypes are introduced but as the game marches on they're abandoned and the depth of each character shines through
Pros:-Story-Combat (Insanity is level to shoot for, if it's too easy, you're on the wrong difficulty)-Playtime-MusicCons:-JRPG Dialogue, prepare for the grunts and cheesy emotions-Weapon system feels abritrary at times, no reason to give up certain gear for a long time

Story: 9
5/10Characters: 8/10Combat: 9
5/10FPS : 60/60---------------------Overall: 9
5/10Pros:+ The story is not your average save-the-world heroic stuff, instead it's dark and twisted
+ The combat system is the best among all Tales' games and is easy to understand
+ There are strong enemies if you like a good challenge (such as "Dire" foes)
+ New Game+ is filled with interesting options, so starting another run is worth it
+ 60 FPS
+ New battle camera
+ Quick save option
Cons:- Some characters may be annoying
- Music is not as good as other Tales' games
- Dungeons look better than in Zestiria, but some require a lot of time and running around to finish
Note:You don't need to play Zestiria before this one to understand the story, but doing so will make Berseria much more enjoyable since it will show how Zestiria came to be
 Alternatively, you can play Zestiria after Berseria
 Whichever you choose will make you experience the story in a slightly different way

I blew up the city to stop the aliens from blowing up the city 
Posted: 1 June
Some of the most exaggerated and insane battles I've ever played in a video game, I recommend 10/10
Also,The game comes with offline split-screen and offers 89 missions
 Lots and lots and lots of content here folks
Posted: 18 July, 2016
First
 If you played Insect Armageddon and hated it
 At least try this game, as IA was a terrible game in comparison to the other titles in the series
Simply put this game is amazing
 Single player is fun and split screen or online coop is awesome
 With a cheesy story and b tier graphics, sound, and pretty much everything, the game still manages to be plain fun to play
 Very few other games can be this mindlessly enjoying
 Destructible environment and hundreds of enemies on screen at once create a hectic experience that is better to play yourself than watch a video of
Collect new weapons and increase armor across four classes while stomping alien invaders and their bug friends to bits, the only good bug is a dead bug
 Each armor pickup gives your class chosen a small bit of armor for the next time you use them
 Each weapon pickup has a random chance at one of hundreds of weapons per class you were when you picked it up
The game allows multiple playthrough by offering harder, faster, stronger enemies as the difficulty is increased, not only by playing later missions but also a selectable difficulty option per each mission
After obtaining more powerful weapons and increasing armor, you can then take on those harder settings
 On those hard difficulties comes higher loot tables for better weapons
 Across over more than 80 levels, there is a lot to see and even more to do
With each player class playing different than the next, you are guaranteed to find one that suits you and your playstyle
 - An all around Ranger with assault rifles, missles, rockets, shot guns and snipers to name a few
 A decent all around character
 Has evasive rolls and decent armor
 Can select two weapons for a sortie
- A vehicle summoning and air strike calling support infantry Air Raider
 Has building sized vehicles, or small tunnel crawling vehicles
 Has health fountain support to heal allies and missile guidance support to help kill
Has claymors, mines and auto turrets
 Harder to play than a Ranger, but rewarding and unique
 Same evasive rolls and same decent armor as the ranger
 Can select two weapons/support at once and one vehicle for a sortie
- A guerilla type high-damage dealing Wing Diver
 Using a jet pack and constantly recovering energy supply
 You fly in, while managing your energy, deal massive damage and back off to recover
 Weapons also use this energy, when you over use it your jet pack fails and weapons can no longer reload until your energy system cools off
 Very light armor means certain death when you run out of juice in bug city
 Can select two weapons for a sortie
- A Fencer
 A high armored walking vehicle-like humanoid suit
 Can use incredibly large weapons
 Hammers, spears, swords, shields, artillery, missles, etc
 Can select two sets of two weapons at once, capable of switching between each set on the fly
 The fencer has a jump boost or forward boost depending on his equipped weapon and his armor is unmatched
The opposition ranges from acid spewing black ants
 to tough armored red ants that grab you
 To flying alien spaceships and wasps
 To giant walking robots and walkers
 There are plenty more but I won't spoil any of that
 Plenty of variety in alien and bug opposition, to keep you always changing your loadout and tactics
There isn't much more to say
After hundreds of hours in the series (100+ on 2025, 100+ on 4
1, 200+ on 2017, 200+ on MA+GDF+EDF2) I will spend hundreds more on this pc version
 It runs smooth and is by far the definitive version to play
 New to the series or not
 It seems to run very well even on lower end hardware (jokingly played it on a Surface Pro 1, and it actually worked at 800x600)
Controllers recommended although mouse and keyboard work fine, I can see the controls are skewed to controller
 If I run into any bugs (lel) I will let people know by adding them as comments
 As of now I have no complaints, as they have been fixed by the August 4th patch
Oh and one more thing

The game's great but there are a lot of bugs
Posted: 24 June
Pros:I can kill giant bugs from afar
I can fly over the bugs
I don't necessarily need to be close and personal with the bugs
At least I get to fight robots in the later levels
Cons:Sometimes the bugs get too close
Like really close
Like to the point where you can see their gross legs and mandibles
So I just close my eyes and shoot blindly
Overall:The game is pretty fun
I just have a personal issue with interacting with any insectoid looking thing

[Introduction]As someone who doesn't normally enjoy visual novels, I was hesitant at first
 Sure, the setting and the anime aesthetic appealed to me, but there was a big chance that this game would be just another VN hyped up by its fanatic anime fans
 But damn was I surprised by what I found
 The game managed to change my mind pretty much instantly, not because of its art style or its soundtrack (though they are huge contributors towards that), but because of the overall feel and well presented atmosphere
 As always, these are my own opinions and experiences, please consider reading other reviews too
 [Negatives]Just some minor things that i still want to mention just to spice things up
 While this game features a form of gameplay, and Im very glad that it does; the mixing of drinks can be a bit repetitive at times
 No wonder some people say that you should play it in sessions and take breaks, just like the protagonist
 The problem is the fixed number of recipes at your disposal and the way the system works, you have the initial 24 drinks but thats it really, no new ones will be introduced during your playthrough which is a missed opportunity
 A double-click option wouldve been nice to add the ingredients directly instead of dragging every single one of them
 Checkpoints are often very far apart from each other which can result in frustration since you have to possibly play huge chunks of the game again, if you fu-ck up or want to do something differently
 [Gameplay]Im truly glad to have the bartending as a way of interacting with the characters in the game, without this feature, the game wouldnt be half as engaging as it is right now
 Mixing drinks together is fun and thankfully doesnt require a crazy tutorial or anything like that
 Simply mix together the ingredients based on the recipes and you're done with the exceptions of big drinks and a few others
 Manage Jills home between days to spent your hard-earned cash for silly stuff or save up to pay the rent
 You even get tiny bits of lore in her smartphone and the ability to save/load, which can also be done during work-breaks
 What I think is the most important part is the need to satisfy the customers taste through mixing alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks together from scratch
 You are often asked to guess the right drink for the right customer, luckily the game has a built-in list of 24 available recipes to help you with that
 Some clients require you to be quick, remember their favourite drinks or even guess the right one that could trigger new events and story bits
 This is the main way to influence the game's progression and the ending that you will get, so be sure to try something different then the game is telling you
 Just pay attention to your customer and what they order, it might not always be what they really want or need
 A character is depressed and orders something sweet
 Add some alcohol to let him forget about their troubles thanks to optional recipes where you can add as much of it as you want
 [Story]VA-11 Hall-As story revolves around the everyday life of bartender Jill and her customers as well as her boss and co-worker Gillian and many others
 A diverse cast of characters who are relatable, believable and interesting in one way or another and have their own problems and worries in life that you can be a part of
 Even though you don't have any choices during the conversations itself, the discussions are still pretty engaging and well presented making you crave for more
 [Graphics]The visuals are reminiscent of old Japanese adventure games for the PC-98, the first visual novels one could say
 Everything is more detailed though and gives this a very modern look and feel
 Good looking characters also make sure that you are interested in finding out more about them and exactly why they chose your bar of all places
 [Music]Fitting, satisfying style of music fitting a cyberpunk city so incredibly well and dont ask me why but some songs even reminded me of games of my childhood like Zone of the Enders, Final Fantasy VII, Breath of Fire III and countless others
 The soundtrack is certainly one of the bigger contributors to VA-11 Hall-As success
 https://garoad
bandcamp
com/album/va-11-hall-a-second-round [Conclusion]VA-11 Hall-A is an incredible 10-20 hour adventure that is without a doubt one of the best Visual Novels currently available on Steam
 This game is an amazing and mature experience and Im glad that I finally got around to playing it, and do hope a sequel is in the works
 I recommend it to anyone who is interested in Visual Novels with lots of text
 Fans of the cyberpunk will also find great value in this beautiful game

that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A SEQUEL

 I binged through it in 2-3 days, unlocked all the endings and did everything but beat the damn minigame
 BUT MY GOD HAVE I ENJOYED IT
 This little visual novel is a treasure and I have loved every moment of it as it told it's story
 You've got a large cast of diverse and interesting characters, not so huge in scope that anyone who matters loses screen time and not so small that you feel like you've got just one or two regulars who just show up all the damn time
You play as Jill, you have no control over what she says or does outside of what drinks she serves and what she spends her money on
 There's no fanservice (unless the boob jokes and occassional mature conversations count), you only see a character's top half and there's only a few CGs reserved for the intro and epilogue
But believe me when I say that doesn't matter
 That level of interaction is enough and the life and personality present in each and every single character means you're just drawn in
 You'll have your favourite character or three that you grin every time they show up, knowing you're going to delight in seeing more of their world
 You'll have some characters you'll enjoy despite their flaws (or because of it) and you've got a bunch of new world building lore available on your phone every day to help flesh out the world should you choose to indulge
The music was varied enough, the artwork was a treat and the story so engaging and enjoyable I had to burn through this thing in 18 hours stretched over 2-3 days
A word of advice to those who don't want to tread the same ground too many times
 There are a few guides that will help with the choices to make for drinks
 Aside from the bad ending you can net every extra ending alongside the good one in one run
 Of course if you prefer to bludgeon your way through the story time and time again trying to find how to do those endings for yourself, more power to you
$15 is a bit more than you'd spend on a meal
 One meal
 That fills you up for a few hours
 You're getting at least an hours worth of enjoyment per dollar
 If you're looking for a good little story to read over a week or two this is a great pick up
 Pleasant art, nice music, wonderful story with charismatic characters
Money well spent

"But I watched the anime, I don't need to play this, right
"Let-Let me stop you right there
The anime is trash*, plain and simple, but this
 this is another matter entirely
Danganronpa answers the age old question of "What happens if you let a mechanical bear with a despair fetish capture a bunch of highschool students with extreme proficiency in one field and force them to kill each other
"The answer, of course, is one of the most incredible visual novel experiences I've ever had
 Danganronpa takes everything up to 11, shows you what it would look like if you went to 12, and then skips straight to 15
 Everything about it is enthralling and horrifying all at once
 I lost a lot of sleep thinking about this game
Do yourself a favor and just sit down and play it straight through
 Don't read anything else about it
 Don't risk ruining the experience for yourself, because hot damn is it an experience
 Everything after like the first 30 minutes is a game changing spoiler
I can come up with about 11037 more reasons why this game is great, but I'll spare you my ramblings
 Just
 just play it
*This is called comedic hyperbole
 Please read my edits
EDIT 1: In response to some of the comments on this review, let me expand my discussion on the anime a bit
 The anime is a direct adaption of only the most essential elements of the plot of the original PSP game
 The result is next to nothing as far as character development, and the suspense and thrill of solving the crimes is completely eliminated by the investigation/courtroom montages that sort of just
 exposit, with little of interest otherwise
 I have absolutely nothing against the adaption as its own work or even against anime in general
 It's just that when compared to the extremely detailed characterization every single character gets in the game and the satisfaction of actually having to solve all the crimes yourself, the anime falls flat
In short, the anime is definitely not a substitute for actually playing the game
 I hope this helps
EDIT 2: Well
 yes, if you've watched the anime you'll have the plot spoiled for you
 However, like I said, you still only know the gist of how each crime happened
 You still have to actually do all the legwork to prove it, which is still a lot of fun in and of itself
 At least I think so
 Plus, there character events and bonus scenes that can't be seen by just watching the anime
 So if you have any attatchment to the characters, then yes, I do think there is value in playing the game
 If you just wanted the plot, well
 you got it

To whoever plan on playing this gem of a game, a word of advice: do NOT look up anything about it online before you've finished it
 Once you get spoiled there's no going back

SPOILER FREE REVIEW -- [I have beaten this on Vita]Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a deceptive, mystery-driven variety adventure title with visual novel, horror and romance elements
 Sounds like a mouthful
 But this game manages to split these elements proportionally to make them enjoyable and add fuel to the evolving, amazing, storyline that will haunt you for years to come
Originally a PSP title, with multiple ports for years to come, the PC version is more akin to a straight-up port than a HD remake
 Which is fine, and understandable, because it isn't the games' aesthetics which make it one of the best adventure games I've ever played; but its story, characters and setting
Again, spoiler-free, but you play as Makoto Naegi, an average high school boy finding himself trapped in a mysterious building one day with other students; aptly nicknamed given their personality and fashion
 Not long in, there's been a murder and you are put in charge with finding out who murdered said person, by learning about the other characters, finding clues and going into a trial with them ala Ace Attorney
 Speaking of - I feel Danganronpa is a strong franchise which can be compared to the Ace Attorney series as there are identical gameplay elements and quirky design choices
Moving on though, general gameplay consists of room-to-room movement, talking to characters in visual novel-esque, with their beautifully drawn portraits to keep you distracted from the text
 During the trials, there are well-placed, reasonable and sensical QTEs that tie-in with how both the story and gameplay present themselves up until that point
 Your quick fingers, your own intuition and feelings for the characters will make you feel confident, or weasel out of wanting to press those button propmpts
Anyway, for me personally, one of the best portions of the game is its atmosphere: its forboding, compelling, repressive and tense building was mostly on my part because of the direction the game goes
 It
 isn't your typical raincoat detective story, there's nicely used humour, a strange but loveable villain which is introduced early, whacky, bizarre, creative yet at the same time, reverse-stereotypical characters
 But what did it for me
 was the way the game progresses, what happens when each new day passes
 what your consequence is for not finding the murderer quick enough
 All the dread, mystery and tension is added as layers of fear, heh
 At one point, I felt legitamately frightened to continue, but I did anyway knowing what would happen next was going to blow my mind
I can't say enough good things about this game, BUY IT
 BUY IT NOW
 It will be one of the best adventure games you'll play, there is something for everybody in this game, big and small
 This game is a masterpiece

On the surface, this game is just a big bunch of stereotypes put together
 However, this turns out to be one of its biggest strengths
 The game strikes a good balance between rolling with the tropes and subverting them, constantly leading you into an 'obvious' conclusion and then pulling the rug from underneath you
 Then, as soon as you start accounting for this, the game once again switches gears to keep you guessing
 I encountered quite a few unexpected plot twists during my first playthrough of the PSP fan translation a few years back, which was a pleasant surprise given the predictable nature of most video game stories
While the story is still pretty fun even if you do know what's going to happen, if you are currently unspoiled, I suggest you try and keep it that way
 Stay away from forums, don't look online for fan art and for God's sake do not listen to the soundtrack until you finish the game (I managed to spoil myself by reading the tracklist during my first playthrough)
In terms of replayability, I consider the game to be worth at least two playthroughs: there is a lot of clever foreshadowing that you will simply not get on your first playthrough hidden throughout the game and focussing your gift-giving and free time activities on different characters will reward you with additional backstory for them
 As such, I'd say the current asking price is very fair, even for a six-year old port
Aside from buying the game based on its merits, if you are at all interested in seeing similar games get ported from Sony's ill-fated handhelds to Steam, buying Dangan Ronpa is a good signal to companies like Spike Chunsoft that there is, in fact, a market for them
 It's unfortunate for Sony, but thanks to Spike Chunsoft, I won't have to consider buying a Vita (TV) anymore to play the second installment of this series and I sincerly hope that other hidden gems will eventually make their way to Steam as well

Think of Ace Attorney, but full of fast paced and action oriented arguments
 As a person that finished it on the PSP (through unconventional methods) I am very satisfied that it's on steam so I don't have to feel guilty
Also it's another game that is full of spoilers, so Googling is very, very risky
 Wanna search up your favorite character but without spoilers
 Good luck
 Searching up fanart
 Goodbye

There was a character that I really liked
 I hung out with them, gave them a present, learned from them, and we both became better people afterwards
 We were best pals
And then that character got killed
 I am now filled with despair
10/10 Would feel despair again

I enjoyed this third title quite a lot and right now its my favorite from the whole franchise
 Maple and Cinnamon are adorable together, and it was cute to see them both pursuing their dream
 The VN is cute as always and theres a lot of adult scenes (which are censored in the Steam version, but you can buy the R18 patch at Denpasoft to unlock the interesting stuff lol)
9/10
 Even without the patch, it was cute as f*ck, I dont care

This is the story of Marsh, the kid who played it as cool as possible until the bittersweet end
 Obviously, as an American, my study habits are different than that of a Chinese student
 Comparing Gaokao to something like the SAT test is a world of difference
 So for my playthrough of the game, I played it exactly like I do school in real life
 In the beginning, I had it all
 The girlfriend, Muxin, friends, and generally nothing to worry about except the first Simulation test, which was about 30 days away
 There were a surprisingly large amount of activities to choose from when free time was available, so I thought that the game likely wanted me to see what it had to offer
 How wrong I was
 After about 30 days of a happy, cute, almost relaxing little game of high-school antics, I screwed up on the first Simulation test
 After all, I had barely studied at all during my free time
The tone shift after messing up that test was jarring
 The music pretty much ceased altogether, except for this haunting song that played rather frequently when I would have arguments with my dissapointed parents
 Muxin wasn't the same either, as her score was rather low as well
 Marsh used to be a nice kid, after all, I was the one making his decisions for the most part
 After the arguments got more and more intense (to the point where coming home was dreaded), I was no longer able to study
 It wasn't my decision any more, it was my character, Marsh, taking the wheel
 The arguments got worse
 Marsh needed to bring up the test scores, and after talking with Muxin and deciding that the RELATIONSHIP was likely the reason for the low scores, Marsh dumped Muxin after screaming at her about his feelings
 I (the player obviously) had no say in this
 And the arguments kept getting worse
 Marsh's father eventually smacked him a few times
 The game was now very depressing
 After sleeping outside under a bridge, he finally slipped from all that I had made him
 If China wanted him to focus on the test and nothing else, it succeeded
 Marsh snapped
 Test problems became his entire life for the next 50 days
 Grades sky-rocketed, but all of the old characters were nowhere to be seen and health was declining
Eventually, after not eating for days, Marsh collapsed
 And I was given a decision after a LONG time
 Whatever I did, I picked the right thing, because Muxin, Xiaohan, and Stom saved him, and Marsh was back where he belonged
 In the end, I got a decent score and had no girlfriend
This game was an emotional rollercoaster, and it's not just an "anime game", it's WAY more than that
 I HIGHLY recommend it, and I'll be playing through it again very soon
Posted: 4 June, 2015
So basically, I paid $10 for my own biography
Over the course of the visual novel, I broke up with my girlfriend, failed all the important tests that would determine my future and became a video-game addict
 All that's missing is a sub-plot about killing tourists and burying them in the Blue Mountains

As a Chinese student who experienced "ZhongKao", the entrance exam for Chinese high schools, I had similar experience
I could still recall those days when we had endless practice tests, papers, teachers getting crazy and try to raise our score (because they get more bonus
)
 Parents getting worried on us, believing in nonsense extra classes, useless lectures even fake nutrients, is there gonna be an end
And back to GaoKao, a much more serious situation than ever (however I didn't experienced this, but I could imagine)
 How are the students doing
 Endless hell, again
 This is the truth
"You have so many chances to change your destiny, but GaoKao is the only time when your destiny gets decided
" (I played in Chinese so maybe this is not the actual translation) - Ms
 MeiI mostly care about the storyline instead of animation or style
 GaoKao
Love
100Days is reflecting the truth of a typical Chinese high school senior (with girlfriend)
 This might be one of the few games that could actually bring myself into deep meditation
 Masterpiece
Presentation: 9/10Easy to catch up, easy to play
 Although the tutorial was given in-game by his classmate which seems to be a little bit awkward, cookie let the player to speak out his name loud in the beginning of the game is quite interesting actually, especially when you put a funny name in
 Graphics: 9/10Great adapting Japanese's drawing style, however in China everyone wear stupid school uniform
 Umm I said too much
Music: 10/10The only way to judge is to listen
Gameplay: 10/10Not too complicated, not too easy
 But this game offers much more choices than a typical gal-game
Story/Background: 10/10The school, parents, the ambition, so much reality
 Can I give more than 10 points
Overall: 48/50 
Posted: 6 June, 2015
I've recently finished my first playthrough of this game, and was compelled to write a review
 I've played several Dating sims/Galgames, but it's never been my cup of tea, so to speak
 The whole idea felt interesting yet impractical, I didn't expect much from this game when my friend recommended it me
 This game however, is a whole another deal
Currently a college student, the feelings of being a high schooler still lingers inside, and this game has brought it all back
 Once again it hit me: the insecurities, the increasing pressure of schoolwork, the overwhelming want for some love, the struggles, and the urge to be live up to your parents' expectations, your peers' expectations, and perhaps most importantly, your own expectations
 Throughout the game there come times where it was too emotionally difficult for me to continue playing and I had to pull myself away for a minute or two
 You might be skeptical about how I can be so immersed into a seemingly simple game, and yes, I was skeptical about it afterwards
 But if there are teenage memories that you still held dear, play this game and all those will come alive again
 Ive played countless Galgames that are simply made to give the player pleasure out of playing them
 You start the game for 30 minutes and suddenly all 25 girls in the game are devoted to you
 Of course, that is an exaggeration, but you get my point
 This game is an entirely different ballpark: its realistic
 Consequences come when you least expect them, and you have to work hard to pull off anything
 Sometimes there can, and will be times where you just cant do anything about the horrible situation no matter how hard you work, and thats just the way it is
 Yes, it is extremely frustrating and stressful, but isnt that just like real life
Never have I in the course of only a few hours, experienced so many emotions
 I was so ecstatic and overjoyed during the good times that I caught myself smiling at the screen like an idiot several times
 But multiple times my head ached and stomach churned from stress that applied onto me through the main characters words
 When Muxin broke up with me (Sorry, spoiler alert, but this is only one out of 50 ways that the story could go), even though its temporary, I couldnt stop tears from trickling down my cheeks when all these pressure from teachers/parents/myself that Ive been enduring was for her
 Heck, there are so many times when I said something in response to the situation, and the me Im playing as in the game says the exact same thing right as I clicked through the text
 This game really digs deep inside, and I can testify to that
Of course, there are still flaws to this game
 In my opinion, I was able to be so immersed in the game because I understood Chinese
 The voice acting was spectacular (even though could be cringeworthy at times, yes Im talking about Stom), but if you couldnt understand what people are talking about, it really takes you away from the experience
 Also, multiple translation problems are still present in game
 From what I remember (which is not much, since I was so absorbed), the use of auxiliary verbs felt funny, even awkward to me
 For example:Why she do that
 or Why I need to go to school today
Should be something like Why would she do that
 or Why do I need to go to school today

Notice without those auxiliary verbs, the meaning can change drastically
 Why would she do that
 does not equal Why did she do that

 I dont have the Chinese manuscript so I wouldnt know the real intention, but this is something I would like to see fixed, because without these little details, we arent getting the complete meaning behind each line here
In the end, this game blew me away
 Id dare say this game made me actually fell in love with Muxin for the duration of the game, and several days after that, even right now as I type up this review
 This game definitely separates itself from the genre and stands as one of the best, if not the best
 I cant wait to play more and see whats to come, since Ive heard theres a total of 50 ways that the story could go, but Im not sure if I want to experience the emotional trauma of preparing for Gaokao again
 Plus, I love Muxin and Muxin only, so the storylines that doesnt involve heryeah
 Now, because this game is so well made, I guess Id like to recommend the game for you, whoevers reading this
The thing is, Muxin is mine and mine only, so dont do it
 Please

"if brought back to the past,which way would you choose
"I was ever a senior high school student in China ,same as the characters in this game, 1 year ago
i cried when i finished the game and got the end 10,the warmth of Xiaohan
Do you know
There was ever a girl in my life,a little similar to Xiaohan
 Oh,but she was not my neighbor
She appeared in front of me,like a godness,She made me know, what is the feeling when you fall in love with a girl
She made me know, if you love a girl,how happy will you feel when you see her smile
But,she also made me know, what is "pain"and what is "regret"
I lost her 
Both of us were under the control of our parents,teachers and the Chinese education systerm
And i feared being refused by her,even i knew,she wouldn't
I am a coward
I hate myself forever
Xiaohan is her,it is my first idea when i saw the Xiaohan in screen,then I made the decisions opposed to the reality
But Xiaohan isn't her
I have lost forever
Every day without she is like a book without pages
I don't know how she is now
I lost in touch with her
But I always recall her at night
 I always worry if there is a boy who will dash away her tears when she cry
 I always worry if there is a boy who wil
make her laugh when she is bored
 I always worry if there is a boy who will remind her of
dressing more when the winter comes
I really hope there is a boy besides her,who can look after her and give her happiness instead of me,though he is not me
To be honest,my English is not good
But I insist on setting down it by English,because I want you to know something
I don't know where you come from
Maybe US,UK or Australia
Millions of Chinese boys envy the freedom you have
So ,don't waste the freedom
When you see the girl sent to you by god
Put her hand in your hand,and say"I love you"
Don't be a coward like me

Positive:- # of endings (over 60
)- A relatively short dating simulator/time simulator with about 6 hours of gameplay
- Great story- Great character designs- Great music- Great characters- Lots of Achievements- Low priceCons:- The 100 days, of which you have to play through every single one, can seem long at times
- You can only do one choice/action a day (besides phone calls, changing
your helping items, etc
)- You can only increase one subject per day- The English translation was off because whoever translated it into English from Chinese did not have a strong enough grasp of English or proof readers
 It detracted from the experience and immersion a bit
 There were misspelled words, words in the wrong order, missing articles, etc
- The music drowned out the voices a bit
 (At default setting)- You can feel helpless at times going through the game (especially going trough it blind)
- Lack of default names except for one
 I would like to name my character something other than "Lee"
 And I don't know if that's his first name or last name
- Flashing bug ((The screen flashes sometimes during cutscenes))- The game affects Steam broadcasting, making it hard to live stream the game
- I can't figure out how to play the DLC Gaokao
Love
100 Days - Yes Monitress
Overall:I really enjoyed the game and thought it was lovely
 I've reached one ending at the time of writing this (Ending 39), and will definitely go back and play some more
 Another good thing is after you beat the game once you can skip read dialogue (default setting)
 I look forward to diving back into the world and
playing it through blind a few more times
 If China really has to go through Gaokao like this, then it's quite harsh
 All I have to compare it to the SAT, which doesn't hold a candle to it
Posted: 3 June, 2015
This game is exceptionally entertaining and engaging for Asians that had stressful public exams
People studying in the West may not feel that stress during the exam preparation period due to different education system , family and society conditions
The game well protrayed the what if you have a girl friend before public exam situation and the tricky thing is how do you spend your time
 All in for studying 
 All for dating
 Just like those harsh choices in real life
The game content is quite rich and consists of many endings
 It worths a lot more than 9 USD
The soundtrack ,artwork and character design is quite good
 The only thing i hate about this game is the poor CV for certain supporting characters and not all the characters got their voice
Sometimes the game crashes and i have to play all over again
 So, save the game constantly
It is a good try from Chinese developer
 Good Job
 You have set a new standard for the industry

This game made me cry, made me sad, made me depressed, and made me happy
 This game is such a feel twister and mood twister
 This game will make you tear and happy at times
 This game is great, this was the best 10$ I spent on steam so far
 This game has so many endings and routes to take that it never gets old
 If you're looking for a game to keep you hooked this game is for you, just do me a favor
 Don't cry waterfalls like I did
 *Sigh*
Posted: 7 September, 2015
First, I'd just like to say that this game makes me really thankful that I didn't grow up in China
 Gaokao seems like the SATs put on steroids
 Anyway, I have so far completed 12 endings out of the 57 (
) in the game, in 40 hours of gameplay
 As a result, I definitely recommend this game to people who are looking for a game that will take a long time to complete, and will provide many hours of entertainment
 The storyline in the game is absolutely amazing, and so is the character developments of Muxin and Xiaohan
 There are quite a few translation errors in this game, so I wouldn't recommend it for those who care so much about grammar
 Completing all the routes in this game will take a lot of help from game guides, and the only really good one is pretty vague in its descriptions
 If you're looking for a story-rich game that will give many hours of entertainment, or even if you just want to complete only a few routes, I would definitely recommend this game

I'm 29 years old and just over 2 months ago i lost my job
 I have worked hard since i left school at 17 and in the past 2 years i grinded my way into a nice promotion at a job where a lot of people hate or see as a dead end career wise
 I'm going through the toughest time of my life right now with personal issues and the troubles that come along with being unemployed during a crisis in your life is weighing heavy on me
 Don't worry this is not a sob story, everything ties in with the game
So, being depressed and unable to get out of bed and generally live my life ( no exaggeration i swear ) i found myself reading up on old video games that i loved as a kid, in an attempt to try and feel happy again
 Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VIII were my favorite games growing up
 In recent years i haven't been that much into games as i was as teenager
 Work commitments and adulthood takes a hold of you and gaming kind of took a back seat
Anyway, i stumbled upon Trails In The Sky FC whilst reading up on good JRPGS on Steam ( JRPG's were my thing as a kid )
 I saw one review that described Trails as better than Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VII, and it was going so cheap on Steam, i had to see what the fuss was about
 Thank god i did
As i played FC and SC consecutively i'll count this as a combined review but as i mentioned above
 I haven't played games much in recent years and an in depth review is something i wouldn't be good at so i'll keep it short and sweet
First things first, the storyline in this game is absolutely fantastic, So many good characters and interactions, a lot of text to read through but i love that
 A game without good text/dialogue will struggle to be a good game
 Trails has the best storyline i have ever came across in a game
 It's very long but well worth it, look at it this way
 Would The Lord Of The Rings be the story it was if it were not a gigantic beast of a novel
 This kind of is the same with Trails
 It's a slow burner at the the start but about 20 hours into FC it picks up and does not stop
 It grips you in and will have you laughing, crying and screaming before you know it
The characters and character relations are amazing
 Sometime the highlights for me weren't beating a tough boss or finishing long quests/chapters it was the small moments when the full team are together and each individual character shines through in the dialogue
 Simply fantastic
I had mentioned before playing SC that the only thing i could say that was keeping it from being the complete game was the music, although the music is great i did say that it wasn't comparable to say a Nobou Uematsu score ( but what is eh
 )
 I'm going to backtrack on this now, after playing SC ( Which is considerably longer than FC ) i can say that the music is absolutely fantastic
 It's up there with Nobou's Chrono Trigger soundtrack for me now
Well, that's about as much as i can say without tangling myself up in knots over a game review
 The reasons i wanted to write this wasn't to critique the game but to get the message out there that games ( no matter what your preference is ) are magical
 I'm now in better spirits and feeling more optimisitc about life after finishing this game
 Yes, that may sound sad to some people but the joy this game brought to me will be something i will forever cherish
 Given the impact this game has had on me, it will now be my " Greatest Game Of All Time "
 Sometimes you need somthing in your life to pick you up and Trails was my shoulder to cry on
 Thanks Falcom and Xseed, you basically saved my life
If you like long JRPG's with amazing storytelling, characters, combat systems and addictive side quests
 You need to get this game
 It's an absolute must
10/10

I don't even know where to begin
 I finished the game today and loved it enough to immediately want to write a review, but
 frankly, I can't find the words
 Let's start with the ending, perhaps: this is by far the best JRPG on Steam, and one of the best of all time
With that aside, let's gets down to business: this game is a direct sequel to another game on Steam entitled simply "The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky"
 You should absolutely not play this game if you haven't played the previous title first, because this game is an incredibly direct sequel to it
 That game, henceforth "FC" (for "First Chapter"), should prove to be a pretty decisive litmus test determining whether or not you'll like this game -- and if you're on the fence, know that SC has everything FC did well and more
As you should know from FC, there are a few things that will either make or break the game for a lot of people:-This is a turn-based game-This is a game from the mid-2000s-This game heavily involves anime-like aesthetics in its character and world designAnd if any of those things turned you off, SC won't really change them
 If you're fine with all three of those things, though, then you're in for a real treat
 SC is basically the perfect sequel to FC, expertly answering many questions FC asked and resolving a great number of personal conflicts, taking great pain to give character even to those who previously had little
 The orbment system is drastically refined for the better, and while combat is largely the same, the greater focus on crafts makes it feel significantly more strategic
 The game as a whole feels more challenging than FC even from the outset, but never to the point where it feels unfair -- at least, on Normal mode -- so that extra bit of strategy is necessary
 Even the artwork is nicer and crisper than anything from FC, and the soundtrack is just as excellent as you'd expect from Nihon Falcom
 And, of course, the localization -- the part that took four years, you might remember -- is just as high-quality as the excellence that was this game's predecessor, worth every second of effort XSEED and others put into it
To those who find no issue with the three points above, this game might well be one of the best things you ever play
 In all my hours of playing the game (66, and not even on a completionist run), I only had two trivial issues: a somewhat slow prologue and enemies that feel a touch too bulky at two specific points in the game
 Both of these things are fairly transient and do little to diminish the game's overall quality, which shines through at almost every other point
This game's predecessor released in English over four years ago
 Ever since then, I've been waiting patiently for this title
 Four years of hype, four years of expectations
 and I'm the sort of person too prone to disappointment to ever get hyped for anything anymore
 And with this game finished, it would be an understatement to say that I'm not disappointed
 Every expectation I had was met, every bit of hype I had was exceeded, and this game will likely end up being one of the most satisfying experiences I've ever had
 If you're reading this, you had the luxury of not waiting that long -- and you'll likely find the game even better for it
I give this game no less than the highest recommendation I possibly can
 This game is the culmination of practically a decade of work between Nihon Falcom's development and XSEED's localization; I thank both of them, from the bottom of my heart, for the many wonderful hours I spent playing the game
 My only wish now is that other people can share in the joy I felt while playing Trails in the Sky SC

Pre-ReviewThis 'review' is aimed to help players interested in, but not yet resolved to buy the game, so to say it is not yet a complete review but I will definitely update it as I progress in the story
SummaryJust a quick overview of what I can already tell you
For this game, even more so than the first one - you will be reading
 A lot
 But even if you are not into reading I do advise this game to you, it may even change your opinion on the topic altogether
Positive Mediocre Negative
+ Finally the conclusion ~ definitely don't play it if you haven't finished FC
+ NPCs welcome you home ~ don't know if it's from my save file of FC
+ Breathtaking locations (old and new)
+ MORE loveable characters ~ you still have to part with them at some points
+ Improved Orbment -> more Arts
+ More Crafts, especially Chain Crafts
+ I found the 'moving' more useful
~ is it just me
+ Extremely fun minigames
+ Still beautiful art style ~ and still old textures
+ HD Portraits of characters in dialogues ~ for important characters only
+ Goosebumps music ~ not the opening of FC
~ no more all different chest-catchphrases
+ Increased replay value
RecommendationIf you haven't played through The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (First Chapter) yet, don't consider playing this game either
Better head back there, read my review ;-), get this masterpiece of a game, play through it and then come back here
 Seriously, this is in your best interest since this game is a direct spoiler to the first one, the best would be to not even watch the trailer and not to go into the community hub of this game
If on the other hand you played through the first one and still couldn't get yourself to buy this one - then I don't understand you
Second Chapter takes off where FC left you and you will definitely feel right back at home in this game, the music is great as ever, the atmosphere takes you in and you want to keep playing until the end
In the first two hours I played the game it already brought me to the edge of tears and made me laugh out loud in front of my PC - just to convey some of the early feelings in the game
So do yourself a favor and grab it
And if that still couldn't change your opinion - you can defeat enemies with Estelle's cooking - I guess some Monsters would die to get a bite ;-)CombatYou can really tell they made an effort to improve the combat in this sequel and
 they succeeded
If you read my review of FC you know about my opinion on turn-based combat and the combat in this series and they made me enjoy myself even more with the additions they made
 OK, I'm not to sure on this one, this will need some confirmation ;-)
 I used the 'moving' in my first 12h more than in the 52h of playing the first one
 Somehow it felt more useful and the delay until the next attack not so huge
 At certain points 'moving' is the only logical move to make - to dodge an enemy's attack, get into the healing range of an AoE-heal or position yourself for your own AoE attack
I still have a slight problem with the mechanic of it, but then again I found it more useful
Secondly, the introduction of a brand new - fresh out of the Central Factory - Orbment, (check back my review of FC for explanations) which enables you to use more quartz resulting in higher stats and, more importantly, more arts to play with, turns diversity in combat up a notch
Last but not least due to your extensive training as a 'Senior Bracer' you acquire the ability to utilize a new, so-called 'Chain-Craft' which lets your party members join in an attack that grows stronger in range and damage the more combatants take part in it
Naturally you will also gain access to new 'normal' crafts for each bracer you get to add to your fellowship, as their levels increase
Additionally, as I already mentioned above - you can now use certain kinds of food to hit your foes with, with different damage and varying 'target systems' (if anyone knows a better word, tell me please), meaning if it will effect a circle around your enemy, a line outgoing from the point you are standing at, etc
Mini-GamesOh boy, I love minigames and they added some in this game, namely gambling and fishing
Of my first about 8h or so, about 1
5h were spend doing these activities
While gambling you can choose from a slot-machine, poker, black-jack and roulette
After exchanging some of your mira for medals, you can start in the fun of losing it to the bank again
 Personally, I enjoyed poker the most (as I did not lose as hard there)
For fishing, you will need a fishing rod, bait and obviously - a place to dip your pole into
 Different combinations of all these factors will result in a different game (mostly location and bait, but without the right rod and line you can't utilize higher level bait), but stay focused not to let those slippery suckers get away
ThanksOn the one hand to Nihon Falcom who developed this series and on the other one, even more so to XSeed and Carpe Fulgur for putting in all the localization work including all the extras they made for us to enjoy and the great translation
Also, remember that it cost these companies a lot of blood, tears, sweat and the tiny thing that some people tend to forget - money
 Well, we can't help much with all those body liquids but the latter one is something we can help them with
So don't be a cheapskate, get this game - full price - so that we all may enjoy wonderful localizations of this series to come
BugsQuite a few bugs already got fixed, for those still in the game read this thread to see how bad it still is and how to fix problems if you encountered some yourself
Personally, I didn't have any problems whatsoever
NoteAs this is a pre-review you might as well not do anything yet, since I will change the whole thing over but otherwise --I hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like

I was planning to just write ''best game ever'' and leave it at that
 But eh, knowing ol' Bokxie here, he isn't satisfied with just that
Actually, I am, but allow me to elaborate
 There are few games out there that to world building and character development as well as this game (and the first game of course)
 This game does take it's time for that, but look past that and you have a masterpiece on your hand
 Likewise, I also took my time because I wanted to see and know everything the world of Trails has to offer
 Half of the game's dialogue is just optional world building, but I wanted to read them because it's done so well
 And even though you revisit Liberl again in this game, it is not a repetitive and boring return
 The sequel does enough to make Liberl a lively place yet again
 And yeah, the characters in the first game return, and become even better in this game with more story behind them
 Also a few new faces I definitely welcome
That is not to say the gameplay is lacking either
 The gameplay is well done for a JRPG
 Nothing that stands out from other JRPGs, but it is very engaging, and some of the boss battles in this game were some of the most intense I had in any JRPG out there
 The OST also helped with that, setting the mood perfectly in whatever situation it demanded
I mean, I could go on and on, but I think I made my point clear
 The only negatives I could come up with relate to personal preferences, like the game being long and taking it's time
 If you do mind that, then maybe this isn't the game for you, and that's exactly what Trails in the Sky is: a masterpiece if you can appreciate it taking it's time to develop itself
 If not well
 then I can't guarantee you'll like it
 You can play the first game, which is also very good and while the games are directly related to each other, the first game's still has an ending for that game, though with a cliffhanger for the second game
 If you enjoyed that game, you can always come back here and see if you want to play the game
I mean, I have played tons of JRPGs, and for over a decade Final Fantasy VI was my favourite game
 And then suddenly this game comes along and aims to rob that place, with the both of them sharing the honour of being my favourite game now
 I love this game to death, and even after finishing it I just wanted to continue
 This game is wonderful, an experience I am glad I was able to play myself

This is a special game
Picking up right where the first chapter left off, Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC brings us back to the wonderful land of Liberl, and if feels just as vibrant and real as it did before
Much like the first entry, when analyzing the individual pieces that make up this game, it may not sound like a revolutionary experience
But the level of detail and effort that is poured into the whole thing really elevates the experience into something far more than the sum of its parts
Not only do the main characters change and grow in believable and appropriate ways as the story progresses but so too do hundreds, yes hundreds, of minor characters that populate the setting
Its the kind of storytelling that is only really available to games
Trails in the Sky SC does it with style
While it may not change anyones mind about JRPGs as a genre, I wholeheartedly and unreservedly recommend the Trails in the Sky games
Posted: 6 December, 2015
In Chapter 4, there is a segment of the story where, if you choose to visit the general store, you can spend a little bit of money to buy chocolate for your party members that have been staying up patrolling the whole night
 This action does not change the course of the main story or unlock additional sidequests or equipment
 It provides absolutely no benefit other than a couple of lines of dialogue
It is the little details like these, put into the game with the hearts of the developers, that are what makes Trails in the Sky SC amazing
Trails in the Sky is not an open world sandbox game, but the amount of effort put into the world and characters of the story is simply astounding
 Your party members are a vibrant, well-developed cast of some of the most memorable characters you will meet, and a great deal of thought was put into each and every line of dialogue as the characters interact with each other, bringing their personalities to life
 The NPCs which inhabit the cities and villages of Liberl are also lavished upon the same treatment, with almost all the NPCs having unique names and distinct personalities, down to even the airship crew and shop owners
 And given that all of the NPC dialogue changes after each segment of the main story, you'll also be able to follow the little happenings in their daily lives
 Yes that's right---most NPCs in the game have their own mini-storylines, a few which will tie into your Bracer Guild sidequests, but most which are just their to simply add life to the world
 My favourite of these even spans multiple regions and games, involving the grandma of Rinon, your Rolent General Store owner, who wants to find a wife for her son
 She eventually gives up on Rolent and travels to Grancel at the end of FC, to no success
 On the airship back though, she meets Kitty, a tea seller girl from Edel Department store, who is on the way to Bose, and gets along quite well with her (while her sister rejoices at being able to take over as #1 tea seller)
 Well, thanks to the airships being grounded, Kitty ends up working at the store in Rolent, and Rinon while suspicious of his grandma, can't help but admire the girl's enthusiasm and hard work
 Later, in Chapter 8 the wedding of a couple (whose story began in FC, and whose ring you retrieve on a sidequest in Chapter 4) takes place, and well, no points for guessing who catches the bridal bouquet
 To anyone who loves a sprawling world with many secrets and lifelike characters, I can't recommend Trails in the Sky more

Awesome JRPG
 One of my all time favorites
The soundtrack is gorgeous
10/10

I just finished Trails in the Sky the 3rd after playing all three games - and while they're all fantastic, I have to say of the three Sky games that Trails in the Sky SC is my favourite
 The characters are all incredible, the story is lovely, and the script writing is fantastic
 The music, in my opinion, is the best in the whole Trails series
 (Although the 3rd was a close second
) However, this may seem obvious but just in case - I recommend that you do not pick up Trails in the Sky SC unless you have beaten Trails in the Sky FC first, as it is the second half of a story and picks off immediately after the ending of FC

I am a pretty, pretty princess
When trying to become Queen I got stabbed, shot, poisoned, burned to a crisp, and rule 34ed Japan style
10 out of 10, would die again
Long Live the Queen is a Visual Novel game that, instead of trying to simply win the hearts of others and fall in love, you try to survive the horrors of royal life with your head intact
Of course, it doesn't help when everyone is a bloodthirsty murderer who's only desire is to bring forth the death of a fourteen year-old girl
Seriously, what the hell is wrong with them
You take the role of Princess Elodie, who needs to be trained to be a proper queen because Disney dictates that no princess is allowed to have a living mother
You end up making all the decisions because your father is a lazy bum who's shirked off all of his responsibilities, but for some reason won't let you have your mother's keepsake
The kingdom is a mess, everyone is evil, and no matter what you do you just can't seem to save this poor little traumatized girl
The mechanics of the game play on themselves in a bit of a cycle
You can upgrade Elodie's stats; which can increase slowly or rapidly based on her mood; which is based on events that have happened; which are based on your choices as well as her stats; which are upgraded accordingly based on her mood; which is ba-- ah you get the idea
This means that every decision, even the first one, can drastically affect how the story unfolds
No two games are alike, unless you purposefully do everything in the exact same way every time
But that's boring
Because of the above mentioned do-it-all-the-same concept, you can technically beat the game as many times as you like after you find out how to do it once
But beating the game is not where this game shines
Sure, acquiring the crown and becoming Queen Elodie is a grand event in itself; only if you get there (because you will die, and die a lot)
But one of the greatest things about this game is the ability to make different choices every time and see where it leads you
Find out what is down each path and discover what you can and can't get away with
And more importantly, unlock all the outfits because they're cute
Proper wardrobe is the pinnacle detail between ratty princesses and pristine queens
All in all, it is a great game and I'd recommend it to anyone
Wait
 you can learn magic
HELLZ YEAH

The first time I played this game I died fairly deep into it because I had not properly leveled decorating like a good princess
It only got better from there
I tried a perfect princess, died
I tried a warrior queen, died
I tried a mix, a little Sansa a little Aria, I died
By the time I finally won the game I had sunk invading fleets, executed half my family and awoken something evil in the dark and deep, and I was beloved by all those still alive
Simply put the game is amazing and you should get it

ELODIE WHY WOULD YOU PUSH AN ARROW DEEPER INTO THE WOUND TO REMOVE IT I KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BATTLEFIELD MEDICINE BUT RAMMING SOMETHING POINTY INTO YOUR ORGANS DOES NOT MAKE THE WOUND BETTER IT MAKES YOU DIE FASTER

Despite its girly appearances, the game involves a lot of strategy, and thinking to help the princess live, gain reputation, and overall being a great queen
 You make choices that effect the story and various paths to discover and explore (Its possible to complete the game with nothing in combat)
 However, one event at the end can not be changed no matter what choices you choose which causes the game to be somewhat linear
 The music was diverse and amazing in my opinion and helped set the tone of the game depending on the situation
 Gameplay could have been better for example more scenes, and backgrounds
 If you enjoy visual novels, this is a great game for you
 However, I feel the price of the game is a bit too much for the amount of gameplay and would recommend waiting till it goes on sale if you plan on purchasing the game
Posted: 25 November, 2013
This is a game of trial and error, educated guesses, and mood management
 If any of those three things sound unappealing to you, you may want to stay away from this game
Have you ever played a visual novel
 This game resembles one
 Half of the game is background images with text boxes on top of them, and the other half is menus
 However, this is not a visual novel
 The story is very light in this game, and forgettable
 This leaves the gameplay to keep you interested:Your princess has a large number of stats, ranging from singing, decoration and dancing, to swords, polearms and archery
 You increase these stats by assigning two classes each day
 At the end of a day, you choose from several different activities, which alter your mood
Her mood is important because it directly affects how quickly you increase skills during the daily classes
 The "depression" mood happens to increase the "decoration" skill faster
 Increasing skills is everything in this game, because it runs on a set schedule of story events
 These happen at the same time and start off exactly the same, but the way your princess reacts to them depends entirely on how you've chosen to raise her skills
 This is the mood management I mentioned
 You are often asked to choose an action during story segments, and these can alter the story greatly - or instantly kill you
The educated guesses and trial and error come from that, and of the fact that you cannot possibly predict when you will need a particular skill
 Your princess will randomly be stabbed, poisoned, etc
 and if you don't have the right skill high enough, that's all folks
 The fun of this game is from starting a fresh game after each death, and planning how you will raise your princesses' skills this time to accomodate the story event you just died on
If this doesn't sound like something you would enjoy, I would have to advise you to avoid this game, as it is ALL it has to offer
 I personally got about ten hours out of it, and I'll probably go back for more someday, but this kind of experience may just not appeal to you

I'm gonna start saying that I bought Lucy just for the sake of buy something and 3 months went away before I decided to finally play it
 Now that I've finished the game I can safely say that I want to punch myself in the face for not playing this earlier because Lucy ended being one of my favorite Visual Novels, this is coming from someone who has read a whole lot of them
Okay so, what's Lucy about
 Trying to not spoil anything (because the story is the main focus of this VN), the game is set in a distant future where Androids are a normal thing to have in every house mostly to help in household chores, you are a 18 year old boy that the game refers as to "You" (yes for 99% of the game we don't know the Main Protagonist name, but luckily that's not a problem because the game is written in a way that the MC's name isn't important until the very very end) who absolutely hates those Androids for reasons that the game eventually explains, one day coming back from school you decide to cross a junkyard to save some time and you find an Android on the middle of this junkyard that was going to be destroyed in a matter of minutes if you don't "save" it, obviously you saved it because reasons and repair it, this Android who calls herself Lucy Valentine ends up being one if not the most advanced Android ever created who can mimick a person even better than a real person, with this premise we start to live our daily lifes with Lucy at our side who suddenly changes everything on it
The game starts slow by creating the scenario that will make the reader eventually ask himself questions like "Does a machine can ever have feelings
", "Does her feelings are even real
", "Do androids are really inferior to humans
", "It even matters if she is an android or a human
"
 What comes next is a story about morale and ethics, a story that made me feel anger to some characters, sadness as to what was happening and nerviousness to think what could possibly happen next, and at the end of everything when I finally reached the ending (which the game has two) it gave me a plot twist that no way in hell I was expecting that made me cry so much but also made me incredibly happy
The fact that this 5 hour visual novel made me feel the things that I mentioned in the last paragraph when I didn't have a single expectations when I first started the game is the reason why I 100% recommend this game at full price if you are both interested in starting in the world of Visual Novels or if you are already a veteran
To end this review I want to mention that I usually don't make reviews like this but after finishing the game I had the urge to write one as a thanks to the developers for making this game
Posted: 7 October
-Spoiler Free-I started out really disliking this Visual Novel
 As someone who has played many, many Visual Novels over the past few years, several things really stood out to me as incredibly irritating about this one
 On the surface, this visual novel gets everything right that most VNs can't, and gets everything wrong that even nukiges manage to do decently
Until you get towards the end, that is
The protagonist comes off as an angsty, brooding teenager that is incapable of any kind of reasonable decision making or conflict-resolution
 This isn't the case

Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- developed by Modern Visual Arts Laboratory or "Mvizlab" in short and published by Modern Visual Arts Laboratory themselves they are an indie game development team made in Korea and is very new but to my surprise their first visual novel is surprisingly good I was not expecting this quality at all
 In Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- players are given choices to make in the game and depending on your choices it will change the outcome of the story
 It features 2 or 3 endings
 1 of them being a Bad end and the other being a Good end
 Relevant links will be can be found below
The StoryLucy ~The eternity she wished for~ is a Visual Novel, about a boy and an android
 You play as the boy, who faces decisions and moral dilemmas that he struggles constantly in this near-future world
In the near future, androids have become the way of the norm they can be found everywhere in human daily lives
 Emotionless husks of metal have become a part of human society, much to the dismay of the boy because he had always preferred the "old methods"
 The robot he found at the dump site though, this one was different
 It laughed, it cried, it smiled, just like a human It has emotions
Audio and Visual elementsBackground, CGs
art  Backgrounds are generally average nothing too fancy to talk about the background art, but as for the CGs I felt it is a little wasted not saying that it is bad in anyway but the CGs they tend to use glares to cover up the background which makes it bright which is good, but at the same time taking away the atmosphere that it could have been created with backgrounds to add more to the game as a whole
 Something which caught my attention is that the UI or menu is very beautifully done I love the direction off the VN that it makes the menu and UI looks very realistic which contributes greatly to the overall atmosphere
Audio Elements  Nothing really stand out for the audio elements except for the fact that it cues in nicely and properly to fit in with the mood of the characters in turn manages to set the atmosphere perfectly every time
 There is also voice acting for Lucy available both in Korean and Japanese voice
To sum upTo sum up will I recommend Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- 
 Simple answer yes, it is well worth your time and money for sure and for people who likes a sad story or maybe Sci-Fi be sure to get this game

The steady advance of technological progress has brought us many unforeseen challenges
 With robotics and AI slowly but surely encroaching on what we used to think of as uniquely human, we are confronted with the question of what makes us so special and on what basis we deem ourselves superior to the intelligent beings we create
 Take this cerebral topic and intermingle it with some comedy, drama and romance, and what you get is one of the most promising indie VN releases of the year
Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- is a short visual novel developed and published by Modern Visual Arts Laboratory
 Set in a mostly contemporary world where robots and AI are ubiquitous and have almost reached the point where they are difficult to distinguish from humans, it tells the story of how a prototype android upsets the fickle balance in a conservative family critical of such technology
 A chance encounter has the teenaged main character take "Lucy" from the junkyard, pitting her exuberance against his cynicism and ensuring comedy hijinks as well as drama and tragedy
 While his struggles to integrate Lucy into his daily life play out on one timeline, the story intersperses snippets from the android research laboratory about the man (referred to as "Doctor") who pours all of his energy into assembling Lucy and protecting her from government interference, leaving the reader to hypothesize early on about how Lucy ended up at the junkyard
In terms of visual novel mechanics, Lucy packs few surprises
 The above average amount of choices packed into its three to five hour main story leads to many of them feeling a bit railroad-y, even though there are multiple endings to be conquered
 The visual presentation is crisp and polished, the backgrounds and CGs are of a high quality
 While there is nothing wrong with any one character sprite by itself, at times their visual styles are noticeably different, which can make scenes look incoherent (some more than others)
 The soundtrack is fitting but not particularly memorable
 Korean and Japanese voiceovers are provided
 The lack of multiplatform support (the VN is available for Windows only) is regrettable
 Something that is definitely worth pointing out is the absurd amount of post-game content and alternate endings that bumped my own reading time from just three hours all the way up to five  I am a quick reader though, and looking at the reviews, playtimes of anywhere between 7 to 10 hours seem within the norm
 The post-game content also provided the story with some much-needed rounding out, so you will most definitely want to keep reading after the credits roll for the first time
Thematically the VN attempts to cover a lot of ground
 At face value there is the "cute robot girl" story, which would have been easy to turn into clichéd "fated love" schlock, but thankfully the story stays very light on the romance elements and delivers its tender budding affection so subtly that you could almost miss it
 Lucy's character itself is less immune to clichés, seeing as she is rooted firmly in the "clumsy, ditzy, caring but naive" tradition of robot girls, and her characterization is at least consistent and believable even if it's not innovative
 Most of the situational humor falls in line with what you would expect from this part of anime culture, with Lucy being oblivious of her surroundings and the main character having to clean up behind her
More interestingly, the story also makes a more than solid effort at tackling the philosophical questions that arise when robots become almost indistinguishable from humans
 For example, part of the story's tension is derived from the question of what grants one's identity if memories as well as body parts can be replicated and replaced as needed (the Ship of Theseus is even mentioned by name)
 As a narrative theme, the idea of artificially created humans has a long literary tradition
 VN aficionados will of course tend to notice the many parallels to planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~, both overt and more abstract, but in the broader cultural world the concept dates back at least to the story of Pygmalion and Galatea of Ancient Greece and the golem from Jewish folklore, and has had one of its major spotlight moments in the form of Shelley's Frankenstein, which Lucy's story also reflects in many ways
 Now, like then, the question is posed what it is that supposedly makes us humans more deserving of a self-determined life than the ones we create as our servants
 The VN is not shy about exploring these questions even at the expense of subverting its own characters (such as when the protagonist shows a
knowledge of Schopenhauer uncharacteristic for a teenager who claims to have no interest in formal education)
Another topic that Lucy tackles is the question of labor automation
 Androids capable of sophisticated reasoning are pushing humans out of the workforce because electricity is much cheaper than minimum wage
 In the world of the VN, this seems to be just as much of an open question still as it is in ours
 This topic manifests itself very clearly in the character of the protagonist's father, who I suspect is hostile to the point of belligerence towards androids because he identifies so deeply with his work and considers his role as a productive employee the central aspect of his own sense of purpose
For all its interesting thematic points, there are also aspects of Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- that I had to grapple with, the biggest one being the general unlikability of the main character
 A lot of this can be explained away by his age and familial situation, but with as many external sources of tension as the story possesses, I wish they had relied less on the protagonist's egotism and carelessness as a source of drama, since it tends to strain the immersion
 In terms of minor nitpicks, I didn't care for how the screen showing Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics was used as a scene transition, since clicking through it every time quickly became tedious
Overall, Lucy is a very well-written story that profits especially from the aforementioned post-game content
 Even though this review is, as always, as free of spoilers as I can manage, I absolutely cannot avoid highlighting the brilliance of the final reveal during the true ending that astonishingly weaves everything together and tempts the reader to start the story over again right away
 It's just one moment out of many, but I appreciate the careful construction of the story leading up to it immensely
Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- stands on the shoulders of giants and it knows it
 Its themes have been explored in other works before and the VN has references aplenty
 However, it is still a worthwhile story on its own that is sharp and polished and has everything a good visual novel would need
 If you absolutely cannot stand ditzy anime girls, this may be too much to stomach, but if you're up for a cutesy tale about existentialism and sociotechnical progress, you can't go wrong here
Posted: 28 February, 2016
Straight to the point:Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- is definitely a Visual Novel worth experiencing
Simply stated:Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- is a thought provoking and emotional tale
The art is lovely and gives the characters life in the story
The music of the soundtrack is spot on,
both provoking and enhancing the experience
Production values are high and quality immediately apparent
What it's about:A coming of age story for a young man almost completely at odds with his world and his relationship with Lucy, an android he came to know by chance
Through his eyes we examine the role of technology in human society and effects upon that society
Through his experiences, we question aspects of "nature vs
 nurture" with regard to individual beliefs
Within the experiences surrounding his fateful discovery, we question what it is that makes a human "real"
From his experiences, we question values, what is love and what it is to love
My impression:One will smile, laugh, scowl, grimace and possibly cry during the course of the tale
The overall atmosphere of the story has elements reminiscent of Planetarian and Narcissu, while the story touches issues in a manner that reminds me of scifi films A
I and Bicentennial Man
The tales journey, as with life, is not always an easy one, but is worth the effort
Judgement:Recommended
Notes:
1- In addition to Steam, I have 10 hrs of play on my Playism copy
2- My review was made after achieving a couple ends prior to finding the True End
 Having now finished the True End (11
5 hrs in), like I said initially, this is a Visual Novel worth experiencing
3- With achievements and
extras to unlock, replay value is also good with this lovely work
Ahhh, the smiles
Posted: 11 December, 2016
TL;DR - Buy this
 You won't regret it
 [Don't read if you don't like UI related spoilers]I've never been a fan of visual novels
 None of them managed to hold me long enough to make it to the end
 Then came along Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For-This game showed up in my recommendations list one day and I saw the "Overwhelmingly Positive" response
 Then I started reading the reviews and thought, can a visual novel really make that big an impact
 So I decided to pick it up and try for myself
The story started out strong but then started to drag and I started feeling bored
 I dropped the game about 3 hours of playing (spread over 2 days)
 4 days later I came back because I really wanted to see what the fuss was all about
Then the ending came along and the credits rolled and it didn't have that much of an impact on me
 Once the credits finished and the main menu showed up, there were some jumbled letters instead of the "Start" button
 I thought it a bug and restarted the game, but they were still jumbled
 So I clicked on them
Then the REAL ending played
 And boy-oh-boy did I gush like a baby at the impact this sequence had on me
 I buried my face in my pillow and cried until I could cry no more
I've not been hit so hard by emotions for a long time and I thank the developers for bringing such an experience

Beautiful StorylineBeautiful SoundtracksBeautiful ScenesA true masterpiece
10/10
Posted: 3 March, 2016
Funny, Heart Warming, Gut Wrenching, Sadness, Anger , thought provoking and REAL are all things I felt or thought when reading this Visual Novel
As someone who has read many visual novels , graphic novels and comics, this is one of the finest things I have ever read
 PERIOD
I laughed, I cried tears of sadness, tears of joy,
I bit my tongue in anger, Questioned what defines life truly and most importantly I was touched inside and began to question some of my own demons in my life
 I will say that the people who wrote this were not your run of the mill writers, but were both very articulate and intelligent
 I won't state my reason for believing this due to possible spoilers but I must say they certainly must have pondered the very topic of this Visual Novel themselves, such as
using
Asimov ((who is one of my favorite writers)), and a few other thinkers and writers as an inspiration as well
Now I will get to the pros and cons
Pros
Great Artwork
 9/10Good Mood setting music
 7/10Not a lot of Characters but the ones in the Game are meaningful and all are key to the entire plot
 Quality over Quanity
 10/10Main Protaginist Feels very real, as do his supporting cast
 10/10Plot Twist with true ending that was very emotional and well done ((not to mention the very meaningful and Emotional Epilogues too)) Thought provoking, morally and spritually
Good Customer support after I had issues starting the Application
No forced romance , friendships or plot, things developed in time and all are meaningful when they do
Cons
Had an error starting the game, but that has been fixed
Predictible in some ways to a veteran of visual novels of what the "right choices" are to get the true ending
Wish the game went on longer just because I got attached to the characters ((not really a con just me whining it had to end
 :( ))Would I recommend Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For
 Yes, but see Below
I would recommend it for those who are looking for a thought provoking, emotional roller coaster of a visual novel, But for those that want a visual novel with the main plot being sex, or nudity
look elsewhere this one isn't for you
Once again thank you for taking the time to read my poorly written review but I can not express enough of how impressed I was with this little Visual Novel
I would like to say excellent work to the team that put this together and made it all possible as well
Kind regards

I'm not crying, you're crying
 
 
 
 SHUT UP
In all seriousness, if you like a touching story (and can forgive a little over-the-top melodrama), give Lucy a chance
I got it on sale, and it was well worth the $5
 Nice production values including gorgeous sprites, beautiful (and plentiful) CGs, some voice over work (Lucy is the only one with VOs, albeit not in English) and excellent sound design
Has in game achievements as well, though they aren't actual Steam achievements
Posted: 7 April, 2016
Never has any piece of media made me experience so many emotions in such a short span of time
 I went from mildly interested, to completely invested in virtually no time since the writing in this VN was so spectacular
Then, once Lucy had her claws in me, the feels trip didn't stop
 I flew between the emotions of happiness, anger, and sadness faster than I even knew I could
Then, when I finally achieved the true ending, I couldn't have been more satisfied
 And just as a side note, I will never forgive that prick of a father

Notable features:Infinite combo prevention system (so combos are more complex and ironically less escapable)Asshats on motorcyclesStrong female characters (if you're into that)Sexually suggestive clothing (if you're into that)A whopping eight people to play online withController supportA boat made entirely out of bloodYou may have heard there is glorious anime cleavage in this game
 You have not been misinformed
 Just go ahead and buy it now if that's what you're here for
 I'll be here, making disapproving faces at my computer and pretending you can see me
I've been told Skullgirls is one of the most technical fighting games to exist
 A goodly few of the mechanics were designed in part by fighter champion Mike "Mike Z" Zaimont
 As a salty casual who can't beat the tutorial but still makes a ham-fisted attempt at playing anyway, I know I've only scratched the surface of what can be done with this game (a process akin to scratching the surface of the moon)
 I've seen videos of high-level play, and it is astonishing
 So if you're somebody who can decipher the phrase "qc
P+P -> a
HK -> dp" you'll find a lot to love here
 If you can't, that's no reason not to buy this game
 The combat is fun and engaging even if you can't explain to your friends what's happening in absurdly small acronyms
Skullgirls has 13 playable characters, each with their own engrossing story modes and unique playstyles (up from 9 in the wake of a devastatingly successful Indiegogo campaign)
 At least 2 more characters are still on the way
 If you grab them fresh out of the oven, they're free, too
 But don't burn your hand
 Then you won't be able to play Skullgirls, and that would be unfortunate

Review For Skullgirls PC Review by : Joell Joelly & Meguca 2
0Pros : - Great animations- Incredible artstyle- Lovely music- Very good value for the money- Mechanically impressiveCons : - Weak keyboard controls (Gamepad recommended)- Multiplayer is unforgiving for newcomers- Really hard to masterReview :Skullgirls is a game full of things to love, which can all be appreciated on their own, which all come together to make a unique experience
 First, the visuals: Skullgirls is easily one of the most visually impressive games you'll ever play
 Every single animation is drawn in incredible detail, everything looking extremely smooth and natural
 It is worth playing almost for the visuals alone
Next, the controls: Keyboard controls are done well, but a controller is highly recommended for anyone who wants to fully explore this game, and the abundant movelists, combos, and other features
 The tutorials are also far better suited for preparing a player using a controller, rather than a keyboard
If you're a veteran at fighting games, you'll be pleased at how 'technically' impressive Skullgirls is, allowing for a ton of ways to chain attacks, get massive combos and feel in control
 Players who are newer to fighters don't have to worry, there is a tutorial covering a massive amount of game mechanics, and the movelists are easy to understand
 As always with fighter games, it can be quite relentless to try and get to high skill levels and pull off every move and mechanic with ease, it does take a lot of practice
For casual players and veterans alike, there's a ton to enjoy
 Story mode covers a pretty cool plot, each character's story really helps to flesh them out and make them feel a bit more alive
 You fight your way through a series of matches, a few adding a bit to the story through pre-fight dialog, until you reach a pretty challening final boss where you conclude that character's story
 There is a variety of difficulty options available, making it accessible to both beginner and hardcore players
The character roster is relatively limited, with 8 Fighters being available in the base game, and 4 added DLC fighters (and a Hidden one) available through DLC
 It is worth mentioning that if you own the base game upon a DLC's release, it is available for free for a significantly long time
 Otherwise, you have to buy the DLCs separately
 This can be quite a turn-off for some players, but given the depth of each character it is more than enough to get a ton of enjoyment out of Skullgirls
Gameplay wise, every character has a variety of moves
 There are light, medium and heavy punches and kicks (varying in range, damage, speed, etc on each character) as well as specials, crouched attacks, jumping attacks, and all the other things common to all fighters
 Every character has varying difficulties, making them better or worse for less skilled players
 A newcomer can likely buttonmash their way through a few PVP matches or the story mode, but on higher difficulties or vs someone who is skilled at fighters will be a brick wall to that strategy
 For many players, the multiplayer is the most important part
 From a technical standpoint, the multiplayer was done well and can provide a lag-free environment to anyone who wants to get into it
 The community isn't HUGE, but there's always players to face, but as a word of warning, most players you encounter online are very skilled
 It can be near impossible to get into as a newcomer to fighters or to Skullgirls
 For this reason I do recommend playing this game locally if possible
In conclusion :Every moment is enjoyable with the beautiful animation and artstyle, there's a challenge to be found if you're looking for one, and there's a casual, enjoyable experience for those who just want to appreciate the art, voice acting and story
And for those reaons I'm giving this game a recommendation

Everything about Skullgirls is perfect
 The devs clearly spent a lot of time crafting this game to be as polished as humanly possible, and it shows
 The art is gorgeous, the soundtrack is amazing, and most importantly, the game is fun
 This is the most balanced fighting game I've ever played, and the fact that every character is viable in some way means that there's plently of variety when it comes to teams
 The game also goes out of it's way to teach newcomers, with insanely in-depth tutorial and training modes
 Whether you're a fighting game veteran or looking for your first pick, Skullgirls is a fantastic game to add to your repertoire
Posted: 23 April, 2014
It's a very solid fighting game, it's not 3rd strike or Tekken 3 or another fighting game with 3 in title but it's good nonetheless, and here's why
Character roster is not robust but it still covers a variety of playstyles, all rounders, zoners, grapplers and speed characters
 To put it shortly, despite the lack in numbers every character feels different from one another
This game has best tutorial I've ever seen in a fighting game
 It doesn't just show you which buttons do what, this tutorial will explain you every little thing about how this game works and how each character plays and when you're done, there's still a lot of space for creativity and improvement
Story mode is
 fine
 I'm honestly not a big fan of it, story itself is quite predictable and largely based on one or two standard tropes that many fighting games use
 Final boss felt a bit disappointing for me but it's kind of a hit or miss situation
 Some will like that there's a special character that is very different from anyone else in a very fundamental way but I personally prefer when at the end you face just a character from the roster like everyone else you've been fighting before
 Also at the time I was beating the game it seemed like the only way to beat the boss on higher difficulties was to just cheese her out and that's not really fun in my opinion but it was some time ago and by now people probably got much better at the game and found out other, more interesting ways to beat the boss
Multiplayer
 I wish I could say something about it but I only managed to play it once with some guy from Australia (and I live on the edge between Europe and Asia) with both of us having ping over 150 or something like that
 not exactly enjoyable expirience (though i have to say lag compensation was rather nice even in that dire situation) but it was the only expirience avaliable at the time
 I recommend you check out something like steam charts if you buy this game for multiplayer, and check if you have some sort of community for this game in your area
 Visuals and sound are very good
 Background music is not distracting and yet very charming, reminds me of something Yoko Kanno would've composed but it still sound quite unique and recognisable
 Animation and art is beautiful and smooth, yeah there are boobs and butts but they offend as much as Switzerland
 There are plently of stages and all of them look amazing
 Game looks and sounds very good, period
And to finish it off, gameplay and controls
 They are both very, very solid
 I use a fight stick and it works like a charm, as it should,
obviously
 Keyboard is also fine though, it's much harder for me to play on keyboard, but I don't see why you wouldn't be able to get good results with it after some practice, though I have to say fight stick is real sweet
 Game mechanics are way beyond what you would expect from an indie dev, gameplay feels very polished and refined, every time I lost I knew that it was my fault and what that fault was and that's a big deal in any game
 So yeah, this game is good, I liked it, pros overwhelm cons and I wish this game sells even better so there would be more people to play with

Every now and then, a game comes along that truly deserves to be called capital-g Great
 I dont mean a game thats merely fun, or entertaining, or even aesthetically beautiful  all great things, but no single aspect of which would nudge a title beyond the level of good
 Im talking about a game that manages to mix a creative, imaginative world filled with original, memorable characters, equipped with polished gameplay, and to pull it all off with an expert craftsmans level of skill and attention to detail  including literally thousands of frames of character animation
 Skullgirls is a traditional close-combat fighting game that manages to bring all of this to the table
 If you are a fan of 2D fighting games who has yet to add Skullgirls to your library, you owe it to yourself to rectify this situation as soon as possible
 It would be a deal at twice the price
Now, Ive enjoyed fighting games since the days of King of Fighters and Street Fighter II  but outside of casually decking friends in Soul Calibur, the fact is Ive never been particularly enamored with the genre for the gameplays sake, or even very good at the games
 Whats always drawn me in, believe it or not, is the story and the personalities
 Sure, the actual plots are typically paper-thin, cotton candy fluff  the Heihachi familys internal squabbles in Tekken, the Orochi power in King of Fighters its all silly stuff even (perhaps especially) when it tries to be serious, and it mostly serves as a backdrop to create fun, creative characters and personalities
 The setting of Skullgirls stands out even alongside the crazier, Guilty Gear variety of bizarre worlds, setting itself in the fictional Canopy Kingdom  a cartoony environment most reminiscent of the art deco designed 1940s, dominated by crime, strange creatures, and hybrids of technology and magic
 Even before you get to the actual character storylines in Skullgirls, the visuals it presents you with  a mix of black, gold, neon and film reel decorations  is enough to make it incredibly distinct, as if someone took the setting of the original Bioshock and decided to make it all ten times more cartoony, and about a quarter as serious
As for the plot itself, Skullgirls provides a situation reminiscent of most fighting game contexts: every seven years, a living artifact known as the Skull Heart offers to grant the wish of one woman
 But if the wisher has an impure soul, shell instead be transformed into a powerful, monstrous Skullgirl  leading her to terrorize and wreak havoc over the world
 A young girl named Marie has made her wish and apparently been found unworthy, leading various characters to set their sights on her, each with their own motives  some seeking to simply bring her assault to an end, while others are after the power of the Skull Heart for themselves
Posted: 24 October, 2014
I've been beaten senselessly by half the characters on normal or higher
The boss has wiped the floor with me more times than I can count
I can barely pull off 15 hit combos while the AI can seamlessly pull off 30-hit comboes ending in a Blockbuster every other attack
And yet I still keep coming back to this game
Why, you ask
Simply because it's the greatest fighter game I've ever played
You will find yourself playing this game over and over with its easy to learn, difficult to master playstyle, with anything from a ridiculously easy Sleepwalk mode for the starters to a downright nasty Nightmare mode for those who know what they're doing and do it well
You will fall in love with the playstyles of each and every one of these characters, from Filia, the girl with a fanged monster for hair, to Peacock, the living cartoon character, to Ms
 Fortune, the zombie catgirl who can decapitate herself at will, and everyone in between
You will find yourself in awe at the amazing background scenery and music of every last stage, from Maplecrest's calming "The Lives We Left Behind" to the techno beats of Lab 8's "Paved With Good Intentions" to the rocking jazz of Under the Bridge's "Unfinished Business"
You will laugh at every single one of these characters' lines, from Big Band's constant musical references, to Ms
 Fortune's terrible as crud puns, to Valentine's dark nurse humor, and all of the others as well
And once this is all said and done, you'll agree with me when I say - this is the best 2D fighter that there ever was
 and, believe it or not, with two more DLC characters planned for release soon, the ride is only just beginning

Probably best looking 2d fighter i have played, everything is hand drawn and looks really good
The gameplay is a bit like marvel vs capcom series, but still different
It also have the best tutorial i have seen in a fighting game, it teach you every little aspect of the game, great for beginners
 If you are new to fighting games, this is a good fighter to start with
Posted: 26 November, 2013
Good:+ plays like Mahvel, but doesn't at the same time+ ratio teams and custom assists are ballin'+ neato tutorial for scrubs+ fancy graphics and coolio music+ wow ggpo netplayLame:- reset-heavy gameplay might ruin your Christmas- combo video with every hitConclusion: Don't get SFxT-----Speaking more seriously, SG is a good game
 If you like fighting games or are simply interested in them, consider SG

After a little tinkering got R18 version up and running, so i will spend holidays shagging drawn virtual anthropomorphic cats, and only God can judge me
Now let's get serious
 If you're on this game's store page, you already know what you're looking for
 If by mistake you stumbled upon this and don't know what to do, i will explain:1)This is an eroge, which means it's a picture book with music and drawn porn disguised as a game, where you "play" as self-insert main dude and swim in pussie
2)Steam version have porn removed
 Apparently game about having your own bakery with harem of submissive catgirls made by hentai artist is also suitable for children, so god forbid they see any adult content
3)With a clever use of hands and internet you can still enable it4)There's a slider that regulates how bouncy boobs can be: from "british royal guard" to "screw physics, full Gainax" mode
5)There's 3 languages avaliable: english and two types of extraterrestial doodles
6)You get Steam achiviements if you play it with extraterrestial doodles
7)Art looks good if you're a fan of generic anniemays
8)Actually animated
9)In Russia it's possible to end up doing time for playing this
10)Music is upbeat and voice acting is
 ugh
11)There's also apparently some kind of story
12)Stuff like this stops me from reading serious vns
13)There's nothing wrong and shameful in playing this
14)Really
If you ask me why should you buy something like this on Steam - hell if i know
 I have no idea why its here in the first place
 I will, hovewer, give this game 100 boob bounces out of 100
Posted: 3 January, 2015

I'll be honest, the reason I purchased Love Ribbon wasn't because I was expecting a well written story and characters (not that I'm without complaints on these two things) but rather for perhaps the more obvious reason - sister incest
However, my perversions aside, I was pleasantly suprised by the engaging story that takes itself seriously and deals with the reprecussions of an incestuous relationship - both societally and mentally
 And unless you go out of your way to patch the game, adding explicit content, the focus is way more on the inner struggles of the sisters and how they deal with their love for each other than it is on sex (Disclaimer: I haven't played without the patch
 But I'm assuming that the two really explicit sex scenes are not in the unpatched version
) I also found myself attached to the characters
 They're given attributes that make them feel more human, which in turn makes them relatable (in the sense that they have flaws, etc
 Not saying everyone is going to relate to incest
)
 And as the story progesses, so to do the characters progress - change or become more open, etc
 However, although I do praise the writing and characters, they both suffer from a flaw that usually keeps me away from a lot of visual novels - they're anime characters
 That is to say, the main girl is your typical awkward, shy, quiet, studious, anime girl
 A cliche
 Now, they took the anime cliches and built on them, but they're still there and it still impacts the overall writing
 This could just be my bias
 But I'm bored of anime character cliches and I'm definitely tired of visual novels relying heavily on them
 But with that said, I still really enjoyed Love Ribbon
 This is an odd recommendation
 Because I definitely recommend it, but the subject matter - incest - is rather taboo and could put people off easily
 But if you're not completely disgusted just thinking about it, then even if you disagree with some of the points the game makes, you could still enjoy it overall
 Now, if you see "Forbidden sister love" and think "ohhh interesting
" Then I hold no reservations in my recommendations and you should buy it

Razzs art style just keeps getting better and better, its absolutely amazing on this visual novel
 About the story, I was expecting something cliché, and I got something different
 You expect the they CAN be sisters, but in the end theyre not so its A-okay to date since theyre not blood related Well, they are blood related
 I was surprised by that fact, and specially by their dads reaction; no soap opera drama here like NO, THIS CANT BE HAPPENING

 Their dad actually wants to protect Iris, and does what he thinks its correct in order to help his daughter
 Some people might say that kind of behavior isnt real, that anyone would get angry
 Well, some parents really would do ANYTHING to protect their child, despite what theyve done
 It was nice to see a different reaction here, and all those factors actually made me feel bad about Zoey and IrisIt all starts pretty cute, then youre dragged by your a*ss to the depths of sadness
 Also, the animation is not great, but it surely gives a certain charm to this VN
8/10, would cry over sad lesbians again

CLANNAD is one of the most well-regarded visual novels in the world, boasting an epic 80-120 hours of content; about twice the size of the Lord of the Rings trilogy
 It starts off at a very slow pace with lots of light-hearted comedy, but once you begin getting involved with each of the characters' individual conflicts, the story ramps up into some gripping emotional storytelling, sometimes sprinkled with a tinge of supernatural intrigue
 The character routes are very worthwhile in their own right, but the true value of CLANNAD is to be found in its final route: After Story
 It doesn't matter how emotionally hardened you think you are; After Story will hit you like a sledgehammer with its relentless emotional impact, and you won't come out unscathed
So, yeah, CLANNAD is kinda cool
 Changed my life / 10

When I first looked at this game, I thought "Typical anime high school girl nonsense"
 How wrong I was
 What I found was far and away the most engaging and heartfelt story I have ever experienced
 I absolutely love Clannad and cannot recommend it highly enough
Clannad is a visual novel originally released in Japan in 2004
 Voices were added in a 2008 rerelease
 In 2015 it was given an official English release
 It is regarded by the visual novel community as a paragon of the genre and one of the greatest ever
Clannad has several different plotlines which can be read in almost any order
 These plotlines are mostly love stories
 The content and quality of these are what make Clannad a legend
 Rather than pander to sexual fantasies, Clannad's stories aim straight at the reader's heart
 Some of these hit really close to home for me
 At multiple points, I had to stop reading for a few minutes to collect myself before I could continue
 Some were so good that I had to go back and reread them again just a couple of days later
If you complete Clannad, you will cry at least once
 Accept this going in
 If someone tells you they completed it without crying, they're a liar
If you're still on the fence, then consider that I was once in your position
 I was unsure of if I should even give this game a shot
 I took the chance based on word of mouth
 Now here I am gushing over it
 One of the best works of fiction I have ever experienced

Simply put, if you aren't in tears after playing this visual novel,
you're not human
Clannad is the best visual novel of all time, a roller-coaster ride of emotions that will change your life
The popular question of, "Is it really worth $50
"
Yes, in fact, it is worth infinitely more
 You can't monetize a life changing experience, and playing through Clannad will provide exactly that
Posted: 23 November, 2015
Finally, the wait is over
 After a year of anticipation and throwing almost all my money at the Kickstarter campaign, our beloved Clannad is here
 All you VN lovers should already know that Clannad is a universally-acclaimed masterpiece
 But for those who don't know much (or anything) about it, know this: it's one hell of a rollercoaster ride
 Clannad will have you laughing, crying, happy, angry, and a whole slew of other emotions
 In fact, Clannad (both the anime series and the VN) is the only story that has truly made me empathize with the characters and relate to it in my own life
 I dare say it to be a life-changing experience if you open your heart
While Clannad is almost always described as a romance game, there is so much more than that
 While there is a lot of romantic material, Clannad offers an endless ocean of life lessons around family, friends, overcoming hardship, making excruciating decisions, dealing with change, and much more
 Clannad really made me take a deep look into my own life and helped me overcome many personal barriers relating to my own family and friends
 It has positively influenced my outlook in many areas of my life and I will forever be grateful for it
Even if you don't think you would enjoy it much, do yourself a favor and pick it up
 And if you already previously played it, buy it on Steam
 Compared to the original Full Voice version, it has so many new enhancements that warrant playing it again (as if the story alone wasn't enough
)
 The HD assets, Steam achievements, and Dangopedia are all big bonuses to me
 The only things missing are trading cards and emoticons
And lastly, join the Clannad steam group for all your Clannad needs
 We're active and very friendly and love discussing all things Clannad (as well as other games, anime, etc
)
 You could say we're Steam's very own Big Dango Family
 Also, if you ever want to talk about Clannad, feel free to friend/message me

I've found that as I get older, it gets harder and harder to actually be good at games
 I guess as I age, I lose the quick reflexes that allowed me to triumph in so many games in my youth
 But this game, this game with the incentive of shooting off a girl's clothing
this game has brought back my competitive edge
 I find myself totally focused, totally in the zone, using every ounce of my attention span and relexes to beat each level at 100% so that I can witness each girl bereft of clothing
But what's more, by incentivising my play with the prospect of seeing anime girls naked, I've noticed that my reflexes and hand-eye coodination have evolved
 My lizard brain, in an effort to obtain sexual gratification, has heightened my abilities to near god-like perfection
 I see everything
 I'm one with the game
 My brain knows what to do before it even happens
 I never knew the desire to see naked anime girls could push me so far
 I'm a better, stronger man for it
 Thank you, game
 Thank you for making me better

Great game, very high quality and the most important part - fluffy eared girls
+Visuals - beautiful animated
 girls, plenty of various dresses and my favorite type of eye coloring <3
+Soundwork: Amazing OST, everyone fully voiced
 great seiyuu work and other sounds are nice too
+Gameplay: This novel is huge, seriously multiple routes for 4 different girls, each long AF
 But all the current game problems are hidden here:1-No language except Chinese or Japanese
 (well it's been said that English translation is coming as soon as possible), you can try to use an atlas or some kind of that
2-No Rx content at all (Srsly this game is full of ecchi scenes, but all of them cut, and there is no available patch yet, which could be paid addition :\ )+Cool steam cards
-No steam achievements - yet

How much is a smile worth
LiEat is a non-linear title with mild horror themes
 It's a "story-based" game, which is to say, the "game" aspect is merely a vehicle for literally everything else
 It's technically a Japanese-style RPG, but the battles are a mere formality; combat rarely amounts to more than holding down the Confirm key until they end, with very little strategy except in rare situations, and even those can be circumvented entirely if you're of the mind and find the right items
 I'm normally averse to these sorts of titles, a firm believer that a game that doesn't focus at least in part on its gameplay is a waste of a game, but LiEat appropriately made a liar out of me, and my annoyance with that fact is matched only by my gladness at being wrong
I didn't quite know what to expect when getting into this one, but I can say that whatever I could have guessed it was would've been wrong with room to spare; LiEat is surreal, strange, sometimes creepy, sometimes silly, yet consistently, if I have to admit it, charming
 Developer Miwashiba uses each "game" to tell a tale of the ongoing travels of a humanoid dragon child who subsists off of the lies of the others, and her cynical, conniving, big fat liar of a caretaker, as they travel the land in search of the world's most valuable commodity: information
 Our liar's muddy morality and views on the world are intriguing, and his foil is one of the most legitimately delightful child characters in any work of fiction I've encountered; rather than being smarter or tougher than you could legitimately expect her to be, she's reactive, naive, and even a little dense, yet without being grating, and while she's hyper-idealized, I'm willing to bet you're not going to care
 I swear that if I didn't know my own kid wouldn't be the most insufferable thing ever just to spite me, I'd want one just for the off chance it turned out something like her
This is all conveyed well by translator and localizer vgperson's mostly enjoyable interpretation of the games' quirky dialogue, the writing of which is consistently engaging and thematic
 Like its plot, the original score is unusual, yet enjoyable, the setting is foreboding, yet inviting, the characters are mysterious and enigmatic -- save for one mentioned above
--
and the plot isn't fully explained
 Rather than fall prey to being confusing as a result, though, the whole thing ends up interesting, and every interaction teaches you more about LiEat's strange world and its inhabitants, which is impressive given that each of the three extremely short games take place in one area each
 There's little exploration, no adventuring, and no questing; you're presented with a self-contained mystery to solve, and the game is over as soon as the case is closed
 Each game features at least one bad ending, and one "real" ending, and after the latter, you either move onto the next game after a visit to a gallery room, or run out of games
The result is probably unlike anything you've come across, even among the independent scene
 There's no soapbox for it to climb upon, no deep, hidden meaning for people to form a cult around and talk down to others over, no quirky fetishes to pander to, and no nerd culture to propagate; it's just a story of two people and the people they run into, but it was enough to get a couple legitimate laughs out joy out of this grouchy old fart, and again, this isn't even my kind of game
So how much is a smile worth
 Turns out the best ones are free, but three dollars was a fair price, too
I'd be lying if I said I didn't think that if you've read this far, you'll agree
* Note that I'd previously played this game from an alternative source, which is why my total time played is low as of this writing
Posted: 24 June
Three short, qaint little rpg vignettes
 It's got some unique art, and for what it is, this is interesting in its own right
 That's not to say that its mindblowing or anything
 Gameplay wise, its standard
 The narrative in general reminds me a lot of Saturday morning cartoons; but this time with more of a gothic victorian asthetic
 The creator clearly had a vision in mind for these characters, which is more than I can say for a lot of games I've played
The concept of litterally eating the physical manifestation of lies is a novel one
 I'd say it could be developed a bit more, but after playing all three episodes it looks like the creator wanted some closure on the story
 Fair enough
 Would I reccomend this game, sure
 But just be aware of what you're getting into
 Of the three episodes, I had most trouble with the last one, as it was the most trigger heavy; meaning things needed to be done in a specific order
 But with that said, this game has personality
 Functionally, it may be basic, but at least it tries to set itself apart from the mound of other rpg maker games out there
 And I think that alone warrants some kudos
Posted: 24 April, 2016
The best $3
29 (CDN) I ever spent
 Seriously, LiEat is one hell of a bargain
Basically you're a wandering vagabond with a loli dragon girl who can eats lies
 Using this power they solve mysteries and find out more about themselves along the way
 Game is seperated into 3 short parts or "chapters" and can take a good 8-10 hours if you interact with everything and aim for most of the achivements
Pros+ Fast, smooth, responsive gameplay & controls+ Music & Ambiance really fits and sets the mood (Bonus: Soundtrack included in Steam>Library>Music)+ Well crafted story and lore+ The pixels, CGs, cutscenes & character portraits all fit together well and create a unique and charming style+ Lots of hidden dialogue and stuff to interact with + achievementsCons- Combat can be a little repetitive at times- The hidden Legendary weapons are super OPOverall, I'd definitely recommend LiEat, it's short, unique, charming and sweet

id=667351001NOTE: With my reviews, I tend to do the pros/cons thing, because it's simple and straight to the point rather than paragraphs which someone might not have the time to read
Posted: 29 August, 2016
I feel like most reviews don't actually focus on balancing this game's ups and downs properly, both the positive and the negative ones
 The positive ones overvalue what people perceive as "cute" while the negative ones bash the game too much
 There are a few reviews that make a justified description or review of the game
 Obviously I'm not doing any side a favor with this
 I'll explain why I can't recommend this game after stating a few facts about it
 Keep in mind I'll be taking in consideration the price of the game and what the game offers for that value
The TLDR pros/cons version:PROS- Cutscenes and Artworks for some in game events
- Movement is fluid
- The overall style is cute
- Small optional interactions you can do in the game to make yourself feel more involved with the story (such as poking Leo when he sleeps because why not)
- Multiple endings
CONS- Lack of consequence if you do certain mistakes;- The lack of actual places to explore per chapter makes the game feel repetitive and boring on the long run
- No combat depth despite being advertised as a JRPG
 Additionally, if you grind some levels you can actually become immune to damage, including boss damage
- Despite being advertised as "A fantastic JRPG focused on storytelling
" the storyline is very short and doesn't hold up to that statement
 The story is appropriate for the price of the game
 Don't get your hopes up
- Some in-game designs for characters are poorly made (especially the artwork of characters on the right of the dialogue)
- The in-game money you acquire is useless
For those interested in more details, I'll start off with the pros:1
 I didn't expect any type of cutscenes at all
 I thought it's just some trailer animation
 It was a nice surprise
 It makes it easier to imagine what's depicted or how the characters actually look in an RPG viewed from the top
2
 For this price I had some feelings that movement speed or the FPS cap would be an issue
 Good thing I was wrong
 The movement is fluid and fast enough for the size of each map
3
 While it doesn't captivate me as much as others, the style is chibi-oriented and cute
4
 The small and sometimes meaningless optional interactions you can do does make it, at least for me, a better way of appreciating the game, rather than not having them at all
5
 It's great to have multiple endings to slightly personalize the story depending on some actions you do
 Some might argue that a linear great ending would be better rather than branching out
Now for the cons:1
 The moment I saw Lies that you can battle I immediately thought of "hey, this looks like a nice detective game
 Maybe if I pick the wrong choice, it's gonna affect the case or make me redo it
or at least lose a certain amount of HP"
 Sadly it doesn't expand on it and there's no consequence with failing to find the lie(s) (unless you count the fact that you waste some time on some battles)2
 Being used to JRPGs, I expected more zones than what it has
 There really isn't too much to explore
 But for the game's price I can't really complain that much
3
 If a game has "JRPG" or even "RPG" as its genre, I expect some combat depth and some grinding
 Sadly the only part where I had to "think" was in the first chapter where I used an AoE attack to get rid of a line of mobs
 Overall, you can just keep mashing the Attack option and still win
 And if you reach a certain level with your characters you become immune to damage
4
 The storyline is okay for the price attached
 I really wish there were more scenes and more character development because I wanted to get to know some characters more than the game allows me to
 I spent some time in RPG Maker
 Adding text is not that hard (And yes, I do imply this game was made in RPG Maker or something similar)
 But like I said before, for the price I paid, it's not a big issue
5
 There's a lot of pixelation done with the characters in the artwork shown on the right of the dialogue, such as Leo looking way too low quality compared to others and not too appealing to the eye
 Maybe that's just me, I don't know
Why do I not recommend this game
 Because it could have been something awesome like "To the Moon" or "Ib" with enough hardwork and patience
 I would buy the game at a 5-10 euro price tag if the game was focused on the following:- More places to explore- More optional dialogue and interactions with the characters- Expand the combat by adding some strategy to it- Most importantly: Make it a detective JRPG game where I interrogate people and find the truth about the case
This game had the potential to be a JRPG focused on finding the culprit and solving mysteries
 Not to the lengths of "Danganronpa" or "Ace Attorney" series, but at least give more player input and consequences related to uncovering who done what they did
 It has a dragon loli who can detect lies, for crying out loud
I'm not gonna go into details on how this could be made as everybody has their own ideas of how to improve the game
 However, I really wanted some negative effects if I'm doing something wrong with finding lies, make me find who the culprit it according to clues and then give me the option to accuse someone
 Heck, maybe use in-game money you acquire to buy hints
Conclusion:The artwork is okay, the BGM is okay, the story is okay, overall this game is average
 And that's the problem
 I really wanted to recommend this game but I can't
 And it's not because of the value of the game, it is for what is worth
 It's because it could have been something awesome and unforgettable giving the right time, patience, hardwork, and price
 Yes, I'm not recommending this game only because it wasn't polished to its fullest potential
 I wanted this game to be awesome (with an appropriate price for its greatness), but the dev team decided to stop and deliver an okay game for its current price
 I am aware that the reason for not recommending it isn't truly justifiable
 From an objective standpoint I'd recommend this game
 But this is a review with my own personal opinion
 Thus, a subjective point of view is more appropriate
A message to all reviewers who keep saying stuff like "omg that girl is so cute and you should buy the game because of that
": You are overvaluing the "cute" aspect of the game way too much
 Is it really that big of a thing for a dragon loli that discovers life to be this game's selling point
 Or the artstyle
 Because I don't think so
 Maybe that's just me
 Who knows
A message to all reviewers who say this game is "horrible" or bash certain aspects of the game in an exaggerated manner: don't forget you spent 2 to 3 euros/dollars on it
 For that value, don't expect too much out of it
 It's not gonna be Final Fantasy
 As mentioned above, the game is neither good or bad
 It's average
 If you're that disappointed, just sell the Trading Cards you get from it and compensate some of the money you spent
 If you're lucky enough to get a Foil type of Trading Card, you can sell that for at least the amount of money you spent on the game
Posted: 20 June, 2016
I bought this game because my friend had recently, and he said it was good
 3 dollars was a low price, so I bought it, and didn't expect it to be a good game because of the price
 It then sat there for several months, until today, June 20th, 2016, I downloaded it and played it
 It was unbelieveably good
 It was not what I was expecting at all, I expected a semi-long JRPG with flashy anime characters
 What I got was a short, amazing filled story that I immediately fell in love with
 The gameplay might be a little bit on the underdeveloped side, but the story beats the hell out of that
 I would go into detail explaining the two amazingly crafted main characters, but I don't want to spoil this experience for you
 Pick this game up for yourself and give it a play, you won't regret your decision
 it only took me about 4 hours to 100% percent it, but it is one of my favorite Steam games I've ever played
Posted: 27 February, 2016
Don't let the "Loli" Steam banner fool you
 This isn't a JRPG that panders to the Loli-crowd
 Instead, I'll hazard to say that LiEat (I, II, and III) doesn't pander at all
 Instead, the developer focused on bringing us a solid and well written story
 The story itself isn't anything amazing, and often, the mysteries solve themselves in the first act
 However, what really kept it interesting were the characters
 The characters are endearing, mysterious, and funny
The game includes 3 Chapters
 Each has multiple endings
 The first two chapters each took me about 1
5 hours, and the last one stumped me for a bit when I couldn't get the Good Ending
The BGM are great and sets the mood as well
 I highly recommend this to anyone looking to play a short game with memorable characters
 Just don't expect this game to last you any more than 5 hours tops
EDIT: Also, any achievement that includes Ranma 1/2 is gold in my book: Happosai~
Posted: 24 May, 2016
LiEat is comprised of 3 short JRPGs
 Each story is extremely well written
 Dialog between characters is clever and interesting
 I lost count of how many times I laughed outloud
 I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoil a thing
 If you can look past the fact you'll have to play within a little windowed box and with graphics a bit blurry, you can find plenty else to love
 Even with the graphics the way they are, there is a lot of charm in them
 My ending remark will be - if another LieEat comes to Steam, I'm buying it in a heartbeat
P
S
 I'm adding to the review for the steam awards badge
 Let me just say, the creators of LiEat just came out with Alicemare and I DID buy it in a heartbeat
 :D

After beating this game and each of his 3 chapters, I can say that this is the most splendid and beautiful game I have played in a long while
It sent me back to the era when I used to download and play RPG maker games like Misao, Ao oni or Mad Father
The art style is beautiful, the soundtrack is perfect and the story is just magnificent
This game is so good that I wish that one day everyone will be able to play a sequel, I know this game is great and that a lot of people would play it
Okay
 now to the serious stuff; the game itself is about 5 hours long, or 6 if you want to get every achievement
The game has a simple fighting system that but it's really entertaining, there might not be many enemies to fight beside lies and some bosses, but the fighting system it's not that important, what's important here is the wonderful and gorgeous story, the story is very interesting and sometimes it hits you hard in the feels
If I had to rate this game it would be a solid 10/10Pros: The art style is amazing
  The fighting system is very basic but entertaining
 Soundtrack is very relaxing and totally well made The price is perfect, basically, 1$ for each 3 of the games
 The animations are short but really great
 The puzzles are really good even if there's about one per game
 The characters are pretty interesting and beautiful
 The game is pretty light, you can install it in about 5 to 10 minutes and you will be rewarded with 5-6 hours of gameplay
 The facial expressions are very cute and well made
 Very funny achievements with great references
 CuteSpoilers Ahead, you have been warned: These spoilers will be about the game's endings so I really warn you, the endings are so beautiful that if you haven't beaten the game yet you should definitely not read the cons, I am just trying to say that the endings are way too good and you should not get spoiled, go discover it yourself, its really worth it
Cons: I don't think this is a con but rather more of a wish;The game leaves you a massive cliffhanger on the good ending, by now the bad ending already shows us that Leo is taken by the lies and becomes evil, Efina still follows him and promises him that one day she will become powerful enough to eat his lies
The neutral ending wich is even sadder than the bad one ends up with Efina being way too weak (Under or at level 11) to eat Leo's lies, thus having to use all of her power to protect him thus making her perish but saving the life of Leo, wich made her happy
The good ending is just heartwarming, Efina is strong enough ( level 12 or higher ) to eat all of Leo's lies and Leo is capable of talking to Cyril to confess that everything he did was to protect them
 Cyril proceeds to leave with his brothers ( Not counting Leo ) and takes off via helicopter thus leaving Leopold and Efina in the rooftop, they both move on together to the next adventure
Final Note:This game is amazing and worth every single penny, I give it a solid 10/10 coming very very deep from my heart
Even if the game's ending is a massive cliffhanger that probably left some people in despair for a sequel, I guess it's not a bad idea to wait and have some patience, personally, I wish that this game gets a sequel anytime soon

Lieat is a very good story
 Isn't much of a game
 I recomend it
Short story long, Lieat is a peice by peice story that entales the "Current off the past" Story of a Con man who cares for a young girl
 THe what and the why is for you to find out, as this game lives and, dare I say, dies by it's story
 This is not a game, it is a story with game elements
 A cut ahead of visual novels but a cut behind an RPG horror game
 I think it wears its place well
The game has a nice style
 Everything is original to the game, and it's all well done for it's miniscual scale
 It has it's own artwork for each character, and even some small animated scenes
 The music sets the stage alright enough, and is something I like to listen to casually
 I'd like to empisise miniscual though
 This game is a very small game, easily completed in 2 hours for a first run for a normal player
 The game is made even smaller by being cut up into 3 peices, each a labled "game" You'll pick from once you start up the game
 Each one is self contained, but they all add up into a complete plot of the main characters
 I like how it was handled, too
 It gives it a sense of progression within each of the chapters without having to ellate farther down the road
 Ultimately, this game a bit sized story broken up into bite sized senarios
 It's handled well through and through, but do not expect a ton from it
Posted: 29 February, 2016
LiEat was without a doubt one of the few games I have bought which did not disappoint me, LiEat is an RPG / Pixelated indie game which is based around a girl who can eat lies travelling with her a man whom she calls "papa"This game does have its secret little quirks and the crazy little fun things you do and the achievements you get from them
 There is no voice acting and the resolution of the game is pretty small which is a little difficult at first, the characters you meet and find will captivate you and the conversations they have always leave you wanting to know more of "why" "how" and "what"
 The combat system is really easy and simple so you don't need much experience or any experience as a matter of fact
 I've never enjoyed a game like this in such a long time and its great to break off from the ultra violent toxic fps shooting games and just have a relaxing and cute playthrough a game like this
Considering its only £1
99 , you should get it, this game has already made me laugh, intrigued and fascinated by the story and all the things to discover, I may also be in love with this game
Nominate this game for the villain in most need for a hug, i mean
 come on
 the villain does need one

And then you experience this and all the worries in the world become silent

(Acutal Review BELOW)Showed my parent some gameplay
Dad is proud of me
 Mom is not letting me come closer to my little sisters and the cats anymore
10/10 - would make dad proud again
UPDATE: My dad increased my allowance after i patched the game
11/10 - would make mom love me again
Edit: Since most of you want an actual review, I'll give you one
 I'm not a professional reviewer or anything, just a simple closet weeb :^)Nekopara is a VN that sets apart other VN on steam, due to it's animation mostly
 To me, Nekopara is a nukige because the plots are pretty decent, but the H-scene are what we are here for
 So lets break it down part by part
CG/Graphic - This is what makes this game a bit different than other VNs
 You don't see many VNs that animates the sprites during conversation, let you pet them and make their "coconuts" bounce
 I also love the E-MOTES system in Nekopara
 The backgrounds and the colours are really lively and heartwarming in a way
 So it's a plus in my book
Plot - If you like the plot from Nekopara Vol
 1, you should be fine with this plot but it's a bit shorter
 One thing I find lacking in Nekopara are the plot
 I understand making a harem + ecchi plot can be difficult because there's a ALOT of VNs out there have the same genre with the same-kind plot
 My kind of plot that is to my likings are the Clannad, Grisaia type of plot etc, where they have proper routes and different ending
 I think Nekopara is the nukige kind of plot c: 
 Anyway, I'm pretty sure you guys bought it for the "plot" am I right
Voice/Music - I'm the type of person who will go on youtube and search "Anime OST that will make you cry" while reading his manga
 Yes, I think OST/background songs plays an important role to VNs
 This is because the purpose for OST is to make the VNs to be alive, make you want to be part of the story
 And Nekopara OST are pretty good
 Not gonna lie, I like some of the OST from this game
 The voice actor are all great and lovely, if you play Imouto Paradise or any loli VNs, you should be okay with some of the high pitch voice (Some of my friends don't like high pitch loli voice lol)H-Scene - All scenes are fap-licious c: You got to thanks Neko Works for making this game and releasing the patch straight after the game launchs
 Animated H-Scene are my kind of game, like Ultimate Boobs War
 I know some of you will get the patch without paying, but if possible do continue to SUPPORT the content creator <3Overall -
I have no complains for this game
 Just another VNs added to my collection
 I enjoy the VNs especially the H-Scene :^)

The devs would have you believe you play this game by buying it and launching it and clicking your way through a cute and sometimes racey story about a guy who can't get a bunch of cat-human hybrid girls to leave him alone
 Here's the real way to play:STEP 1: Buy the game
 STEP 2: Download and install the 18+ patch from somewhere reliable
STEP 3: If you live with your parents, lock your bedroom door
STEP 4: Get a big wad of toilet paper or a box of kleenex
 You'll need more than you think
STEP 5: Boot up the game, speed through it but read just enough story to know what's happening when you eventually reach the H-Scenes
STEP 6: Beat the Bishop, Polish your Mustang, Manage the Glue Factory, etc
STEP 7: Sit there like the pathetic waste of matter that you are, droplets of baby batter running down your stomach
STEP 8: Regret everything, put in a refund request for the game
STEP 9: Try to rekindle a relationship with a past love interest IRL and fail miserablySTEP 10: Out of frustration, flirt with multiple girls who remind you of the original one
 STEP 11: Ruin your reputation with any and all females you were friends with
STEP 12: Go home and feel bad for yourself
STEP 13: Go on Steam and see Nekopara on the front page
STEP 14: Repeat from Step 1

Nekopara is the story of a dude that runs away to open up a cake shop using his rich parents' money
 Two "catgirls" sneak their way into the luggage and surprise their owner in a "we're too far from home so you can't get rid of us" way
In the first part, you take advantage of legalized slavery to get Chocola and Vanilla to dress up as cute maids, which brings a lot of creeps and virgins customers to the shop
 It's pretty obvious that you wouldn't have any customers without them, yet you find the MC constantly complaining about them

Mad Father is a Wolf Editor Horror Game (think of it similar to an RPG Maker Horror Game) which originally released in 2012 (and was translated into English in 2013)
 This Steam release marks a rework of the game with an overall nicer layer of polish & some new content
 I've only dabbled in the Steam release a bit at the time of writing to compare some early game differences, but I had played the game & gotten every ending back with the freeware version
I'll start off this review with a general review of the game itself, followed then a mention of some of the new content & early game differences
-----GENERAL REVIEW:-----The game follows the story of Aya Drevis, a young 11-year old girl who lives in an expansive mansion with her father, Alfred, & their maid, Maria
 Aya is aware that her father does somewhat cruel experiments with a chainsaw to people in their mansion basement, but she still loves her father all the same
 She has seen his good traits and love he gives to her as his daughter
 However, one night she awakens to some odd sounds, & finds shambling corpses and other strange beings wandering the mansion with murderous intent
 A curse has been put upon the mansion from the countless people Aya's father has slaughtered, & now the dead walk among them seeking revenge on the Drevis family
 The only way to escape now & save your dad is to lay these spirits to rest, either through forgiveness or force
Mad Father gained a strong cult following for good reason, it has a number of creative & interesting varied scenarios despite its simple nature, ranging from puzzles, to light stealth, story, exploration, minigames, & backed with good gothic atmosphere with just a hint of the fantastical
 While the main setting of the game is a Mansion, you quickly begin to descend in it, finding surreal labyrinths with intricate detail & interesting elements to each room
 Some play a role in gameplay, others are simply interesting to look at
 As you explore you'll come to face a number of challenges & entities who want you and your dad dead
 You must find a way to put the spirits at rest, & make your way to your father deep in his underground labs
 Along the way there is a colorful cast of odd characters you learn more about, & a number of side-quests off the beaten path you can partake in (they're optional to complete the game, but needed to get the true ending, though of note is the whole mansion is explorable even at the end of the game, you can go all the way back to the starting room of the game from the final room of the game)
 While the story isn't surprising, it is well-told and full of charisma
 Aya is a likable protagonist and her relationship with her twisted father is interesting, & the members of the core cast and their interconnecting relationships are just as interesting (if not more so)
 The journey is engaging all the way through if you're into these 2D RPG-Horrors, & will easily give you a good 3-6 hours of playtime (depending on how much you explore, how many endings you go for, do 'optional' stuff or not, etc)
 It has a charm to it simply due to its tone, a mixture of a Victorian-styled setting & characters combined with a more modern twisted sci-fi mad scientist doctor via our father and the gruesome undead experiments of his, forging a sort of scientifically twisted vs supernaturally malicious scenario
 It's an interesting contrast that creeps its way into various aspects of the game I just find wholly fascinating
I will mention while the game has some good atmosphere, it isn't all that scary, nor is it trying to be
 There is the occasional moment or scene, but the game aims more to unsettle you as a mood-piece with a central interconnected narrative and attract you with elements of intrigue, abstractness, & feeling to set a tone than to startle or even shock you
 This said, some of the scenes are rather tense and creepy
If you're into the scene of 2D Horror games that came from the like of Wolf Editor and RPG Maker, this one is definitely worth checking out if you haven't before
-----FOR THOSE WHO'VE PLAYED BEFORE:-----But then for those who have played it before, you may ask yourselves, "What's new here
 What makes this worth $5 compared to the previously free version
"The first thing you'll probably notice as you play is the graphics have been updated in almost every room of the game
 Some rooms have been changed drastically with completely new layouts & details; they hardly resemble the rooms from the original
 Others just have nice new touches that help bring them more alive & add character
 In the mansion at the beginning there wasn't a room I encountered that hadn't seen some sort of overhaul, and the touches look very nice
 Along with the new spritework, there is also a few new pictures that pop up during cutscenes to give more life to them & the previous pictures have been revamped to look much nicer
 Also has new enemy sprites, better sprite animation & details, more detailed death scenes, & other touch-ups
For an example of the graphical difference, here's a comparison of Aya's Room: Aya's Room (Original Game): https://66

pngAnd so far, most rooms have been drastically redone like this
The game had to get rid of things it couldn't use for commercially, with the element that stands out the most being the music
 Most of the original OST is present, but there are a few new original music tracks in this version of Mad Father in-place of the few unusable songs they had
 I've only heard a couple new songs thus far, but I like them
 They fit the game nicely & don't feel out of place
 I may even like them more than the originals
The game also has some new ease of use elements
 Aya now will have exclamations pop over her head when near things she can interact with or investigate
 Items glitter now to stand-out, so you don't have to observe everything just to find key items hidden in shelves or the like, & the hit-detection feels much better & smoother than before
 The UI/Menu is completely reworked, & the QTEs the game previously had have a new gameplay style where instead of rapidly pressing a button, you now must press a series of buttons before time runs out (with an improved UI element as well)
While I can't speak in full length as I haven't quite beaten the new version of the game, there are some new dialogue & scenes in the game
 There is some changes to the layout of the locations as I said before, some new areas as a result
 The dev has also said there's some new optional side-stories to uncover, new scenes, & some of the gems have been relocated
 There's also a new "IF" option on the title screen, which is unlocked once you get the True Ending (not sure what it is, tho)
Game also comes with the Steam features of Trading Cards & achievements (which there's a 27 of)
Some may not find the new all that new, but it's made revisiting this game a joy for me so far, and as I loved the original I don't mind putting down some money for a revamped version with some new paint & some additional content to support future endeavors
-----OVERALL:-----While some may want to stick to the free version for its 'freeness', I think this version of Mad Father is an overall improvement which will be the best way to experience the game for either new players or fans of the original
 Maybe not the huge expansion some may have hoped for, but the much more detailed & realized world along with the various additions, changes, & fixes all feel in-line with the vision of the original game while in my opinion steadily improving on it
 Mad Father had a cult audience & will find new fans
 If these type of games interest you, I do think is wholly worth checking out

A classic horror game that its worth every cent
 I cant stress enough, you have to play it yourself
 Mad Father has this eerie atmosphere that will make you so addicted that you wont stop playing until youve solved the great puzzle centered in your family roots
 It's a story about love, hate, madness, the fear of death
 And about a crazy daddy carrying a f*cking chainsaw and chasing you
 After all, that's the best way to tell "I love you" to his 11 years old daughter
Posted: 14 June
Took me a while to play this because there were some critical bugs during release day, but the devs worked hard to fix everything up
Now, this is the premium version of Mad Father which is not just a straight re-release of the free version, but an upgraded one (in many ways, I'm told)
 Better graphics, better level design, better everything
 It's a really tight experience without any filler and with an interesting story, so any fans of RPGMaker-type horror games will find this a highly enjoyable experience
You can also increase the game's window size, so don't worry if you're running a high-resolution display
 This is a feature that is not exactly common for these types of games, but this game has got you covered
I'm looking forward to future games from the dev
Posted: 24 September, 2016
Totally worth it
 I bought it more to thank the developers for all those nights that made me scary when it was free

Man, this is even scarier than original
We need Misao remake as well
Posted: 29 December, 2016
The description on its Steam page is actually you need to know before you start playing the game
 The whole gameplay is just as interesting as my first impression of it when I first saw the title and the capsule art
 It's so fun and immersive that I didn't even notice I've been playing this for over seven hours already
Mad Father is about a crazy family
 You play the role of Aya Drevis, a ten year old daughter of a mad scientist
 Despite being aware of her father's inhumane hobby, Aya still loves and respects him
 The story begins at midnight of her mother's death anniversary who, according to her father, died of an illness
 While attempting to sleep, she heard her father scream for help, and she is determined to come to his rescue
 However, the further she goes, the more she learns about her father's nature
There's not much to say about the story
 It is fairly straightforward and even predictable
 That's not to say that the story wasn't good
 In fact, knowing how it unfolds adds to the excitement because the gameplay is almost the story in and of itself
 Every character is very likeable except the father, although the father still has a reasonable motive behind his actions
 There's no other word to describe him other than 'Mad', which stays true to the title of the game
 While the gameplay is a masterpiece, the selling point of this game is the art
 I must say that it was what made me want to get this game in the first place, and it didn't let me down
 The game was an eyecandy until the end despite the dark and gore theme
 The music was also very ambient
 I honestly did not notice the background music, and that's a good thing
 That means it was a part of story
Overall, This is one of the games where the story, gameplay, art, and music all work together seamlessly
 I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to everyone regardless of your taste in games
 Besides, who doesn't want to be a little girl whose weapon of choice is a chainsaw
Posted: 25 September, 2016
This game's been available for a few years for free, but it was easily worth a price tag all along
 I'm very glad to be able to support the developers after all this time
 It's a short-but-sweet, but nonetheless excellent, story driven adventure puzzler of sorts
 A real gem for anyone that is a fan of horror or slashers
Posted: 29 May
One of the most enjoyable RPG games I've played in a while
 Though the jump scares weren't anything to sneeze at, the music and atmosphere that it brought really brought the game together as a horror RPG
 I adore the sprite animations, and I really enjoyed the 'If' Ending because it was refreshing to step into another character's shoes, if only for a brief moment
 This game has fantastic replay value and the achievements are manageable for even the less seasoned players
 I got so frustrated my first play through when I ruined my chances of a True Ending because I didn't properly explore, but it was so fun starting over again to guarantee the ending that I wanted to experience
 Overall, it's a well made, beautifully atmospheric game that's very afforrdable to play if you're really not sure about the style
Posted: 1 December, 2016
This
one messed up game
but that isn't necessarily a bad thing
Yet another gem on Steam that unfortunately many would let slip by
 Personally, I couldn't recommend it enough, due to the resonable pricetag for all what its worth as an experience
The game, had one of the most original and unique plots I've ever come across in a top down RPG game
 I personally was so engaged and moved by the storyline that I just couldn't find the leeway on leaving the game half way through without having curiousity lingering in my mind
 Consequently, I managed to finish the entire game in straight 5-7 hours, collecting all the achievements whilst emphasizing on the comprehension of dialogue and minor details to get the perfect grasp on what the game had offered and truly, it was worth it
 By the end of the game, my experience regarding the game was unsettling due to the disturbing plot and the many twists that it had as per the progression in game but regardless of that, they were part of the escapade which was, dare I say, amusing
Mad Father, as the title goes by is a psychological horror that offers exceptional soundtracks for every scenario in the game, an atmospheric top down level design, minor puzzles, simple controls and grotesque material / content in compliance with an innovative yet captivating plot
 It comprises of multiple endings for which the choice is to be made at the very end of the game for the subsequent ending
 Final summation
 A fine indie rpg,
purely a bang for the buck, twisted yet fascinating
Posted: 24 September, 2016
This is one of the games I bought without hesitating and thinking if it's worth it
 I remember playing free version about 3 years ago and I enjoyed the story and all the spooky moments, so I was pretty happy to see that it's been remastered and made it to steam
 And to be honest this version is way better than the original, not only visually, but because it got some additions to the storyline
 If you enjoy horror rpgmaker games that have beautiful graphics and a nice story with some plot twists, then you'll certainly enjoy this game
 Storyline is quite short and takes a couple of hours to run through, but it's certainly worth it's price

My sister on my steam account"Matt whats NEKOPARA
""My friend gave it to me, its just some weird weeaboo thing
""Can I play it
""Ummmm ok

Nekopara Vol
 0 is the prequel to the events that occur in Nekopara Vol
 1
StoryThe story is pretty much outlined in the description on the steam store
"The eldest daughter of the Minaduki household and their 6 catgirls go to wake up their master; prepare breakfast; clean up the house; go out on a walk; make dinner; take a bath; sleep together; et cetera, et cetera
 "Sadly it outlines the majority of what this visual novel has to offer, which can be a bit of a spoiler, but the interactions and personality of the catgirls does offer some light comedy
 Their differing personalities, as well as their curuiosity, does lead to them to sometimes being more troublesome than helpful
 This being said, the visual novel is a bit short, and can be fully read in about 30 to 50 minutes, depending on your reading speed
Notable features-As you all may have noticed, there is a hand on the top right of the screen while playing the game, pressing it engages in a petting "minigame"
 This minigame pauses the game's dialogue, allowing you to pet the characters on screen
 This is not limited to the catgirls, you can even pet shigure
 The petting feature goes a bit further, making the characters react differently; based on where you choose to pet them
-Trading cards with more cute backgrounds and emoticons
-Artwork is similar to that of its predecessor, having some scenes played out in their adorable chibi form, and many other scenes in their normal form
 Art is a bit more lewd, as it has a shower scene with shigure as well as the catgirls
(use your imagination)Verdict 7/10At the time of this review, there is a small typo, in which Maple asks Coconut if she is sure she can finish all the food she wanted, but refers to her as cinnamon

This game has eaten up all my time
 I lost my job and got kicked out of my house because of these girls
Worth
Posted: 7 June
A game that revolves heavily on the fact that the player either owns a cat, a sister, or a computer
 The second reliance is upon the player to be the kind of person that would willingly purchase a VN, on steam, and remain completely unashamed playing it for all his friends on his roster to see
 As a man that makes his own money and uses that to build a $700 PC, I can say that somehow I fit into one of the previously stated categories
 The core of the VN surrounds several catgirls going through an entire day without their master/owner
 Much like real cats they tend to be complete dumb-asses that make a mess and fight causing you to watch their shenanigans as well as their breasts bounce around the screen significant something; possibly violence, maybe sexual perversion brought about from Hiroshima and Nagasaki
You, the player are not the master; even though at certain parts you see though his eyes
 No, you are a disembodied spirit the stalks the girls around their house and town respectively
 During certain parts you can use your ghost powers to pat these girls on their head, poke their bellies and grab their boobs
 Similar to real life these girls react positively to being fondled, but unlike real life they never sit you down in an interrogation room, show you the video of you fondling a girl and force you to sign a mutual release because you didn't know she had a boyfriend and that man was a lieutenant for the state police

Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a 2D platformer so solid and lovely to control i wanna kiss it
like, imagine Dark Souls and Metroid had a little 16-bit baby, and then that baby made a game called Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight for his preschool project
 thats this game
Momo borrows its core mechanics from games like Metroid and Dark Souls, which i heard are pretty good
 main gameplay really only includes jumping on platforms and slashing/shooting bad dudes, but Momodora likes to get a little deeper than that
 your main weapon is a leaf, which attacks slowly and leaves you vulnerable between slashes, but you have a roll that gives you invincibility frames if things are dicey
 your other weapon is a bow that's pretty quick but forces you to stand still, again leaving you vulnerable
 this means you cant be strolling along willy nilly and you gotta take each group of enemies on with care and strategy
 as a result you get combat that's pretty gosh darn fun and challenging (hey this kinda reminds me of Dark Souls)
the map that you explore is linear for about 2 seconds while the game teaches you how to play it, and then immedietely opens up, branhing into paths leading to the game's several areas (which all look damn beautiful btw) that you can explore
 along the way you can buy/find abilities and upgrades that help you kill baddies faster or move around faster or use the power of wind or whatever, and its real neato (huh kinda like that Metroid game hmm)
 the map is also sprinkled with a lot of hidden goodies, hints toward lore, easter eggs, and a secret boss if any of that scratches your itch
 overall its a treat to explore and discover
speaking of bosses, the few that pop in during the game are pretty good
 the average boss battle is a lot like Dark Souls, bosses hit hard, but their attacks are predictable and telepathed, and leave them vulnerable to a few swings from your leaf if you execute correctly
 each boss looks, plays and acts different from the others, adding to the world experience as you come across them
 their rarity, combined witht the bangin' soundtrack, makes each boss intense to fight
the death system in this game is also a lot like Dank Souls, in that you have several bells (bonfires) sprinkled about the map that serve as save points
 hitting the bell (resting at the bonfire) heals the player, refills active item charges, and sets that location to be the respawn point, yadda yadda classic game stuff
 save points are definetelypresentation-wise, this thing is so damn delicious to experience
 animations feel like they have some weight, and scenery looks pretty dang pretty on this one
 im no artist, though, so i cant say much else
 also the soundtrack gets soooooo good at times
 my favorite track is "Pardoner's Dance", which plays when you fight Fennel (that hot gal in the white dress and the red sword)
uh, story, right
 you get a vague idea of what's going on via talking to npc's or pre-boss banter, but i had a lot of trouble putting together the whole pie, and there's a lot of reading between the lines on this one
 i ended up filling some info with my imagination, which was okay, but left something to be desired
 maybe it's cause i haven't played the other 3 Momo games, but i dont know
 you should ask someone else about this to be honest
overall, yeah this one's pretty dang good
 and definitely worth two $5 footlongs

Great metroidvania game, with a lot of depth
 Good map, good gameplay, really a nice surprise
 It took me about 7 hours to reveal 100% of the map on normal difficulty (which I think is actually a nice thing, I prefer a short but intesne experience over a long but boring game)
 Good job devs, I had a great time

Best 2D Souls game I've ever played
Posted: 23 December, 2016
This is a very short game with a mountain of untapped potential that could have been one of the greatest metroidvania games ever created
 As it is, it's still a phenomenal appetizer for the genre with shades of Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Shovel Knight
Just don't overthink it or get too invested in any of the characters, because they're little more than interesting signposts and the journey is over just as suddenly as it begins
I can see it being a good speed run game
Posted: 29 May
Momodora: RUtM is basically a 2D, 16-bit Bloodborne clone
 If that sounds appealing, buy it
 If that sounds confusing, continue reading and I'll elaborate
The game is dark, gothic, and brimming with psychological horror and depressing themes
 The godly mellow soundtrack just improves on this even further
Combat is centered around dodging and stunlocking enemies, there's no way to block attacks
 You have an incredibly fast ranged attack in your longbow, but using it makes you stationary, so you need to time using it well
 Same thing with healing: it's very fast, but it will lock you in place long enough for enemies to hit you unless you time it properly
There's a lot of hidden secrets, including shortcuts, HP upgrades, equipment that can change your playstyle considerably, and hidden Ivory Bugs that are 1 pixel big and traded in with a collector for various rewards
The game is incredibly free, once you reach a certain point you can take on all areas in any order
There's a lot of missable optional content, and that coupled with the freeform structure adds a lot of replay value
The game has gotten a lot of updates with things most other devs wouldn't even consider, like tweaks to reduce photosensitivity epilepsy trigger rate in some effects and a danish localization
It's a bit short, but considering the amount of hidden stuff to find it can give you way more playtime than it initially seems
 And I've seriously spent more time with some of these bosses than it took to get past some bosses in Dark Souls 2 and 3
Overall this game is definitely worth getting if you're into soulslikes, metroidvanias or bullet hell games: it has reasonable chunks of each and is a huge step up from its (already amazing) predecessors Modora I - III
Posted: 9 December, 2016
Great MetroidvaniaPROS+Nice soundtrack+Great Bosses+Big game world(way bigger than 1,2 or 3 parts of the game)+Nice difficulty+Good replayablity+New Game++Various endingsCONS-Final Boss is easy as pieGreat Metroidvania
Boss battles are great,exploration is really great
This game really offers a challenge and after first walkthrough you will get even harder difficulty
Buy it and play it
Posted: 14 June, 2016
Go, buy this game at full price now, if you find yourself even remotely interested in metroidvania-type games
It's just beautifulColors, backgrounds, character sprites, animations and music: everything flawlessly blends into a stunningly atmospheric and coherent 2D game world
 Seriously, Momodora knows its aesthetics
 I absolutely loved this aspect of the game
 (Bonus points for playing as a kawaii priestess with a maple leaf as main weapon and being able to turn into a cat)Gameplay is simple, yet effectiveYou won't find a ton of useless items, spells or use one of many gazillion button input combos
 Nope
 You've got your basic melee 3-hit combo, a chargeable bow, 3 active and 2 passive items
 Combat works and feels just right
Movement is also tight and responsive: running, jumping, rolling and dashing through the world is a real pleasure
DifficultyI played on normal difficulty
 The game is challenging (especially in boss fights which require you to learn their patterns) but not too unforgiving
 Weirdly enough it gets a lot easier towards the end since you find tons of HP upgrades and more powerful items
 Looking back I'd recommend starting out on Hard
The only downsideAfter roughly 5 hours playtime I'm standing before the final boss, 99% of the map is cleared and I don't want the game to end yet
Seriously, it's too short :(

Well, i`m sure about one thing
 I enjoyed this game way more than i thought i would at first
 Fault - Milestone One was rather
 meh in my opinion
 But Fault - Milestone Two did in fact surprise me and got me much more comfortable with the storytelling
 What I didn`t like about Milestone One was the story progression, but that was handled far better in this episode
 Especially Selphine - who i didn`t quite like in Milestone One - got a lot of development which surprised me
 This episode really got me immersed in the story and for that i am grateful
This episode makes up for its predecessor`s mistakes and leaves me also quite
 speechless
 I am already looking forward to the next entry in this franchise
 Good job
The only thing i kinda don`t like is the time the developers need until an episode is developed
 I hope this series will get a proper ending

Absolutely beautiful
 Readers who enjoyed Fault Milestone 1 will absolutely adore Milestone 2
 In the first five minutes, the story immerses you back into a world of magic and fantasy
 New visual aspects aid the readers mood and the sound effects are spot on
 Storywise, there should be no surprise to feel absolutely enveloped by it
 Readers who have experienced the first part will also notice that certain details get a little kinkier than last time, which is no problem to me
 The game does not diverge at all from its original tone and actually gets deeper and deeper into the fantastic fantasy world
 The history can be seen to slowly unravel and the quaint little town setting of the first one is changed into a much bigger, broader world, full of new adventures
 Best of all, we get to delve into the engrossing expeditions of the adorable (yet brave and breathtaking) heroines, Selphine, Ritona, and Rune
 There is no doubt that the Fault series can be enjoyed by both beginners and veterans to visual novels

I don't write reviews often
 However in some cases where something exceptional is made i will
Something that i can either put my time to for extremely long periods, enjoy it to a maximum extent where nothing gives me hesitation or where my very outlook on certain things change entirely
 This visual novel bought out both 2 and 3 of these 3 reasons
The art/style: The visuals are absolutly stunning, amazing barely covers it
 I presonally love it and feel that it adds a lot to the visual novel with the different backgrounds, charater designs, and effects
 The intro and credits are the only two "movie" cg throughout the game but are well done for how short they are both explaining the latest events from fault milestone 1 and the aftermath of whats happened in this visual novel
 The CG itself is beautiful and again really shows off the skill and talent
at
Alive in Dissonance
 This game is visually stunning in every detailThe story: (No spoilers) The story took me about 4-5 hours to complete
 This is fairly short but don't go into it expecting to read little
 In the time given the story explodes with absolute moments of intensity, moments of calm (including in the menu screen) moments of disbelief and one moment of genuine anger towards a charcter
 It was filled wit a lot of emotions
 Also desipte its size this visual novel can be both for casual readers and those are looking for something that truly surfices their reading needs
 I will say this as well
 The way the story moves forward is smooth
 There are no points i felt it was rushed or needed to be sped up
 Unlike the fault milestone 1 i felt i could have read this visual novel the whole way through in one sitting with no problems at all (not to say fault milestone 1 was bad because it isn't)
 The characters: There are 3 main characters, multiple sub characters and the main bad group of enemies
 The 3 main characters develop an ever bigger sense of self showing their personalities even more so then they already had been
 Providing a new outlook on them especially with Rune and Selphine
 Sadly with Ritona although we don't see much change in personality or even development in her overall character
 We do get a new side of her compared to Fault Milestone 1 that is caused mainly by the events of Fault Milestone 1 as well as an event that occurs within Fault Milestone 2
The new characters you meet as well as old characters from Fault Milestone 1 were somehow all unique and none felt they were wasted or pointless at all
 One thing that was interesting is the fact that even characters who had little to no input into the story still had actual character models made for them
 Hell a few characters you never even found out their name
I'm espeically interested in what will happen with Flora, Misha and Riggs
Next the group of "enemies" now due to my no spoiler review this will be harder to explain
 We see barely anything about them again in 2 however we do get a little bit of interest from the leader
 Learning her power and even her breaking the 4th wall very slightly
 It gave a whole insight into what Ritona and Selphine are up against when returning home to Rughzenhide
 Replayability: Although i find it hard to replay most visual novels without having a very large gap inbetween play times
 I can very easily see myself replaying this
 It left me wanting, no craving for Fault Milestone 2 : below
 I really cannot wait to see how the story progresses
Music: The soundtrack and effects made are truly incredible
 They push forth what the scene is trying to make you feel
 Anger, Sadness, Intensity
 The general mood in visual novels hinges by a pivot and the music really sets the mood into what the writers clearly wanted the mood to feel like for the reader
 The soundtrack is great but doens't have anything in my mind that stood out such as The fruit of grisaia's Home (for Amane) or Holograph (for Sakaki) in Their respective routes
Overall: I really really enjoyed this visual novel
 No ifs or buts about it
 It was a massive improvement on what was already a good 1st game
 Although we are left with a lot of unanwsered questions I got a brilliant amount of satisfaction from the game
 I would highly recommend trying it
 However
for the love of god play through the 1st fault milestone
 If you do not you may be very confused as to what is going on
Final score 10/10 At the least a must try
 After reading through this visual novel i'd be happy paying for it at full price despite how short it may seem

For you that just want a quick review, i say this as simple as possible
 This kinetic novel story, is the best that i have ever read
 The character development, the plot, the art, the music, its all done professionally and beautifully craft
 You should buy and read the first one and also buy and read the second one
 Now, if you still need more reason, Let me tell you in this long wall of text
First thing first, the character development is
 wow
 Its very good, you will know, care, and feel connected with the characters after you done with this kinetic novel
 Usually in a lot of anime or visual novel, the way they tell the ruthless character to soften up is to change their personality instanly once they soften up, but this kinetic novel managed to make the ruthless character stay ruthless, but giving her a deep and logical reason of why she is ruthless
 There is no one dimensional characters in this kinetic novel
 It managed to makes me care with every characters even the evil one, and also makes me curious about others characters that the kinetic novel still didn't tells
 Every characters have a reason to do what they do, even though it feels wrong at first, that is the best part of the characters
The plot is well done as well, because it depends on the characters and as i said above, the characters development is really good
 Although the plot didn't have the "Unique" stuff like the first one have, it is still engaging and also fun while also very touching and might makes you cry
 I have to say this however, this one is also leaving a lot of unanswered plot point while didn't really answered the first one
 Unlike the first one however, the plot give the main character a better reason of why they do what they do, why they help the people along the way even though their freaking kingdom is in danger 
The art and the visual as you see on the store page is very nice and beautifully drawn, it what makes me even try this title when it first came out
 Like i said on my fault milestone 2 demo review, they have a freaking battle cutscene 
 In a kinetic novel 
 All the battle CG feels alive and engagging which is really good, not a lot of visual novel could do that to me, to make my imagination fill in the blank
 In my mind, the battle CG plays out like an anime instead of still pictures
I don't know how to comment about the music, but i know when a background music is good and did their job well, and this novel background music did that both
 they help me connect to a scene, like a sad scene or a fight scene
 One of my dissapointment however, its the lack of voice acting
 A lot of jokes felt flat because of it, because i know i would have laugh out loud if i heard the intonation of the characters when they said this funny stuff
Soo, yeah 
 Recommended to the highest degree
 If you enjoy visual novel and reading, be sure to buy this
 If you enjoy an epic and touching story, be sure to buy this
 Just buy this already 
 Steamkravter, buy this 
 ^-^

Fault 2 is a sequel to Fault 1, so you should play the first one before this Compared to fms one, fault milestone two side:above is short (i completed this in 5 hour) but more straightforward, with less mystery and more emotion
Art is as good as fms one and there's more CG
 Music fits the scene perfectly and the character development is really good
Simply put, this VN is fantasticPros+ Emotional Story+ Beautiful art and wonderful cinematic camera system+ Character development+ Fantastic soundtrack+ High Production Value+ Strong Villain
she can destroy the entire continent alongside with your faultms2a
exe using a spell, then rewind time to just before she cast the spell cons- No voice acting :((( (This game is too great not to get Voice Acting)Final score 9/1010/10 if Ritona and Rhegan get VA 
Posted: 9 September, 2015
Every VN should aim to be this good
 It's wondrously immersive and keeps your interest
 And honestly buying the previous one (as great as it is
--I mean, there is a reason this series is so beloved) isn't a necessary prerequisite to enjoy this one as it catches you up on what happened in the first installment
Posted: 28 April, 2016
Its even better than the first game, and I thought that couldnt be possible
 The quality of this kinetic VN is amazing, totally worth paying the full price
 I need more of this series in my life
Id love to see more works from these developers on Steam too
 10/10, worth every cent paid and worth every hour of gameplay

Overall I found ms2:a to be a very strong and quite intriguing VN
Relative to ms1, which you absolutely should read first if you haven't, I think it's a much more tightly constructed piece of work
 Everything has it's place so to speak and it's all arranged just so in a way that all comes together brilliantly
 The art is very solid and I'd suggest it's a moderate step up from ms1 overall
 In particular it's event CGs are very plentiful at 52 compared to the 24 found in ms1, this is despite it being only slightly longer
 The art and atmosphere are also enhanced by the periodic use of camera work which typically looks quite nice, although a few graphics lack the resolution to cope with it well if your screen is over 1200p
 The music is more or less on par with the previous title, although a little different as they picked up a dedicated composer
 I found the writing to be a really meaningful step up from the original
 This is due in part to a new translator being used who does a much better job than their predecessor
 I would also mention the improved translation in turn leads to better world cohesion which is nice to see
 On an aside it's worth rereading the encyclopedia, which has many of
the same entries as ms1, as the old translation was outright wrong in some cases
In terms of possible negatives I will say with regards to the direction they go in terms of character screen time that it may irritate some people, however I can't go into that without spoilers
 Personally I found it interesting although I do suspect I'll enjoy ms2:b, which I eagerly await, more than I did ms2:a
To anybody worried about the naming scheme with regards to above/bellow, you shouldn't be
 It's episodic in much the same way as ms1 and you still come away with a satisfying self contained story
Overall I think anybody who even remotely enjoyed ms1 should be very happy with this purchase
 To people who haven't read ms1 I'd suggest you go check it out
 It's a little rougher around the edges but still an exceptional read
Note this review will tag as pre-release because patreons started getting keys a few hours before launch, I also paid for a phisical JP copy and would have a key from that anyway so I don't consider it a conflict but I though I'd disclose anyway

Because this is a long review, I will stick a TLDR at the bottom
fault - milestone two side:above is a sequel to fault milestone one
 If you have not played fault milestone one, I strongly recommend that you play that game first, lest you risk being completely lost in what is going on
 fault - milestone two side:above is a medium length kinetic visual novel (very like fault milestone one)
 When I mean kinetic visual novel, I mean that there are no choices in the game, and you simply click and read as the game progress
 However, fret not, because fault milestone two does a very good job in many regards
 fault milestone 2 side:above was actually meant to be half a game, but for game length and pricing concerns, it was split up into the first half of fault milestone 2
The story follows the travels of Selphine, Ritona, and Rune as they try to return home (Okay no more otherwise I'll be spoiling >:), and I wouldn't want to do that)
 The storytelling improved in fault milestone 2 from fault milestone 1
 The pacing got better at times, and once again, there is a great deal of world building
 In fault milestone 2, Selphine and Rune both really recieved a great deal of further character development
 Selphine's character development really stood out in the second half of the visual novel, be it her or not her (you'll see what I mean)
 It is hard to tell some more without spoiling certain parts, but I will just say that the story deals with complex and deep things while still staying true to the series
 There is a bittersweet story near the end once again, and at the very end there is a rather heartwarming mini-movie (a couple of drawings paired as a story)
 Overall, the story of fault milestone 2 did not dissapoint, and I will look forward to more great things from the next installments
Aside from the story, fault milestone two side:above also features a great upgrade to the art
 There are more scenes, that are better quality, and with more variety
 The art is only going to get better in the future
 Oh, and what about the music
 The music for
this game was even better than fault milestone one in my opinion
 Some of the scenes were very fitting, and I enjoyed the last song the most (the one that comes with the mini-movie, it's really good in a calming way)
 It is really nice seeing the staff responsible for creating the fault series improve as people like me and all the other people who played this game support them
 We can only expect even better installments
Speaking about the staff and developer, it is also worth mentioning that the Alice in Dissonance community is also starting to thrive
 I joined their Discord around one year ago, back when it was still relatively small, and now it has grown to a much bigger level
 Same goes for the Steam group
 There is a community of people sprouting around this game, supporting it, and supporting each other
 This doesn't always happen with many games, and for all I care, this is great

This game, man
 This game is just absolutely fantastic
 If you like metroidvania-type games and bullet hells, you will most likely love this game
 It's by far the best action-platformer that I've ever played, and that's not just in gameplay
 Ignoring the story itself (which is probably mediocre at best, but charming nonetheless), there are so many ways that you can play and explore this colorful world
 Want to complete the entire game without collecting any item whatsoever
 You can do that
 Want to break the order of which the story progresses
 Well, you can do that too
Rabi-Ribi is the very definition of non-linear
 You can do what you want, when you want, and in any order that you want
 There's a plethora of hidden passageways and secrets
 Some of these things also only appear depending on how you're currently playing
 For example: if you are going through the game without collecting items, there is a part where you normally would not be able to progress without some specific items (e
g
 double jump), but upon reaching this area on a 0% item run, a spring will appear and you'll be able to move forward
 And to be crystal clear, this spring will not appear if you have collected any item at all (except rainbow eggs and three other things that are forced onto you), so you wouldn't be able to abuse this
 In that aspect, it's appearent that the developers really put a lot of thought into the game's structure, and I think that that should be respected because, nowadays, you just don't see things like this in games
The game has eight (six + two DLC) different difficulty levels
 Hard and above are there to provide a challenge to those that want it, but those that don't can opt to play on an easier difficulty that is closer to their own skill level
CasualNoviceNormalHardHell (Unlocked after clearing Hard)Bunny Extinction (Unlocked after clearing Hell)Unknown (DLC)Impossible (DLC)Now, going back to the word 'colorful': Rabi-Ribi is beautiful for a pixelated world
 It's very eye-catching and relaxing to look at
 Not to mention that the soundtrack is quite fitting for the overall atmosphere of the game
 But although the soundtrack is nice, I don't think that it's anything mindblowing and I can see it being repetitive for some people after a while
 There could stand to be more tracks for boss fights, as well, because as of right now it's very limited
 But that's just a minor complaint for me, as after the 80 hours that I've played so far, I am still enjoying it
Actually, I think that words cannot accurately express how much I am enjoying this game as a whole
 I'm not even good enough at it to do things like True Boss Rush on Hell difficulty or above
 In fact, I had some trouble just completing the game on Hard (though, to be fair, I didn't use buffs or consumables)
 But that doesn't, and never did, take away from the fun that I am having with the game
 There are plenty of other things for me to do, and if I ever feel like hating myself, I can just practice until I'm good enough to complete Impossible mode
Also, to be honest, I feel like the $17
99 price tag is pretty low (I'd gladly pay at least $40) for how many hours one can get out of it
 The game itself is not that long and can be beaten in just a few hours or less (if you know what you're doing), but its replay value is off the charts
 I mean, just check out those achievements
 And although it's not terribly long, the first playthrough for most people, on average, will probably take 15-20 hours
 Personally, it took me between 40-50 hours for my first playthrough because I played on Hard and went around collecting all items without using a guide
 Anyway
 TLDR; Rabi-Ribi provides a challenge for players of all skill levels in a way that almost no other game does, and that's letting you, the player, go at your own discretion
 It's also pretty spectacular, and if you love the metroidvania/bullet hell genres, you owe it to yourself to buy this game
 Don't even think about it--just do it
 I can guarantee that you won't regret it
(Also, the art is very cute and has some ecchi bits to it
 If you're not into that, please don't let it turn you off of buying the game
 You'll be missing out, greatly
)
Posted: 4 May, 2016
First of all let me just say; Do NOT pass this game up just because you think it's some fanservice ecchi eroge hentai thing
 The only thing you'll see is some slightly revealing outfits and some minor yuri undertones
 If you pass it up because of that, you're missing out on a ton of fun, trust me
 (I think the game is a little underrated because of people thinking that
) Now then with that out of the way, Rabi-Ribi is a 2D bullet hell metroidvania platformer where you play as Erina; a Bunny Girl who is accompanied by Ribbon; a Fairy
 Erina focuses on close range combat and Ribbon with long range
The story essentially revolves around Erina finding her master then finding helpers to help find her Master's sister
 While the story isn't too strong, the bullet hell boss battles & metroidvania aspects are definitely the biggest & best parts of the game
 It's also non-linear (after prologue) so you can go and tackle the bosses in any order you want, it makes speedruns very interesting
Pros+ Gameplay is very smooth & combat is satisfying+ Cute & well done pixel graphics, sprites and CGs+ Amazing soundtrack that fits very well with areas/boss fights+ Lots of different difficulties (from Casual to Bunny Extinction)+ Tons of boss battles (40+)+ Different badges to pick from which encourage different types of gameplay+ Many different areas & locations to explore and items to find & upgrade+ Non-linear+ Speedrun + Boss Rush+ Offers help (with buffs) when you get game over repeatedly (Normal or below)+ Lots of Steam integration (Cloud saving, trading cards, achievements, leaderboards) which I personally, really appreciate+ It has lots of replay value going for it with achievement hunting+ Developer is really nice and active in the Steam discussions+ BunnyCons (I had trouble actually finding reasons to dislike Rabi-Ribi)- Story wasn't too strong and was a little repetitive, but it works out- It had not too good optimization at first, but it's getting better- A few bugs here and there, mostly ironed out now (Nothing too major)- Boss battles get re-used a several times in the story (slightly annoying)- Slightly overpriced (If you go for all achievements, you get your money's worth for sure)All in all, you can tell alot of work was put into the game and i'd definitely recommend giving Rabi-Ribi a try, it's easily my game of 2016
 I hope you can take my word for it with all my achievements and hours in it
 Thanks for reading my review, hope it helped you

Posted: 1 February, 2016
Do not be fooled by all the weeb anime visuals, this game is an amazing metroidvania
The explorable game world is giant, and is mostly non-linear
There are literally dozens of bosses, many of which can be tackled in any order you want with few exceptions
There is fast travel to minimize some back tracking, a shop where you can buy upgrades, and a ton of hidden secrets and items scattered all over the map
The gameplay handles surprisingly well, and the music is top notch through the entire game
The story is sort of meh, and there's a lot of dialogue that is painful at times to read through
It doesn't detract enough from the game though
Boss battles seem to be at the heart of the game since there are so many
They are bullet hell Touhou style fights with creative and insane barrage patterns
Playing through blind on Hard right out of the gate, I found it to have the perfect level of challenge
It's hard enough that you feel motivated to hunt down hidden power-ups, but fair enough to not discourage you
After all if you get stuck on a boss there's always a few others you can try your luck on
After you beat the main final boss, which is a doozy of a fight that I won't forget soon, the game keeps plowing onwards after the credits roll into overtime with more challenges and extra content for those willing to see how deep the rabbit hole really goes
 (See what I did there
)Overall highly recommended for fans of metroidvanias, the game is very lengthy for the price and the replay value is there as well

Went for the bunny girlsStayed for the wonderful gameplay and musicWhen I got this I was shocked just how good of a game this really was
 It's a Metroidvania mixed with a bullet hell, but don't let the name "bullet hell" discourage you
 It has the right difficulty for any kind of player, new or veteran
Please, please try this game
Posted: 22 December, 2016
Most deceiving hardcore game on steam
Story:You're a bunny waifu who tags along with a fairy waifu, murdering a diversity of waifus
Gamplay:- Bullet hell
- Smooth combat, plenty of ways dealing with enemies and bosses so it never gets stale
 - During boss fights you get rewarded for performance with a ranking system that improves your damage
- The game has quite a bunch of difficulty modes, while the final one will provide a very nice challenge for those who seek it among you
- Big world with plenty of areas to explore and find secrets
 Almost every non-transition screen has a secret in it
Art:Weeb stuff, either you like it or you don't
World design is simple and easy on the eyes
Music:10/10, you might even find yourself listening to the OST outside the game
It's that good
Overall I had a great experience playing Rabi-Ribi
I would recommend this game to those who enjoy hardcore gaming (and are decent / good at it)
 If you're here for achievements then turn away from this game, as you will fail miserably to complete it

From CreSpirit comes a exploration platformer, bullet-hell, RPG, developed by CreSpirit and Published by Sekai Project
[Note - I have been provided a copy of this game by its publisher but it and has no effect on this review outcome]Introduction/ StoryRabi-Ribi is a 2D exploration platformer that focuses on non-linear gameplay
 There will be hints to guide the player along, but theyre never required to follow them, which allows for much greater freedom toyou guessed itexplore
 I absolutely love this game as a whole mainly reason is that there is full freedom of exploration, you could easily spend your time not following the story and just hunting for hidden treasures or objects
Rabi-Ribi follows the mishop adventure of Erina, whose routine life as a rabbit is turned upside down and inside out when she awakens to discover that, not only is she in an unfamiliar new world, but she has been transformed into a human girlwith rabbit ears and a fuzzy lil tail to match
 As Erina ventures out into this magical new world in search of her Master, she meets the spunky pink-haired fairy, Ribbon, who mysteriously chooses to stick by Erinas side
 Together, these unwitting heroes embark on their quest to restore Erinas life to normalcy, unbeknownst to the troubles that await them
Gameplay ElementsOnto the gameplay elements , I absolutely adore the customization that you can do to the game like making it a whole lot easier or simply by making the game harder as a whole
Badges  Provably 1 of the biggest thing that you would use in Rabi Ribi, as you can see in the above screenshot I took a full offense badge setup
 Basically it allows me to kill enemies relatively fast but if i were to take a hit, it would be a very very huge blow to my HP in Rabi Ribi
In Rabi-Ribi you could do almost anything you want without following the story at all, for my case what I did was i spent an approx 10 hours exploring and trying to find power-ups mainly Max health power ups because my health is low since I took a full offense badge setup
Controls  I am playing Rabi-Ribi on PC with a keyboard and the controls are good
 The default settings are are well thought out and it can be fully customize allowing you to bind any buttons you want on the keyboard
 [no cramping of 2 hands onto 1 side of the keyboard] I think having a good controls are very important because who wants to play a game with 2 hands overlapping each other
 Using a gamepad is recommended for Rabi Ribi but it all comes down to personal preference as for me I prefer keyboard but it is up to you too choose
Power ups  These can can be bought each time for a set amount of [EN] a currency used in Rabi-Ribi and they can be bought ONLY after you defeat bosses and they agreed to go to Rabi-Ribi town as seen in the above screenshots and you can buy power ups from them
 But do note these power ups do not last forever but can be repurchased again once it expires after a set amount of time
Difficulty level  A important factor people will look out for in bullet hell games, generally speaking from my experience for Rabi-Ribi it is very forgiving to new players, at the start on a new game you will be asked to choose a difficulty level
 As for me I went for novice first because I do not have much experience in bullet hell games but I found it way to easy so I decided to go for hard mode which is challenging and not too hard for me
 Well different people have different skill set
 Novice is too easy because each time you die you will respawn, but with a damage reduction buff but as for hard mode there is none
Enemy attack patterns  For hard mode it is manageable and challenging at the same time but as for novice it is way too easy but if you do plan to play casually do go for a novice difficulty
Audio and Visual Elements and FeaturesThey are STUNNING I love the artwork of the CGs they are all extremely detailed
 Soundtracks, the soundtracks are really great they fit into the battle that is happening in your screen it just makes the whole game feel more immersive and cool like you are really part of the fight, I absolutely love the soundtracks
To sum up Do I recommend this game
Definitely a BIG, Yes I definitely recommend you to pick it up if you are a fan off bullet hell and great soundtracks and love treasure hunting with RPG elements

Okay, where should I start
 I saw this game quite a few times in my Steam recommendations before actually buying it
 And well, not wanting to sound rude towards other "anime games" you usually read stuff like "It has anime boobs 10/10" so I didn't check the reviews when it said "Overwhelmingly positive
" Until that one day: and all reviews came up with: "Ignore the super cutesy appeal, it's a great platformer"And this is simply what I can only fully agree with: the game is a 2D platformer - combined with Touhou like bullet hell battles - and those battles get extremely hard over time
 I just saw the credits for the first time (apparently there will be quite a bit of post game content which I haven't explored yet) and boy - I was playing on "Novice" difficulty and the bosses were giving me a really hard time
 I'm not saying the game's unfair:it never is
 The controls work perfectly fine, they're super responsive - just make sure to get a controller to play this - in my case I remapped the buttons
 But yeah, the controls and everything working just great made me never blame the game if I died (and it happened quite often)
Other than that: If the cutesy appeal would turn you off - then you'll be certainly missing out on a great and challenging platformer
 The story might be a bit absurd to be frank - a bunny gets transformed into a girl and she searches for her master
 And as the story progresses she searches for her master's younger sister
Sounds simple
 Well, maybe
 But all the characters in the game have a little trait - there are very many so don't expect them to be super deep but they're very charming
So
well: I recommend it

I have over 300 games and this is one of the few that actually makes me happy
Posted: 21 June
Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile
 She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome
 I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released
To be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it
Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations
 And it was worth the wait
 This is an awesome piece of art
As a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace
 Visually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios
The gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming
Finally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot
Rakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles
 It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist
 It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title
Thank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen

Let me just dry my eyes again
this game is amazing
The characters are ALL totally unique, they have you relating to them in many different ways, the music is amazing and certainly helps set the mood in some emotional situations
One moment I was laughing at the funny jokes in the dialog and the next I was wiping the tears from my eyes as the game tugged on my heart strings
The game takes you through many different stories, all of which are tearjerking, funny, warm and sometimes a little scary and they all have their own hidden message for you to reflect on, you could learn a lot from this absolute masterpiece
 I could talk about this game forever but to save me doing that I think you should buy the game and experience it for yourselves, I can promise you that you won't regret it

If you think you're the target audience for this game, you probably are
It's a game with a story to tell, and that's what it does
 It's a story about grief and loss and regret and hope and accepting the inevitable
 It's about acknowledging the awful unavoidable things that occur in life--disasters, illness, accidents, bad decisions--and how people can decide to handle the awfulness and the importance of understanding
It's a game split between a hospital filled with patients with long-term illnesses, and a brightly colored fantasy land populated with cute animals that mirror the occupants of the hospital
 But the fantasy land isn't really a happy retreat from reality, and it's not a bright paint-job over a horrible truth
 The kid-friendly atmosphere isn't trying to hide the brutal reality of what's happening, just to look at it in a different, brighter light
 If a story-driven game with light puzzle elements and an unapologetically bittersweet story sounds good, you'll like the game
 If not, you probably won't
 To the Moon comparisons make sense, but I do think that Rakuen hits emotional notes that will resonate with a wider audience
And the game has a dedicated 'talk to Mom' button; more games could use a talk to Mom button

If you liked To The Moon, youll probably like this game
 Rakuen is a bittersweet, yet endearingly hopeful, emotional rollercoaster
 It made me laugh, it made me cry, it gave me chills, it broke my heart and soul, and it made me wish things were different
 Bring some tissues because there will probably be a 99% chance of precipitation originating from your tear ducts
 The story is about a Boy who is in a hospital
 He has a book called Rakuen that his Mom reads to him every night and finds out the world inside the book, Morizoras Forest, is real
 Hes able to travel to that world through doors that appear in the hospital and the game combines elements from both worlds into the story
 There are characters in the hospital that also show up in Morizoras Forest, and you have to find out what happened to these people (in both worlds)  what are their dreams, regrets, and hopes
There is no combat in this game  it focuses more on exploration and character development
 The puzzles were not too challenging, nor too frustrating
 The story itself is broken into 5 different parts/arcs and all of the arcs blended together seamlessly
 I got really invested into the characters and their storylines
 I could relate to each story in some way, which got me even more intrigued to find out what happened to these characters
 There are a ton of endearing characters, like a little girl named Sue who collects marbles that have planets inside of them and Tony, a grumpy old man who guards a broken music box
 There is such a huge contrast between the hospital and Morizoras Forest
 The hospital is gray and drab and is the location where most of the scary-ish scenes occur
 Its where the majority of the depressing elements of the story will come to play
 Morizoras Forest, however, is vibrant, colorful, and has adorable inhabitants
 There are beams of sun that move as you do, giving a resplendent feel to the forests charm
 The music is upbeat and everyone there is (generally) happy and very comical
 Although the game can be very sad, there is a lot of humor in the game as well and provides good comic relief during the unrelenting sadness
 There were moments where I would be bawling my eyes out but thered be some humor laced into the scene, so Id be laughing with snot dribbling out of my nose
 The world of the forest itself was full of ridiculously humorous characters
 I was dying when I saw what the equivalent of a cat is in the Forest
One thing that I appreciated, and loved, was that Mom was a huge presence in the game
 It established a great dynamic of Moms and Boys relationship and showed how far Mom would go for her son
 Mom was always there with you, to guide you, to give you helpful hints if you arent sure what to do next, and to even hold your hand when things got scary
 Im 27 years old, but I felt so much comfort and reassurance in having Mom there with me all the time, especially during scary scenes
 Mom was such a badass  shes strong, witty, smart, kind, reassuring, sassy, super knowledgeable about tea, and always looks at the goodness in people - and she even comes with dad jokes
 Shes a beacon of hope in the darkness
 The graphics and art style are super cute
 I like cute things (sue me, Im a grill) so when I saw how adorable the Leebles, buds, minimoris, and more from Morizoras Forest were, I was a goner - I died from cuteness
 The music was phenomenal
 I cant really say much more than it was amazing and added so much to the mood and atmosphere
 The music alone would make me want to cry sometimes
 The game itself is pretty short and I wish it had been longer  if only because I didnt want it to end
 I took my time with the game since I wanted to explore every inch of both worlds
 It took me 9
5 hours to finish the game  that includes all the stopping to bawl my eyes out and finding the strength to go on
 This game is so magical and heartwarming and instantly became one of my top favorites
 It will take you on a beautiful and amazing journey
 I can't recommend this game enough

I have never cried at the end of a videogame
Not in UndertaleOr in To The Moon
Not in any story-based game I have played or watched a playthrough on
I cried so much in playing Rakuen, I could probably fill up a sink with tears- of happiness and otherwise- and fill up a bucket to water my sky-island-reaching plant
I felt for these characters
 I laughed at their humor and cried for their pain
This is why you should just buy the game- even if you think you know what will happen
 Even if it was spoiled
 Even if you have never played a game like this before,please buy this game
This game not only shows what small-dev groups can do, but what games should be like
In the recent years of game sequels, game devs becoming lazy and creating terrible games, game creation that lacked a certain finesse,games that are full of happiness, sadness, humor, kindness- everything a good story gives- are the games that should succeed
Please help one of these great games, one full of something that means more than destroying monsters or enemies, succeed
 Buy Rakuen

MaestroRakuen has the potency of a violinists last note
 The bow moves, the fingers tighten, and the string sings with a cry of joy,
pain, anguish, or hope
A spotlight shines down and the musician bows her head in silence, surrounded only by the circle of light and blackness of the stage around her
The audience, frozen in place from the tenderness of the moment, tries to gather themselves from the emotion of her performance
Yes, Rakuen is like that
I never saw it coming
Here, out of this sweet little game packaged in an RPGmaker wrapper with happy faces and cheerful dialogue, came a tempest of storytelling
Make your comparisons to other games like To the Moon if you like, but this game can make you pause for a moment, shocked at the very real drama that unfolds within a single scene
 One minute I am picking Sila Berries, the next I simply forget to breathe as the tragedy of the story leaves me with that sinking feeling in my gut as if I am falling
Perhaps it rang too true with me, maybe Im a softie
What I can say without a doubt, though, is that Rakuen makes the player actually care about characters like very few games can
Gameplay/StoryWhat Ill begin with is our lead character, Boy, a young child, of perhaps eight years of age
He is in a hospital, along with many other characters, recovering from an illness
A doctor informs him of a thief that is stealing items from the hospital, and to the Boys surprise, his favorite book, Rakuen, has been stolen as well
The Boy sets out to find the culprit and retrieve the book, leading to an exploration of the hospital by opening drawers, discovering keys, collectibles, and solving puzzles along the way
The real meat of the game opens up after speaking with the entire cast of hospital residents and staff
 Once the book is retrieved, the Boys Mom appears and she stays with him throughout the rest of the story
She gives him a key to unlock the books magical land of Rakuen, which apparently is not just a story, but also a fantasyland juxtaposed to the real world of the hospital
Strange portal doors begin to be revealed, and the Boy and his Mom travel to Rakuen through these doors
Once there, they discover the land of Rakuen is in dire straits
The powerful forest guardian spirit, Morizora, has fallen into a dark sleep due to the negative energy of the Envoy spirits who are changing the forest into a land of doom and desolation
Its up to the Boy and his Mom to save the land by helping the inhabitants cope with their problems and collecting parts of a magical song called Mori no Kokoro in order awaken Morizora
Once awakened, Morizora can grant the Boy a single wish and save the forest
Right here is where the game takes on some adventure gameplay that feels quite a bit like the Blackwell series of games
Two characters are being played at the same time, the Boy and his Mom, to uncover clues and find out the tragic story of the other characters with the sole intention of helping those people find peace
Each time you help someone, you get a piece of the song, Mori no Kokoro
What you wont need to worry about, however, is how to combine items
That part of the game is done automatically once you figure out the puzzles and locate the keys or objects required to progress
That said, the puzzles are cleverly broken into sections that take some thought to figure out
There is nothing incredibly hard, yet you may get stuck occasionally due to a single key element that has yet to be uncovered
Rakuen has the uncanny ability to layer the clues and puzzles in such a way that the answers may be elusive even if the actual solution is right in front of you
Most of the difficult puzzles are in the first few sections, with the latter half of the game being much easier to get through
The main part of the gameplay that separates Rakuen from other games is that there are counterparts in the real world of the hospital
For example, with Winston and Gemma, Gemma is in a coma in the hospital with her husband Winston at her side
When going to the land of Rakuen, you see the exact same couple with Gemma sick in bed and Winston caring for her
In order to set these lives straight, you must visit their past, and patch together the story
The key here is that you interact with their past and show each character how to unburden themselves from the weight of their unhappiness
Each time a song is sung that becomes a piece of the final Mori no Kokoro song to awaken Morizora
There is no fighting, no leveling up, or weapons
Players are only able to help people not fight them
So, at this point, you may ask, Whats so special about that

For one, there is the dynamic of a child who is dealing with the arduous task of assisting these people with his mother by his side
Just like in Blackwell, the secondary character protects the main character, guides them, and helps with useful hints here and there
It also forms a relationship, one of the key components that made Blackwell successful, when two people are involved with each other you feel that connection between them
It not only moves the story along, it creates the opportunity for the mother to become a significant part of the plot
Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, Rakuen creates segmented drama
There are scenes where you want to continue with the story but have to unlock a series of events that go further than a simple explanation
A mere storyline is not enough
There are properly set-up scenes, not unlike a theater play
Here, Rakuen bravely drops hints of underlying secrets while keeping the big secrets in mystery until the final curtain drops
You complete one area only to discover another hidden alcove with insight into the backstory of someone, or a tiny snippet of life much like the calm before the storm
And then, there is the presentation of pacing
You might be completely unaware of the power of a scene until you get to the center of the story and have your heartstrings pulled when it all finally clicks together
It takes a lot of care and effort to pull that off correctly, and Rakuen does it in spades
Final ThoughtsEver have someone give you an origami figure that you unfold and discover a hidden story carefully tucked away inside
Thats Rakuen, a small and compact game which reveals the most endearing game experience Ive had all year
Rakuens focus is about personal connections
Each character has lost that connection and it is up to the Boy and his Mom to reassemble those bonds
 Its also about a tragedy, and Ill warn players that they very well may cry during this game
 I certainly did, but Im prone to that because Rakuen hit a nerve with me
When I was a little boy my sister had cancer and I remember those hospital rooms full of patients, each with their own personal stories of how they got there
Its not easy to manage through that and Ive never seen it portrayed in a game through a mother and child point of view
Its unique and touching, making you feel like you are right there in the hospital with them
Each scene is carefully constructed, with very close attention to the pacing and timing of select moments
 My throat got dry
 My eyes welled up
 I have to admit, it can be hard to take as the game pulls punch after punch
Yet, the journey is worth it
Rakuen aims right at your feelings with no holds barred
Ive seldom come across a game that tackles real world tragic events and uses them as core components of a storytelling experience
The pain you feel is entirely because these things can and do happen
The fantasy of Rakuen took me to a place I certainly did not expect
It connected me back to those difficult memories of the hospital that I purposely tried to forget
I wasnt sure how Id feel at the end but I have to say, I am thankful
My rating is an AutoSave, I encourage anyone who loves storytelling to purchase this game

A beautifully written experience from the dev, Laura Shigihara
 Don't let the simplistic art style fool you, this game is spicier than the spiciest meatball you've ever tasted
 And I've tasted some spicy meatballs
 (In a good way
)If you've played and enjoyed 'To The Moon,' and have been craving for a fresh new experience; this game does it all
 Amazing music that seems to fit every situation
 Cute and funny character development, even with characters that don't have a huge impact on the story
 Oh, and most importantly
 the feels
 I've had games make me teary-eyed before, but this game made this 6'2 bearded man emotional
 If I'm correct I believe this is Laura's first game
 If so, she nailed it first try
Do yourself a favor and pick up this work of art
 10/10

For me, Rakuen is a great showcase of video games as an art medium
 Combining the cinematic storytelling with the exploration mechanics of classic Zelda titles, Rakuen is an incredibly personal project and you can really feel its creator's touch on every aspect of the game
 As a non-combat, story-focused game created with RPG maker, I'll try to focus my review on these elements specifically
Thematically, it's probably easier to compare Rakuen to titles outside gaming realm such as the animated movie 'Spirited Away'
 Rakuen's main themes are family, friendships and the duality of life & death, which it generally handles pretty well - even though the pacing, depending on the player may seem overly melancholic and in some instances even pushy
 I've seen many people hype this game up mainly as a tear-jerker, what for me feels both as an overstatement and disregard to other parts of the story which I found great
 I do think that Rakuen has a touching plot, but the real highlight for me was its amazing side characters and hilarious writing that acted as a good counterpart for the overrall sad tone
On a mechanical level, Rakuen shines
 The limitations of the RPG engine and how the developer approaches them is often a good way of judging a game, and Rakuen feels like the framework was created for it and not the other way around
 Completely dropping combat aspects works well, and the usually tedious puzzle-solving of RPGM titles is done in a way that entwines it well with the story
 For me however, the enjoyability of said puzzles varied greatly
 A classic Zelda-esque dungeon was an amazing experience, but some of the more cramped and ominous parts felt monotone and only times I wished for a peek in the walkthrough
Graphically Rakuen is a treat with good character design, beautiful enviroments and fitting effects
 The unique artstyle coupled with original soundtrack might not be for everyone, but they really nail home the creator's passion for the project
Overall, Rakuen deserves the praise it's gotten - if it had been published to a handheld console ten years ago, it would be definitely praised as a classic gem by now
 Even now, it's a great example for both what you can do with such a simple engine and the emotional depth you can create with a videogame
Posted: 28 May
Rakuen starts off slow, but never loses the player's attention until the heartbreaking end
 What makes this game feel so special is, in my opinion, that it just feels complete
While there is still room for interpretation, the game will answer all relevant questions through its great storytelling
 And not only the main story is crafted this well, every character in this world feels unique, like a real living being
For 10 Euro (15 incl
 Soundtrack - definitely worth it
) I highly recommend Rakuen,because - even if it suffers under the same 'weaknesses' as other storydriven games, e
g
 not offering enough gameplay, it does not need to hide behind To The Moon, Life is Strange etc
 as it will definitely touch your feelings, and this game did it even more than any other game that I have played before
Please spread the word and give Rakuen a try even if you are not a fan of RPGMaker products,as this is the perfect example of a storydriven game highlighted with the right use of music at the right time
Thank you Laura Shigihara for this experience

I'm a sad man
 I'm late-40s and I still like cute things
 I also love RPGs, so you can see why I looked at Recettear and liked the look of it
The game wasn't quite what I thought it was though
 but in a good way
 I was pleasantly surprised
You'd probably be forgiven for thinking as I did - this is a typical JRPG with the theme being centred somehow around a shop
 Well, yes it is
 and it isn't
 The game essentially has two parts to it
 The RPG part takes the form of a fairly typical top-down dungeon crawler a la Chocobo's Dungeon, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and a host of other similar ones
 That's about as standard as it gets though
Recettear does things rather differently - you are a young girl who has inherited her father's item shop which serves the local townsfolk with equipment for their day-to-day use and more importantly, stuff to go a-dungeon-crawling with
 You also have a guardian of sorts (who also turns out to be a debt collector too) who's a fairy
 Well, this is a Japanese game - 'nuff said
 The relevance of this is that Recette (you) have also inherted some burden of debt too, who naturally you owe to your ward
 So, the crux of the game is to run the shop, and earn enough each day to enable you to pay off your monthly debt payment
I know, that might sound a little boring, but it isn't
 It's actually where the game really shines
 Your day is divided up into a maximum of 4 sections, which you can "spend" by either visiting town for certain things, visit the adventurer's guild (more on that later), or open the shop
 Your shop has certain shelf spaces laid out, and arranging the stock so your best stuff is visible from the window is an essential trick
 Put the boring, common and cheap items in the window and you'll attract less passers-by
 Put the really expensive stuff in the window and you'll also attract less passers-by
 It's a balancing act
Once customers come in, they'll flit around looking, and approach you with items they want to buy from the shelves
 As with any real-world store, the trick is to maximize profit, while retaining custom
 So, sell higher than you bought it, but low enough so they don't get annoyed and never return - another balancing act
 Some customers will ask for certain special orders in advance, which you almost always never have the stock at the time to fulfil, so you make a gamble on whether you can acquire the stock they're asking for - accept and fail, and they'll get annoyed, but refuse and they'll get annoyed too
 You can't please everyone
So where does the stock come from
 This is where the adventurer's guild and the dungeon crawling comes in
 Instead of opening the store, you can toddle off to the adventurer's guild where all the adventurers hang out
 You can recruit them, for a fee to go and dungeon crawl with you
There's a great element of risk/reward here, as at the end of each level, you can choose to duck out with the loot, or proceed onwards with the chance of more and better loot, but with the added risk of costly failure
 As Recette, doesn't fight (well, she's only a girl), you take the role of the adventurer here
 Her role is to tag along and store your part of the loot
So, you fight, you level up your adventurers, you gain better loot to sell for better prices, you get money to pay off your increasing debt, and so on
There's also some added little nuances such as it being wise to look after the adventurers you are hiring by selling them stuff cheap when they visit your store, as they'll use that stuff when crawling the not-so-murky depths
 As the game progresses, you'll need to get a bit inventive in how you manage your stock and customers, but I won't elaborate on that as that would be spoiling things
It's not an easy game to describe, and it probably sounds a bit dry on the face of it, but if you like the straight up old-school action-RPG dungeon crawler, I wouldn't hesitate to grab this - it does that part of it very well, but the light startegy side of shop management and how it dovetails so very, very nicely is what makes this game utterly unique
 I can't recommend it highly enough
So I have no hesitation in saying this is easily worth £15 on my value-for-money scale
Posted: 25 November, 2013
You think this is a cute little game about running an item shop and having fun, but it's not
 It's a game about crippling debt and trying your hardest to claw your way out of it
 The bank comes to your house and tells you that your dumb deadbeat dad is probably dead, and that they're going to repo your house
 Instead of making you homeless, the bank fairy just turns you into a slave and turns your house into an item shop (because zoning regulations and child labor laws don't exist here) and you spend the rest of the game trying to make payments to buy your freedom
 Fun game, but god help you if your hustle isn't strong enough
 Would not recommend to the capitalistically weak
Posted: 1 May, 2014
Finally a game where I can live out my fantasies of becoming a merchant who crushes hearts and dreams under the weight of his fat profit margin
Posted: 20 October, 2014
Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is, without exaggeration, my favorite game of all time
 The art and characters are absolutely adorable, the protagonist is even more so, and the gameplay is incredibly addictive
 You not only get to spend plenty of time squeezing every last possible cent out of your customers, you get enormous dungeons to go adventuring through and plenty of amazing spoils to bring back to the surface, craft into amazing items, and sell right back to the adventurer who helped you acquire them
 And once you pay off your loan, you unlock Endless Mode and get to finish exploring those dungeons and becoming a billionaire
 I have 225 hours of this game under my belt, and I STILL haven't finished finding every item in the game
 The plot(that is, the plot that isn't related to your loan - yes, there's more
) is definitely fun, although you won't be able to see the whole thing during your first story mode, but since Endless Mode allows you to pick up right where you left off, it's not a problem
Basically, what I'm getting at is that Recettear is an amazing game, I love it, and you probably will too
 Base price for hours of entertainment
 It's a bargain
 Capitalism, ho

Montaro is the best game i have ever played The concept of the game is very realistic
 These struggles are what doges go through on a daily basis
 This game raises important awareness for those poor doggos who have it hard
I can't remember exactly when I bought Montaro, but it was the best decision I ever made
 I saw the adorable shiba as the mascot, and saw it was only $0
99 and decided to try it out
 I got all of the achevements within about three days of hardcore gameplay and passion
 I've now got this game for at least eight of my friends so that they could enjoy it too
The Gameplay is simple, yet immersive
 The machanics of the environment and other characters never fail to be perfect
 the different skins, which i've unlocked all, are beautiful and I cannot pick a favorite
 Everything gameplay wise flows perfectly, and the graphics are stellar
 With everything you can interact with, it gets really challenging at some points, and may be rage inducing, but is always fun
The music within the game is the best thing i've ever heard
 When loading up the game, I wait for that iconic start, and it fills me with so many feelings every time
 I get an overwelming sense of pride, joy, inspiration, warmth, comfort, and compassion
 I wish you could buy the soundtrack
Sadly, there isn't multiplayer, but to be able to play Montaro at the same time as my friends, and hear their feedback is fantastic
 I've talked to all of them while playing, and some of them don't fully appreciate the artistic masterpiece which is Montaro, they do love it
 They all think its a good stress relieaver and wutld be great to have on the go
 As an aspiring game designer, this title has taught me so much
 I will forever hold Montaro in my heart
Overall, this game does everything perfectly
 There is very little anyone could do to make this beautiful experience better
 Montaro is well worth the $0
99, and more

TL;DR: A fairly simple endless runner game, just enough complexity to show the effort that went into it and make it worth the super-cheap price
Not going to be a super long review, but also likely far more serious than the other meme-based reviews on this game's page
In essence, Montaro is an endless runner game where you are auto-scrolling along the screen from left to right
 Your goal is to collect Doge coins, which usually are on the upper level of the screen
 After you collect enough, you can purchase new costumes for the dog you are playing as
 Ostensibly, the game is based around getting high scores, but notably to 100% complete it, you don't need to be anywhere near good at it, which is a positive if you worry about games ruining your completion percentage
The strategy (and there is a bit of one) of the game revolves around getting to the upper level of the screen, usually by bouncing off of certain objects
 Banana peels are the most common and allow you to keep on the upper levels by bouncing between platforms, but each one you bounce on takes a half-panty off your lifebar
 If you lose all health, you lose control of the dog for a while, usually leading to death
 So the best strategy is to stay up top as long as possible, drop down to refill by flipping up skirts (yes), and then get back up
 It is usually safer up top as well, but not always
The hazards in the game come in two forms, instant death and delayed hazard
 Instant death is pretty normal for these sorts of games, and in this game comes in the form of sewer holes, flying crows (which you can knock out if you hit them from the bottom while spinning), and angry cats
 The delayed hazards come in two forms, chickens and birds
 If you hit a chicken, it won't kill you, but instead a certain amount of time later, it will spawn a horde of them along the bottom, which runs left to right, pauses, then comes back
 The birds are perched up top, and if you hit them, they'll fly behind the screen, then come at you from the right, adjusting to try and hit your level
 Both of these are avoidable initially (just don't touch them), and when they come back, but you are easily screwed by them
The levels do change after a good bit of distance, adding more height, more ways to get up and down the levels, but in essence the game stays the same, with more complexity as you go
 Other than costumes and the achievements, there really is nothing more to the game
In summation, Montaro is a exceptionally cheap endless runner game, not a lot of investment in it, but not a lot of substance
 Enough effort was put into the game that it doesn't feel purely like a joke though, and that is appreciated

While my money was on Dodonpachi, I have to admit that Mushihimesama is the best choice for Cave's first game on Steam
 Before you start asking what a "Dowhatawhat" is, allow me to explain
 Cave is an STG* developer commonly known for their "bullet-hell" games
 The foundation of STGs is the prevalence of tiny instant-death orbs, so a barrage of them is a truly fearful sight
 In a way, Mushihimesama was conceived to be an "Anti-Cave" shooter
 Like a number of STG companies in the mid-90s, Cave was born from the ashes of Toaplan
 Before declaring bankruptcy in 1994, Toaplan was a giant in the STG world
 Their games were often high-quality, and relied mostly on traditional mechanics and scoring systems
 When playing a Toaplan shooter, you weren't concerned about "medal-chains", you were struggling to survive
 As intimidating as the average danmaku spread is; faster, more focused shots can be just as threatening
 In Dodonpachi you'll easily cut through battalions of tanks, but in Twin Cobra, one tank is usually enough to spell your doom
Reco is just your ordinary princess in an extraordinary world
 Atop Kiniro, her trusty beetle, she must face innumerable dangers in order to rescue her homeland from a deadly force
 You have an odyssey of your own to undertake, because Cave has put two generations of STGs into one tight package
 While you may or may not be a veteran of the genre, you always have to consider the basics
 In the age of danmaku, we see plenty of bullets, but all too often, we forget where they came from
 For the most part, all we know is that we'll stay alive as long as we continue dodging them
To really grasp what makes a 2D shooter work, we have to consider the origins of the bullet, hence "Original" mode
 In this mode, the bullets are minimal, quick, and very direct
 Your first instinct will always be to stay as far away as possible
 This means hiding out at the bottom of the screen
 A very important aspect of STGs that we tend to ignore, is that enemies are shooting to kill
 They aren't spreading bullets all over the screen for their health, they're aiming for you
 This is subtle, but if you pay attention in between the waves of projectiles, you'll see cannons turning in your direction, and the eyes of adversity following your movements
 Staying far away merely to give yourself the most reaction time, probably isn't the best idea
The maneuvers that you perform before the bullets are fired, are just as if not more important, than maneuvers made after bullets appear on-screen
 Every enemy in this game has their own attack-pattern
 When a stage begins, you might see one or two creatures perform this attack, but by the end of the stage, their numbers increase substantially
 These foes will combine their efforts with others (also introduced earlier) to make your life miserable
 By memorizing their patterns and locations, you've got an advantage, which is a very rare occurence in the STG world
 With this knowledge, you can "lead" enemies into firing at where you were, instead of your current position
 Eventually this will minimalize those frantic situations where you're trying to dodge everything at once
 Don't get me wrong, that's always fun, but not really conducive to survival
You also have to consider the psychological aspect
 All it takes to die in this game is one bullet, and even Original mode throws out hundreds of thousands
 When the situation becomes desparate, you can throw out a bullet-clearing bomb
 Bombs in a Cave shooter tend to penalize the player's score, but they also carry more insidious aspects
 In short, bombs are a weapon that is used against you
 In a genre where life and death are measured in pixels, do you ever really need to bomb
 Even thinking about the "B" button on your joystick is drawing focus away from the action
 Oft-times, you "panic-bomb", which mentally shakes you
 Shortly afterwards you're liable to exhaust your stock, and your lives aren't far behind
 This is all the more reason to learn enemies, their patterns, and how to lure their fire away
That's just the fundamentals
 There are still three more modes to test your abilities on
 Maniac is about what you'd expect from a Cave shooter
 The bullets fly a little slower, but they're far more plentiful, and much more ornate
 Still, what you learned in Original will help you here
 A lot of enemy-fire can still be led away, and even though every bullet is similarly-shaped and colored, you'll know exactly what is firing from where, so hopefully you can avoid terrible situations
 Unlike Original mode, where the bulk of your points comes from remaining lives at the end of the game (if you get that far), Maniac has a complicated scoring system
 It involves something called counter-banking and
uh
in the interest of sanity (and character limits), I recommend looking up a guide or watching replays
 One of the handy features this game offers is the option to turn on an "input window"
 Basically this shows exactly what joystick movements and button-presses are being made
 When you watch a replay off of the online leaderboards, you can get an idea of what the top players are doing to get their hi-scores
Unfortunately there's only so much that can prepare you for Ultra mode
 Just to give an example of just how difficult things get, I'll share my experience with this port
 The last time I played Mushihime-sama was nearly a decade ago
 When I started this port, I managed to reach the 4th stage on Original and Maniac, on my first attempt
 Ultra
 I couldn't even get past stage 1
 It'll take a herculean amount of effort to figure this nasty mode out
 So feel free to give Arrange mode a look
 I really like this mode, because getting high scores require that you get close to everything
 Point-blanking an enemy in a 2D shooter is a very dangerous idea, but it can also be extremely thrilling
 It's especially rewarding, when you discover those hidden safe-spots
 Once you get accustomed to point-blanking, the other modes are going to seem a bit easier
 You'll find yourself taking risks you never would have before, making subsequent attempts all the more interesting
 The only complaint I have about Arrange is that the True Last Boss makes an appearance
 In Ultra Mode, he's substantially more difficult than anything else in the game, which is saying a lot
 Arrange mode is a little easier than Maniac, but when the TLB shows up, everything goes out of whack
Regardless, this game is best experienced by spending time with every mode
 You might think that you have to be able to master Original before you can move onto Maniac, but what's the that old saying
 Rome wasn't 1CCed in a day
 Ehh
 What I meant to say is that all these different modes exist for a reason
 They're there to teach you about 2D shooters, and experience you gain in one mode can be shared with others
 Yes, there are more bullets, and Maniac/Ultra/Arrange have scoring methods to consider, but stage layouts and fundamentals remain the same
 There's also Novice and Training modes to help with your practice sessions
All in all, Mushihimesama gets my highest recommendation, because it explains so much about how STGs work, without using a single word
 The more you play the game, and its various modes, the more details you notice
 Your play-style slowly evolves to fit the nature of the genre, and you begin to do things your past self could never even imagine
 The gorgeous aesthetics and great soundtrack are icing on the cake
 Oh and you'll definitely want to get the v1
5 add-on as well
*2D shooters, Shmups, etc

It's responsive, quick and smooth, the Arrange and Matsuri modes are a treat, and it sounds/looks wonderful
 Finally, a better shmup than Crimzon Clover is on Steam
 Highly, highly recommended

I knew I'd find a few things to get annoyed with right away, but this is a PC port of a CAVE game that runs fine at first glance and offers all the content available in the 360 versions
 Such a thing was a pipe dream for a long time but here we go, Mushihimesama on Steam
 What a big day
 Buy this game immediately if you've never played Mushihimesama
 You've been missing out for years and so have I
 On to some ratings and complaints:10/10 Original game9/10 Supplementary content9/10 Port job 7/10 Conversion for PC audience9
5/10 Post-release supportSound/music for some modes pretty lofi quality
 They've worked on some of that (1
5) post-release, this is of course an old arcade came from a board with terrible sound to begin with
 Fixing/arranging more of the music would definitely make it a better arcade conversion to the home audience
Could use an FPS counter
I'd like to have an option to get rid of the xbox360 button graphics in menu dialogs etc
Would be nice if the CAVE bootscreen and 1st title screen were shown in a vertical orientation in TATE mode
The screen zoom settings are applied per mode rather than globally which may require you to set this up 4 times in a row the first time you play the game, but on the other hand, this lets you set different wallpapers for each mode, which some players might like a lot, so I think changing this on the setup side, you'd still want to let people change some things per mode
 It's not really a big deal
Obviously I'd love to see a new Arrange mode as DLC in the future but I'm sure they will be too busy priming more old games for release in general to take such a long look back into the game code
 I'd love to see an Arrange from any of the CAVE devs who didn't work on the original game, but I'd love to see what some random hacker did with it too
 Pipe dreams, again
 This is an absolute must buy for any STG fan who hasn't been fortunate enough to import Japanese region-locked games
 Thank you so much Blackbird and Degica for this
 If you have any problems with the game please contact Degica support and I'm sure they will get most of it sorted out
 This is certainly worlds better than any DotEmu wrapped emulator rerelease and Degica have rapidly become a godsend to bullet chasers worldwide
 This will almost certainly become the definitive version of Mushihimesama
Please excuse any errors on my part as I'm just now playing the game and I have never played the original port or arcade board

By far Cave's most beginner-friendly Shmup
 Great handling, excellent stage and boss design, memorable music
 There are 3 difficulty settings with one for every level of mastery
 Original Mode has been very popular even with complete beginners, while Ultra Mode is brutal for even the most seasoned veterans
 If you have even a fleeting interest in 2d shooters, treat yourself to this one
 (Have been playing Mushihimesama on PS2 and X360 extensively, just got this to be able to play on modern hardware)
Posted: 9 November, 2015
Mushihimesama is a vertical Bullet Hell in where you play as a girl riding a giant beetle and shooting other giant bugs into oblivion
 The reason why is explained at the end of the game but even then you will be left confused as to what happened and be left feeling like you just walked in to the ending of a movie with no context as to what it was about
 Very few people go into a bullet hell expecting a engrossing story though I found it funny to be greeted with what was supposed to be a tear-jerking ending when the game didn't even so much as tell me the main character's name before that scene
 It may sound weird to start off a review talking about the ending but this is a very short game and you will beat it in about half an hour or less, regardless of your skill level
 This game features unlimited continues so everyone will be able to get through it if they are persistent enough
 However the feature allowing you to save a replay of your play-through will cut off at the point you first lost all lives and had to use a continue
 There are three modes to play here, them being Novice, Normal and Arrange
 Novice is exactly what it sounds like and makes the game considerably easier by having less projectiles and simpler bullet curtains compared to Normal mode
 This is definitely the mode to start with if you are new or out of practice to the genre
 Arrange is a remix of the game that tweaks with certain aspects of the game that I will cover more thoroughly in a bit
 Each mode minus Arrange has both score attack in which you compete with your friends and play
 While in either mode you will have the option of either picking Original, Maniac for higher scores as well as more challenge and finally Ultra, for when you want to throw your controller/keyboard across the room in utter frustration at the real last boss wiping the floor with you
 You will also be able to change the amount of lives you have and at what score you get more
 Finally you will be able to pick which one of the three bullet formations you want to have, S-Power for a stream of condensed bullets for heavy damage, W-Power for a screen filling low damage attack and M-Power that is a mix of both
 There are quite a bit of options for you to mess around with to say the least
 Now that you are finally in the game and shooting bugs you will notice that this is pretty much what you would expect from a bullet hell
 Bombs to clear the screen of projectiles, a counter to keep track of your score and a ton of enemies wanting nothing more than to shoot you out of the air
 It does all of this very well and keeps you in a trance like state as you splatter all the bugs and collect all the yellow gems they drop to rake in a high score
 Black enemy beetles carry power-ups so you will want to shoot these buggers down
 The power-ups are either a small ally beetle that will shoot beams whenever you press the fire button, an upgrade to your projectiles or if you are about to fight a boss, a couple of bombs
 A neat thing about the upgrade projectile power-up is that you can let its timer count down and it will change into a different type of shot
 So say that you are shooting condensed projectiles but this part of the level is filled with a ton of enemies, simply wait for the power-up to change into a wide-shot formation and you will now have a much more suitable, screen filling projectile attack
 This is a really neat system that makes it beneficial to learning the three projectile types instead of always sticking with what you know
 Enemies in this game are huge and their size does matter as they will fire larger projectiles the bigger they are
 That's not to say you shouldn't be cautious of the smaller enemies as well, since they fire tiny projectiles it can be easy for them to shoot you when you are focusing on a gigantic enemy
 Remember that you are flying, you will be able to pass over some ground enemies when the amount of projectiles get intense and it seems there is nowhere to go
 Projectiles are bright purple and very easy to spot, so if you get hit it will always feel like your fault
 All of the five stages have a mid-boss that you will have to face and will leave if you take too much time with them
 Bosses are where you will be most tempted to use your bombs as they will shower you with intricate bullet patterns
 These moments are when you will most likely experience slowdown that will bring the action down to a crawl
 The developers have stated that these are on purpose to give you a chance to react to all that is happening on screen though it would be nice to have an option to toggle the slow down on or off nonetheless
 That finally brings us to Arrange mode
 This is only a mode you'd want to play if you are already familiar with the game, it only has the ultra difficulty meaning the game is at its most brutal and you will have to face the aforementioned real last boss
 She is the most shump/bullet hell boss I have ever encountered by far
 It is an extremely difficult fight and to top it off she has an absurd amount of health
 It will takes longer to whittle down her health and defeat her than it does to play through most of the game
 Now with that out of the way onto what makes Arrange mode different from the other two modes
 For one you start the game fully powered up and are able to kill the earlier enemies much easier than usual
You will also have a feature most other games call auto-bomb which causes your character to automatically toss a bomb, clearing the screen when you are about to get hit
 In this case she will throw all your bombs if you get hit, making your rate of survival much lower so you will not want to rely on that feature over your instinct of when to use them
 The final thing that makes this mode much different is the ability to change your form of projectiles on the whim, to any of the three types available
 Music in this game is a calm and soothing strangely enough
 Stranger still is that it somehow fits in with the whole shooting giant bugs theme of the game
 That is mostly due to the nice environments that range from flying over the water, across deserts and through giant trees
 You will also be able to mix and match the music to play stages with either of the two soundtracks available
 If you are playing this game horizontally you will be able to pick from 12 backgrounds to cover the parts of the screen that goes unused
 Vertically is how this game was meant to be played, so if you have a monitor that can pivot that would be the ideal way to play this, though you can't go wrong either way
 Annoyingly enough you will have to tweak the screen settings and the background in each of the three modes separately
 One global setting would have been much preferred instead of having to tweak the game to our liking in all three modes
 At the end of the day however, that is a minor complaint that will hopefully be fixed in a patch
 This is a blast to play and due to its length won't take up much of your time in your attempts to master the game
 Mushihimesama is an excellent bullet hell with plenty of content to keep you coming back and is hopefully the first in many of developer Cave's games to be released on the PC

I won't write a review for the game itself, you can already find countless of them on steam and over the internet
 I'll just review the port
 I've waited for some time and observed how things were going before either bashing or praising the port
 After 2 months, much has happened, things are more or less settled so I think it's the right moment
At release, let's be honest, game was in a clumsy state: crash problems, leaderboards problems, rendering problems and what not
 It was far from the Batman disaster hopefully, but it could definitely have been better
 Since it was CAVE first PC release, I think it would have been wiser from them to do like SNKP with KoF XIII and let users pre-purchase the game in beta so they could benefit from their feedback and bug reports
 Which is more or less what happened here, except it is not what we expected, and thus, not paid for
But we can't go back in time so let's look forward instead : since the 6th november (so in less than 2 months when I write this review), they have released no less than 6 patches, most issues have been addressed and they still listen to players for the few issues remaining
 They work hard, and fast
 They acknowledge their mistakes and do their best to fix them
I wouldn't have recommended Mushihimesama at its release
 Frankly
 But now, there's no reason to keep your wallet closed for this game
 CAVE devs proved that they are concerned and dedicated to the quality of their ports
 They have proved it was more than a mere cash grab
 Now we can wait for their future releases with an optimistic state of mind
Posted: 17 November, 2015
>>>This review has been written after 10 hours of play time<<<So let's get going
Mushihimesama is one of the best vertical scrolling shmups currently available on steam
 It features 5 entirely different levels, each one set up in a unique and compelling way
 These levels can be played on varying difficulty settings with three different "ship" types and different modes to add even more variety and depth
 The beginner friendly novice difficulty, as well as the normal difficulty, is separated into 3 different modes, with unique scoring systems and their own challenges in regards to scoring and staying alive
Don't let the art style fool you, this not some kiddy/girly game throwing monkey wrenches at you, this is a bullet hell game with all the bells and whistles, frenetic, engaging and satisfying all throughout
 Well planned and designed bullet patterns will fill your screen like nobody's business, especially when going for more difficult modes
 The encounters are nicely orchestrated and structured
 The stages play and feel different every time you approach them in a different way, be it hunting for scores or just trying another "ship" type
Replayable
 Definitely
 If you are the type of player to sink your teeth into games to improve on scores, routes, or to simply push yourself
 If you are simply looking for some fireworks, you can have those in spades, but you might be missing out on some of the fun, challenges and content, for that matter
 This game is no fast food at all
 The more you practice, the further you will go, the higher your final score will be
 This game respects your time and rewards you for your efforts
Sure, the art style is matter of taste, but it is somewhat refreshing to have it this way, because the number of military-styled shmups is legion
 The colours are vibrant, there is effort put into details which you might easily miss in the heat of the battle
 The soundtrack is moody, catchy and matches the overall visual theme, which is always appreciated
 The way it looks and sounds, it works fine, simple as that
Is it worth the money
 This is something you will have to answer for yourself, because my 20 bucks are not your 20 bucks, if you know what I'm saying
 Should you like shmups in general it is worth your time and money, should Mushihimesama be on sale at some point, doubly so
 If the idea of thousands of bullets flying around makes your fingertips tingle: What are you waiting for
Posted: 11 November, 2015
One of my all time favorite Bullet-Hell/Shoot 'em up games ever is finally on Steam
The fun of this game comes not only from how well crafted the graphics, sound, bullet patterns, enemy types, etc all are, but also from how simple but elegant the scoring systems are
 If you keep playing you WILL keep getting better, and you WILL keep getting higher scores
 The game has multiple game modes, each with their own quirks, scoring systems, and differing mechanics
 Not only do you have Arcade mode, but you also have Novice mode and Arrange mode
 And then each of those has Original, Maniac, and Ultra modes, which differ in more ways than just difficulty
There's also guaranteed to be unlimited challenge as far as the difficulty is concerned
 Novice Original is easy enough that people who've never picked up a game like this can 1 credit clear, while Novice Ultra provides for a great time for new players but still has that "holy crap I can't believe I just survived that" feel to it
 Then on the other end of the spectrum is Arcade Ultra, which is damned near impossible, you have unlimited credits which is an awesome feature but the challenge of course is to finish each mode with no credits or as less credits as possible and set a new high score
+ Great and varied modes and difficulty settings to suit your skill level+ Great Soundtrack+ Infinite continues+ Graphics and art styleP
S
 the game at launch had a few problems like crashing and not running at all for some like me but now its fixed and runs fine
Posted: 11 November, 2015
Mushihimesama is one of Cave's best STGs, which in turn makes it one of the best entries in the genre
 It features glorious bullet patterns, great level and boss design, and a large variety of gameplay modes
 The latter makes it particularly suitable as an entry-level shmup, as even beginners should be able to work towards 1-credit-clearing the game
The port was a bit wonky at the start (crashing with larger friend lists), but this issue was fixed quickly
Posted: 9 November, 2015
Just cleared Ultra mode, I'll be having nightmares in purple all week now
Now all we need is donpachi, dodonpachi, and deathsmiles on steam (and of course mushihimesama futari) and my life is complete

The 3-5 hour story takes place in a post-apocalyptic future and is told from the perspective of an unnamed Junker  a salvager who searches cities abandoned by war and plagued by perpetual acid rain for any trash that could be redeemed as treasure
 The eerie silence of his seemingly eventless trip to the war-torn site of an abandoned planetarium is broken by the cheerful voice of a young woman greeting him as the 2,500,000th visitor
 What is another person doing here
 This doesn't feel right at all
 So, with a grenade launcher cocked and loaded, he encounters Yumemi Hoshino  a chatty robot employee of the planetarium who's miraculously still functional but "a few fries short of a Happy Meal
" At first, Yumemi's overly friendly nature and almost saccharine optimism annoy the Junker to no end, but her effervescence eventually grows on him
Unlike many visual novels, which read like Choose Your Own Adventure books with branching pathways, Planetarian reads like a straight up "light novel" (Japanese novels with illustrations- somewhere between a manga and a full-on novel)
 Basically, all you do in this "game" is read words, look at the pretty pictures of anime characters atop dreary environments, and listen to the voices and background music
 There are no choices to make, no branching pathways to explore, and only one ending
 Speaking of light novels and voices, Planetarian spawned a light novel featuring four short stories and some audio drama CDs, so the storyline extends beyond the main game
 Music and voices are the only reasons to have Planetarian in a game format vs a print format
 The evocative soundtrack has some lovely music, and my favorite pieces exhibit a shimmery quality
 As far as the voices go, Yumemi's voice is suitably vibrant and Junker's voice is suitably disparaging
 Planetarian is not a bad game, but it does not tug the heartstrings quite like Freebird Games' To The Moon or hit the emotional notes of Key's other games like Kanon, Air, or Clannad
 Planetarian's story is all too brief, and the game's interactivity is nonexistent
 I would only recommend it to the most ardent fans of Key, and even then I would say to wait for Clannad's localization instead
Pros:+Enjoyable story
+Soothing Soundtrack+Good CG artworkCons-No gameplay
-One Ending with no branching route to select-Only Chinese Language for this HD remake-MY THOUGHT-There's something truly memorizing about the idea of a post apocalyptic world
 Perhaps its the perpetual loneliness of a race on the brink of extinction or how survivors struggle to cope with reality by clinging onto past memories
 Whatever the case, Planetarian embodies my favorite scenario in anime by telling a tragic tale between the most unlikely of companions in a world that has left them behind
 The story revolves around a hard nosed militaristic man and an adorable AI unit named Yumemi who functions as a tour guide of a Planetarium 
 She has zero awareness of the world on the verge of collapse around her, and is simply happy to have her first visitor in over thirty years
 These two could not be anymore different as entities, but together they find brief solace as the only inhabitants in what may be the last peaceful refuge on the planet
 Conclusion:Planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~ is a visual novel that fans of the genre should be required to play if they missed out on it previously
 Once you know what youre getting into with kinetic novels, its easier to simply sit back and let the storyline work its magic
 Once the game is over itll stick with you, too, which is still a surprisingly rare and impressive experience to get with games

When I saw the Chinese version of Planetarian in Steam store, I purchased it without hesitation
 The release of Chinese version really shows Key's sincerity to Chinese consumers
 I believe that if Key would publish Chinese version of their other games, such as Air or Clannad, I would also buy them as soon as their release
Thanks for the wonderful games presented by Key
Posted: 8 May
It's a game from 10 years ago
 Reviews are pretty worthless ATM
Just want to say thank you Key

A very short visual novel (took me only almost 3 hours to complete) but i enjoyed it a lot although it is a very typical "grumpy man in a devastated world meets happy girl" kind of situation (although this time the girl is a robot)
 10 dollar is a little bit too much in my opinion though (because of the short time) better get it on sale
Posted: 20 October
A short but touching tale set in a dystopian future, Planetarian seeks to explain the meaning of a life, be it a human or a robotic one, in a world that is void of life but only death, destruction, frustration, despair, desperation and hunger remain
 While I must say Planetarian is not as touching, exhilirating and impressive as other Key titles, this is still a good buy
Posted: 21 November, 2015
I recommend the game, I do not however recommend buying off steam, buy from denpasoft website and you will get the H scenes, which are missing in the steam version, I bought the steam version and the H scenes have a lot of character development in them and some are completely cut from the steam version, there is also no way to patch it in
 Ultimately by the time I discovered this I had played over the 2 hours that warrant a refund so I had to spend 80$ just to play the full game
 Don't make my mistake just get it from denpasoft
Posted: 30 May, 2015
Grisaia no Kajitsu
 It's my favorite visual novel
The interface is great and comfortable, there is a good selection of Extras, like CGI and even Windows soundpacks and even icons
 On a technical standpoint, it's a great game
I may not have many hours on this (Unless a R-18 patch is released, or created by the users) - but I have played it
Now with the story, it has its fair share of funny moments, and its fair share of dramatic moments
as well as those moments that had me on the brink of tears, or just depressed for multiple days
Amane's route is outstanding
 One issue in this version is that you're missing out on the adult content, which is coincidentally a large focus of her route
 Though, there is also a lot of humor and fun in this version without any adult content
 I will not spoil Amane's route at all because it's something that you truly have to experience for yourself
 When I first played through her route, I only got 2 hours of sleep for 2 nights in a row, just because of how interested I was
 It's amazing
 Sachi's route is very good, it's interesting finding out exactly what drives her to act as she does, just make sure that you are ready for the reason
 Try not to get the bad ending for her, though
truly horrifying
 I don't know fully how to put how I feel about her route into words, but I assure you that it's great
 The R-18 content here does not matter as much, I believe- though in general I do believe that not having it is a general issue
Yumiko's route is nice, she's sort of like a tsundere/kuudere mix in personality, and her route is generally good, but not exceptionally remarkable overall
 I enjoyed her route a lot, especially in seeing how she slowly becomes close to you, or Yuuji
 Nearing the end a lot of unexpected things happen, and it is all played out pretty well, but once again, when you compare it to something like Amane's route, it's hard to stand out
 However, I still enjoyed it a lot
I have not yet completed Makina's route, though it is pretty good so far
 Lots of humor, and a lot of dark stuff as well
 Each route has two sides, and they are all generally played out well
 R-18 content here as far as I have gone doesn't matter at all, but I can't say for sure since I have not yet completed it
I have not started Michiru's route, but some people argue that it is the best route in the entire game
 Others argue that Amane's route is the best
 They're generally the two most acclaimed in this game
Overall, there was not a single moment in which I wanted to just get through a certain part to get to the good stuff so to speak
 The entire experience was perfect, from the comedy to the pure horror at some points in time, everything was great
 I do not have a single complaint for this game, but it goes without saying that the R-18 version is the definitive version to get
If you're looking for an outstanding visual novel that will last you over 50 hours of gameplay-(Yes, even with quick reading)look no further than Grisaia no Kajitsu, or "The Fruit of Grisaia"
Posted: 31 May, 2015
I've played the uncensored version of this game, so ill just summarize this version and the uncensored version while giving a honest reviewPros--A deep DEEP storyline involving each girl-Very beautifal CG's and animation quality throughout the entire game-Common route is enjoyable and a fresh slice of life introduction before you make your choices-Lolis (Need I say more)-Tsunderes (Need I say more)-Kuuderes (Need I say more -
-)-Many HNNNNNNG moments throughout each route-Yuuji's wisecracks-Yuuji's philisophical input throughout the game-Lotta sass, LOOOOOOTTA sass-Over 50+ hours worth of content to play, and its so good that you'll replay the routes over again, guarenteed
-Great voice actors-The skip buttonCon--Its censored, so for those of you who are expecting the gratious amount of 18+ content the original version offered (Especially in Amane's route) Forget it
-The common route is LOOOONG, I mean 5-6+ hours alone long if you can stand watching it-Some routes aren't exactly the most realistic of scenarios (COUGH MICHIRU COUGH)-Unless you are a diehard fan of the series, sitting thourghout the monologue that is the common route may reduce you to rubble and dust
Posted: 7 June
Contains all the details you missed from the Anime
 What a great VN
 Lots of paths to choose from, and the writing style that Yuuji had really appealed to me
 If you want to avoid spoilers (if you watched the Anime first) then theres a great guide here, but I played this first so I chose with my heart ;) I can't think of any faults - the OST was also amazing

a great novel but a lot is censored (language etc)
unrated is justice

*I played through all of the game with an offline version of the game*Fruit of Grisaia is a visual NOVEL not a dating sim; you will be reading for hours before you make your first choice and another hour before you make your second choice
 The story is a long and rambling account of a strange guy going to an obscure school of only five weird female students
 Yes the setup is absurd, but Fruit of Grisaia knows it and goes with it
As a novel I have to say how good the writing is since it is often thought provoking and emotionally touching
 The problem is that those good moments are amongst a sea of silly-stupid encounters with those girls
 That sillyness is fine if you like over-the-top Japanese cutesy schtick, but it's incredibly annoying if you don't
 All the girls are to some degree frustrating-annoying with the Micharu girl being way off the scale
 Michiru is so bad she is obnoxious
 Makina is annoying but you later learn about her inner demons and why she is who she is
 In fact, all of the main characters have their backstories developed wonderfully
 Every character has their own genuine motives, wow
Posted: 14 June, 2015
My friends hyped this visual novel to me to the point where it could no longer live up to my expectations
 I was expecting writing up with the likes of Clannad and Little Busters
That being said, it's still very good
 I would say the character routes are, in fact, more intriguing and in-depth than the character routes from aforementioned visual novels by far
First off, this visual novel does not have a true ending
 The story leads somewhere entirely different based on which girl's route you choose
 This is a very character-oriented visual novel
 Second, this visual novel does not have a lot of choice-making
 The choices you have to make are pretty much limited to route branches and good/bad endings
 While this is not a negative thing during the characters' routes, it could possibly have some impact on the very long common route if you are a person who would like to branch off into a character's route as soon as possible, or like to re-read parts of the common route and see what would happen if you made a different choice
Third, the soundtrack is very good
 Some visual novels tend to have a pretty forgettable soundtrack with the exception of a few major tracks (I'm looking at you, Sharin no Kuni, Himawari no Shoujo), but that is not the case with this one
 It's one of those soundtracks where it's easy to hear that it belongs to The Fruit of Grisaia
Fourth and last, the artwork is very pretty
 The backgrounds and the CG are top quality
 Couldn't ask for any improvements on those
 After you complete a girls route you even unlock system voices, icons, and desktop wallpapers related to that character

Review - The Fruit of Grisaia"One of the best visual novels in Steam
 Definitely a great mix of comedy, drama and romance
"
The Fruit of Grisaia is the first of the Grisaia Trilogy
 The Fruit of Grisaia is a visual novel where you take the role of transfer student, Kazami Yuuji as he enters Mihama Academy and hopes for an "ordinary" school life
 As the story progresses, you will come upon the 5 heroines of the novel namely: Sakaki Yumiko, Suou Amane, Komine Sachi, Matsushima Michiru and Irisu Makina
 Each heroine has their own unique story and personality
As said by most players, this is a very long visual novel with a lineup of up to 32 scenes/chapters on the common route alone excluding the around 17+ scenes/chapters for the heroine's actual arc
 The price of the game is well worth it because aside from its very long content, it also features the whole CG Gallery, Scene Replay and Music Collection unlike other Visual Novels in Steam where the CG Gallery and other features are removed from the actual VN
 I finished this Visual Novel by around 50+ hours
 After finishing one of the 5 arcs, you'll also unlock a Secret feature but I'll let you see it for yourself once you get your own copy of The Fruit of Grisaia
I recommend this game to big fans of visual novels
 This ain't for you if you can't stand to read a lot of content because this is really a very long novel
 The content of the novel is very well written and packs quite a lot of humor
 Each chapter/scene, whether its a common route or a heroine's arc, is very much worth every minute of your time
 From the cuteness of Yumiko to Michiru's clumsiness, the novel will give you quite a feel of watching an actual anime episode
 If you're looking for some humor with a mix of drama and feels, this is one of Steam's best Visual Novel available
 If you don't believe me, then see and feel it for yourself

Sachi: If it is the fate of the tsundere never to yield in battle for seduction
 If you must overcome the allure of Amane-san's breasts
 I believe only one path lies open for you
 The temptation of the hole
Michiru: 
 The hole
Sachi: Yes, the hole
 To be more precise, I am referring to the female genitalia
Michiru: 
What
 Did you just say
 genitalia
Sachi: Allow me to explain
Sachi: I will construct a heap of sand above your groin to emphasize your current inability to move, then dig a tunnel offering direct access to your genitals
 We shall use this suggestive and convenient "hole" to tempt Kazami-kun
Michiru: 
Uhm
 Sachi
 What
 are you saying
Sachi: The plan has a solid theoretical basis, I assure you
 I read this in a book the other day
Sachi: To conceal a flaw in your security system, it's wise to make an obvious "hole" to draw focus away from the true weak point
 In other words, we attract attention to this hole in order to distract from your undeniably inferior breasts
Michiru: 
What
 are you talking about
 huh
 is it the heat
 has heat gone to your head
Sachi: Please don't say such things
 I'm thinking quite clearly
 Everything is perfectly normal
Michiru: What part of this is normal
10/10 best scriptIn all seriousness though this game is amazing
 I bought all three of vns from kickstarter and now i just bought the digital copy
 You should really buy this, the feels are real and it can get pretty damn funny
Once the 18+ version comes out you should think about getting it
 It adds to the story, manly amanes route imo
btw michiru is best girl"you've got to be blond and have twintails
 otherwise, you won't be recognized as a genuine tsundere
"over all the game is a 10\10
Posted: 14 November, 2014
Deep inside the old sarcophagus city, while searching for food, weapons, or resellable scraps, you make an unlikely discovery: What you'd assumed to be an abandoned military facility is actually a pre-war planetarium
 And as it turns out, the custodian robot is still welcoming customers after all these years
Let's talk about planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~
It's a kinetic novel (a visual novel without any choices or other interactive game elements), so the only thing that the player/reader controls is the pace of the story
 Do what you will with that information
Originally developed by Key in 2004 and recently published on Steam by Sekai Project, this is widely considered a classic in the VN community, and a very worthwhile addition to the still meager selection of good visual novels on Steam
 It's a short story about a world full of desolation, hopelessness, cynicism and resignation, and about a little robot girl who's immune to all of it
 It's also about going stargazing in a world without stars
The backgrounds and character sprites in planetarian are somewhat sparse in direct comparison to some of the more visually bombastic VNs out there
 It is however very evocative, and with that it falls in line with the writing
 The whole novel follows a slow pace -- never dragged out, but certainly deliberate
 It leaves plenty of time for you and your own thoughts, and I urge you to take advantage of this invitation
 I ended up with just over three hours of total playtime, which included some breathing room for the fantastic voice acting
Any good visual novel swings in tune with its soundtrack, and planetarian is no exception
 Opening with the music box lullaby "The World of the Stars" it immediately offers you a glimpse of its gentle mood
 Tracks like "Song of Starflight" accentuate the day-to-day interactions of the main characters with a lax and childish air, while the perhaps most iconic song of the roster, "Gentle Jena", cushions some of the more tender scenes in an aura of warmth and belonging (and I would encourage you to keep that last one playing in the background while you read the rest of this review)
Visual novels as a medium don't lend themselves especially well to twitchy action stories, and despite the occasional surprise in that regard, the bulk of planetarian is about its characters and their interactions
 Of the two main characters, only one actually appears on screen, and it would be a fair assessment to say that the story is about her, in several ways
Yumemi (translated as "Reverie" in some localizations) is not the kind of quasi-human A
I
 that we're used to from the likes of Cortana or EDI
 She is a robot programmed for a very straightforward purpose
 She oscillates between toddler-like naiveté at best, and robotic-algorithmic behavior at worst
 So why do you entertain her thoughts of repairing the old projector
 Why do you, a looter perpetually on the verge of starvation, end up tacking another night onto your stay at the old planetarium
This story isn't about what Yumemi is, but about what she represents
Spending valuable time and energy on a planetarium of all things should feel frivolous, yes, downright sacrilegious
 But there is something peculiar inside you, easy to explain away as idle curiosity about the starry night sky that you only know from old people's stories
 Something you probably didn't think you still had
 They say there was a time before the war, before the planet was shrouded by a thick layer of acid clouds, when people were able to look at the stars whenever they wanted
 When there was still a notion of mankind eventually travelling to, and settling on, foreign worlds
Back when people still had hope for the future
Yumemi was left behind at the beginning of the war, and despite not having had any sort of human contact in years, she diligently awaits the day's customers
 There's only one thing she wants out of this existence, one thing she wants to do more than anything else in the world: to show you the stars
The little robot girl, once built for the simple goal of caring for the planetarium's customers, ends up fulfilling a much grander purpose
 Tucked away in her own little corner of a gray world inhabited by people who have forgotten what it means to be human, Yumemi is a shining beacon, a time capsule, a reminder that there is a star-filled sky right behind the acid clouds
 Yumemi is the child, the lamb
 She embodies innocence, childlike wonder, relentless optimism
 Looking into her eyes, you cannot help but feel deeply ashamed for what the world has become
What was it, then, that made you stay at the planetarium
 Was it really just idle curiosity
 Or is there more to this little thought in the back of your head after all
 Do you feel in your stomach what the place emanates
 Does Yumemi give you the strength to dare to form the words, that maybe, just maybe
 there is some hope left in this world
 That there is such a thing as "the future"
You should read planetarian if you have any interest in visual novels, if you haven't experienced a good story in a while, if you like looking up at the stars and wondering what the future holds, or if that little spark deep inside you that is almost drowned by cynicism needs a little bit of nourishment
 Wholeheartedly recommended

It's a nice & sweet short story I've read
 Planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~ is made by the legendary company "Key", well known for creating Angel Beats
, Clannad and Little Busters
 anime series
 This game will guaranteed to touch you with the feels and make you cry
Good points- Fantastic character development & interactions between the two unique characters - The junker guy & Yumemi the gentle robot
- Very well presented that will easily set your mind into the wonderful world of Planetarian
 - Delightful soundtrack & story
 I love the soundtrack especially Gentle Jena, one of my favorite songs
 The melody is so touching and charming
 Listen to this piece & you'll be blown away https://www

planetarian may be a short story, but it is one that sticks with you in the back of your mind for a very long time
 I still remember when I first finished planetarian years ago
 It is as soul-crushing as it is beautiful, and the impact still holds up against the best of Key's catalogue critically acclaimed visual novels
 Thematically, it shares many ties to Key's most recent game Rewrite, which could be interpreted as an attempt at expanding upon the themes introduced in this game in a grander narrative
 With that in mind, I would definitely recommend the two as complimentary to each other
 If you're perhaps new to visual novels in general, then planetarian is definitely a good place to start
 It demonstrates some of the very best of what visual novels have to offer in a tiny package; a small taste of what you can look forward to in the world of visual novels
 It's also serves as a great appetiser to Key's brand, something to prepare your palate for the main course of Key's much larger games
 I'd recommend this game to anybody who appreciates a good story that touches on some really powerful themes
 It's not for the faint of heart, but once you've managed to overcome the pain it's bound to put you through, you might come out with something you didn't have before

And you're reading reviews instead of insta-purchasing
For shame
Posted: 25 October, 2015
-Finished the game
-Immediately search for Planetarium within the city
-Can't find one
 -Looked up into the night sky
-Saw 2 stars
-Start crying
Thanks Key, not only I can't eat dango and watch baseball without feeling sad
Now I can't even look at the night sky the same way
P
S: Buy this game on Steam if it's 75% off sale, unless you want to support the publisher/developer
The game is only 5 hours long at most, and you can get it much cheaper on Itune store (It seems that not all Itune Store has the English ver, I know for sure that the Canadian Itune store has the English ver)

A VN by 'key' and one of the leading VN developers in the world makes a VN that will make you cry at the end, assuming you actually cry because this is VN are by the same people who made Clannad, Air, Kanon, Little Busters (All great VNs and animes)
 It does show its age (this VN was made 10 years ago) when you play the game and the 'save' function isn't great either, you only get 5 save slots, so you have to overwrite your saves quite a lot
 The story is set in the future after the "failure of the Space Colonization Program"
 It is a post-apocalyptic novel involving only 2 main characters "Mr
 Customer" aka "The Junker" and Yumemi Hoshino aka the robot
 There is no "choose your on route/story" in this VN, its a direct story with no choices
 GraphicsAs you'd expect, this a pretty old VN, so graphics isn't its strong point here
 It has basic drawn images and the animation is limited
 Though the visuals are not the great part, you can still enjoy the VN with what is offers
 Final Score: 5/10StorylineThis is a VN by 'key' we are talking about, of course its going to tell you a great story
 I have never read a VN by 'key' and said "I was disappointed with it"
 All their VNs are nicely told, it often gives you tears, but thats part of the experience
 Expect to cry in every VN that 'key' makes
Final Score: 10/10SoundAnother strong factor here
 The music and soundtracks are possibly the most satisfying thing you will love about this VN, considering that it is over 10 years old
 I still have a hard time trying to figure out how they managed to make all these soundtracks, they are absolutely fantastic, even though half of them where very sad to listen to
 The only downside is that there is only a few of these soundtracks
Final Score: 9/10Gameplay/Features/LayoutThe VN offers simple controls, press "Enter" to read another line, press "Spacebar" to hide the text box etc
nothing complicated there
 The features are also very simple, since the VN is pretty old
 It goes the same with the overall layout
 Here's and great tip, tilt your head left or right in the title screen and be amazedFinal Score: 6/10PriceProbably the most common question when buying anything is "Is it worth buying it
"
 If you like light romance and sad stories
 This is your best bet
 You won't regret your choice, it was made by 'key', so you know it's worth it
 At £7, this is a pretty cheap VN already, considering there are other VNs out there that cost more and has less stuff to offer
 This is definitely worth your time and you shouldn't worry about spending too much on this
 Final Score: 10/10Overall Score : 40/50Percentage Score: 80%

Early Access Review
It's hard for me to play games
 Every hour I'm playing a game is an hour I could have spent writing some useful code, getting some chore done, or exercising under the preposterous delusion I'll ever be skinny
This game breaks through that and asserts the value of the occasional diversion
 It makes me smile when the world around me is a never ending stream of negativity about politics I stopped caring about long ago
 This game made it so the Xbox 360 controller I bought doesn't just sit on top of my workstation collecting dust
I won't bother talking about the game itself
 It's all already been said
 You should buy this game
 Don't wait for a sale, just get it
I just wanted to say thank you Radical Fish Games

To be fair, this one is a masterpiece
 I had honestly enjoyed every second of it
Pros: - Unique combat and talent systems; - Charming excellent-looking universe; - Practical easy-to-understand visual tutorials;
- Interesting non-repetitive quests and sidestories/dialogues; - Great music; - Touching story; - Huge parkour-based detailed world; - In-game statistics which includes absolutely everything; - A lot of secrets on levels; - Creatively-made memorable enemies and bosses; - Good AI; - Perfectly balanced difficulty, challenging enough;Cons: - Super addictive, and by that I mean I already want to start whining about additional content until I'll blow up
 To be noticed: - Super comfortable playing via gamepads; - No bugs, no glitches, no crashes, no lags, everything works perfectly, can't believe this is in Early Access; - I'm in love with main characters

Early Access Review
Quite possibly one of the highest quality indie games I have ever seen, and it's not even out of Early Access
CrossCode is an effective love-letter to the era of SNES action RPGs, with smooth, engaging combat and challenging puzzle segments
The combat is varied and requires different strategies to take out different enemies
 You can fight enemies with both melee and ranged attacks at the same time
 There are a huge amount of ways you can upgrade and customise both of these methods of attack
The puzzles combine a wide variety of mechanics in order to provide various challenges for the player, which are always very satisfying to complete
The 16-bit graphics are absolutely beautiful to look at, with extremely fluid and detailed animation, as well as stylish interfaces and character design
 The game's characters are all well-written, unique and very likeable
 Even the main character has a very clear personality, despite her vocabulary only consisting of around five words
 This game is absolutely filled to the brim with witty dialogue
CrossCode has an intriguing story, which involves the game's (mostly) silent protagonist trying to regain her memories and uncover her past
 However, the game is currently unfinished, so you may have to wait a while to experience the story in it's entirety
 (Even now, the game still has enough content to be worth the price tag
)The developers of the game are constantly adding to and improving the game, though, and they are especially responsive towards the community

CrossCode is a very enjoyable game to play that has an incredible amount of content in it for an early access on top of the Devs constantly updating it and adding more content to it every month or two, I highly recommend you get this title during a sale or even at full price it's still worth every penny
The artstyle for CrossCode is gorgeous, combat is fast paced and responsive, Boss battles are challenging, soundtrack is really awesome, puzzles are actually really fun and engaging to do even though I personally suck at them xD, the storyline & characters are great and the main character Lea is just so adorable and badass at the same time >
< this game feels like a Fusion of Megaman, Zelda, Secret of Mana and

Within a few minutes, Cross Code takes you back to the days of you sitting in front of your CRT reliving your favourite action RPGs on the SNES: Secret of Mana, Terranigma, Chrono Trigger
 Using a combination of charming, classic hand-drawn environments and characters, a soundtrack that makes you remember it days after you last played, expressive and likeable (N)PCs, an interesting setting that keeps you intrigued, mind-boggling puzzles that require brains AND timing and a battle system built around throwing balls that simply doesn't get boring or tedious, delivers enough challenges for you to improve and trumps with epic boss fights
This review is based on the current version 0

 You take the role of Lea, a Spheromancer-class character in the fictional MMOG CrossWorlds
 For unknown reasons, Lea lost her memory and logs into CrossWorlds as an attempt to recover it, but due to a problem her speech module isn't working properly, resulting in her ingame avatar being mute
 Only with the help of a programmer called Sergey, she is able to express simple words like "Hi", "Bye" or "Lea"
 To find the answers to her questions and to her memories, she keeps playing the game in order to not make the system identify her as an intruder or bot and kick her out
 With the help of various other players from other classes and the crew of the MS Solar, she dives into the world of CrossWorlds
 VisualsCross Code is visually resembling the 16-bit titles from the SNES and Playstation 1 era using a flat top-down-perspective to make the riocheting and ball throwing natural
 It mixes classic medieval RPG environments with futuristic elements like laser bridges, energy walls and teleport devices
 Every area or city has its own look which is defined by the area it is built in:Rookie Harbor, with its western medieval style, Bergen Village, where snow-covered houses are built around cliffs, Ba'kii Kum, resembling a desert town that was built around a large oasis, Basin Keep, a rainy, modern skyscraper city in the midst of a fairytail-like jungle
 The world is full of little details and filled with NPCs talking or running around the areas and towns making the game appear lively and populated at all times
 AudioThe game features a rich playlist for all kinds of situations and environments and never seems to be out of place
 On top of that, has a very enganging battle and boss theme
 Style reminds of early PSX-themes
 Especially atmospheric in puzzle rooms where concentration is required, rhythmic beats keep your mind focused
 The sound effects are natural and a mixture of sounds that fit the medieval setting as well as the MMO type futuristic sounds
 Explosions are loud, wind is soft
 When you use skills, they will impact with force and sound and landing every hit feels great
 GameplayControllable with both mouse and keyboard and gamepad, the gameplay is responsive and easy to pick up
 However, you will learn early that precision and skill are still required to be effective in this game; you can not simply run up to opponents and start beating them up: they have more than one way to deal with you
That brings me to the three main gameplay elements of Cross Code
 But first,Mechanics
Because of the puzzles, it is impossible to miss a mechanic as you have to understand and use it to proceed
 Every puzzle is a tutorial so to speak
The formula is mostly like this:- Introduction of new element/mechanic tied to it- Very simple introduction puzzle/battle for comprehension- Several puzzles and battles with advanced usage- Boss battle that requires advanced usage and timingPuzzlesPuzzles make use of all logic you pick up in the game
 If a new element or mechanic is introduced, the following puzzles will evolve around that
 For example, the Faj'ro temple makes use of both your ice and fire element by introducing walls that are made of water
 Based on the element you use on them, they become ice blocks or vaporate for a limited time
The puzzles themselves are never hard: They are easy to comprehend and you always know what you have to do to solve it
 The only factor that makes you fail the puzzle is yourself
 Either you are not used to mechanics yet, or you missed the timing
ParkourThis game does not have a jump button by design
 Lea will automatically jump once you run off a ledge or gap
 Using that, every single area has parkour and free running elements
 They either lead to hidden chests, secrets or new areas

Early Access Review
"After beating the dungeon I now know the truth
 The developers feed on the rage of the players
 Without our agony the developers cannot succeed
"I almost cried reading that, and I understood why
I have been looking for an actual RPG game for a while now and CrossCode filled that void
 A great story, great combat, and a very pleasent developer team
 Being a fan of the whole variety of games, CrossCode was a bit of a shock when I realized the game wasn't just another cut out of the RPG cloth
It carries elements from several genres:RPG (Obviously): Giving into the classical feeling of a Megaman or Zelda-esk stlye CrossCode has an "almost" cliche story involving Amnesia and a broken voice module
 Avoiding the classic silent protagonist and going with an almost silent one (Who by the way has a very wide range of reactions even without most of her speaking abilities) allows for solid communication and in most cases relatability
RTS: The entire combat system is Real time, and YOU have the decision to keep going on your fighting streak
 (Although the terminology BLOOD LUST comes to mind) The games fighting aspect is not easy either, most enemies require a specific strategy to deal damage, and in some cases, won't even take damage unless you perform a set of actions before hand
 (I'm looking at you Phoenix, I have a special set of words for your ice dungeon BS)Story-Driven: Or if you'd prefer a visual novel
 Every character you interact with has a personality, random people hanging out nearby, random people in the combat areas, every single NPC
 There isn't a single NPC who doesn't feel unique from the other, and the developers have done an amazing job at upholding this level of seriousness
 Your party members feel like real people, they have lives outside of CrossCode and it works as a solid excuse to pause the game and add to the building story of Lea
 Oh yes, Lea, you amnesia ridden woman you
 Besides having amnesia, Lea has a speech problem, apparantly, in which is made up by her sense of humor expressed through her responses
 Grinding: I LOVE BL2 and grinding was a huge part of it, so to face a small amount really didn't phase me much
 This game does have a grinding aspect (It has a mission literally built on grinding, but more on that later
) but it isn't as bad as some RPG games would make it
 The chances of things dropping are relatively high, and if you are willing to search, you will find what you need
Puzzles: NYEH
Thats dead now
To put it simply, this game has a major play on the puzzles aspect, and is the thing that the dungeons are built on
 If you play this game, don't go in not expecting your brain to be challenged, because I can promise you, you will not get away without feeling slightly aggervated at one puzzle or the next
 Don't worry, you'll figure it out, it might take you a few days, but I totally believe in you
 (Please make guide on how to puzzle, these developers abuse my puzzle privledges
)In all, CrossCode, is it the next big thing
Possibly
Is it a definite success
Pretty sure it already is
Is it worth my money
Yep, if you want it in early access that is
Normally, this would be the point I go on some rant about early access but I cant help but praise the developers on this
In two years they succesfully stayed on track for updates and releases, and I have yet to see them fail
So, congrats on being an actual succesful early dev team, you just outdid 90% of the other teams
Good luck on release day, I see this game exploding on that day, its got a wonderful community and a great team to keep it together, and I look forward to seeing whats next in your work

Early Access Review
NOTE: The story premise is fascinating
 For people interested in the plot, I can only say this: If you buy it, wait until the full release when the devs do it justice
 You will miss out on plot elements if you play it before then
 The game is addicting, but for an RPG with a linear story like this one, there should be more to it
 The gameplay is a class-act, though
The game's combat is irrefutably polished and well-designed
 It is like a bullet-hell meets hack and slash, but tactics are involved as well
 The skill-tree is incomplete but looks hopeful
 The dungeons are really enjoyable, although occasionally segments proved to feel a bit tedious
 The bosses are interesting to fight, though not too difficult
 As an RPG, the game is NOT a grind
 Levelling and acquisition of gear is usually not difficult or tedious, but to make things even better there is a sort of kill-count system that makes the levelling experience involve more player engagement than the basic combat already requires
 The music is really good, even though some songs may get old after a few minutes
 Turning the music down a bit helped me with that, though
 The art is a 10 out of 10
 I found myself ogling at the level of detail of the boss in the first actual dungeon, and every other asset seems to have that same level of polish and aesthetic appeal

CrossCodeDeveloper: Radical Fish GamesPublisher: Deck13 Interactive GmbH, Deck13Note: A key for this game was provided by the developer for the purpose of writing an informative review
 No other compensation was given
Introduction==========CrossCode is the perfect example of why Early Access exists
 It gives us an idea of the game the developers have in mind, while allowing us to support them and help them to finish their game
 CrossCode is an action RPG, and a shiny pearl in the sea of
trash that's currently swimming in Early Access
 There are a lot of systems and features in place and ready to go, such as melee/ranged attacks, dodging, guarding, skill trees, elemental attacks, interacting with the terrain, trading, puzzle-filled dungeons, story scripting, enemy AI and attack patterns, bosses, and more
 CrossCode draws heavily from the 16-bit era, and if you've played Secret of Mana or Zelda: A Link to the Past for the SNES, then you'll see the influence easily
 The gameplay is very similar to those two games, and it's simply amazing
 The current version of CrossCode is a set of demos, one for each mode: Story, Puzzle, and Exploration
 I'll go over each one in turn
Gameplay==========First, let's go over Story Mode
 In Story Mode, you are introduced to a cast of characters and the game world
 I'm not going to spoil anything here, but let's just say it's a premise that's been done before but with a few twists
 You begin in a sort of tutorial area, which has you running a character through a small forested area towards a building
 Along the way, you are taught the basic controls and basic combat abilities
Once you reach the building a short dialogue occurs, then the game transitions to a cargo ship where we meet the main player character and the supporting cast
 More tutorials occur, such as ranged and melee combat, switches, dodging, and later guarding
 You have a melee slashing attack, and a ranged attack that has you shooting spheres
 The spheres are able to bounce off walls when charged
 The Story Mode demo wraps up after a boss battle that introduces an antagonist who tries to abduct the main character
 She is saved by the supporting cast and makes an escape
Next, we have Puzzle Mode
 Puzzle Mode takes you through a typical dungeon that will be implemented into the finished game
 This has you hitting switches to open doors, moving boxes to press switches, navigating large rooms to solve puzzles scattered throughout, and ultimately ending up at a boss battle that introduces you to Boss AI scripting
 It has 3 phases, the first being the melee phase
 It'll be within your melee range, so just attack it normally
 Next with Phase 2 it'll move away out of your melee range, so start using your ranged attacks
 In the combat area are 2 switches which raise 2 pillars
 When the boss starts charging up it super attack, hit one of the switches and hide behind a pillar that pops up
 The boss will finish his attack, then hit the switch itself and lower the pillar and resume it's attacks
 In phase 3 it gains a shield, which you need to solve a small puzzle to figure out how to bring it down
 It involves bouncing your ranged attacks off of bumpers to hit it from behind, shorting out it's shield
 Defeating it gives you the option to take on the "Final Challenge", which is a short Survival Mode, that has you fighting waves of enemies
 The Puzzle Mode Demo wraps up afterwards
Last, we have Exploration Mode
 This starts you in an area called Autumn's Rise, where you are introduced to even more features, like Elemental Attacks, Skills, Items, Equipment, and Combat Arts
 In this mode you are free to explore the map, defeat enemies, and buy equipment and items from the few shops that are present
 There are even a few trading booths where you can trade items you find for other items
Exploration Mode ends when you find all of the hidden treasure chests in the area and open up the last challenge
 Graphics==========CrossCode is a very colorful, vivid game, with detailed character sprites
 Remember how the SNES did sprites
 Take those, and make them 100 times better
 CrossCode uses very crisp sprites with fluid animations for all aspects of gameplay
 Attacks, movement, dodging, etc
all look extremely detailed and very well done
 No complaints from me in the graphcis department
 I grew up with classics like Super Mario World, Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy III (VI), Chrono Trigger, Earthbound, and Lufia, so I'm no stranger to sprite-based games
 CrossCode features some of the best sprites I've ever seen in a video game
 Even the character portraits are sprites
Sound and Music==========Great sound effects and cacthy tunes that fit any given situation
 The music sounds like it would have been right at home on the SNES, and sounds very Secret of Mana or Star Ocean-esque; this fits the theme of the game extremely well
 When combat starts the music changes to a more fitting tone, and transistions back to normal when combat is concluded
 Being a big fan of video game music, I can't go on enough about how much I like the music in this game
Performance==========I ran into absolutely no issues while playing CrossCode
 Everything was crisp and smooth, no framerate issues or crashing
 The game seems very well optimized for a game in what looks liek an alpha stage
 This makes it very easy to recommend this game to all players who are fans of this genre, as they will have very little issues getting the game to run so they can enjoy it
Final Thoughts==========This game has everything you could possibly want from an action RPG
 Combat, exploration, puzzles, dungeons
the concept is here and it's amazing
 Please buy this to support the developers and help them get this gem finished
 I'd hate to see such potential shut down, and this game has a ton of potential
 It could be the next big indie title
 It just needs a helping hand
 And with Steam's Early Access program, that could very well happen
 Even with it's early alpha/demo state, it still offers several hours of fun gameplay
Gameplay Demo==========This demo covers all of Puzzle Mode and a nice portion of Exploration Mode

Early Access Review
"CrossCode is a poster child for why independent games matter more than ever in a market where AAA relevance is dwindling
 It's destined to become a cult phenomenon, reverently mentioned in the same company as Cave Story, Braid, or Fez
 I'm highly looking forward to it and you should be too
"So I summarized the first (and currently only) review I ever thought worth writing over a year ago
 15 months on, it's truer than ever
 In the intervening time, among plenty of other great independent games, we saw the absolute juggernaut that was Undertale blow up the internet
 And at the risk of drawing parallels between two VERY different games ("indie" isn't a genre after all), CrossCode deserves that kind of recognition
CrossCode is not the best game you'll ever play
 Its story and characters are fun and infectiously endearing, but they won't redefine the way you think about narrative in games
 Its art and music are lovingly crafted, but so are a dozen other great (and not-so-great) pixel-art games
 The puzzles are smart and the fast-paced combat is insanely fun and suitably challenging, but it probably won't supplant your favorite ARPG
 CrossCode is reminiscent of a lot of things, a synthesis of elements both nostalgic and modern that you've likely seen many times before
What CrossCode likely IS though, is the best game you've never played
 Because it's been fairly sparsely covered during its early access period, it's flown under the radar for a lot of people
 And because that synthesis of elements is so well tuned, you'll wonder how you missed hearing about such a well-made game for so long
 Almost every aspect of CrossCode feels really, really good to play, not just in an acceptably non-distracting sort of way, but dripping with love and care and attention to detail
 The extreme ratio of positive reviews isn't a fluke or vote gaming by a hyper-devoted fanbase
 Lately, it's people finding the game wondering if an early access game can really be THAT good, and discovering to their delight that yes, it really can be
CrossCode is aiming for official release some time in the first half of 2017, and the amount of progress that the development team has made since the early access launch last year strongly suggests this is a realistic goal
 Even if you don't want to spend money on an early access game right now, do yourself a favor and follow it, because you're probably going to want it when it's finished

Early Access Review
You play as a girl avatar that lost memory in a M-M-O game
 Well
 sounds familiar
 Anyhow
 it's got cool puzzles interesting boss fight
 a level up system
 a equipment system
 a quest system
 a Circit upgrad system
 A big open world map for action rpg in many secters
 A samus aran type of ablity/upgrade scene that's really cool
Intersting background and combat music that i like
 So far this game is lovely
As for an very eally access game
 the whole story plot is only 30 minutes long
 it took me 40 minutes cause i had a little problem with a boss
 8/10 a really fun small indie Action RPG
 cannot wait for more story plot
Posted: 30 May
today i will tell you why you should Buy this game
1
 Because its not like rebirth 1 with all of that grinding
2
 Its not like rebirth 2 and with a short story and a hour worth of nep's
3
 Its not like rebirth 3 with the over powered dlc weapons and characters
Megadimension VII offers a whole new way of playing like investment in citys and route building ill explain
investment is 3 different types of ways to spend money to help you inprove your Megadimension life
1
Commerse is, each level you upgrade will enable you to buy more items form the shop
2
industrial is, the items you will be able to develop will increase's3
puplic relations is, the higher the level the better the stuff you get from your country, such as processer units, healing items, other usefull items, and of course the nepquiz and walletcrusher on of the best shows on television
The route building is a much better way of travelling instead on instant teleportation like on the rebirth series
 at first you have to use credits to purchase the route that you want to build too
 and in the route building you can encounter random enemies when travelling, but if you have a new game+ you can disable that, but whats the fun in a quick and easy playthrough
Megadimension VII starts in 1 part of 3 stories, Zero dimension, hyperdimension, heartdimension
with all these storys you would expect this to be a long game, well your right there is about 40-50hours if gameplay in all 3 storys and you will never be bored there is new areas and Finally a better villan, well a few awesome villans
 (not gonna spoil anything) no offence to Arbore, pop-up purple had, arsnore what ever her name was
The 1 bad thing about this game is that if you play this for countless hours, you will love the way the game looks and then when you go back too the rebirth series you feel a bit
 odd
now lets talk about the Gold Third even thought there are 4 members
C-Sha (the Leader): She's more of a glutton than her looks may suggest, and she can't do so much as lift a finger on an empty stomach
 S-Sha:
A young woman who's reserved and seems very cool, but has a considerably aggravated case of chuunibyou
 She has two Dogoo-like monsters who serve under her
 B-Sha: she likes to build robots, collect hero toys and serve as a hero of justice
 However, her phobia of monsters prevents her from doing this job efficiently
 Because of this, she transforms into the mysterious hero known as Presto Mask to give herself confidence
K-Sha: K-Sha is a yandere when it comes to Noire
 She's very protective and cares passionately about her, though in a somewhat romantic way which annoys Noire occasionally
 when holding a gun however, K-Sha's personality changes drastically
 Rather then being shy, she becomes dead serious and will complete her missions without question
 Much like Uni, K-Sha is skilled with guns
Now we go with uzume Tennoboshi: Uzume is the type of girl who is obsessed with being cool so that she comes off as reliable
 Uzume is exceptionally loyal and honest to her friends, Very rarely will you see her relax unless she is around friends
 However, this is a very strong willed facade made to help cope with her position as Zero Dimension's sole remaining CPU
This game has to be one of the best Neptunia Games, because its a 2016 game the graphics are amazing, the new systems inplemented into the game are cool too, and of course new characters, and remodel'ed characters
 its a very facinating game that deserves to be called a Neptunia Game
This game is like 3 games in one
 and deserves to be $39
99 + DLC costs
at first when i bought this, i thought was that you can build a country from the ground up from one of the acheivements that was listed, but thats alright this game was a really good one anyway
 cant wait for future Nep Games, Especially 4GO,Im gonna Rate this a 9
5/10the -
5 is becasue i had to but game in windowed mode for it not to crash suddenly
Overall Best Game 2016
Posted: 9 June
Lets start by saying that this game is funny and worth playing if you like anime rpg; now we can go a bit more into details with pro and cons:pros:-the game still use the same turn based strategy as the other games from the main series, a very fast turn based strategy with movement and positioning;-even bigger cast of cute girl only;-inproved combo system;-new dungeons added to the classic one; -new monsters;-city management system;-a few trick in the plot that i will not spoiler;-very nice CG
cons:-Nepnep trolling can be a bit annoing;-city management is not deep;-new monster and dungeon are few in number;-heavely reuse of the older enties of the series game system
so yeah more or less every entry in the list above explain itself but not the last one, which is why you're still reading
what i mean with reuse of the old game system is exactly that, having played all neptunia games i can totally see that the developer have used the old game asset to create this one: graphic engine, model, textures, some music, ecc
 Now while it can actually be fine since this game is totally anime graphic (meaning it doesn't really grow old), after so many years from the first entry of this series i would have expected at least a graphic improvement
This last point is the only one that really bother me but, even still, this is a very good anime game

In all brutal honesty, I wasn't enthused about making yet another trip to Gamindustri
 Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth was a pleasant surprise due to its colorful cast and amusing storyline
 The second Re;Birth game was a solid improvement
 The third game was even better, but it was also more of the same
 At the time, I thought that this RPG series was long overdue for a fresh take, but I started to worry that it would never happen
 I envisioned that Compile Heart had grown complacent
 They would continue to hammer these Neptunia RPGs out, all with slightly different storylines, five or twenty additional characters, and memes more "dank" than ever thought possible
 With the release of Megadimension Neptunia V2, Compile Heart has put my worries to rest
 This is, without a doubt, the best entry in the series thus far
 The Story and CharactersDespite having "V2" in the title, this entry in the saga has very little in common with "V1" aka Re;Birth 3
 In fact, if you have at least some familiarity with the CPUs and the Candidates, then you could probably approach V2 as its own self-contained story
 Without giving too much away, this game is divided into three separate acts
 Each act focuses on a handful of characters, and their efforts to protect Gamindustri from a mysterious threat
 The storyline is darker than in previous games, but it never becomes overbearing, or gritty just for the sake of it
 The truly serious moments feel earned
 Even accounting for the franchise's penchant for farce, the villains are well-written, and the heroines deal with the problems facing them in a convincing fashion
 Alongside the improved story-telling is a very strong cast
 With Re;Birth 2 and especially 3, CPU Candidate Nepgear went from mediocre to almost unsalvageable
 This is her best role yet
 Big sister Neptune has also improved
 Well, she's still as ridiculous as ever, but at least she's not completely irritating
 Noire, Blanc, Vert, and Uni also have more involved roles in the storyline, which is a huge plus
 As far as new characters go, Uzume is exceptional
 Her story is well thought-out, and her quirks are endearing rather than grating
 The Golden Third represents the "developer" characters that are common in Neptunia games (Cave, Red, Mages, etc)
 Again, I have nothing but praise for them
 Rather than being a mere excuse to include several references and in-jokes, each of these four characters has their own arc
While it would have been nice to see a few characters from the previous Neptunia trilogy make an appearance, I believe that sticking with just the main heroines and the handful of newcomers, was a very wise decision
 There aren't as many meaningless skits, and conversations don't get buried by dozens of people voicing their thoughts at once
 The three-act storyline neatly ties everything together
The GameCompile Heart has made changes to nearly every element of its bread & butter RPG
 The dungeons are slightly larger, house more secrets, and can involve a little platforming
 This provides another incentive for players to jump around, aside from the stat-boosting challenges and the ability to loudly exclaim "I'm a kangaroo
" The structure of this game has also undergone a massive overhaul
 In the previous games, it was easy to unlock optional dungeons, defeat the side-bosses, and enter a cycle of constant level-ups that removed any semblance of challenge from the main story
 There's still more than enough side-content in V2, but unless you're really determined, you won't reach a "kill-all-bosses-in-one-hit" level of experience
 At least until new game+
The remake system has been removed from Gamindustri
 While you can still gather monster materials to craft some items or enhance gear, you won't need gamefaqs the entire time you're playing
 Most gear acquisitions are handled the old fashioned way; via store purchases, or finding them in dungeons
 Other unlockables, like the "cheat" abilities (higher jump, faster run speed, etc) are discovered simply by playing through the game
 Furthermore, by employing scouts, you can discover additional treasures and new dungeons
 So, if you disliked Stella as much as any normal person, you'll be happy to know that she was kicked to the curb
 While these changes might disappoint some Re;Birth fans, overall they improve the pacing and atmosphere
 Your play-through of the game isn't under constant risk of being halted, just so you can look up how to find a "old dragon ball", an "old dragon horn", or the all-important "old dragon's 
" However, some of the other changes & additions are a little undercooked
 The overworld no longer functions as a "click on the location to instantly travel" map
 Now you have to selection your destination, and the protagonist will run to wherever that is
 The reason I don't like this setup is because there are random encounters
 While they aren't too annoying, I really have to wonder why they exist
 Random encounters can be turned off after beating the game
 This is equal parts welcome and perplexing
 A number of other unlockables such as scouts, clothes, and weapon modifications are awarded by investing in all of the major lands (Planeptune, Lastation, etc)
 It's a neat idea, but you're liable to spend most of the game dirt-poor
 In fact, by the time you have the opportunity to do any serious investing, your first play-through is about to end
The battle system has also undergone some slight modifications
 The EXE meter resets after every battle, and overall isn't nearly the "win" button it was in the past
 To balance this out, all of the playable characters have recieved more moves and abilities
 The combo system has also been revamped
 Certain combination attacks can result in longer waits, which effects the heroine's turn order
 Combo attacks can also do more damage if certain conditions are satisfied (such as performing a rush attack just before a power attack)
 The differences aren't dramatic, but if you're attempting to play through the game at low levels of experience, they can be pretty important
 Positioning is also more tactical than ever, since enemies (and playable characters
) take more damage, when attacked from the sides or back
While this game is harder than its predecessors, most of the challenge is going to come from early on
 The first half of the game is spent with less than four party-members
 These limitations alongside a lack of primo grinding points make for a decently balanced level of difficulty
 Once you recruit everyone, the battles devolve into the typical attack/special move/sometimes heal doldrums that plague most RPGs
 Still, it's nice while it lasts, and players can opt out of carrying over their experience levels and equipment in new game+
 In ConclusionWith Megadimension Neptunia V2, Compile Heart has proven that they aren't averse to taking risks with an established series
 Taking these risks not only requires a lot of confidence in the game-designers, but also the writers
 Yes, there are still times where Neptune acts the fool, or Vert jokes about Blanc's lack of "plot" development
 These moments are what keep the adventure grounded
 More importantly, the writing goes above and beyond to give everyone a purpose beyond the cheap laughs, and this leads to a more compelling story
 While I've enjoyed all of the previous Neptunia games, V2 is a necessary evolution
 The improvements to both the combat systems and exploration help round out this superb RPG

Dear Compile hearts,I beg you
please have mercy on my wallet, slow down making these games and ffs dont release the best ones right after the steam summer sale
Thank you,Person soon to be living under a bridge
Posted: 29 June
43 hours for a single playthrough
60 hours for two playthroughs
108
3 hours for all achievements
And I would play through this game again and again
The story and characters are the main selling points while the combat becomes secondary (still really good though)
 Oh yeah, the soundtrack is amazing aswell
I could go on but i'm too lazy

I think Megadimension Neptunia V-II marks something of a watershed moment for the Neptunia series in that it's no longer "good, but
[insert caveat of your choice here]", it's just plain good
 Actually, great, even
Finishing my first playthrough of the game took me roughly 55 hours; that was taking it fairly leisurely, unlocking this and that that wasn't absolutely necessary for the first playthrough and goofing around now and then
 After that, there's still the "true" ending, which leads to a post-game segments during which you can clean up any bits and pieces you didn't finish off first time around - Or trophy hunt
 Well, at first, I want to say that I think this is Compile Heart's finest work to date
 While there are some technical issues regarding frame drops in a few places, most of them are not really all that significant
 Ignoring some typos, the script and translation are both excellent, the gameplay is enjoyable, smooth and well-balanced
 The first and last points there adress two of the biggest criticism the Neptunia series has had ever since its release - technical issues regarding atrocious framerates that weren't really justifiable for the kind of game they were, and balancing issues regarding inconsistent or just way too easy difficulty
 MegaNep counters both of these problems: It runs at pretty consistent 60fps pretty much all of the time, only dropping in particularly busy scenes, and has a very well-paced progression with no point in the game that felt too easy or too difficult
 The revamped game systems work extremly well: Skills feel neither under- nor overpowered, characters feel unique and pretty much any party combination can work perfectly fine
Now, narrative and characterisation has never been an issue for the Neptunia series, but, pleasingly, MegaNep even improves this, making up a story that is spectaclar, dramatic and even emotional at some points in the end
 Additionally, it keeps the humorful atmosphere, with Neptune being the goofy, likeable, forth-wall-breaking protagonist that we all know and love
 In other words, it's not just a great Neptunia game - It's a great RPG, period
 The only thing that saddens me is the fact that so many people will write it off without even giving it a shot for themselves; still, I guess that makes it all the more special for those of us in the know who can enjoy and appreciate it, both on its own merits and as, to date, the absolute pinnacle of the series

If you never played a Neptunia game you can start with this
 All you need to know is explained as you go, no need to play the other games to understand
 The classic JRPG is all there with some much needed improvements and fresh addtions to the series
Lets not forget ALL THE NEP NEP MEMES you can handle
If you dont like JRPGs I dont know why your here

BEST NEPTUNIA GAME EVER
I have owned the previous games, Nep1, 2 and 3
And I must say this version is x10 better because: (NO SPOILERS)1- Alot of new features2- Actually has a story, and not just about puddings
 3- Lots of new maps, and maps got bigger
4- Less recycling
5- New characters with fun personalities
6- Better artwork7- x10 Better music
 8- More BOOBIES
 Bigger and bouncier than before, too
Buy it in a heartbeat
 Amazing
Recommend
 10/10TIP: Buy all the DLCs except the ones which give armor or weapons, because those will take the fun out of the game
 Maybe buy them when you reach end game
 I love the new characters

Target Audience:
Danganronpa/Story Driven Fans, or surprisingly, Puzzle enthusaists
Summary:
Let me get this out of the way: if you haven't played Danganronpa 1 and 2 at this point: well you should probably do that before you play Ultra Despair Girls
 It's not that you can't get anything out of this game if you play it alone: but it's SO much better after playing the first two games
 And those two games are fantastic
While Ultra Despair Girls tries to spice things up with a new gameplay style, it's the iconic and fascinating story is the reason that you should pick up the game
 The spin off takes the story in a new direction but not only keeps a lot of the themes from the original, but adds a more character relationship driven angle with Toko and Komaru which really REALLY works
 The angle with the kids takes the series to new creepy depths, and if you were concerned that the game who pull punches with the new characters involved: you'd be dead wrong
 It can be down right disturbing at times in the right way, causing you to shudder in your seat
The gameplay however doesn't do as well
 The basic shooting doesn't play to its own strengths, as the generic gameplay and lack of AI complexity keeps it from being interesting
 It's got a bunch of tools, but it doesn't use them well in the main gameplay
 Frankly, its the worst part of the game
 When it switches to a more puzzle like format: that's where it starts to get a lot better: as thinking about how you use each bullet to kill all the Monokuma's at once
 It's all a case of wasted potential, as the tools here could have been used to really work in a Survival Horror type setting
The presentation is pretty good (for a vita port), and the port itself is great performance wise,
although has some options missing that I would want
 The voice work is good, and the music work is great despite being all over the place genre wise
 Overall, Danganronpa series fans have to pick up this game because well, the story is worth it
 And if you aren't a fan of the series as of yet, even though it's not the best way to get into it, it can do the job for someone who ABSOLUTELY NEEDS action gameplay
 Video Review:
https://www
youtube
com/watch
v=muDSpdQX0tE Lists: Positives: The Story keeps the themes of the original series, but takes them in a new interesting direction with more traditional dystopian/survival elements
 They kept the lore in tact without going completely off the rails
 This feels like a Danganronpa story
 The Star of the show is the relationship and complexity that develops between Toko and Komaru
 They play off each other well, and the growth of both characters is fascinating to watch
 The world is built on in a lot of good ways, and does a good job of bridging several of the holes in the plot up to this point
Pushes your uncomfortable meter in good ways
 Can legimately get under your skin and make you wonder if the villians/heroes are justified
 Kudos to the writing
The kids characters
 All of them are rather well done
Very clever references to the original game, and makes fans who pay attention really appreciate the tight narrative here
The tools for the gameplay have interesting concepts, and if they were assembled better, it would make for some good gameplay
 (More on this later)
Character design and artwork is still superb, doing well in giving little details about the characters while still having a style to it
60 FPS will drops every so often, but not more then 4/5 frames
 Does support up to 4K in Fullscreen (although really, you're not going to notice it that much) All controllers are supported that I tried
 Including a default configuration for the Steam controller
Negatives: The standard shooting is rather repetitive and doesn't do well in constructing interesting scenarios to keep the player entertained
The enemy AI is pretty gosh darn horrible
 Will constantly run into walls, and is able to be easily exploited
 This added to your speed makes even the hardest difficulty
a reasonable cake walk
The 3D models don't do well in complementing the emotional elements of the story
 The Animation/3D cutscenes conflict with each other
Note, my main machine could not play via the keyboard/mouse controls due to 
something causing the game to auto rotate the camera and not allow me to use the virtual directions
 The thing is, this problem was not seen on a second machine, and seems to be some directx/other issue
 Keep it in mind as you may have to refund the game if you run into this problem
Some of the deaths this time around don't have that much of an impact due to the format chosen here
The strength of Toko almost undoes Komaru's character at times
 Side characters sorta get overlooked from the good side
 Don't like the split of options here with the launcher and the in game options
 Missing bindable keys, which for a third person shooter, is sorta a big feature to miss
Posted: 27 June
I finished the game at 100%
 See last section for the final conclusions:Very early review of the game
First of all: DONT PLAY THIS GAME BEFORE DANGANRONPA 1 OR SUPER DANGANRONPA 2, because it will sure spoil the story
About the port:For now I have only played the prologue, but the game looks very good and has not any performance issues
 You can clearly see how everything in game has been remastered for higher resolutions; the only thing that is a bit lacking are the 3D cutscenes which still seem a bit bad, although in my opinion that is not an issue because they are good enough
I have not tested the keyboard+mouse control, but given that the game is a third-person shooter, it sure will feel better, I migh even change later, although you can use the a controller without any problems
 UPDATE: I have been playing with Keyboard+Mouse and I prefer it over controller
 The only downside is that there are not customizable keybindings, althought the default ones are pretty good
About graphical options, in my opinion the game has enough
 You can customize in the launcher of the game if you want to display it borderless window or fullscreen along with other graphical options like antialiasing
 Something I noticed is the lack of V-sync option on Fullscreen mode, but I didnt see any tearing so its okay
About the game itself:This game does not follow the same pattern as the two ones before (simply because the author wanted to make something different lol) and instead of a trial-murder-puzzle game, is a fps with some hack-and-slash
 Even so, the game keeps the Danganronpa feeling and I think its worth a play if you are fan of the series
 Storywise is not very important, but give details about what happened between the first and second game and introduces some characters that are then shown in the Danganronpa 3 animation, which ends the Hope's Peak Academy Arc, so if you like the universe absolutely play this
Final conclusions:The game is fine
 Recommended if you like the Danganronpa Universe and dont expect nothing like DR1 and SDR2
 The port is fine overall, I havent find any bugs nor performance issues
 The only con I can say is that its a little easy with keyboard+mouse simply because aiming to the weak point of the enemies is very simple
Posted: 30 June
A word of warning going into this game, whether you're a Danganronpa fan or not: a lot of the subject matter in this game is WAY darker compared to the first two Danganronpa games, and is pretty dark to average person
 You may be saying "Wait, it gets darker than just straight up cold-blooded murder like in the other games
" Yes it does
 It's not a deterrant of the game, just a word of warning so that those who play it know what they're getting into
That being said, it's a really solid game
 Great storytelling, great characters, a nice blend of serious, bone-chilling semi-horror and almost 4th-wall breaking silliness
 It's absurdIt's (somewhat) scary (in a cartoonish kind of way)It's fanservice-y at timesIt's Danganronpa
Hope to see you aboard Kazutaka Kodaka's Wild Ride
Posted: 27 June
An incredibly solid third-person shooter / puzzle game filled to the brim with all the things I love about Danganronpa and more
 I highly recommend the keyboard + mouse controls, because the mouselook camera is fantastic and makes the game incredibly satisfying
 Also, Genocide Jack has no qualms showing off her panties mid-fight, so that's a plus
Posted: 1 July
If you haven't played Danganronpa 1 and 2 yet, do not play this game
 Saying that, if you're a fan of the Danganronpa story or puzzles, you'll enjoy Danganronpa Another Episode
Posted: 27 June
After all this time for a PC port was it worth the wait
Yes
This is definitly worth it to anyone having enjoyed danganronpa before and while the shooting isn't spectaculair danganronpa plays to its strengths with its writing and atmosphere while forming a connection between the first 2 games
I do advise that while having played the previous games isn't required, it will add so much more to your experience if you did and they are definitly worth checking out
Posted: 29 July
Score: 6
5/10Time to 100%: 20 hoursOne just for the fans
PROS:Story - Amongst the Danganronpa series this game has easily the darkest of the storylines, for reasons such as torture, betrayal, murder, sexual abuse and all for the most part involving children no less
 It is a pleasure (or displeasure
) to play thorugh if only to see how things turn out for the characters involved and its the primary reason to play through this game
 Characters- The characters in the game - specifically the bad guys - are fascinating individuals in their own right
 They're full of different neurosis and demented backgrounds
 Their history is unravlled through their breakdowns and from books scattered throughout the game shedding some light on why they are just so f'ed up
 There's also the appearance of a very special someone
CONS: Gameplay- It's pretty basic third-person shooter fare with substandard level designs with poor looking graphics
 Although in all fairness, this is a port of a PS Vita game so just bare that in mind
 It's also extremely easy as most enemies in the game will die in one shot if you hit them in the right place, even on the hardest difficulty
 Other Characters - So in the pros I had mentioned that the BAD guys are the interesting characters
 That's because for the most part the good guys, namely the two main characters are not interesting AT ALL
 Let's start with Toko
 I never liked her in the first game and I still don't like her now
 She's whiny, neurotic, annoying and insulting pretty much all the time and while they try to give her some kind of character development it falls far too short as she's still just as irritating as she's always been
 Then there's the main character who is so bland and boring that they constantly make jokes about this fact again and again
 We get it, you're normal and boring, okay great
 So in conclusion, play this for the great story and certain characters if you're a fan of the series
 As it is worthy of a playthrough and fills in some of the gaps between the first and the second game
 And need a fix before Danganronpa 3 comes out

Make sure you've played the rest of the Danganronpa series before playing this
 Otherwise, you'll get unwanted spoilers (and it also might not make as much sense)
 Technically this game takes place between Danganronpa 1 & 2, but it all feels more fluid if you save this one for last imo
 Keep in mind that this game is very different than the other two
 It's more of a puzzle/FPS so it's more interactive in terms of gameplay
 There are no trials, and the flow of the story is more fast paced
 It's still a solid game with solid mechanics and helps round out the story from the other games
Posted: 28 June
As with many spinn-offs this game is made first and foremost for fans of original serie, it heavy relys on player to be familiar with at least first game
 So to put it out of the way1) People unfamiliar with Danganronpa games, don't buy it
 Or buy a bundle with all 3 games
2) People who played Danganronpa games: if you like those games and want to know more about lore, charecters and whatnots, buy it
3) Hardcore fan
 Absolutely must have for you
Plot:Player takes controll of Komaru Naegi (sister of Makoto) and fanfavorite Toko (aka Genosider Se)
 Another Episode takes place between 1 and 2 games, and follows events prior to second one
 Without too much spoilers; the story itself is the strongest side of this game -- shouldn't come as a surprise
 Nice twists, great addition to first game, likeble charecters, humor and drama
 Danganronpa
Gameplay:For the majority of the game you will play as Komaru armed with hacking gun (looks like megaphone) and in her case game pretty much is a mediocre TPS: sure game tries to keep you entertained, tosses new enemies now and then and hacking gun have a variety of diffrent ammo -- 8 types to be precise,
each more effective against certan enemies (for example knockback will swat shields from hands of monokumas with said shields, dance will make monokumas dance -- but use it against siren one and every enemy in vicinity will gather around him etc)
 The second charecter is Toko Fukawa, you can switch to her and play as Genosider Se for a short periods (she doesn't have health instead it's battery
 Think of her as your super mode), slice and dice Monokumas with signature sccisors, use extremely fun blood lust moves, take it back and relax for a while
 Still gameplay is very weak, enemies are slow, fragile and come in small groups (on max difficulty I expereinced exactly zero challenge from them)
 So yeah a mediocre TPS with boring slasher tossed inbetween
Oh right there are also chalenges and puzzles
Again not a bad way to keep player entetained, does bring variety, and developers tried their best to make those puzzles and chalenges diffrent, but to be honest those puzzles and challenges will became a chore somewhere around third Chapter
 They are easy
 One or two may have an intresting concept and fun solution, but majority is kindergarten level
 Still, guss it wouldn't be Danganronpa without a little mind excercise now and then
OST and sound: As always Danganronpa provides a good music and decent sound design
 English dub still sucks -- switch to Japanese as soon as you can (to do that press C on keyboard\Y on controller on difficulty chose screen)
 Overall not much to say
In conclusion
 It is a game for fans of serie, don't buy unless you played previous games, buy if you are a fan or simply a person who is intrested in this universe
 Sure gampelay is not the strongest side of game, but story, charecters and mystery will sure keep you on your toes till the end

 The Damn

Posted: 2 February, 2015
I'm not sure what prompted me to get HNR;B1
 Yes I play Japanese videogames, yes I watch a little Annie May, and hell I even listen to Hatsune Miku
 However, I'll be deep-fried in damnation before I tolerate uguu moeblobs crying over baka oniichan and the lack of senpai-noticing
 That's not what this game is about though
 The art might give you that impression, and there is some fan-service, but I dare say the best qualities about HN are the characters and writing
HN is broken up into 8 chapters
 Typically there's plot, then shopping, more dialogue, random people handing you "plans", dungeons (both forced & optional), and then more plot
 It's a standard setup and if you know what you're doing and/or skipping dialogue this game can be quite short
 I wouldn't recommend it though, because the actual game portions aren't the greatest
 From what I've read, this edition of HN is a massive improvement over the original in terms of exploration and combat
 This must mean the first version was really dire
Getting around is handled via a map-screen, with dungeons representing the only "on-foot" portions
 While the dungeons include various niceties like no random encounters, the lay-outs tend to repeat quite often
 We're talking the exact same lay-out, and the enemies that populate them tend to be the same creatures you already fought, except stronger
 There's no other way to say it, the dungeons in this game are weak
 At least they're short, and they aren't bogged down by elevators, lots of stairs, and mind-numbing puzzles
The combat fares a bit better
 It's turn-based and over-time you develop combos
 There are three types: rush for building EXE meter (super moves), power for straight damage, and break for taking down shields
 There are a variety of other skills like healing, buffs, and so on
 The roster of playable characters eventually blossoms to over a dozen as well
 It sounds like a lot to take in, but for the most part this is not a difficult RPG
 There's very little strategy aside from "use a lot of super moves" and the ever-important "heal when you're low on HP"
 If you're getting slapped to heck and back, it's probably because your level isn't high enough
 Late-game grinding isn't really a hassle either
 A lot of optional super-enemies drop enough exp to level multiple times in a single battle
 I suppose the level of difficulty can vary greatly, depending on how much leveling you do
 Some players might find more entertainment in avoiding optional fights, so that every regular encounter is hard-fought
 Eventually though you're going to become OP, you can't resist it
Most of the grind in this game is in finding all of the materials
 Those plans I mentioned earlier add things to the game
 New equipment, new abilities, more dungeons, and so on
 They require materials stripped from the cold dead flesh of the monsters that you kill
 This is best tackled with a guide
 The in-game "Nepedia" is nice, but it pales in comparison to a guide from good ol' gamefaqs and the always handy CTRL-F
 Materials (along with corpses) can also be turned in for quest rewards (if applicable)
 Quests are interesting in that completing them can raise & lower shares
 The gals of HN are always talking about shares and their importance in the console war
 This never really becomes a factor until 1) the ending and 2) the acquisition of hidden characters
 It's something to keep in mind
 I guess I should mention that aside from the ridiculous "millionaire" achievement, HNR;B1 isn't bad if you're a completionist
 Doing everything (aside from some DLC) in the game took me less than 30 hours
 I have played through the Vita game as well
 That first play-through took about 30-35
 If you don't skip cut-scenes, the length is more than reasonable
Notice the lack of character discussion in this review
 Yeah, I'm not going to spoil the best aspect of the game
 The cast of Neptunia is great, and the voice-acting (both ENG & JPN) is very well-done
 I mean okay yeah, it's cute girls, some of whom transform into something exceptionally form-fitting, but the dialogue is rarely dull
 Aside from a couple (expected) interactions, the cast doesn't get too hung up on the standard Annie May tropes either
 Call me shallow, but I also got a kick out of all of the videogame references
 The most amusing one to me is Neptunia herself
 The other goddesses are Leanbox, Lastation, and Lowee
 Since the plot of this game involves a console war, you can guess what those names refer to
 So what's the deal with Neptunia
 Back in the mid 90s, Sega was planning a console that combined the Genesis & the 32X
 It was called Neptune
 Honestly, I can't think of a better system that represents Nep-Nep, she is quite a random character
So yeah, I recommend HNR;B1
 As far as J-RPGs go it's not particularly great, but it has so much charm I can overlook its faults
 Also, it's appropriately-paced and the port isn't too bad (although I had to switch to XP compatibility due to constant after-battle crashes)
 Don't write this game off simply because you visited the community hub and saw a few questionable images

tl;dr: An extremely basic and grindy RPG with cute characters, funny dialogue, impressive English dub, and a pretty depth lore
 Give this one a go if you're very patient and have a few days to burn
 Gameplay: The Gameplay is a turn-based system where you and your enemies take turns beating each other up and magical or physical attacks, sometimes both at the same time
 The higher your combo, the more abilities you can use
 There's a shop in every city that's indentical (The shop that is) and sells gear for your Party Members
 There's also plans, which are basically upgrades you can get which will change the game or different characters, but you need materials for said plans
 To get plans you have to visit through dungeons and collect loot, kill enemies, and explore
 There's roughly 7 or so dungeons that are all very different, but they get copy-pasted for roughly 40 or something dungeons
 Same with enemies, so it can get repetitive very quickly
 Some Dungeons such as the Snow-related ones are also too big and don't have enough enemies
 Plus, lots of treasure can go un-noticed due to the painful amounts of white everywhere
 Characters: The characters in Neptunia are so good and likeable that there's even fans who pretend to be them, kinda odd, but kinda charming in it's own unique way
 The Characters themselves are also charming, it's very silly with dialogue
 You don't get to pick who you send out to talk, or the words which they say
 Instead you're pretty much just watching them talk to each other, sometimes with voice to go along, other times just text
 To move on to the next text box, you need to press Enter on your Keyboard
 I found myself pressing Space by accident and ended up skipping tons of important dialogue, the skip is just so fast that it literally skips all of it within just 2 seconds
 Kinda annoying, but it's a habbit that you can break easily
Dungeons: The Dungeons are the classic turn-based RPG game, they look really pretty and large, but only a small portion is where you can play
 Enemies are randomly strewn about in the dungeon, who will sometimes follow you and attempt to take you down, or you can sneak up on them and get the first-turn of combat, which is very useful against those stronger boss-like enemies
 As I noted earlier, the dungeons are very limited and are copy-pasted a ton throughout the game, same with the enemies who are just retextured with different colours
 The enemiy choice for some of the Dungeons make no sense
 Like, a flower in a dystopia Tron-setting

As someone who played this game to platinum three times on the Vita (thanks, stacking region trophy lists
), I find it to be the best Neptunia released in the West yet
 The gameplay is simple to grasp and fun to play and the script is the best yet with quite a few funny moments, which is a huge step up from the very first game's cringe-worthy reference overdosing every few seconds
 The English dub is also very good
Just one note: the cutscene portraits weren't scaled up, which is quite noticeable during cutscenes, particularly against the much crisper backgrounds
 It's not a dealbreaker, but it may bother some people

Hyperdimension Neptune
 -The best game with anime characters in steamif you are a fan of J-RPG with battles in turn and anime girls
 That game is highly recommended for you
- Simple gameplay and addictive;- Very good battle sytem;- Powerful anime appeal;- Vibrant soundtrack;- Many references the world of consoles and animes
Don't waste your time
 Buy this game now
 
Posted: 13 March, 2015
Let's start with a note: Neptunia saga is not for all, that's a fact
As far as you can try if you don't like these "breaking the fourth wall", other games references and the fact the characters (at least the main ones) are girls you are not going to enjoy it
Now let's talk about the game:HDNRB1 is not just a remake of HDN, infact much is changed between story and mechanics
The game is a quite hard JRPG, at least at the begin, sadly later you will probably going to spam these EXE (super like moves) destroying everything in your path but still the game gives out quite a challenge
There's not actuall grinding like other JRPGs but still you can't go around ignoring enemies or you'll be in trouble against these End chapter bosses
Graphically the game is not that bad but not everyone like the "anime style"
Musics are good even if not that many
Dungeons are
 well there's many dungeons but not many types, you will find yourself unlocking many dungeons sure but in the same times many of them are just the same one with some differences and nothing more, same for the enemies, so be aware, if you want to see differences at every corner you are not going to like it
As port is not perfect but still this is the very first port made by IFI and, in my opinion, they made a good job in the end
Should you buy it then
 Yes, you should
Still, like i've said at the begin, this game is not for everyone but who knows, you may find yourself having more fun than you think

Lighthearted & self-aware // Recommended for JRPG gamers*A controller/gamepad is highly recommended for this title+ Dialogue is rife with self-aware humor and myriad cheeky references+ Gameplay is solid and straightforward+ Can create battle advantages by sneaking up on and hitting enemies first; pre-emptive strikes can pay dividends+ 'Order of Action' bar helps to plan turns in advance; injects a bit of strategy into the gameplay+ Multiple endings offer a fair amount of replay incentive+ Voice-acting, both English and Japanese, is competent and well-implemented (there are some issues with mouth syncronization, however)+ Detailed character models and applaudable attack animations+ Excellent soundtrack; fits the game like a glove and is often quite catchy+ Character customization is a refined facet of the game, and this offers many opportunities in regards to character performances in battle+ Offers a plethora of items and gear that does wonders to allow the player freedom of choice in combat- Visuals are underwhelming to say the least; textures, in particular, seem overly dated, likely as a result of the game being a port from the PS Vita- Camera is a bit restrictive and often feels clunky, particularly when traversing dungeons- Battles quickly become very reptitive; the player soon falls into a routine, following a formula that takes one down the path of least resistance- Quite a bit of grinding required at certain points in the narrativeLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit

If you angle the camera correctly and jump with some of the characters their skirts will go up and you can see their panties

Certainly one of the better Hyperdimension games this series has great potential it still hasn't quite lived up to
 still as is - a great JRPG Experience
 This first installment feels
 shorter than the game its remaking but that may have less to do with the game and my own experence with Victory knowing exactly what to do
As a remake it takes the entire combat system from the first game and chucks it in a bin, replacing it with the more enjoyable combat system seen in later installements
For those not familiar the combat system usually involves a party of three(Four in later games) being placed inside a circular area - characters are able to move freely and you're encouraged to keep them spaced apart as enemies can and will hit multiple targets cluster together - and you're free to do the same
 A usual array of special attacks, skills and ultimates are there to fill the standard kit - however your normal attacks are broken up into "Combos" which can be fiddled with and swapped around to your liking
Neptunia also keeps its notable game references and forth wall breaking humor
 I personally enjoy the campness of the story and chracters, its what kept me with the franchise so far
 Its lighthearded tone and utter refusal to take itself - or indeed anything else seriously is closer to a breath of freash air than most of the dower affairs I've seen on the release list lately
Take it as a bit of unchallening junk food - like the JRPG equivelent of Dynasty Warriors
-Port Report-The ports is
 okay
 I supposeIts a Vita Port so its not the least bit demanding - The astetic carries it fineResolution Caps at 1600x900
 Er
 okay - its not 1920x1080 but I'll take it
Locked at 60FPS - (some cutscenes are at 30
)It is a turn based game so maybe that doesn't matter so much
Rebindable Keys and Gamepad Support
 YES
Doesn't use the buttons its dispaying - you should play around with the settings - but it plays fine with a gamepad
Mouse Control in the Menus
 YES
I'd say B+ on the port
 Cerainly seen worse handheld ports

This game is a must-buy for any RPG fan
While its style is distinctly western, in everything but art Epic Battle Fantasy is very much a JRPG
 The combat is heavily based on elemental advantage/weaknesses  brute force is rarely an option in harder battles, instead the key to victory is using correct skills and gear
Speaking of gear, uniquely among RPGs, newer weapons and armor you acquire are not direct improvement of your old equipment
 Instead, each weapon and armor has properties that make it good in some situations and mediocre to bad in others
 The result is that no equipment becomes useless, and some of early gear may very much be an option for endgame battles
Instead of acquiring stronger gear, the game features upgrade system for your equipment, allowing you to improve your gear as you progress through the game (most later upgrades require items that are not available until later)
 And on final note about gear, each item your character wears, from weapons and armor to small badges visibly changes your appearance, which is really a nice touch
The story doesnt even pretend to be serious, but it will accomplish what it sets out to: make you laugh from start to finish
Overall, Epic Battle Fantasy is all kinds of awesome
 If you like turn-based RPGs, give it a try and it wont disappoint

Like RPGs
Like Some honest to god decent humour
Wanna be a good guy and help out a guy who has made a ton of free games buy giving him some money
Want a cool soundtrack for free
Do you have a thing for anime boobs
 *slapped* ok okThis game is worth every penny and don't let the people saying "oh no you don't have to pay its free on kongregate" fool you
The steam and prem Kongregate version has additional content to the base game and provides much more content then you'd expect
Also the steam version gives the soundtrack for free so a plus there
Give it a whirl on Kongregate if you are really cautious about the games you buy and make your choice there
I still say you should buy it to support the dev who really puts more work into his games then a lot of other devs that make free games (also give his other games a try while you're at it)

You've seen the video, and you're going "This is a Flash game
This belongs on Newgrounds
Wait, this IS on Newgrounds
Why would I pay for this
Why would anyone even greenlight this
"
I'll tell you why: because this is the RPG your oldschool heart's been waiting for
You've got your turn-based RPG elements, your enemies rating from the silly to the spooky to the right-out terrifying, your countless tongue-in-cheek Final Fantasy/Pokemon/Zelda/Mana/etc
 homages
But then there's the feeling of being a part of this world: rather than "exploring" a "vast" world of triumphs and tribulations, you just sort of twiddle around and run into packs of monsters just sitting there on the worldmap
There's the never-ending bickering and bantering among your teammates as you progress
There's the range of hints both silly and satisfying that play out as you spar with your foes and try new techniques
The challenge is there too--boy, is it ever
For a game optimized to be played 30 minutes at a go, you can spend a lot of effort fine-tuning your characters' skills and loadouts for tough fights (and it will *really* pay off if you are playing Epic and going for the achievements)
You'll be able to come back to it over time, too--have the satisfaction of clearing the game, take some time off from it, and come back to it anew in New Game+ (or ++) playing however you feel, without having to collect all those non-key items again but with all the damage numbers exponentially increased for more cheesy epicness
And of course, the content you won't find on Newgrounds here--the Battle Mountain--escalates the challenge further (though you could still get through it pretty easily in Easy mode if you went that route)
It's a chance to step off the beaten plot-ridden path and just smash up tons of monsters--plus all-new bosses both uncompromising and unsettling
If you are a child of the 90s or late 80s and don't have time to play RPGs anymore but still admire them from afar, this is your chance to see firsthand what happens when nostalgic thrills meet the present day
This East-meets-West cultural take just might give you one more fantasy to embrace after all

You enter a battle with five generic looking monsters
 Suddenly from behind you, a tank fires an armada of bullets at the enemies for no reason, accompanied by a cat with no legs that charges towards them with a wooden sword and shield
 Your swordsman jumps in with his sword and then suddenly summons a sword out of thin air due to his sheer love for swords
 You click on your mage's chest only to find out that her boobs give you an achievement
 Your ranger looses her arrow towards the final enemy, but it doesn't do enough damage, that is until a giant wooly mammoth falls from the sky and crushes it
This is just a typical battle in Epic Battle Fantasy 4
Posted: 29 October, 2014
This game is a funny joking, breaking the forth wall, RPG
 It's all good fun in the world of EBF4, with jokes coming left and right, and all being masterfully crafted so that none fall flat you won't stop laughing
 Enough about how funny the game is, let's talk about gameplay, the game focuses on the goal of collection and completion rather than harsh and numerous battles, the creator has also made it so that character's not battling will also gain experience so that you won't have to grind for any other character at a later time
 The collection will included things such as: chest locations, random drops for armor and weapon upgrades, those weapons and armor
themselves, certain creatures to fill that damn bestiary, ect
 All battles are fair and equal as long as you do a little side searching here and there to gain a little extra exp
 Jokes, fair battles, and no grinding sounds like a good game to me

Thank goodness I got this game, Matt has always impressed me with his epic battle fantasy series, and when I heard that the fourth installment was going to be on steam I just couldn't keep quiet about it, I was extremely excited for this coming out on steam
 It is definitely worth the £8
99 I spent on it
 In fact I think it's worth much more than that
 Turn based RPGs has always been my thing
 The game also tickles me ribs with it's humour, crying with laughter at some points
 I really enjoy some of the references to animes that you make
 I like the roaming around, puzzles and the mini-games too
 Honestly Matt, I love this goddamn game so much
 Would absolutely recommend to people who love a good, lighthearted turn based RPG
Posted: 9 December, 2015
I've been playing the EBF series since I was a kid, and this one by far is the best+ Awesome bosses+ Interesting story+ Hilarious dialogue+ Great music (you get the game soundtrack free too :D )+ References everywhere+ Great combat system (Good 'ol turn based combat)+ Tons of equipment, both clothes and weapons+ Easy to navigate UI+/- Block Puzzles+/- Grinding and Backtrack- May be a little confusing for new players, but you can get used to it (especially the inventory)Definitely one of my favourite games of all time
 ( and its cheap for the hours of gameplay and fun you can get with it)

Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is an adventure RPG game, developed by Matt Roszak, releasing on Steam is February 2014
 This is my first foray into the Epic Battle Fantasy series and have no other previous experience with other games in the franchise
 Gameplay is a simplistic RPG style view, with turn based combat for the fights
 Controls are so simple; you literally can play the whole game with just your mouse
 The game has a real Pokémon feel to it, as you explore you will find parts of the map you cant explore yet because you dont have the required skill, for instance, to cut a tree down or to smash a rock
 Once you learn said skills, you can backtrack quite easily to explore and find treasure hidden in the previously locked area
The game has well over a hundred different enemies to kill, and learn their strengths and weaknesses of
My favourite part of the game play is easily the loot and item system
The game boasts over 170 different items for your characters to use; you can upgrade these items through using the Forging mechanic which require you to use craft-able items to make the upgrade
The combat system is really well designed too; you have a party of four characters eventually, but you can only use three in a battle, the fourth acts as a backup in case one of your others dies
 The Pokémon element theme is a key mechanic too; making sure you use the correct weapon with the right effect on the enemy is an almost absolute must most of the time
Characters can also learn companions which acts as like ultimate attacks, and any of your characters can use them rather than having them bound to one of your party  the best and most fun by a country mile has to be the Super Nova, which just obliterates the entire screen
 Visually, EBF4 is again, simple, but that comes across very pleasantly
 The in game art style looks colourful and vibrant, and has a very 3DS look to it
 The narration parts of the game are done in a beautifully, almost hand drawn style of art, as if they have just been pulled out of a childrens book
 I was enchanted by the visuals straight away as soon as I saw this
 There is little animation in the game, given the 2D aspect, but the small amount of animation in the game is done really well, no odd movement cycles or strange looking attacks
 There isnt any voice acting; however there arent walls and walls of text to read through, so that can be forgiven
 EBF4s difficulty levels can be changed on the fly, and you are almost encouraged to play on the highest difficulty until you start hitting a brick wall
 I played the game on a normal difficulty and still felt sufficiently challenged by the fights
 You can ramp up the difficulty to epic mode for those wanting to get extra achievements though
 Once you complete the game you have the option for New Game+
 Not to mention the Fire Mountain area of the game
 This area scales with your characters level, allowing you to take on unique beasty bosses for extra special loot
 This for me again, reminded me of the Pokémon games and the Elite Four trainers
 The world, in which you play in, is full of extra little bits to do, with roughly 20 side quests to complete, which offer no real variety but still add a bit more game play
 The quests are only collection quests, so dont expect to be getting really in depth quest lines like other RPGs
 The quests will reward you with stat increasing items, or more equipment to make use of
 There are also a number of NPCs scattered around the world that whilst they offer no game play advantage, they do have a bit of lore behind them though
 EBF4 took me just under 20 hours to complete
 I went into this game expecting it to be over in five hours
 I am absolutely amazed at how much content and how long this game actually is
 What really does this game the most credit is, I wasnt bored once whilst playing, and I wasnt waiting for the end of the game to roll around as I was having that much fun playing
 There may not be a massive amount of replay ability given the linearity of the storyline, but the New Game+ mode will definitely cater for any people that are fans of the game play
Technically, the game runs in a much smaller resolution, whilst you can play full screen, it is a scaled up version
 For some reason, I almost had a lot of stuttering during some moments in the game
 This was fixed by reloading the game, but I couldnt quite work out what was causing it
 Obviously the game isnt very taxing to run, given the 2D graphics, but still, I was dropping frames every now and again
The game cannot be played using a controller without the use of third party software, but I would recommend people play this game with their mouse
 To sum up, I am absolutely amazed at the quality of this game
 It is easily one of my favourite RPG experiences I have ever had
 I remarked quite a bit in this review about the resemblances between EBF4 and Pokémon, and that comparison really does this game justice
 It is an absolute masterpiece of a game that looks so simple on the outside, but is beautifully and carefully developed on the inside
 The game is so perfectly priced at £8, 99 too, with hours of content and high quality content at that

If you saw the cutscenes, this game may have seemed like crap
 If you saw the trailers or screenshots, this game may have seemed like crap
 But if you play the content of the game, then it shines through as what it really is; a gem

"But this game looks like a Sonic ripo
 " <FALCON PUNCH>YOU KNOW NOTHING
 Play the demo, check the gameplay, read the reviews
 This game is a Saturn-era platformer that NAILED IT
 We are talking here about levels of quality used to describe games like: Shovel Knight, Megaman X4 or Sonic 3 & Knuckles
 While game certainly is a nostalgia trip, it firmly stands on it's own in this day and age
 Whole experience is delivered in awesome package with suprisingly varied gameplay mechanics, great level design, smooth controls, soft esthetic and top-level, adrenaline pumping boss encounters (better quality than all Sonic's bosses and on the level of the best from Megaman)
 On top of that, three distinctive characters to play means high replayability that easly justifies the initial price tag
 Game may look like Sonic initially but in reality it plays like a improvement and modernization of Blue Blur's formula with many influences from other awesome platforming classics
 It evolved from this ground-up and at the end Freedom Planet does it's own thing
It looks well, sounds well (amazing soundtrack) and even the voice-acting, that is clearly more of indies level of quality, is most times solid
 Not amazing mind you, but not bad either
 Storyline is nothing super special, but characters are likeable enough to let some plot problems and incosistencies slide
 Cutscenes can be really lenghty sometimes
 I liked them, but those who highly prefer gameplay over story can disable them by choosing Classic Mode
Some people also complained about difficulty curve
 Bosses are in fact a bit challenging on Normal difficulty, but for me, fair checkpoint system and painless continues are more than enough to balance this out
 If you are not reckless and do recognize some boss patterns, you should be fine
 There are also plenty difficulty settings to choose from - you can pick Easy or Casual, if you want a sweat-less experiece
This isn't a flawleess ride, but the overall quality of the game is unbelievably high for the first major project from this developer and only $25,000 gained from kickstarter
 Again, check the demo
 It gives a correct glimpse how the game really looks like and it should definietly tell you if you will enjoy the game
 All in all, I highly recommend this game
 It is much more than it looks at first glance

The CD-player in my car is busted, the disc won't eject
 So, imagine having to listen to Jamiroquai's "Traveling Without Moving" constantly
 It's a good album though, came out in 1996, had classics like "Seven Days in Sunny June", "Canned Heat" and "Supersonic"
 Speaking of Super Sonic, the lack of a certain hedgehog on the Sega Saturn was very strange
 There were a couple spin-offs and Sonic X-treme (which was never released), but no Sonic 4
 In fact, Sega still hasn't released a Sonic 4, I can't understand it
During the 16 and 32-bit days, the mascot-platformer was the most over-stuffed genre on store shelves
 These games were mostly garbage like Bubsy & Awesome Possum
 Anytime there was an actual hit (like Earthworm Jim), publishers would run it into the ground through a combination of uninspired sequels and marketing
 Still, there were a lot of good games released during this time: Rocket Knight Adventures, Socket, Pulseman, High Seas Havoc, Adventures of Little Ralph, Keio Flying Squadron 2, Tryrush Deppy, Ristar, DoReMi Fantasy, Super Tempo Popful Mail, Astal, Clockwork Knight, etc
It was a rough transitional period for the platformer
 Due to the popularity of Mario 64, most developers went 3D (or at least 2
5D) with varying levels of success
 The 2D platformers released around the time were by small teams, and unless you read Diehard GameFan, you didn't know of their existence
 Freedom Planet could have been one of those games
 If it had released in 1996, it would have toiled in obscurity for nearly a decade, until it was purchased by somebody in a random ebay auction
 This guy played through the game, thought "Wow this is really good
", and told everyone in his gaming forum about it
 I'd wager that by 2008, Freedom Planet achieved some mid/high-level of notoriety, and commanded about $80 per disc through online auctions
Freedom Planet follows the adventures of Lilac, Carol, and Millia
 Three heroines, three kingdoms, one war, an alien menace, and that's the short version
 There are a lot of cut-scenes in this game, and the story takes some unexpectedly dark turns
 Saying anything else is liable to turn this review into spoiler-central, but I'll say this much: there's at least one scene in this game that I'd be perfectly content with never seeing again
 But enough about that mess, let's talk about the actual game
 There are three playable characters, and they have a variety of unique skills
 This is a fast-moving platformer, not unlike the Sonic games, so expect loops, ramps, and so on
 The stages are all fairly large, with numerous optional paths, secrets, traps
 and enemy robots
 This is also a combat-oriented platformer, and the later stages throw a lot of baddies at the player
 Freedom Planet certainly isn't lacking in boss-fights either, you can expect two or more in every stage
How you deal with adversity depends on the character
 Lilac soars with her various aerial maneuvers (including a flying dash-attack & a shoryuken), Carol has her claws, Chun-Li kicks, and a motorcycle, while Millia creates blocks and shields to frustrate anything capable of firing bullets
 These skills are also necessary for getting around the stages, whether it's flying over massive cliffs, driving up walls, or even subtle tricks such as using a phantom block shield blast to propel Millia a few feet
 The controls are exceptionally fluid, and the mechanics are very solid
 While the levels are fun to explore, they're even more entertaining, when using every ability to its fullest extent to speed through them
 Also, unlike some platformers that emphasize speed, there's no worry over taking damage from simple enemy contact
 As I mentioned earlier, Freedom Planet has a lot of boss-fights, and they can be pretty tough
 Most of the challenge is in reading their patterns
 They move quickly, and while you might see this as a sign to move fast yourself, it's all a smokescreen
 What's liable to happen is that you'll bump into their attacks and get yourself killed
 Instead, you want to stop, wait, and see what happens
 They'll jump from one of the screen to the next, present some opening, and that's when you attack
 Each character has a move that gives them some invincibility, such as Lilac's flying, Carol's kicks, or Millia's shield
 Using those moves, even in last-ditch situations, could save your life
 All that said, even the easy setting will lead to some boss-related deaths
 The most devastating attacks tend to juggle you, which eats through a ton of life
 Also, Millia has half the health of the other heroines, but she tends to kill bosses faster so it balances out
Where this game really excels is in level-design variety
 All too often, variety is a double-edged sword
 Yeah it's fun to see something new and different, but when you're flying from one set-piece to the next, you never really get a feel for how the game actually plays
 You buy a game, expecting a third-person shooter, but every other level involves turrets, vehicles, flying, swimming, sex QTEs, and so on
 Each stage in Freedom Planet is different from one another, but not so different that you feel like you're playing another game
 It's also important to note that the level-design never completely shifts gears
 One stage might feature more enemies, another probably has some extra puzzles, but it never feels like "this is a puzzle stage" or "this is the stage where you fight all the time"
 Everything comes together naturally, and you're always in complete control
 Although, yes there is a 2D shooter stage
 Of course there would be a 2D shooter stage
 I've been a platformer-fan for decades and this happens every time
EVERY SINGLE TIME
 Apparently, there's always someone out there that thinks "Our game is too good, we should throw in a really weak section to give reviewers something to complain about"
 Towards the end of Freedom Planet, there is a 2D shooter stage
 It's not particularly bad, but it's just
there
 All told, I guess I can deal with a few minutes out of a 2+ hour game being merely passable
Freedom Planet is a relic, and I mean that in the most affectionate way
 It's a mid-90s platformer that has all the elements of a forgotten classic, but it was released in 2014
 It's unfortunate that more games aren't released that emulate this style
 It seems that for most indie-developers, their favorite system growing up was the NES
 That's cool and all but eh, I prefer the days of the Genesis/SNES/Saturn/PSX
 I'd rather see more games that prey upon my nostalgia, and if they turned out to be half as good as Freedom Planet, then I'd be in for a treat
Posted: 21 July, 2014
You know whats unfortunate
 Most people will get the wrong idea and will knock this game down
 There's gonna be a ton of people who will just glance at this and will simply presume the game is a sonic knockoff
 Like with the recent indie game Shovel Knight, it takes elements from various classic games and makes it all its own identity
 So does Freedom Planet with its different game play styles
 You have characters that of course are fast like sonic, some fight like Zero from the Mega man games, and another who can bring up blocks via magic and throw them via Mario 2 style
The gameplay yes, level designs take inspiration from sonic titles, along with bosses from games such as Gunstar Heroes, a bit of Ristar, and just this massive blend of genesis/super nintendo games all into one
yes it blends, do breathe this
 Story wise (no worries about spoilers) feels like a good old Saturday morning cartoon show with funny humor, fun characters, and can still be dark in some areas
 Themes ranging from friendships, growing stronger, revenge that shift from various character viewpoints when playing the other characters
There's a lot going on here, its worth the 15$ definitly with its content, and along with more coming along the way with an expansion which will add an adventure mode for Milla since she's only in classic at the moment, along with characters such as Spade and Torque somewhere down the line
 This game though does get hard at the very last few stages, NES hard but checkpoints are plenty and unlimited continues are in this so its not too bad
 Just expect a challenge at the later half of the game
 Hopefully this game does become more popular with people on youtube giving this game more attention such as YOGSCAST and reviewers such as Somecallmejohnny and more, just to name a few
 Spread the word, tell people about it, and treat it like the kind of game you'd keep in your retro game collection
 No scratch that, treat it like the kind of game that stays fresh and fun for years to come, even after the millionith playthrough
 Worth the cash, no doubt about it

A Sonic game that's better than most recent Sonic games and it doesn't even has Sonic in it
Posted: 24 November, 2014
TL;DR - Freedom Planet is easily my indie GOTY, and among my favorite games of all time
 Now, on to a full review:I'd had my eye on this game since its early Greenlight campaign and sadly missed its Kickstarter
 Fast forward many months of watching the game evolve, and Freedom Planet's on Steam
 After everything I'd seen, I set fairly unrealistic expectations for this game
 and was shocked when I found they'd not only been met, but exceeded
In short, Freedom Planet is everything you could ask for out of a fast-paced 2D platformer
 It hits all the right notes with a mix of speed and platforming, coming together in excellent level design, very much akin to Genesis era Sonic titles
 However, it isn't a Sonic clone; it clearly draws a great deal of inspiration, but also has enough differences to feel fresh and unique
Freedom Planet undoubtedly has a love of speed, similar to Sonic, and features great level design, with branching paths and multiple ways to tackle areas due to characters' different abilities (more on that later), but the levels can be fairly lengthy and aren't afraid to slow you down for some more intricate platforming or a bit of combat
 Neither of those points are negatives; the levels never seem to drag, continuing to add in new hazards to overcome and sights to see, and being unable to simply blow through a level without prior practice makes the platforming feel that much more satisfying
 Combat is also quite fun, as it maintains the game's fast pace and mixes in a good amount of variety in both attacks and enemies
 Boss battles are also unique and challenging, each requiring different approaches to beat them, and ultimately being very entertaining in their design
Graphically, this game is beautiful and features very detailed sprite work
 Characters are drawn down to minute details, and backgrounds and level pieces are equally detailed and varied
 Each area is distinctly different from the last and very lovingly drawn
 Not only does the level as a whole paint a lovely image, but the artists even took care to include small details that can truly breathe life into a game
 This attention to detail carries over to the characters, with entire animations dedicated to a single usage in-game
 For instance, in one level there are disco balls, which cause the characters to dance if they're stopped near enough by
The soundtrack is also varied and fun, keeping pace with the game
 Voice-overs are also surprisingly good, especially considering how games can suffer greatly from poor voice acting (to the point it would have been preferable for them to be silent)
 Freedom Planet's voices in no way detract from its characters, and in fact, can be rather fun and fitting, particularly in its many lighthearted moments
Story-wise, it's on par with retro-inspired action games
 You're out to save the world, you'll meet some fun characters, and you'll find little plot surprises here and there
 Gameplay far outshines story here, but it's a good romp regardless, and if story isn't your thing, there's the option to skip it completely and get right to the meat of the game
Replayability is another one of Freedom Planet's strong suits
 As of writing this, there are three playable characters, each with distinct abilities
 Two of the three even have their own story, and I've heard plans to not only increase the character count, but also to give characters unique stories and levels
 Characters aren't just simple sprite swaps either; each character has an entirely different set of moves and abilities, as well as levels unique to them
 Even when passing through the same levels, it feels like a fresh experience
 The characters vary enough to warrant entirely different play styles and ways of going about overcoming the same areas
 This is particularly prevalent for boss fights, which adds an extra layer of excitement replaying them
There are other little extras, such as a set of 'hit the targets' levels, which are much smaller, but focus on avoiding obstacles and making your way to all the corners of the level
 These are rather fun, although you'll be done with them very quickly
 Keep playing, and you'll even unlock a mahjong mini-game to relax with between more intense gameplay
All said, Freedom Planet can offer dozens of hours of entertainment for a very reasonable price
 Between the levels' length and depth, each character offering a brand new perspective on the game, and simply being fun enough to drag you back for one more try at a faster run, Freedom Planet is a great value and a shining example of the incredible things indie gaming is capable of

This is an excellent game that reminds me of so many of the awesome Sonic The Hedgehog games and other great platformers of the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis era
 I got to Stage 3 and decided this game deserves a honest review from me
 First off, the controls are really tight and well balanced to the character's abilities
 At the end of each stage you get a boss fight that is fun but not overwhelmingly hard
 I also get to collect items that give extra lives and so on
 You even have a similar ability like Sonic but it works a little different
 Overall this is the most addicting platformer I have played in a long time and I will be happy to give it my two thumbs up
 Buy this game and play it with a smile, it's that good
 :)

If this game came out back in the Sega era we wouldnt be talking about Sonic and Tails we be talking about Lilac and Carol

I cannot spoil anything for all of you who don't have this game yet
 But this game will be worth EVERY PENNY you spend on it
-Stages designed uniquely with various gimmicks that don't get old as well as some neat attention to detail in certain levels
-A very charming and sometimes intimidating cast of characters
-Top-knotch voice acting
-Gameplay that has evolved VERY much from when it was still only a sonic fangame now making the only similarities the ability to go fast, some loop-de-loops, anthropomorphic characters and launchers/springs
-An utterly eargasm-inducing soundtrack
-A very interesting and captivating story that's very prevelant for a platformer
-Bosses that can REALLY get your blood pumping and provide a very great challenge
-The playable characters are all fun to play as(especially a certain 3rd one
) with their own pros and cons that keep them balanced
Overall
 Even as a beta tester I can't say anymore about this game without spoiling it
 Atleast not now
 You will have to play this game yourself once it comes out to fully understand how great it is
 Please play it as soon as you can
 For the puppies

Game can easily be beaten in about 3-4 hours
I've spent over 40 hours playing this game
Guess I should recommend it
Posted: 27 November, 2014
It's Sonic + Sparkster + Gunstar Heroes with its own goofy saturday morning cartoon plot
 Essentially, this is to Genesis platformers as Shovel Knight was to the NES
 This means that it's good, and you should buy it
 It also has great music
It's also a solid argument that Sega should just give the Sonic license to GalaxyTrail and let them go nuts
 Sure as hell can't be worse than Sonic Boom, right
Fun fact: Freedom Planet was doing snarling robot-armed snake antagonists before Sonic Boom made them uncool

What I played: fault milestone oneWhat I expected: a story in a JRPG-style fantasy setting with reportedly good writingWhat I got: a thought-provoking and at times intensely emotional story, very rich in characterization, set in a very detailedly-developed world, and exploring philosophical issues of culture and technology and much more
Yes, I do indeed recommend this
(Disclosure: I acquired this visual novel by preordering it during (though not directly through) its Kickstarter, at near full price
)

Fault Milestone One is about a communist pacifist equal-sex magical monarchy where our main chracters, anime Alice in wonderlands and anime Corvo Attano live in
 A mallicious Chinese warlord blitzkriegs it with an Ethopian army of child soldiers and african- I mean Shadow Warriors
Using Aurora Borealis
 our heroes teleport themselves themselves away and end up landing in a different continent in the city of Kardia, where capitalism
 misogyny
 and science exist
 (I swear it's not America)Trapped in these new lands, without their magical universal healthcare, they must find a way back home before they die of mana-deprivation

fault -milestone one- is the first episode of the fault series that tells the story of Princess Selphine Rughzenhaide and her Guardian Ritona Reighnvhasta as they run away from an assault that is lead by Melano
 As the duo managed to escape from the Melano's party, they got teleported (shift) to the other side of the world
 Their journey began as they want to return to Ruzenheid and confront the opposing mysterious party that is supposingly lead by Melano
Trying not to spoiling much on this review, -milestone one- is mostly focused on the mysterious character named Rune/Sara and "her" dark pastime
 The story started light-hearted but more and more mystery comes up later on and the duo is determined to solve this problem regarding Rune/Sara despite the limitation that is imposed to their body because they are running out of natural mana to supplement their body
 Do note that the ending of this VN is quite sad (like CLANNAD-ish sad) and twisted (how twisted
 Just play the game :^)There is only one choice in the VN which serves as turning point of the story
 The characters are likeable and the story gets darker and more interesting starting from Chapter 5 as more foreshadowing are created that will pique your interest to finish the story until the end
 Lots of action in the beginning of the chapter but it might get a little bit information crunch towards the end and a big plot twist at the ending
The UI for this game is very fluid and vivid
 I was amazed that this was actually done on Ren'py (props to Sekai Project for porting it I guess) but it's kinda feel too bad that this amazing VN is not voiced
 The art is well done ESPECIALLY the main menu artwork, I kinda wish that they have some 1920x1080 artwork but all of them are 1280x720, it's not a bad thing but it leaves me wants more of this epic art
 The soundtrack that plays along with the scene are reaaaaallly well done, it helps build up the atmosphere for the situation pretty well especially that one time on Rune's madness scene
8
8/10 a must buy Visual Novel, some of my interpretation of the story might be wrong because my Japanese is not perfect (since I play the beta build) but it's enough to make me immerse myself in the story (it actually have some hard kanji too so yeah :^))It would be a 9
3/10 if it was voiced but it's already great in its current state
 Definitely recommended if you like the classic Sci-Fi theme that mixes kingdom with magic and stuff
Note: I was asked to put spoiler tag for the screenshot I upload because I finished the game on the beta while everyone still waiting for the english translation
 Yes, that's how interesting and eager I was on reading this VN ~Also, Melano & Mharo are qt3

fault - milestone one is a short but enjoyable visual novel about culture, science and family
 The game takes place in a fantasy setting where the main power source is mana
 Due to circumstances that you'll find out if you play the game, the two main characters are transported to an unknown part of the world
 The world this game creates is fairly interesting and it goes pretty in-depth on how it all works
The intro and ending of the novel were probably the weakest parts as they seem to be building up for the sequel
 This isn't really a bad thing but it all feels disconnected from the main plot - spoilers, the ending is a cliffhanger which is pretty lame
 I've seen some negative reviews on the store page with short playtime which makes me think they quit at the intro which is a shame since it gets much better
 Outside of the intro I think the characters work really well off of each other and it's nice to see their stories develop
The presentation is pretty good - you can see some of the art on the store page
 The music pieces feel pretty short and repetitive but they are effective in the scenes they are played in
 The camera will sometimes zoom in on characters, which is what the "unique 3D Camera system" is, I think
I've tried to keep this review vague because the game is pretty short - it took me around 4 hours to finish and I think people should experience the story for themselves
 It is a little expensive so if you didn't get this in the humble bundle like I did, I might recommend waiting for a sale as there isn't really any replayability - there's a single choice in the game and it doesn't change anything from what I could tell
 I still really liked it though and I am excited to play the sequel
Small and minor edit: also some of the achievements are dumb but that doesn't really matter

What essentially gave the premise of a run-of-the-mill fantasy VN with cute young girls eventually formed into a depressing story dealing with a foreign culture and corporate business, family matters inside and outside of those corporate businesses and redemption coupled with some of the best presentation a visual novel has ever had the privilege of possessing, a cast of very memorable and human characters, atmospheric yet subtle music and well-detailed lore
Totally defied all of my expectations
Posted: 17 December, 2014
At first I was expecting this to be a "coming of age" tale about 2 girls on a journey back home- but oh man I'm so glad I was wrong
 What I got out of this VN was a great tale about family and what it really means to BE part of said family, cultural differences between regions, and a bit of science and a dash of religion/fantasy
 I'd definitely recommend this game to people who enjoy a story about family but also about how we as humans can be oh so different in where we grew up but at the same time be oh so similar to one another
 I rate this a 9/10
Here's a pros and cons list for those interested
Pros:+Great art+Awesome soundtrack +Transitions are neat+LOVE the characters+The tone and pacing of the story is great+Great storytelling by the writer+Great story+Great theme about family and friendsCons:-No Voice Acting (this may be personal preference but Voice Acting adds a whole 'nother dynamic to the tone, storytelling and how it can add auditory stimuli to help immerse us as readers into the story even further
) -Few grammatical issues (not too problematic but they are there at times)-A little bit too technical on the terminology at times (there are a few instances where they go a little TOO much into the science/mana bits and how things work but I believe this is a subjective issue
)-Only Part 1 ):

This is my first review on Steam, and I'll make it simple
ART: Manga style
 Gorgeous and emotional
CHARACTER: Adorable, charming and full of personality
(Which is also a typical manga style
)STORY: I spent my whole day reading it without resting and eating
 So you tell me
WORDING: The wording is featured in mutiple types, elegant, preciseness and with distinctive styles
 The accent is adorable xD
 However, it might not be the standard writing nowadays, the sentences seems a bit obscurely and contrived
(I mean only the English version, I cannot read Japanese
 Well done the translations
) SOUNDTRACK: Outstanding, most of the times
 Sometimes I sence the background music inappropiate for the scene and by the way, the OP is awful
 But most of the BGM were good and sometimes the BGM-Swap makes the story incredibly dramatic and thrilling
 UI: Serves perfect, smooth and pretty
 The encyclopedia made this VN easier to comprehend
In conclusion
 I would give a
9
5/10
The -0
5 comes from the awful OP (the one after the teleportation to the unknown forest)
 I'm planning on making a OP myself already (perhaps
xD)
At last, the best VN on steam with no doubt and the most expensive VN I've ever bought (15)
Posted: 20 May, 2015
Best thing Sekai has brought to Steam
 Buy this instead of Sakura Spirit

So, first I was all like, whoa, Magic
 kravte
 and then I was all like WHOA, MAGICKRAVTE
But then the game was all like, nuh-uh, science
 So I was like, oh okay, that's cool too
Then there was murder and tradgedyAnd then robots happened
And then I was cryingAnd then the end left with like a WTF is this momentAnd then there was another character in the main menu screen (Yay
)I would seriously reccomend this game, it is a beautiful game with amazing backround music and a compelling story, I didn't want to stop reading once I started

Note: This review will be mixed with Fault Milestone two side:above and Fault Milestone one
 [Just for the audio elements area] Fault is a Science Fantasy Kinetic Novel developed by ALICE IN DISSONANCE, and Published by Sekai Project
 With the addition of a new 3D camera system, Fault Milestone one aims to introduce a more immersive and larger than life reading experience
Follow them on their journey of a lifetime as they try to make it back home to the Kingdom of Rughzenhaide
 This partucular VN in my opinion really stood out among many other VNs that I have played I really enjoyed this the most among all that have been released
The story A princess named Selphine a bubbly, happy-go-lucky Princess and her sharp-witted but slightly misanthropic Royal Guard Ritona
 While attempting to make an escape from a brutal assault thats devastated their homeland of Rughzenahide, the two mysteriously teleport to an unknown forest surrounded by vegetation not native to the surroundings of Rughzenahdie
 The atmosphere is thick and heavy and no sign of life can be found, which is particularly unusual for such a lush forest
 Sign of life isnt the only thing missing though
 Something is odd about this land  something is amiss  but Selphine and Ritona are too startled to notice the obvious
Who were the assaulter and what was their goal
 Where did Selphine and Ritona end up traversing to
 Will the two make it home safely
 And more importantly, what will they come home to once they do
Audio and Visual elementsVisual elements  All top notch, from character sprites to character designs, backgrounds and CGs anyone who have played or do plan to play Fault series the art is very distinctive
 It s eye catching very made a huge impact I loved the mix of colors that were use to bring out each character personality like for example, Purple that signifies royalty, etc
Audio Elements  The OST all of them are top notch, extremely detailed and fitted in perfectly into its environment and cues in at the perfect timing
 Its soundtracks is immersive when playing through this VN it felt that you are a part of it it felt good and it has very good abilities of conveying the mood and situation of the VN
 I loved all of them, but there were a few that stood out here is the list of them that stood out, The divide and Sol (Sol Main Theme) and Ode Piano Version and Homeward Bound and Death of dignity and Lines are drawn
 I wish I could share those soundtracks but I am not sure of its copyright issues on this matter but I here is a video of its trailer, from it you can tell it is good just from its trailer
To sum up Will I recommend Fault series
 Yes
 Absolutely in fact you should not even give this a miss, missing this is like walking past a box filled with gems and then regretting it later
 I am honestly glad I picked this game up, usually after I buy a VN or game I will regret later becasue I simply did not enjoy it and they usually does not keep me in intrest to make me wanting it to reread it but as for the Fault series its different
 I have reread Fault milestone one and two 3 times each and I am still not bored at all, despite it being a kinetic novel
Click here a review filled with images and afterwords at the end[azusantiara

Posted: 25 June
Possibly one of the best western visual novels Ive played so far, even tho I didnt liked the ending too much
 Im going to be honest, at first I thought it was going to be an okay title with pretty art, but ACE Academy is actually really good
 And one of the keys of success is the MC: hes funny, kind of a jerk sometimes, can be a sweetheart I loved him
 Its a slice of life with mecha action
 I was interested more because of the giant robots at first, but the comedy and character interaction were surprisingly good
 Theres a lot of mentions of other famous games (such as Persona 4), the amount of choices and the way that they change the story is awesome, and the voice acting is great
 All VAs did an excellent job on this game, seriously
 About the routes, I enjoyed Kaoris a lot
 Im not so fond of the tsundere type and yet I liked that character a lot
 Her voice fitted her so well that I think thats one of the reasons why I liked Kaori: the girl is stubborn as hell, but you can feel that deep down she does have a good heart, and shes not simply grumpy for no reason
 Also, I liked Mayu
 (Yes, the madwoman
 Yandere is my guilty pleasure, Im sorry
 lol9/10
 If you want a good and light comedy to read, youll enjoy this VN
 But if you dont like games with no closure or with cliffhangers, you might get annoyed
 But honestly, the character interaction and the scenarios are so good and enjoyable that I feel like forgiving the ending
 I really hope that there will be a sequel someday

Early Access Review
Do I recommend it, even though this is only the first episode
 Yes I do
The scores below are from 1 to 10, 1 being terrible, 5 being average and 10 being excellent
 I am confident in this Visual Novel and I think it can be one of the best Western Visual Novels
 Keep in mind that the scale I am using is the same that I use to evaluate japanese visual novels (like Grisaia no Kajitsu):Story: Not rated at the moment (episode 1)Since this is only the first episode and was pretty much about introductions (and there's still another girl to be introduced in the next episode), I can't rate the story
 My personal thoughts are that this is going to be a straightforward comedy slice of life romantic visual novel, so I don't expect any serious developments or mind blows
There's not really much I can say about writing
 It focuses on the dialogue and the protag thoughts, and doesn't waste time in detailing objects/sceneries
 It's an easy to read writing and direct to the point
There are some references and easter eggs
 One of the best scenes in this visual novel is a small battle between the MC, Kaori and a Tech Gosu
 Their battle is a little parody between Android, Apple and Microsoft
 Another is when choosing a movie, you get to choose a movie of a list of movies that all are based off real movies, and the characters leave their comment on it
Visuals: 7The backgrounds are just too good
 The artist makes such a good job of using lightning to give more life to the backgrounds
The characters also look good in my opinion
 The big drawback here is that, probably due to financial limits, secondary characters don't have fully drawn sprites
 Meaning that their sprites are just black figures
Gameplay: 9This visual novel, just like many others, is about making choices
 Difference is that this one has tons of choices that drastically change the story, while the others only have a few
 If you need a comparison, compare it to Walking Dead videogame from Telltalles games
 Some choices only change a few lines, while others change a lot of what happens
 For example, earlier in the game, you can choose to go to school by bus or with the bike
 Depending on what you choose, it will change what characters you meet first and what will happen in the next day
 Not only that, but if you decide to be an A hole with someone, that someone will remember it later and act accordingly
There's also the rollback feature
 Rollback is the feature that allows you to rollback to your previous choice and choose another option
 In this VN, you are asked in the begginning if you want to disable it
 If you do, you will get achievements and "other possible goodies"
You can also name your protagonist and choose his background trait: athletic, intelligent and intuitive
 If you choose to be athletic, you will have no problem carrying luggage, if you choose to be intelligent, other characters might ask for your help with the studies, etc
 This also sometimes highlights the best options in some choices, for example, if the teacher asks a question, the correct answer will be highlighted if you chose the intelligent trait
This visual novel also features mini games
 In the first episode, there are two type of mini games, if there will be more or not in the future I don't know
 One is a simple press the right combination of 5 buttons scattered around the screen
 In this episode, it appears only once to callibrate the MC's mech
 To be honest that minigame feels unnecessary (especially because your penalty for failing is just repeating the mini game), however one of the devs said that he plans to use it again later, so I assume that this one can serve as a tutorial kind of thing
The other mini game is the combat
 I am pleased that they improved it a lot since the alpha
 Now it's a lot better and it feels like I am actually doing some damage
 This mini game is simple: Just press WASD according to what appears on the screen
 If it appears W, press W and your combo will go up
 You have limited energy and the enemy has HP
 Depending on how well you do in the combat, the other characters will react to it (if you did well, they will praise you, etc)
 However, the bad side is that the mini game is too easy (for me at least)
Sound: 7They really did a good job here
 The music is good and one of the tracks even got stuck in my ear (it's one that plays when riding the bike if we choose to go to school with it)
 That's a lot more than I can say for many visual novels
 You see, I am like this: if I like the music that is playing, I continue to play the VN with it on, if I don't, I turn off the music and play my own
 I didn't turn off the music in this VN
The voice acting is also good
 The voices match very well with the characters (Shou especially)
 Obviously, we are talking about low budget voice acting, so don't expect voice acting on Morgan Freeman level (aka God level)
 It's good, but not something that will blow you away
 But considering that one can count english voice acted visual novels with just one hand, this is a really good effort from the devs
However, there are at least two moments where secondary characters don't have voice
 Considering that I reported this in the last alpha, I am going to assume that their lack of voice is intentional and not a bug
 This is weird because everyone else is voiced
 I will update this if they add voices later
Characters: Not going to rate yetSome of the characters are inspired by your usual japanese anime stereotypes, like tsundere
 However, they don't shamessly try to imitate them to the letter, which is good, because english voice acting + japanese stereotypes = usually not a good idea
 It's not by chance that "Idiot
" doesn't sound as good as "baka
" at the end of "I didn't do it because I like you, baka
"In the first episode, you are introduced to an uncle (Kaito), sister (Nikki), friend (Shou) and the romantic options: Mayu, Yuuna and Kaori
 There's also a french girl appearing in the next episode, Belle (Ooh là là)
 And there's also other guy that you may or may not meet in this episode depending on your choices, Akira (I got my eye on you, you white haired *insert swear here*)Because we are only in the first episode, and also because I'm lazy, I will refrain for now from talking of each one individually, but what I can say is that they feel compeling and I want to know more about them
Enjoyment: 9I am a sucker for choices
 I am a sucker for consequences
 So I had a blast replaying it multiple times and roleplay differently each time
The only complaint I have is that this episode felt a bit shorter compared with the original demo, but other than that, it was fun
Final rating: 8 (episode 1)TL;DR:Just buy it
 I kid
 You should buy it if:- You like light hearted stories;- You like mechas;- You like tons of choices;- You like easter eggs/references;- You want to support western VN's
You shouldn't buy it if:- You want a serious story (again, this is based off of the first episode, it might get serious moments later on for all I know);- You don't like any kind of mini games in visual novels;- You prefer more linear stories
If you have any questions or you want to point out something, feel free to comment
 I will reply as soon I notice it

ACE Academy is a story-rich visual novel developed and published by PixelFade Inc
 Following your little sister as she begins her studies in a new country, you find yourself transferring to ACE Academy which is a premier school for Cenorobotic studies in Japan
 "Cenorobotics" is a new academic field dealing with the study and use of GEARs which are giant mechanized robots originally developed for military applications
 The popularity of arena GEAR combat has enveloped a number of different areas with engineering, sponsorship, entertainment and weapons development just to name a few
 How will you and your sister adjust to life in a different nation, will you be able to make friends or possibly find love and most importantly will your piloting skills position you and your GEAR at the top of the Cenorobotics program
 Welcome to Japan
Usually I skip the gameplay portion of a visual novel review because it's a visual novel and there is no gameplay
until now that is
sort of
 Strangely enough, there actually is some gameplay involved in ACE Academy whenever there is combat with the mechs or GEARs as they are properly refered to
 On the battlefield, as advances are made by you and your opponents you are quickly given a list of actions to make with your GEAR and you only have a very limited time, seconds at best as a countdown timer initiates, to make a choice which really adds to the tension of the battles
 Do you block, evade, fire weapons or go in for a melee attack
it's all very well executed into the story quite nicely with animations during the battles
 In summary, this additional dynamic really had me even more intrigued with the narrative in ACE Academy as I found myself eagerly looking forward to the next engagements with the GEARs
Visually, this novel is really stunning with it's top notch illustration and professional presentation
 The manga inspired artwork is some of the best I've seen in any V
N
 and is filled with bright cheerful colors and terrific shading
 Even the menu screens are beautifully done which shows the commitment that this development team really put into this title
 One very eye-catching feature is the animation of the characters in this story
 They certainly aren't the static 2D figures that you see in most visual novels no
 The people in ACE Academy are wonderfully animated
 Their mouths move when they speak, their eyes blink, they even show different emotions with their facial features like blushing and getting upset or angry
 Sometimes even cute little speech bubbles with different animations in them like a heart or a tear pop up over the characters heads depending on what they just said or what they're feeling it's all very manga-like and fun to observe as you read the engrossing narrative
 They also change clothing on a regular basis, whenever you meet someone outside of the Academy for a social engagement they are always wearing something different
 I found this to be a wonderful little detail and something that you don't often see in most visual novels
 On another note, the sound is of the upmost quality
 It's truly immersive as the development team has managed to include ambient noises such as doors opening/closing, phones ringing, birds chirping, vehicles etc
, basically all the sounds you would hear as the characters interact with each other and their environments as the story progresses
 I really love it when these sounds are incorporated into the V
N
 because it truly immmerses me within the story
 ACE Academy has voiced dialogue and typically I like my V
N
's without it but I must admit that the voice actors in this title have done an impressive job with the script
 I find them all endearing and quite believable in what they say and how they say it
 Also, your little sister Nikki has the cutest voice ever
 In conclusion, with all the effort put forth in just the visuals and sound quality of ACE Academy you would be hard pressed to find another visual novel with as outstanding a presentation as this
To date, ACE Academy has been without a doubt the best and one of the longest visual novel experiences that I've had on Steam
 The story is extremely well written and quite entertaining and some of the more emotional scenes will even bring a tear or two to your eyes
 There are many unique characters to interact with and an abundance of choices to make throughout the branching narrative and let's not forget the fun GEAR combat
 There is also a ton of "pop culture" references thrown at you in this V
N
 so that was an added bonus as well
 As far as options go, there are the basics for audio, video and text speed
 Also included is an unlockable CG gallery and a very memorable original soundtrack with a few homage bonus tracks thrown in for good measure
 Sadly there are no Steam Achievements or Steam Trading Cards to collect which is a shame because those would go over nicely with this title
 As most of the V
N
's that I've tried on Steam have been fantasy based or occuring in present day, it was very refreshing to finally get a quality title that was purely science fiction
 In conclusion, featuring a truly intriguing story in which you actually get to pilot a mech, amazing artwork, a rich cast of memorable characters and a terrific O
S
T
, ACE Academy is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to visual novel fans, anyone wanting to experience a great sci-fi story and definitely to anyone wanting to try a visual novel for the very first time

If you ever wanted a visual novel where you can troll the hell out of everyone in it, look no further
 ACE Academy is a western VN with a lot of humor and English voice acting (that manages to not be terrible)
 I have to be honest, the first playthrough I wasn't that impressed
 I chose the sensible, serious dialog options and found it to be an average slice-of-life story with a pretty disappointing ending
Then for the next playthrough I went full-on troll mode and it got way better
 Humor is the biggest reason you should pick up ACE Academy
 It had me laughing out loud many times, and that's enough to forgive it for its flaws (lackluster ending, some unvoiced dialog, minor characters are represented by silhouettes, etc
)
In summary, there is a dialog choice that says "Swiggity swooty, I'm coming for that booty
" I think that says it all

+ Main cast are standard anime tropes, but likeable+ Several girls to get your dating sim on, and thus replay value+ You are not the center of the universe (see below)+ Number of enjoyable, selectable scenes to get to know the characters+ Quality of CGs and sprites, it's a "cute" game+ Interesting setting and good world-buildingo Combat is infrequent and bland enough to be unnecessaryo Reused backgrounds and silhouettes for many side characterso Forgettable but passable soundtrack- Many story elements feel rushed and half-baked (see below)- Voice acting, particularly for secondary characters, is weak- Far too many pop culture references that will age the game terriblyACE Academy is tough for me to review
 There's plenty to like about it, but it's clear that it's PixelFade's first effort, and suffers from its original episodic release
 I assume the latter was a budgetary requirement to raise more funds through Early Access, but it's probably responsible for some pacing and focus issues
First, I will elaborate on the "pro" above: you are not the center of the universe
 You can pursue a variety of romance options, and beyond that choose which friends you spend free time with
 I was pleasantly surprised to find that characters I didn't pursue still clearly had a life outside of the game's scenes
 Girl who hit on me constantly that I rebuffed
 She got another boyfriend
 Standoffish teammate that I avoided until the end
 All the while she was working at a daycare and has a heart of gold
Now, the "con," which ties into my point about PixelFade and the episodic release
 Story elements, like a big, brewing conspiracy and the fate of your family, are repeatedly teased and then tied up far too quickly and cleanly
 There's some build up, but no climax, no payoff
 So why include them at all, really
 I suspect as they released episodes the game expanded in ways PixelFade didn't plan, and came to a point where their limited resources required they call it finished
 So they did
 but it's not satisfying
 This seems to happen even with bigger-name episodic games, like Life is Strange
 It is simply hard to maintain quality and cohesion this way
Steam tags call this an "RPG," but ACE isn't and by trying to be (with a kind-of "story arc" and characters "classes"), it dilutes itself
 In actuality it is "slice of life" and should have embraced that
 Drop the abortive mystery and rivalry and just be about a schoolboy and his friends
 As written, this practically begs for a continuation or sequel that seems unlikely
 That's too bad, because the bones of a really compelling VN are here
 I would love to learn more about GEARs and how they define people's lives
 I would love to keep following these characters and their relationships beyond the beginning stage (but that's a general gripe for too many VNs)
But still, I do recommend ACE Academy, maybe with the caveat of waiting for a sale
 If you like VNs (and if you're reading this, you very likely do), I believe this game will be enjoyable, but not mind-blowing, for you
 It was good enough on its own merits, and has me interested in PixelFade's further work
 Apparently in their next game, Crystalline, there is only one love interest for the main character that will be relatively complicated and fleshed-out
 That's a very promising direction in today's mile-wide, inch-deep world of dating sims

Wow
 So, this one came in as a complete surprise
 I didnt expect much when i bought it, but boy was I wrong
TL;DR:Pros:
Intriguing Story
Good, genuinly funny writing
Tons of choices, that also have an impact
Unique and likeable characters
Fully voice-acted
Decent length
Nice Artstyle & SoundtrackCons:
Abrupt, unsatisfying ending
Minor: Artwork occasionally gets re-usedIn Detail:Pixelfade
 Never heard of that Developer before, nor about the game itself
 So I expected a pretty run-of-the-mill Visual Novel
This was not what I got
 The CharactersThe character cast in ACE Academy was great across the board for me
 The romancable characters are unique and differ heavily from each other, but all of them are very likeable
Other characters such as your best friend, or your little sister etc
 are just as loveable
 The Dynamic between them is great and the game manages to convey a real sense of belonging
 You feel like a real part of the group
 The StoryThe Story is what I would probably classify as mildly interesting
 That doesnt mean it's bad, far from it
 For a VN it's actually rather intriguing and does the job well enough
 It's nothing revolutionary, but compared to a lot of other VN I would say it is above average
 RomancesNow as mentioned before there are 4 romancable characters
Each of them has unique traits but all of them have very rewarding and heartwarming moments in their respective routes
Through the excellent writing the progression of these romantic relationships also feels pretty natural and not forced
 Game Length & Choices After doing all the routes I capped at roughly 20 hours
 Now, I will not lie, I didnt really check my playtime after I first reached the ending , but it should last you a good 10 hours
However that is only if you play through it once, there are a lot of reason to play through it several times
At the start of the game you name your MC and select 1 out of 3 personality types
 Depending on your type you will get unique dialogue choices as well as different outcomes in some events
In additon to that you also have the above mentioned different romances that I encourage you to explore
Lastly this game throws a ton of choices at you from the get go
 Some may just slightly alter a dialogue, but there are also a lot that affect the story and that have actual impact

Early Access Review
Firstly Id just like to say as this is the early access and still has a lot more to come I thought it was extremely good
 The story was enticing and kept me very interested in the characters throughout the first part of the game
 I also enjoyed little mini games within this visual novel which kept things interesting
 Secondly the music to this game is very good and fits the rhythm of what is happening and the mood that goes with it
 I was very surprised at how well it was done for a companys first work
Finally all the characters to this game have a lot to them and are all very likeable
 This made me enjoy the story so much more and felt more connected with each character
 The voice acting is also good and fits the characters all very well giving them all their own great personalities
 There are also many different choices you can make which help keep the game fresh and mean there is much more replay ability
 In all I feel ACE Academy is definitely worth a buy
 Its a lot better than most other visual novels I have played on steam
 Especially seeing as the first part is longer than most of them, it is defiantly worth the money
 If visual novels are your thing I think you will enjoy it as much or maybe more than I did

So I was looking for Visual Novels on Steam which are on sale (Everyone wants sales) then I came across this VN
 I didn't deem it as something good because it was on sale and probably because I never heard of it before add to that it was made in the west
 So my expectations were set to low and I played the game to basically laugh at how terrible it might be
 Then it happened 2 hours in and I can't get the game off of my mind
 The characters are too damn good, the interactions are superb, there are a plethora of choices and scenarios to see and of course the protagonist is realistic
 I'm not a fan of Mech and the future but this is an exception
 An exceptionaly, wonderful VN for those lost in the dangerous seas that is called VN hell
 I finally found something I'd read 'til the end
 Simply amazing, no amount of praise can amount to the light I saw yesterday

Early Access Review
As one of the earliest and largest supporters of the project, back when it was known as Kendo Crush, I have to say, that I had a great deal of fun with the original demo
 However, I have since given up support for the project, through no reason other than the unfortunate issues the development staff encountered at many steps
 What was originally intended to come out fully in June of this year, is now still in early access
However, this is to be expected
 They have changed the game considerably, and picked up new staff, despite the issues encountered
 As a mid-tier backer of the project, I was given early access to builds of the new Ace Academy game
 All I can say is I found the quality of the writing to be greatly diminished from that of the original demo
 Without spoiling anything, certain character interactions with a girl named Kaori
 Shes quite temperamental, and I was originally satisfied with how much you were able to tease her
 From what I played of the current game, there have been far less options to do this
 In general, I found the comedy of the original to be much more prominent
 There are some improvements over the redo
 The art is much better, and Im sure the futuristic appeal of the game will be more enjoyable to some, over the original Kendo focus, which some might have seen as boring
 I must admit, that it was probably a better move for the game to be redesigned, but that doesnt change my opinion on the matter
While I can guarantee the game is worth the price, it just isnt there for me
Posted: 3 February, 2015
I wasn't entirely sure about a VN priced at $20
00, but after about ten minutes in, I realized why
 It should be noted that I'm fairly new to VN games in general, having only played six or seven personally
 That being said, compared to those, this blows them out of the water
 First off, the story is not only moving and impactful, but long
 You don't actuall come across the intro until about 30~ minutes in
 That's just a estimate, but it honestly felt the opening came in where other VN closing credits would start rolling
Secondly, the entire VN is voice acted
 Voice acted tremendously well, for that matter
 Even the main protagonist has not only a voice, but a face as well
Not only that, but the art in this game is amazing
 At first I thought I was delusional, but every character's eyes and mouths move
 Every character and background scene really immerse you into the story the developer wanted to portray
 10/10, only regret regarding this game is the fact that I didn't buy it sooner

A short review with no story details
eden* is a wonderful visual novel with brilliant art and a soundtrack that enhances the reading experience without being too overpowering
 Simple details like having the characters blink add a nice touch to an already high quality work
 This is by far my favorite visual novel currently (this review was created March 22, 2015) on Steam
 The $20 price tag is quite steep, so I would wait for it to go on sale (mine was 50% off)
 If you're looking for a serious visual novel to start reading, I recommend this
Notes:- Length ~15 hours (assuming you listen to the voice acting)- There IS voice acting- There are NO choices/routes in eden* (Kinetic Novel)- There is VERY LITTLE TO NO fan service- This is the regular version of eden
 The eden Plus+Mosaic version (not available on Steam) includes added blood to certain scenes and less censoring for certain scenes
 It also includes an extra eroge side story that is not part of the main story
 In my opinion I would have liked the added blood, but an eroge side story sounds incredibly out of place for this VN
- I consider this a serious/emotional visual novel, unlike a VN such as Sakura Spirit
 It tries to BE something and succeeds instead of appealing to absurd fan service
- Originally released September 18, 2009

Excelent kinetic novel, very much recomended

If you knew that the world was going to end soon, how would you want to spend your remaining time
 What would change for you, how would your priorities shift
 Assuming you'd find an opportunity to escape, would you choose a future of perpetual narrow walls and cramped spaces over a short time of ultimate freedom followed by certain doom
For the people living in the world of eden*, these questions are no longer abstract
MangaGamer delivers the English release of this 2009 title by minori to Steam
 eden* is a kinetic novel (a story without choices or gameplay) about the last few people on a dying planet
 Its most unique selling point compared to similar titles is its visual presentation: Instead of the waist-up character sprites positioned in front of static backgrounds that we are used to from most modern visual novels, it relies almost entirely on scene-by-scene custom images, each one carefully designed to take character positions and camera perspectives into account
 This gives the experience a very cinematic feel, quite literally reminiscent of movies, compared to other titles of its kind
 Most scenes also features blinking eyes and lip syncing with the Japanese voices, which makes it impressively lively
Needless to say, the asset quality is excellent throughout, starting with the backgrounds ranging from the painterly to the borderline naturalistic
 The same attention to detail extends to the characters who, despite the multitude of poses and perspectives, always appear consistent, unique, and alive
 From what I can tell as someone who does not speak Japanese, the voices really fit well, and coupled with the competent sound design and the soundtrack by Tenmon (if you happen to enjoy Makoto Shinkai's movies: yes, that Tenmon), which expands a small number of recurring motifs into a gripping soundscape, this is an aural experience that you are unlikely to forget
The story revolves around Warrant officer Ryou Haruna and his assignment to guard a remote research facility during the planet's final moments
 A peculiar (but largely unspecified) astronomical phenomenon is going to wipe out all life on Earth, and humanity is putting the finishing touches on a centennial plan to migrate into space and search for a new home
 One component of this plan are the felixes, genetically engineered superhumans whose intellect propels scientific progress far beyond its normal pace
 However, there are dissenting voices claiming that humanity should face its ultimate fate head-on instead of trying to escape, so military protection is granted to essential actors within the plan  in particular to Sion, the supreme felix, mastermind behind the giant starships and humanity's savior
The central themes of eden* include destiny and free will as well as the morality of living one's life for someone else
 Ryou, as the self-described "military's attack dog," and Sion, as the people's only hope to keep on living, are both so devoted to their duties that they have fallen out of touch with their own humanity
 Circumstances force them to confront their deeply buried sense of self and be thrust before the most pivotal decision of their lives: to keep on living in the narrow golden cages of their own design, or to choose the ultimate act of defiance and experience the freedom and joy that they had always denied themselves, living life to the fullest until the curtain falls
The writing tends to focus on character interaction and personal growth over story complexity  eden* is all about the human condition, not about hard sci-fi
 In fact, even the scientific details of the end of the world are almost completely glossed over
 If you are looking for an apocalyptic sci-fi story with cool technology, this isn't it
 Rather, the focus on the characters is so strong that it could be described as downright melodramatic in parts, insofar as that can be a good thing
 It features countless goosebumps-inducing, memorable, quotable moments that easily smooth over the fact that some of the tension maybe could have been resolved in easier ways, or that there's a certain degree of plot convenience constructing the situations that are most interesting for the characters
 It all ends up feeling very complete and satisfying
All in all, I can recommend eden* without much in the way of caveats
 If you dislike visual novels or anime-style art, odds are you have not read this far down
 If you like visual novels but you're not sure if this one is worth your time, my answer is that it is
 I also recommend avoiding playtime estimates
 Reading speed varies from person to person anyway, but the later parts of this story work best if you can empathize with the sense of impending dread that the characters are feeling
 For them, any day, any moment, could be the last one
 It'll be more fun for you if you can get lost in that feeling as well, instead of calculating how many hours you might have left
 Even if you have little to no experience with visual novels, this one is probably a better one to get started than most titles currently on Steam
 With the above-mentioned reservations in mind, eden* easily gets a positive recommendation from me

Almost as good as Clannad

"The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion
" ~ Albert CamusI haven't been playing visual novels for years now
 Around the time that I got involved with adult responsibilities a couple year back, I involuntarily stopped sparing time for the genre
 Thanks to a friend's insistent screenshot sharing of many beautiful VNs, I noticed that I've been missing pretty artwork and superficial stories in a very girly manner
 I gave up and decided to give the genre a go after a long time
 My first pick though, being anything but superficial, left me thoughtful and shaken
eden* is a tale of compassion, free will and tomorrow
 It is the tale of a world coming to its end
 It all started with the appearance of an ominous red star on the sky
 After through research, scientists agreed that it is the first warning sign of the end
 It took a hundred years for mankind to prepare themselves for a major immigration project to evacuate the planet and search for its destiny elsewhere
 During these final moments of the worn planet earth, there are yet things to wonder and chains to break
 Between a stoic soldier, a secluded genius, a kind maid, a broken warrior, a regretful commander and a loud journalist; eden* is the tale of breaking chains
The game is designed to be a kinetic novel - which means a visual novel without any choice options
 You only keep reading and watching the story as it unfolds
 In this manner, it cannot wholly be defined as a game
 The quality of CGs and the labor put into artwork are far beyond your casual visual novel though
 Characters present a full selection of animations, including moving eyes and lip synch with Japanese voice acting
 Voice acting is also beyond the par, as if taken out of an A+ anime series
 Translation from Japanese to English is great - which is a rare case in any media - and manages to deepen the mood furthermore
 The game is quite long so to say; if you'll be waiting for voice acting you can expect an average game time of 13-15 hours
I'd love to share some character details, but any relevant information about identities or backgrounds would be downright spoilers
 Have you ever watched Clannad
 With After Story part of course
 If your answer is no, it is a huge recommendation
 If yes, you already know what kind of soul wrecking experience that you are getting yourself into
 You'll remember Sion and Ryou's story for a long while

Ryo is not interested in Maids*camera pans to boobs*Ryo watches the scenery outside the window*camera pans to skirt*Pros-High quality animation and scenesI'm used to seeing standard sprites in visual novel but this one was really made with dedication
It has animated mouth and eyes, plus the poses are not limited to just standing
-Main protagonist has voice-Cute girls with flushed cheeks
(99
99% of the time)-It's not a loli game
She's 100 years oldCons-Small Resolution-Clunky settings menu-Some shortcut keys like Full Screen and Window Mode are not working-Can't access to CG gallery unless you finished at least one route
-Sometimes the art seems off
expecially the guys
 The girls are perfectly fine
I will continue to edit my review
I'm just a bit distracted to where the camera pans

This game has a niche target audience so I'll do my best to outline it below
 If i have to give a rating I would give it an 8/10 and reccomend getting it on sale
 I'm very aware that while I enjoy these games reccomending them is a bit dodgy as alot of people simply will not like what this game is
 It does what it tries to do but that wont appeal to ALOT of people
REASONS NOT TO BUY THIS GAME:This game is not mechanically deep, characters roles are pretty simple to figure, beyond buffs debuffs and manipulating the turn system theres not alot to learn, the last one is a nice touch but still not a good game for someone who wants to think hard about their strategy
Story is pretty poor in general (though not even close to as bad as rebirth 2 imo) and it has alot of repetition in monsters, dungeons etc
 The game is rated 12+ and that age level seems appropriate so if you're looking for adult images, look elsewhere
 Fanservice is tame and sporadic
It has quite alot of post game content through the free dlcs but unfortunately there is pretty much no way to progress to the last 4 areas or higher level fights in a
natural way
 To do these you simply turn on the "in-game power level hax" and grind levels for an hour or two
 This means that to keep things fun post game you have to carefully balance your levels or else you will be annihilated/untouchable
The difficulty is a bit low for alot of the games until you reach the ultra late-game at which point it reaches stupid levels and the only way to balance is essentially to be really careful about how you break the game (see above point)The 4th wall gets SMASHED repeatedly here
 All the games broke the 4th wall but this one just completely ignores to the point where even I got annoyed in later chapters and I'm normally immune to it
REASONS TO BUY THIS GAME:The games characters are the main draw
 Its a mix of a visual novel with a turn based rpg and the characters keep the visual novel element highly entertaining for the most part
 Having all the dlc characters active can make it a bit too much dialogue wise so I reccomend not using them for a first playthrough if you intend to do more than 1
 Some of the characters might drive some people crazy and as obvious as it might sound, anime like characters and reactions are plentiful so if you like anime you probably have a higher chance of liking this though I'm sure its not necessary
Having plutia and Nep as the 2 of the 3 main characters pretty much makes this game for me
 Is funny
 well I think so anyway :DThe battle system while simple is fun to play and the animations are really smooth
 If you have played the other games you have a good idea whats going on but this one is a step up on this front, not anything massively different just little things that make game more fun to play
 The entire interface is massively improved in this game too, it still has its flaws but the menu in this game alone is enough to make it the best of the three
Theres a challenge system introduced where you get little bonuses by completing challenges and while some of them are a little painful and the higher targets in many are RIDICULOUS, its still a nice addition
The game isnt too short at about 40-60 hours for a casual playthrough of true ending if you read everything, certainly not long by rpg standards but long enough that you wont feel ripped off

This game is much better than Re;Birth 1 and Re;Birth 2Just like Re;Birth 1 I completed it in 100% (all achievements, lvl 999, all bosses and events)
Battles aren't too easy (unless you're using super EXP plan from DLC), animations are as good as ever, story/characters/humor perfect
I bought it on discount but it's still worth those 28 Euros
 If you're Neptunia fan you have to buy this one
if you are new then I'd recommend playing Re;Birth 1 and Re;Birth 2 first before this
otherwise you'll miss a lot of jokes and references

Coupled with the bright, colourful art style and cheery soundtrack, I honestly struggle to see how anyone could play one of these games and not enjoy their time with it
 When compared with its original counterpart from PS3, Hyperdimensiondimension Neptunia Re:Birth 3: V Century doesn't have many new elements as we would like, just some added minor functions
 However, it's thanks to the improvements that the developers tried to include in the previous remakes that make this entry in one of the best iterations of all the franchise
 If you haven't played any game of the series, you could easily try this one
+60 FPS - 1080P+The Girls We Know+Fluid Combat System+A Ton Of Video Game References And Cultural In-Jokes+Museum Is Awesome+Soundtracks Are Better Than Ever-Pretty Hard To Play With Keyboard - Mouse (That's Not A Big Deal Of Course)-It Doesn't Offer the Same Amount Of Improvements Than Previous-Lack Of PresentationMy Review Score Is: 84/100 As Normal Gamer,And 110/100 As Member Of Lastation
I Hope All You Guys Enjoy,Boing

Ys Origin does a great job explaining the past, it also features interesting characters that you can finish the game with (each one having their own unique game-play, equipment, short storyline and so)
For those who don't know, Ys is an old school action RPG (from the late 80's) that luckily didn't got extinct in today's modern video game industry (That strives to approach to the masses), the surviving series features a very solid and hardcore experience for those who delve in to it (No hands are held here, not suitable for some casual players)
Without delving that much in to the storyline, I'll start by saying that the whole game is set in a massively big tower with tons of floors where you'll actively explore till you reach the top, all because due to the fact you're part of a team that is looking for two mysterious female angel like characters who have disappeared and also they are fighting a mysterious evil that suddenly appeared on their land
Just like the first of the series, it is based on your character progression (Status), based on your skill and how well prepared and equipped you're, you'll fight tons of different minions and bosses through out the game
The game is fast paced, if you're used to a slower and less action based game, then do not delve in to this one, you'll have to be quick and prepare yourself to evade any possible attacks and at the same time plan how you'll attack your foes quickly before their defense is up again
You're forced to play the game to unlock new areas as you progress but do take in mind that you're not only forced to a narrow path, you'll have some freedom of exploration to farm and grab new items
 As for the game soundtrack you'll be delighted, it is so memorable
In terms of art style and UI they are all professionally done and will set in motion your connection to the game, giving you a taste of immersion (You'll have a good read, the game has a big script), character wise; some are forgettable but overall your experience with them is quite positive
 If you like Anime and you like oldschool games that are fast paced and hard, then this is the game for you

When I bought this game, I didn't expect too much
 Like may be it can kill couple of hours of boredom
 Most reviews are of some grand praise but how actually this could be any good, YouTube videos quite meh, nothing amusing
So without much anticipation I picked some girl with axe and started in nightmare difficulty
 Control was good and responsive; there are some instruments in your arsenal on how to wreak havoc on your enemies
 However, your enemies arent going to watch you kill them, some immune to this, some immune to that, some shoot barrages of projectiles, some charge without rest, some come in swarms, some bestow loads of status effects
 All of them share one thing: they want you DEAD RIGHT NOW
Terrain is quite simple, however made well in its simplicity: every zone have unique feeling about it, not like I can watch landscape forever of course, but certainly adds to game
Music was to my liking, which does not necessarily mean that you would like it, but this game strong point is that tracks come in huge variety
 Orchestra, piano, violin, harmonica, metal, electronic stuff  game has that all
 If you played through whole game and did not like a single track that would be a huuuge WOW
 from me
Plot is not complex and has nothing unexpected in it but still makes you feel for characters
 If youre new to YS, it would make a nice introduction, so you wont have whats happening
 feelings, if youre veteran, some whys and whats would be answered
So like I said, I picked girl with axe and started playing
 Shortly I came across that guy  Velagunder, he is boss of first subsection
 And he killed me repeatedly for six hours straight WHAT THE F
 I sure am not high skilled player or something, but I was able to finish battletoads, TNMT, contra, rollergames and such titles on NES in my childhood
 What is this guy
 He surely is enjoying watching me struggle, shouting angry words and writhing in agony
 Six hours after he decided to surrender and I was like: YEAH
 DIE

Ys Origin is quite possibly my favorite game on Steam
It might be because I was already a big fan of the Ys series before I played it, but still
 It's a great game
Ys Origin is an action RPG, with a hack and slash styled battle system
 There are 3 playable characters, the 3rd being unlocked when you clear the game the first time with either of the first two characters
 Each character has a very specific playstyle
 To avoid spoilers, I'll only detail the initial two
Hugo Fact is a ranged caster
 He is very powerful, firing off spell bullets from his wand and his twin artifacts known as the "Eyes of Fact" that hover at his side at all times
 His is very agile, but he cannot fire while moving
 Yunica Tovah is a melee attacker
 Armed with her handaxe (and later greatsword), she excels at close combat
 She is very quick, dealing fast, hard damage to her opponents
 When you start the game, you get to choose from many different difficulty settings (Very Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Nightmare), as well as choose which character you want to play as
 Each character has their own storyline, though all three of them are intertwined
 Playing each character is highly recommended, as each storyline offers more and more insight into the overall picture
Gameplay consists of your typical RPG fare: battling monsters while exploring your surroundings
 In Ys Origin, you are tasked with exploring a giant tower that extends to the heavens
 The tower is broken up into segments, with each segment offering a different environment to do battle in and explore
 They are varied enough to where sometimes you forget you are in a tower and are instead traversing a dungeon located elsewhere
 At the end of each segment (and sometimes in the middle) you are presented with a boss
 The end of each segment is always a screen-filling boss, and these are the most fun parts of the game, each requiring some strategy to defeat
Ys Origin includes a neat Arena Bonus Mode and a Boss Rush/Time Attack Mode
 In Arena Mode, you choose a character and fight wave after wave of monster in a specific location
 As you defeat enemies, you accrue SP
 You can then use this SP to unlock a variety of things for this mode, such as extra costumes and even a surprise guest character
 In Boss Rush Mode, you can choose to either battle one Boss at a time, or every boss in the game consecutively
The music and sound effects are top-notch
 The Ys series is known for their amazing soundtracks, and Origin is no exception
After awhile I found myself whistling along as the music played
 You may be inclined to find and purchase the soundtrack online
just a warning
 :POverall this is just an awesome game
 I got it on sale for about $7, but in my opinion the original, full price is WELL worth it
 You get a lot of game for the price
Highly Recommended

When you think of action-RPGs you probably think of Diablo, Torchlight, and all those other games where a players worth is measured in the loot that they acquire
 Monsters are essentially piñatas that when killed will explode into an array of multi-colored pieces of equipment
 After spending so much time on games such as these, my mind dulls to the point where I stop caring about saving the world, or performing some heroic and death-defying feat
 All I really want to do is look at numbers rise
 I need an intervention
 I need to refocus
 I need Ys Origin
All you really need to know about the Ys Series is that everyone fights with an un-matched level of veracity
 Imagine a thousand buzz-saws being shot out of a thousand cannons, and everything they shred also gets set on fire
 When the series was still very young, the early games required the player to kill monsters by running at them and striking either of their sides
 In a way the later games such as Ys Origin are an extension of this basic design
 In the interest of balance, the improved controls and maneuverability means players have to contend with more intense battles
 A plethora of difficulty settings assist the player in finding a level of challenge that suits them
 The hardest settings deliver an experience akin to a 2D shooter, where the entire screen is flooded with death
 As youd expect from the title, Ys Origin establishes the roots of the series
 Fans will quickly note all of the references to the first entry, which include characters, events, and even boss-battles
 In fact, the entirety of the game takes place in Darm Tower, which is essentially where most of Ys 1 also took place
 Still, aside from the boss-battles none of this is particularly exciting
 This game was originally released in late 2006, and even with the update to Steam, an option to skip cut-scenes was never developed
 The dialogue is fairly good, but the story is very traditional and there are certain events that have to be sat through
 The time spent outside of combat, tends to be really dull
There are three playable characters in this game and each of them has a different fighting style, a few unique bosses to contend with, and their own path in the story
 Yunica Tovah is the token cute-girl-with-a-big-axe
 Her companions and adversaries are quick to point out her lack of magic ability, but I cant tell the difference, when shes summoning firebirds that lay everything to waste
 Hugo Fact on the other hand is all about the spells, though his style of play can best be described by the classic arcade shooter Mercs
 Expect to run & gun your way through the tower if you play as this wizard
 Big brother Toal Fact is unlocked after beating the game with either of the other two characters
 His fighting style resembles Wolverine
 Basically you go pork or bacon on enemies and claw your way to success
 Each adventure should take around six or seven hours to complete, although this can be slightly effected by the difficulty setting
Darm Tower is a lot like Draculas Castle in that the forces of evil can shape it to fit their whims
 Im absolutely certain that when I scoured this tower in the first game I did not have to deal with swimming through flooded corridors, jumping over spike-traps, and dealing with that always-necessary lava level
 Each level has a theme and by the second or third youll figure out everything you need in order to progress
 This adventure is almost entirely linear; however youre free to backtrack in case you missed anything
 Unfortunately even though you get some cool powers like the ability to double-jump there really arent any instances where you can go back to prior areas to find items you couldnt get to earlier
 This is the same case for all three playable characters, so once you learn the layout, all you have to focus on is the methods for dealing with the demons
 The combat is by far the greatest aspect of the Ys series, and the same can be said for this entry
 All fights move quickly and multiple types of foes all attacking at once is a regular occurrence
 To keep things fair the demons have a tell when theyre about to attack (they blink white for half a second)
 Also, while all demons are capable of hitting very hard, as long as youre exploiting weaknesses they go down just quickly
 If youre not doing enough damage, usually a level-up will balance things out, and a second or third might even make you slightly overpowered
 Still, dont expect to grind through bosses as experience points drop to about one per kill, which will force you to move on
 The boss-battles in this game are especially great, probably among the best in the series
 At first I was worried that every boss was going to be a weak-point mashing affair, but each encounter is varied and just awesome
 Some demons like The Creeper are not only relentless but can also induce serious headaches by healing themselves in mid-battle
 Unlike a few of the other Ys entries there also arent any herbs, potions, or elixirs that can be purchased to bail you out
 But hey, all this difficulty adds to that feeling of accomplishment
 Replay value in Ys Origin is certainly high
 After completing the game with all three characters youre given access to the time-attack, arena mode, and bonus shop
 The time-attack is a boss-rush where you can face off against any or all of the major demons for the possibility of a spot on the leaderboards
Arena mode has you dealing with waves upon waves of monsters, if you survive you can use the points you earn to buy prizes from the bonus shop
 You can always head back to the tower and attempt the harder difficulties as well
 There are plenty of achievements and getting them all practically requires that you master the game
 Really theres not a whole lot that can be said about Ys Origin
 Theres no hidden meaning to be found and this is not some life-reaffirming experience that I could write thirty pages on
 This is simply an excellent action-RPG that despite being more than a few years old it still contends with among the best the genre has to offer
 On the other hand if your experience with the genre has never gotten beyond breaking open monsters and collecting all the armors, swords, and belts they were stowing in their nether regions, then steer clear
 This game keeps it focused and judges the player entirely on their ability to evade and strike, luck isnt a factor in the slightest

A thorough evaluation of how bad you are at video games
The music starts pretty grape and actually gets better the higher you go up
Yunica has pretty cute oven mitts
If you die it's probably your fault because controls and movement are solid
The platforming actually doesn't suck (wow
)
Featuring the Wolverine from the Marvel universe
Has a boss rush mode
Bosses will bully you
Higher difficulty actually adds stuff to bosses instead of just health and damage
11/10 would play again (because the game needs multiple playthroughs to unlock everything)
I actually have no complaints about this game for real
Posted: 25 November, 2013
Well here we are a few days into June 2012, and the gaming year couldn't be going better
 E3 is in full swing, with publishers announcing their latest and greatest titles
 However quite frankly I'm finding myself distracted from all the excitement
 Why, do you ask
 It's because I have found my personal Game of The Year, and I don't think anything else that could come out right now could possibly top it
 You can take your Diablos, your Modern Warfares, your Max Paynes, and you can file them all away for some other time and place
 I'm too busy saving the ancient land of Ys from demonic hordes hellbent on the destruction of humanity
It has been a mere three months since XSEED made their Steam debut with the smash hit Ys: The Oath in Felghana
 In that short time their crack squad of programming gurus and translation wizards have been working overtime to bring us more Ys goodness, and this time they've takes us back to the beginning with Ys Origin
 This entry in the series is actually a prequel, taking place 700 years before the events of the first Ys games
 This of course means that Adol Christin has to sit this round out, however do not despair
 This time around we have THREE playable characters to fill out the roster, and each of them brings their own story and unique gameplay style to the table
If you have played a Ys game before (and I'm sure you have) then you should feel right at home with Yunica Tovah, our first playable character
 She's a tough but compassionate young girl who has dedicated her life to protecting the goddesses
 Do not underestimate her abilities because although she cannot use magic, she can swing around a massive battle axe as if it were a feather duster
 Players new to the series should start with Yunica, as she is very easy to handle in combat
 Once players feel comfortable they can tackle Hugo Fact, a magic user who plays out like a bullet hell shooter
 The third (and secret) character will unlock once you finish the game as either Yunica or Hugo, and suffice it to say he's only for experienced players
Of course it would not be an Ys game if it didn't have big badass boss fights, and Ys Origin delivers in spades
 As usual each boss has it's weak point and a pattern that you can exploit, and half the fun is figuring out how
 Unlike other games that have impossibly punishing bosses, in Ys Origin if you're dying frequently you can simply level up and try again
 Also be sure to check out the upgrade menu at save points, though they may seem minor, the right enhancement can save your life
 Also be on the lookout for rare cleria ore, as it can be used to temper your weapons
The music and graphics are of course as stunning as you would expect from a series of such a high caliber as Ys
 From the stirring violin strains of the opening theme which give way to choral chants and guitar riffs, you can guess from just that track alone that the soundtrack is something special
 And it truly is, with a wildly diverse soundscape of orchestral music inlaid with the finest hair metal that Falcom Sound Team J
D
K
 has to offer
 Just ad rich are the gorgeously rendered 3d backgrounds and lush sprites that make up the visuals
After you finish the main quest in Ys Origin there's still plenty to do
 A host of unlockables including Time Attack, Boss Rush, and Arena modes round out the package, offering hours of gameplay beyond the main story
 If you yearn for an epic story with brutal bosses, complex character development, and a truly hardcore soundtrack, look no further than Ys Origin
 Newcomers will find an engaging start to a new series, and Ys veterans will find plenty of references to their beloved series, and even answers to some burning questions that they may have
 At a solid asking price of $20, Ys Origin is an unbeatable value
 Pick it up today

Probably my favorite YS on steam since Chronicles
 The way it sets up the plot to books one and two is amazing and has some of the strongest gameplay and music in the series
 I look forward to going back and replaying the other 2 routes in the game
Posted: 4 May, 2014
This is one of the best action RPGs available, with one of the best combat systems ever made
 The game is also very challenging, but you can put it on an easier difficulty
 Normal difficulty will cost you many deaths, especially during the difficult boss battles
 The game will last you around 12 hours to play through the storyline portion, but it has high replay value
 You can choose from 3 characters (1 is unlockable) and they each have their own storyline
 I would say Hugo and the unlockable character have strong storylines, while Yunica has a weak one
Posted: 28 May
Great replay value
 Three separate stories that take place in the same area, but they are all connected
 The gameplay is more fleshed out when compared to Felghana, and the story is good as well
 Farming is important for at least Hugo, and Yunica for a smooth experience (Not too much farming though)
 Toal's playthrough is designed well, but be extra prepared for the final encounter
 Other than that, the combat is fantastic, the story is quite good, and the graphics are fantastic in many cases
 I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good time

YS Origins, a lost gem among rpg's
Ys Origins is a prequel to a series named Ys which I had never even heard of, which I was suprised considering my love of rpg's
 Ys Origins feels a lot more like a very fast legend of Zelda title mixed with a dungeon crawler, as in you navaigate dungeons while solving puzzles and killing a lot of enemy demons rather than a Final Fantasy type game with it's turn based battle mechanics
 The game consists of three characters Yunica, Hugo and Toal, the game must be completed once to unlock Toal
The three characters have very different distinct play styles and abilities which really makes the game feel fresh even though you are revisiting the same areas each time, also each time you will see a different side to an interesting story
 The entireity of the game is spent climbing a tower, with your surroundings, traps and enemies varying from floor to floor
You will solve puzzles while fighting hundreds of demons which will give you experience to level up to get stronger and sp to enhance other abilities
 Along with the three characters the game also contains a time trial mode that times your climb of the tower and an arena mode which you fight waves of monsters increasing the replay value, which you can unlock other versions of the three characters and the main character from the other Ys games
Enemies are very varied, but every few floors you will face a gigantic boss, the boss's are very challenging needing different tactics each time and extremely rewarding when you finally finish it off
 I really enjoyed playing it as all three characters and will be purchasing the other ys games on steam and reviewing those too
 Pros- Nice graphics feeling retro and new at the same time- Interesting storyline and characters- Lots of replay value- Fun gameplay- Very action packed- Amazing boss fightsCons- No world map, entirely in the tower- The inside of the tower barely changes for each character- Some of the steam achievements didnt seem to unlock although im sure I met the criteriaOverall Score9/10
Posted: 28 November, 2015
To all those saying this game is too hard, it's a lot easier with both hands on the controller
 
Posted: 18 June
Wow
 This game shocked me with how good it was
I DEFINATLY reccommend you play it
BUT
This is not a game to start Shantae with
 The mechanics are different and it's not a good idea of what the series is
Beyond that, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse takes place directly after the events of Shantae: Risky's Revenge
 If you haven't played Risky's Revenge first, then you should because it will cause some confusting moments in Pirate Curse
Pros:- Amazing Graphics- You constantly feel interested in the game
 There's never a moment where you feel bored or want to take a break
- Just like all Shantae games, there is backtracking, but the other thing about Shantae games (excluding Half-Genie Hero)
is that the backtracking never makes you feel sick of the areas
 With the new pirate gear you obtain during your time in
the game, after virtually every world there is things to do in all the previous ones
- There are a ton of collectables- The game is NOT linear
 This game encourages exploration and has the best use of collectable hunting I've seen in my
years of gaming
 You have to go off your path and utillize your arsinal in creative ways to find hidden passages in walls
or hidden rooms to find them
 You don't even have to find said collectables and that really helps them feel like goodies
rather than chores like many recent games do
-
This game gives you NOTHING on a sliver platter
 Sometimes I feel I'll be hunting for a secret or a collectable just to find
a key in the chest I found
 The puzzles aren't simply laid out in front of you, they require dedication and smarts
 This
really protects the game from being too easy and definatly ups the enjoyment levels
-
Amazing character development
 The story is great, all the characters have lovable personalities, you just remember
them all and very few are just one-offs
-
The game also brings some of the trademark Shantae humor to the table which is always greeted with a warm
welcome
-
Fantastic soundtrack
-
Just straight fun platforming-
You actually use your items to fight bosses
 You don't know how many games render items useless by not doing this
-
Gems weren't jsut coming at you in heaps
-
Platforming wasn't too easy
-
REALLY good final boss fight
Cons:- Items that you had to purchase and upgrade in RR amd HGH were turned into one-time use items
- Some items like the Monster Milks and the Bubble Shield I felt were useless
Just buy this game and Risky's Revenge at the same time and you'll have a good few weeks

Risky's Revenge review: http://steamcommunity
com/id/stumperman/recommended/277890/This game is good, and should be bought
Pros:- Better and kind of worse item system
 You are no longer trying to double tap the bottom screen of the 3DS to use an item
 Instead you hit Select or whatever the keyboard control and press A on the item
 The downside to this is the key items and map are also here, mainly the map
 In the 3DS version you could have the map on the bottom, now you have to hit select then go to the map menu
 I already beaten the game 7 times now so I don't need the map
- Better than both prequels
 WayForward know how to make good sequels and this out of all 3 shantae games is so far my favorite
 Longer story
 fair gameplay, not too easy not too hard, it does get harder as you progress etc etc
- Good story- Memorable Characters (nameless npcs are even memorable)- Good Characters (I love all characters, even nameless npcs)- Challenging but not impossible - Excelent Platforming + Puzzles- Funny and unique dialouge
- Wonderful sprite animation- Awesome soundtrack- High replay value (After beating the steam version 3 different times I will have beaten this 10 times)Cons:- Bad for players who do not have a thrill for adventure
 This game does not exactly tell you what you have to do and where to do it
 You have to use your brain and the tiny amount of hints the game gives to find out where things are
 This is however good cause what's an adventure platformer if the game just tells you what to do and how to do it
- Grinding Gems to get items
 The items for upgrades and moves can be way too expensive and useless
 Like I said I beat this game a lot of times, I never used the back kick move, or the back dash
 Back dash being 100 gems (not bad) and the back kick being 400 which is too much for something I never had to use
 Also you have to upgrade your hair strength, whip speed, scimitar, and pistol 3 times which adds up to a lot of gems
 It's not that bad to grind for them but it could of been done better
So if you like Metroid/Castlevenia you will love this game
 The story in this one is more deep than Risky's Revenge and the original GBC game
 It is totally worth the 20 dollars to get
 That concludes this review with the 2 minor cons (one being really minor), I still have to give this game a wonderful score
I give this game a 10/10
Posted: 24 April, 2015
These are the pros and cons I have come up with during my first full (100%) playthrough of this game+ I have never taken so many screenshots in a single game before + Platforming+ Artwork + Soundtrack+ Plot (not just the story
)+ Humour in almost every cutscene+ Death barriers are clearly marked so you know which holes are hidden rooms and which aren't+ Lots of achievements+ Didn't feel like I was missing too much backstory even though I have yet to play the previous two games in the series- Two of the three combat skills you can buy are basically useless compared to your standard moveset- Maps do not tell you which items you have already found (and where they were located) which can lead to excessive backtracking- All the achievements are making my OCD kick inAll achievements acquired update:+ The speed run achievements are quite the challenge and the game rewards you with two "fan-service-y" wallpapers if you can beat it in under 2 hours with any% and under 3 hours with 100% completion
 Completed and acquired all achievements for Shantae: Risky's Revenge update:Pirate's Curse vs Risky's Revenge + More bosses + More dungeons+ Less confusing map system+ Risky's ship and pirate flares replace Warp Squids (much more convenient travel than before)+ Twice as long to complete (not counting Pirate Mode)+ Movements and attacks are faster and more fluid+ More meaningful dialogue and story+ Artwork of characters has improved and looks more like a visual novel during dialogue+ Save files now display %completion and location of last save+ Different attacks do different amounts of damage instead of them all being considered one "hit"+ Better quality and more memorable music (the soundtrack is also twice as long)+ Graphics settings now allow true fullscreen (no black bars or stretch) for 1080p monitors+/- Graphics are more or less the same as Risky's Revenge+/- Weapons and items replace transformations and magic
(I personally like this game mechanic but some people would prefer the hallmark transformations of the previous Shantae games)Shantae (GBC) 100% complete updateIts kind of funny how I ended up playing this series in reverse order
 Now on to the update:Pirate's Curse has many references to the original GBC game
 Many of the songs heard in this game are actually remastered from the old chiptunes of Shantae
 While the original game was MUCH more difficult in terms of travel from one area to the next, I feel like Pirate's Curse was a nice change from most of your troubles being day travel (or rather NIGHT travel when enemies were twice as tough) to more emphasis on labrinths, quests, bosses, and overall story
I still think Shantae is one of the best GBC games out there so don't discount it just because I said Pirate's Curse is better
 If you ever do get a chance, play Shantae (GBC)
 Verdict: Buy it now out of 10Thanksgiving Sale 2016 Edit: Gimme my badge, Steam
Posted: 23 April, 2015
(Note: I fully completed this game on the Wii U, so I have the experience to write a review)Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a 2D Metroidvania Style Platformer with a little bit of RPG sprinkled in
 The game takes place after Risky's Revenge
 There's a spirit of a once evil pirate called the Pirate Master
 His spirit awakens to find out he's capable of taking over Sequin Land, and tries to spread the area with Dark Magic, effectively ruling it slowly but surely
 It's up to Shantae, paired up with Risky Boots, to stop the Pirate Master by going to multiple islands and taking out the areas where he's getting his power
This game is SO much better than Risky's Revenge ever hopes to be
 It has a much faster pace overall, so it never feels sluggish
 Shantae's attack, movement speed, and even the gameplay itself is generally quick, making killing enemies much less slow and tedious, and making the game overall a better, more paced experience
 Other than that, it also has a much more interesting story with tons of character dialog and more immersive character development with funny and witty humor
You aren't limited to one huge area like in Risky's Revenge, but you now have multiple islands to explore, each with their own individual theme and secrets to uncover; also their own dungeon
 It certainly brings a breath of fresh air very often with each of the island's own unique style of puzzles, platforming, and fights
 Pretty much makes the game itself very diverse so nothing is boring
Shantae can no longer dance, but find some of Risky's pirate gear so she is granted more abilites
 For example, she can find Risky's hat to have herself gently float downwards or use wind to go up, or Risky's pistol to solve puzzles and shoot enemies from afar
 You'll find a new item in each dungeon, and they are well worth the journey to get them
 Of course, it also makes the puzzles much more variedThe game is a little more on the RPG side this time around
 Shantae's hair and Risky's weapons can be upgraded, and Shantae can even learn some new moves
 It takes lots of money to get everything fully upgraded, so spend your gems wisely
 It doesn't sound like much, but it's actually alot to upgrade
 There's also healing items that enemies drop, and sometimes even attack items
 You can access all of that by simply going to the item menu and using it, easy peasy
Overall, this game is wonderful, and a FANTASTIC step up from Risky's Revenge
 If you can get this, get it
 It's a wonderful platformer series that has a great, memorable story, and fun, fast gameplay

This game is spectacular
 If you enjoy platforming games you owe it to yourself to try this one out, either on the Wii U or on my personal preference here on steam
The art style is vibrant, colorful and full of life, as are the environments, characters and Shantae herself
 The dungeons and various islands are crafted to challenge your mind and creativity, while offering a wide variety of completely different enemies that don't hesitate to engage you
 As you progress you're granted new items that introduce unique facets to the gameplay
 One delicious layer of cake after another, the sweet saccharine icing of course being the tight, responsive controls that let you play exactly how you need
 The plot is immediately engaging, and the music really psyches me up
 If you were put off by the brevity in the prequel "Risky's Revenge" then you have nothing to fear
 There's a huge supply of content in this sizable, well-polished package

This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer
Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a platformer game which was initially released on the Nintendo 3DS and WiiU
 It's the third in the Shantea series
 I haven't played any of the previous one so I was a little behind on the story here
The game was released initially in 2014 and was ported to Steam in April of 2015
 The 3DS release of this game was actually nominated for the best platformer and was also in the Top 10 games in the Nintendo 2014 survey of fans favorites You play as Shantae, who is a half-genie
 You goal in the game is to save everyone from "The Pirate Master", with the help of her what appears to be long standing nemesis, named Risky Boots
 Throughout the game you will find various different "pirate equipment" such as pistols and cannons, these items are all used at various points in order to progress through the story
 You can also upgrade all of your equipment too to make them more effective
 This game is said to be the biggest in the series in terms of how many locations are included for you to explore
 We also see a familiar mini-map screen you will have seen in Metroidvania style games before
 The actual gameplay is very Metroidvania too, lots of jumping puzzles, thought based puzzles, enemies, collecting jewels and gems to find and chests with equipment and keys in to find
 The game uses a 2D graphics engine, which I can imagine looks pretty good on the 3DS, however it does look like a bit of an emulated game on the PC
 The dialog scenes look nice, but the actual in game graphics are very pixelated, granted some people enjoy that style so that may right be up your street
 I must warn you, this game is not easy at all
 You will die, and die, and die plenty of times
 It may even have you rage quitting at points that it is so frustrating, but you can't help but load it up again in order to move on
 The difficulty curve is very up and down, sometimes you can be going through one level and think its actually quite easy, then all of a sudden you are failing countless times on a specific area in the zone
 Being hard is not a bad thing at all; it's actually something I really look for in a game
 I did have to revert to Youtube videos for hints on how to get past some levels though
A full playthrough of Shantea and the Pirate's Curse took me almost six hours
 Sadly I don't think there is much replay-ability to be had here; once you playthrough it the once - there is really no other reason to playthrough it again
 This is actually a well put together port to the PC
 The developers have gone to the effort of adding full controller support along with a graphically helpful control screen to go along with it
 I would highly recommend you play this game with a controller aswell; playing on a keyboard would be a disaster
 I would recommend Shantea and the Pirate's Curse; but not at full price
 I think the six hours it took me to complete along with the zero amount of replay-ability means you should really be picking this up on sale
 However I did enjoy playing it, it is in no way a bad game
 I am looking forward to trying out the other games in this series now

After achieving 100% in Shantae, and spending 8 hours on the entirity of the game, I can say it was one of the best metroidvania's I've played
There are plenty of powerups, and there are lots of secrets to discover
Also, the only complaint I really have about Shantae is how inconsistent the difficulty is
 For the most part, the game is easy, then once you get to a certain island, IT GOES INSANE, then you leave and it's easy, then at the end it suddenly goes insane again
 I'd rate it 85/100
 It's a solid game, and one that I am happy to have in my Library

In both its visual novel and anime incarnations, Higurashi When They Cry, also known as Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, is revered as one of the greatest horror/mystery works of their mediums
---If I liked the anime, will I like the visual novel
Definitely, without question
 The anime is a great adaptation in two ways
 First, it does not cut out or distort many important plot points, although there are certainly changes
 Second, it makes fantastic use of the advantages of the animated medium to create suspense
The visual novel, however, explains several key plot points better than the anime does
 Most importantly, the visual novel portrays paranoia and confusion far better than anime ever could
 The visual novel really gets you thinking like the protagonist thinks, whereas the anime just has you experiencing what the protagonist experiences
Chapter 1, Onikakushi, covers the first four episodes of the anime
---Two main things set Higurashi apart from otherwise similar horror titles
Slice of Life CamaraderieHigurashi in its entirety isn't just a story about how bad things happen and a bunch of people die
 At its core, it is a story about overcoming adversity (although the first chapter is very much about bad things happening)
Higurashi's early slice of life scenes reinforce this overarching positive theme
 They depict a group of friends who participate in cutthroat competitions on a daily basis
 They struggle and play dirty to improve themselves and each other
 It's very much not your usual slice of life
ParanoiaParanoia plays a huge role in the first few chapters of Higurashi
 Many characters deeply involved in the series of murders have yet to be revealed
 Two main characters have yet to be introduced
 The protagonist, and by extension the reader, doesn't know why or even what is happening
 In this way, Higurashi is quite similar to the visual novel Chaos;Head (excuse me, ChäoS;HEAd)
 An unreliable protagonist tries to survive and figure out what the hell is going on
You could say that Higurashi is to horror visual novels as Amnesia: The Dark Descent is to horror video games
---Higurashi is phenomenal bang for your buck in terms of both quality and quantity
 It is very much enjoyable as a standalone work, but also leads into a greater overarching story
 What are you waiting for

Higurashi is a classic VN
 It's had anime adaptations, its own manga series, OVAs, live-action films, even a third-person shooter
 The cult surrounding this VN undoubtedly made 07th Expansion what it is today
 How's the Steam release, then
Returning players will notice that the English translation has been entirely redone
 MangaGamer opted to do away with the subpar 2009 official translation and redid all of EP1's script from scratch
 The results are satisfying; characters speak naturally, inner monologues don't feel stilted, and wordplay is more sophisticated
MangaGamer contracted an artist to create new character art to replace Ryukishi07's original work
 Again, the results pay off as the new character sprites look professional and do a great job at conveying the emotions of the characters
 I personally prefer the new art to the old, but purists can switch between the two by simply pressing 'P'
 The Steam version of Higurashi runs on an entirely different engine than the original, an engine which allows the game components to be modded at the players' leisure
 Players who wish to use the PS2 character art, PS3 backgrounds, etc
 are easily able to modify Higurashi's files to do so
 The new engine doesn't interfere with normal gameplay at all, and returning players might not even notice it
All of these make the Steam version one of the greatest ways to experience Higurashi, but how's the story itself
 Engaging, to say the least; first-time players often find it difficult to stop reading once they've invested time and emotion into the plot and characters
 Each chapter ('Onikakushi' being one of eight) is roughly 7-9 hours in length, so you'll definitely not feel cheated for content by the time you finish
Higurashi has earned its acclaim/notoriety
 If you ever wanted to get into VNs, this is one of the best you can start with

A psychological horror game/novel that doesn't include jumpscares
Not many games like that exist today
EDIT: There is one or two scenes in the novel that made me jump a bit but I think i am in the minority there (The 'LIES
' scene in particular)
Posted: 17 May, 2015
Finally, a game that teaches players valuable life lessons such as:- Stay away from little girls with cleavers
- When in a town full of crazy people, try not to be home alone
- Don't do cocaine in phone booths

Higurashi When They Cry is a series that spans 8 Chapters (or Arcs) in total and Onikakushi (Spirited Away by the Demon) is the first of 8 chapters
 The Steam version is a remaster of the original Sound Novel which includes the option to switch between the new sprites or the original sprites
The story in itself is a solid horror/thriller experience, it throws you in a shoe of Maebara Keiichi, a recent transfer student to Hinamizawa and his experience with his friend
 The beginning of the game shows you an all-happy go round group of friends and kyute girls that as they go about doing kyute things
 As the story progress, Keiichi discover that there was a bloody murder in Hinamizawa
 Confused and curious about what happen, he started asking his kyute friends about the incident but they keep denying it happens, which makes Keiichi starting to doubt his friends
 The story starts to get interesting around the end of Watanagashi festival, I won't spoil the rest of the story but expect a crazy ride after that
If you have already watched the anime, then you must read this VN (I know I said Higurashi is a Sound Novel, but blame Chunsoft on that one) since the anime butchered a lot of content from the VN
 There is no choice to be made since this is a kinetic VN and no it doesn't have voice acting even though it was promoted as Sound Novel (blame Chunsoft)
 Also this is just the first chapters/arcs of Higurashi so expect to shell out another $6 for Tsumiboroshi, Meakashi, Watanagashi, Matsuribayashi, Tatarigoroshi, Minagoroshi & Himatsubushi
 Based corporate :^)Closing this review, I recommend any oldf*gs out there (like myself ;-;) who have played Higurashi before to play this one not only because of the updated sprite, but also unifying all your Higurashi in one place (Steam) is nice if you didn't have the physical copy of all Higurashi
 If you're interested/new to the series, love horror/thriller genre or have watched the anime and still feel that it's lacking, pick this up and sate your horror/thriller need
Also, Umineko f*cking when MangaGamer
Posted: 18 May, 2015
As someone who watched the anime before playing this game, let me preface this review with the three words that resonated in me the whole time I went through this
So
Much
Content
This remastered sound novel contains the first four episodes of the anime
In rough numbers, this is about an hour and a half of content
As someone who can read rather fast, this sound novel took me almost nine hours
This wasn't two hours of good content and seven of boring padding, but rather nine solid hours of enjoyment
Seeing the thoughts behind Keiichi, the main character, change as the novel progresses, seeing more of the average day life that the cast goes through prior to Watanagashi, and just in general seeing things fleshed out so much more than in the show was wonderful
The atmosphere was perfect throughout, and the character sprites were much more engaging than I was expecting as someone new to sound novels
My only real complaint was the total lack of choices throughout
I know through the friend that got me into this series in the first place that later chapters will have them, but it was surprising to both of us that this one was completely on rails
This didn't detract from the story, but did feel a little disappointing
So, do I recommend this experience
Whether you've seen the show, or want to see what all the fuss is about before looking at either the rest of the novels or the show, I most certainly do
For $6, you get a book complete with backgrounds, character sprites, and sounds
You get a fantastic first chapter of a fantastic story
You get heartwarming moments, heartbreaking moments, and a few truly creepy moments
What more could you ask for
Posted: 27 January, 2016
First, a brief note to the uninitiated:This is not a pleasant story, whatever the screenshots may have led you to believe
 Beneath the veneer of a cheesy, run-of-the-mill school-comedy lies a cruel world of madness, terror, and violence
 Major characters die routinely; sometimes on-screen, sometimes off, but never in a peaceful manner
 Nonetheless, it is a highly compelling experience, and very rewarding if you can endure to the end of the series
 If this intrigues you, feel free to read on, but those looking for nothing more than a stereotypical anime-harem-style rom-com would do well to look elsewhere
 Higurashi may resemble that on a superficial level, but this is a series that delights in letting the reader think they know what is going on, even as it brings the façade crumbling down around them
 Now, then
Each chapter of Higurashi When They Cry is a seemingly self-contained story comprised of three distinct parts
 The first is indeed a light-hearted slice-of-life comedy, centered around a mixed-age group of students living in a remote Japanese village in the early 1980s
 Made up of four local girls and the protagonist, a boy who just recently moved into town, this group spends their time going to school, playing a variety of games together (usually under the threat of ridiculous and embarrassing penalties for losing), and generally goofing around
 This relaxed, easy-going atmosphere  filled with ruthless card games, lunchtime chopstick duels, and treasure-hunting at an illegal garbage dump  appears at first glance to be utterly inviolate; a tranquil, serene place where nothing tragic could ever happen
Inevitably, this atmosphere begins to sour, as the locals' carefully hidden secret  a four year long string of deaths and disappearances  starts to show through the illusion of a peaceful country village
 Seemingly straightforward on the surface, with little reason to believe they may be connected, these incidents nonetheless have some disturbing things in common
 The victims have some connection  albeit increasingly tenuous ones  to an old, hotly contested dam construction project
 And each of these events occurred around the time of an annual religious festival held at the village shrine every June
 While most try not to speak of them, particularly to outsiders, or pass them off as sad coincidences, these incidents invariably give rise to rumors of a conspiracy within the village to purge it of those perceived as enemies
 Or, among the superstitious, of the curse of an angry god
Finally, the proverbial dam breaks and events begin to spiral out of control in a sudden, rapidly escalating drama of suspicion, violence, and murder, suffused with a pervasive psychological horror that straddles the line between a supernatural malice and one that is all-too-human in nature
 Personal secrets are dredged up and sins exposed, showing characters the reader thought they knew in a very different light, while eerily echoing centuries old regional legends that speak of this place not as a quiet, insular community, but rather as a monstrous village of man-eating demons  oni, for those into Japanese mythology
 Who is at fault
 Is anyone at fault
 Could the crime have been prevented
 Do you even know what the crime is
At times switching gears so seamlessly that you hardly notice and at others doing so with a deliberately jarring abruptness, these three elements combine together to gradually build an atmosphere of tension, terror, and inexorably approaching tragedy, even as they challenge the protagonist and reader alike to uncover the truth of what exactly is happening in this tiny mountain village
Higurashi When They Cry is a visual novel in a stricter sense than most, known as a kinetic or linear visual novel that lacks player choice, as opposed to the more typical form of visual novel built around branching storylines
 Gameplay amounts to the same kind of player interaction that can be experienced by reading a traditional mystery novel  gathering clues from the narrative, building and revising a theory, and attempting to reach the correct solution before the author reveals the answers in the end
As previously mentioned, each chapter is essentially self-contained: covering roughly the same period of time; utilizing the same pool of characters (regardless of what may have happened to them in a previous chapter); and featuring the same general situation
 Yet each story also differs in various ways
 Different characters and their backgrounds take on the central roles
 New characters are introduced and previously minor ones are expanded upon
 Some plot elements are explained away, while others are unveiled for the first time
 And ultimately, a new, unique chain of events is brought about, leading to its own distinct conclusion
 Later chapters toy with this formula in various fashions, one notable way being by changing the protagonist to tell, or retell, the story from a different character's perspective
 All together, this allows the reader  through repetition, of sorts  to gradually start to distinguish the events that are fixed, that are certain, from those that can change, what is real from what is illusion, and try to piece together the truth, perhaps even finding the miracle that leads to a happy ending somewhere along the way
With each chapter seeming to have no bearing on the events in any of the others, this series can be understandably confusing for new readers, who will have difficulty working out exactly how the disjointed pieces are meant to fit together
 In the interest of aiding those not yet in the know I will offer this, decidedly non-spoiler, interpretation: consider each chapter as a particular path from a Choose Your Own Adventure book or branching-style visual novel, only written as its own individual story and given to the reader in sequential order
 While not entirely accurate, this viewpoint should allow new readers to reconcile the apparent disconnect between chapters until such mysteries begin to be revealed in the series' second half
Higurashi is also described as a sound novel, owing to the developer's emphasis on the use of background music and sound effects to help shape the atmosphere of each scene
 This is done exceedingly well, although many of the better pieces of music start to appear in the later chapters
 At the same time, the developer, 07th Expansion, and the game's author, Ryukishi07, are very much the Japanese equivalent of an indie studio, with Higurashi being their first project
 Nowhere does this show through more than in the graphics
 The background images are largely ordinary photographs with a filter over them and the original character sprites, while expressive and charming in their own way, are fairly amateur work
 The character sprites can be switched out to updated, more professional ones in the options menu, if so desired
There are some minor details regarding the translation that could use some polish, but overall it is a thoroughly engaging affair alternately capable of making the reader laugh out loud and sending a chill down their spine
 After letting Onikakushi and Watanagashi sit unplayed on my desktop for months due to time constraints, I just recently powered my way through both available chapters, promptly reread the entirety of the manga series, then played Onikakushi through again
 I'd have done the same for Watanagashi, but my love for Higurashi's quasi-sequel Umineko has flared up and stolen away my attention for the time being
As a long time fan of the When They Cry franchise, my only complaint is that the next chapter isn't out yet
 If you have even a moderate tolerance for what one prominent video game critic refers to as Anime Bull****, I cannot recommend this series highly enough
Welcome to Hinamizawa
Is anyone else hearing footsteps behind them

Ironically enough, good horror can often serve as an escape
 When you're fully immersed in a state of mind where your attention is drawn, or rather forced towards a source of fear and terror, the unpleasantness serves to pull your mind away from a life of deadlines, chores and unfulfillment
 In that sense, it's a lot like drenching bland food in plenty of hot sauce - sure, your mouth may sting to high heaven, but at least you don't have to taste what you're eating
In that sense, Onikakushi drew me in hard
 The premise isn't anything that original (an insular country town with a dark history harbours an unpleasant secret that you stumble upon by chance) but the execution is exceptional
 The degree to which it pulls you into the psychological state of doubt, terror, helplessness, paranoia and delusion is so extensive that I experienced horrible acid flashbacks at no less than four points in the story
 By the time it was over, I felt tangible relief
The main plot takes a while to get going - the buildup takes up almost half the story and is composed almost entirely of dumb anime tropes, if that sort of thing might turn you off (personally, I'm fine with it), but the payoff is well worth it
 I'd highly recommend this, especially at so cheap a price

Analogue: a Hate Story certainly isn't billed as a feminist game
 It's creator, Christine Love, cheekily describes it as being more about transhumanism, traditional marriage, loneliness, and cosplay
 Maybe that's true
 All I can say is that as a man, the game struck me as unflinchingly feminist

What would you do if you were to wake up tomorrow, having been thrust into a completely foreign society
 Being greeted by your "new family" who tell you what to say, what to think and even how to feel in order to not violate their social norms
 Being told that your identity, the place you carved out for yourself in the world, is long forgotten, but that they already have a new role good and ready for you
 That your dreams no longer matter
This fate, among many others, is one of the gears in the complex machinery that would end up removing all traces of life from humanity's great hope, the huge pioneer starship Mugunghwa, in Analogue: A Hate Story
In this unconventional sci-fi/mystery visual novel, you are a space investigator hired to find out the truth about what happened to the Mugunghwa and how it got lost on its mission to settle foreign planets
 Arriving at the wreckage and linking up to the ship's computer, you are greeted by the archival A
I
, who offers to help you sort through the letters, reports, and diary entries of the people who lived on board before a mysterious catastrophe killed everyone
 You quickly learn that very little is as it seems, and there are so many personal motives wrapped up in the situation that actual honesty is hard to come by
The presentation in Analogue sets up a computer-y atmosphere with abstract backgrounds and actual in-story explanations for things like the multiple choice "dialogue wheels"
 The effort put into the art is largely concentrated into the two highly detailed on-screen characters, who delight with a plethora of poses and facial expressions to convey their emotions
 The soundtrack, especially the character themes, features recognizable melodies (sometimes in several variations) realized in a consistent style that works extremely well with the atmosphere constructed by the rest of the story
For most visual novels, the user interface tends to be an afterthought, and only rarely is it a point of contention in a review
 Analogue, however, eschews the medium's tradition of a branching linear narrative and forges its own path in regards to navigation inside the story
 In essence, every piece of text that you can find is one of the "files" of the ship's archive that you can view in any order, and you can also talk to the A
I
 or drop back to the command-line interface at any point
 This provides the player (a term that I use deliberately, because for Analogue, being a mere "reader" really isn't enough) with a high amount of agency that few visual novels choose to provide
 It also creates a proportionally high number of opportunities to fail, for example if the player is not quick on their feet when it comes to using the computer terminal as the situation requires
This sets up an interesting contrast with the main character's agency in the plot
 After all, many years have passed since the events you read about and there is no way to influence the outcome or to save anyone
 The only thing you can do is to find out the truth
 There is a present-day plot involving the main character and the two artificial intelligences that still reside on the ship's computer, but the focus is on the mercilessly unchangeable past
The people on the Mugunghwa lived in a surprisingly traditionalist society with strong codified gender goles and rampant classism
 The members of the noble families all struggled for power, but no one seemed to heed the big picture or pay any mind to the ship's course
 It was a troublesome situation in which a little girl from hundreds of years ago was awakened from cryostasis
 Her family hoped that the Pale Bride might bring them salvation, but what could she do to find her way in a society that was so radically different from the one she knew
 You notice early on that she seems to be somewhat of a focal point for the events on board following her reawakening, but how does she factor into the eventual genocide
 What caused the ship's undoing
 And why do the two A
I
s despise each other so much
Analogue is, at its core, a mystery story
 While it is still a visual novel and you can gloss over most of it without really internalizing it and still get to the end, it is a more rewarding experience to actually untangle the relationships of the characters and understand how their motivations propel them to do what they do
 There aren't really any mechanics in place to support this endeavour, other than the family trees that the A
I
s helpfully provide you with
 I found that my enjoyment of the story increased significantly as soon as I started taking my own notes with pen and paper
 I would encourage you to do the same, because otherwise it is very easy to lose your perspective as you wade through the countless documents, each colored by its author's perceptions
Bit by bit you wrestle the truth from the ship's archives, and slowly you piece together the puzzle until you are able to see the full picture in all its horror
 All aspects of it, from the psychological through the sociological to the interpersonal themes of the story, paint a drab picture of loneliness and despair
 It poses the uncomfortable question of whether the ship's population as a whole might have been beyond salvation for who knows how long, doomed many years before the finale of the story; whether the event that put an end to all biological life on board was merely the logical conclusion, much like you would turn out the lights when you leave an empty room
 It's hauntingly honest in its depiction of the darkest depths of the human soul, and after completing the story for the first time, it left me with a strong feeling of unease about what any one of us might be capable of, given the right circumstances
It does also have its lighthearted moments, and even though visual novel connoisseurs will find many tropes and clichés conspicuously absent, Analogue coquets with the expectations carried over from its genre siblings in certain moments, such as when one of the A
I
s invites you to dress her up in various outfits
 It's no stranger to fun and there is plenty of clever humor to be found in the data logs and the A
I
 banter
The overall execution in this VN is so congruent and polished that any perceived shortcomings almost have to be rooted in personal taste
 Some people might not care for the minimalist presentation, others might have preferred a more linear way of storytelling, yet others may have their reasons for not wanting to read a story where gender inequality is a prominent theme
 But judged on its own merits, I can find nothing but praise for Analogue: A Hate Story within me
 It's unique and interesting, and if you think that a mystery visual novel with deeper than average gameplay mechanics might intrigue you, I can recommend it without reservation

This is ancient history now, but for a while, back around 2005 or so, there was a perception, largely created by a single translation group, that the "visual novel," a format of linear text adventure that grew out of the Japanese PC games scene, might actually have something to offer beyond cheap titillation
 They chose short, indie works like narcissu, Planetarian or OMGWTFBBQ, melodramatic stories of finding that last emotional connection in the moments before your early and miserable death
 And then they pretty much stopped doing it (at least for free), because, hell, translating this stuff is a pain, and that was the end of that
Analogue feels much like the promise of those earlier works
 Written in English by a native speaker and skilled writer, with a great sense for how to use the interactive features of the format to really draw you in, in a way that "an ordinary book" can't
 It's smart, somber, and complicated; it's a well-told story, and not just "for video games
" And really, I just have a thing for simulated terminal interfaces
Posted: 27 October, 2014
I will start off by saying that I am a great lover of Visual Novels and games of the sort
 I will admit that coming into Analogue: A Hate Story, I was fairly skeptical and I wasn't sure what to make of it
The only real negative was that I found the game did not make it very easy to get into and I felt like the user interface was a little bit unclear in sections
 A factor that I have no doubt would initially put people off
Little did I know that later on I would come to the conclusion that this game is worth every second I invested into it
 The story is incredible once you have managed to piece things together and after some time you begin to learn new things and discover new secrets
 The level of depth and thought that has gone into the creation of this game is incredible and I would reccommend everybody to play it
 There are some fun little additionals which are added into the game through the use of the command centre, which is a nice little addition which I haven't seen implemented in too many others
At £6
99 it is incredibly reasonable for a visual novel and there isn't really a good excuse not to buy it

There's no doubt that Steam has been flooded, for better or worse, by visual novels as of late
Now, don't get me wrong, Indie titles are great, but amidst the endless stream of "waifu"-bait visual novels (VNs) you'll see here on Steam, I think you'll be hard-pressed to find many decent stories with an intriguing plot that aren't about getting in a girl's pants for an affordable price
 That's par for the course when discussing visual novels, but that's also why I tend to trust VNs from well-known studios/devs, because at least you know you'll get plot while playing VNs of acclaim like Clannad, the Grisaia Trilogy, or The Devil on G-String in exchange for their premium price
But, let's rewind time back to 2012, when Gangnam Style was top of the charts around the world and every tween and their literature teacher was dying to see Shaky Camera: The Movie The Hunger Games
 In this archaic age of yore, there were, quite frankly, no good visual novels on Steam, save for one: Christine Love's Analogue: A Hate Story
 Back then, I wasn't sure how much story ten bucks could really buy, but boy I was surprised
Analogue eschews all the teenage high-school setting jazz you'll see in 99
9% of visual novels out there
 Instead, it opts to tell the fate of a ruined colony ship, the Mugunghwa, in a decidedly sci-fi setting
 It does this with considerable polish
Analogue's presentation is simple, nothing more and nothing less required to tell its story, letting you explore the lore of the ship's mysterious downfall at your own pace as you literally read through logs like the investigator you are supposed to be
 At the very least its more interactive than half the VNs on the market, with a very entertaining minigame thrown in halfway through the story
 Now then, you can hold off on impulsively buying those tempting 11 Anniversary Lootboxes in Overwatch since for those same ten bucks, you get a substantial story and can brag to your friends all about the "Joseon" Era of Korean history
And at the end of the day, what's more important
 Getting yet ANOTHER Tracer legendary skin or knowing what "Joseon" means
 You be the judge of that question
Just uh
don't blame me if your 10 bucks gets you neither of those, in the end
Pros Absolutely riveting plot Cute AI girls Different outfits on a whim for Cute AI girls More game interaction then smashing "ENTER" every 10 seconds Stop a nuclear explosion with your hacking skills A feminist game that makes sense You can achieve the impossible dream every indecisive teenage Light Novel main character wishes they could make by quite literally cheating the systemCons No voice acting, but that's completely fine Relatively short, but there actually is a sequel so more playtime there too I guess Learning about how unpleasant people from the Joseon Dynasty could be is disgusting, but that's the point Not that I care but its based off of Korea and not Japan so you "purists" may have some beef with that
No but seriously
 Play Analogue

Do AIs give you feelings
 Do you like women
 How about making straight people uncomfortable
 All these things and more are available in Analogue: A Hate Story
Posted: 31 May
You should really play this game
It was one of those things that just stays with you, and you keep thinking about it the rest of the day after youve played it
 Its also not that long I got 98% completion in, according to Steam, 2
8 hours
 So its more than worth the investment
There are two stories here
 The frame story is that you are sent as part of your job to go through the records of a recently rediscovered lost ship/space colony that has been gone for hundreds of years
 You head over and start sifting through the log files with the help of the ships AI
 The second story is what actually happened on the ship
 The setting is simultaneously a future dystopia and a past dystopia the frame story takes place more than a thousand years in the future, while the secondary plot takes place six hundred years before that
Its hard to describe the game without getting into spoiler territory, but Ill do my best: the gist of the secondary plot is that on this space colony, some unspecified disaster caused major social and educational regression and an extreme population reduction that ultimately resulted in the establishment of an extremely oppressive patriarchal society in which women rarely are allowed to leave the home and are often married off as young as 12 or 13
 A young girl put in stasis before the disaster due to an illness wakes up hoping that a cure has been developed, only to find the world has gone to hell
The game is simultaneously a reflection on the horrors of the past a particularly disturbing post-game authors note lets you know the circumstances are based very heavily on actual customs of Feudal Korea as well as a warning about where we could head in the future
 The girl wakes up and tries to tell her new family about her illness by emphasizing how thin and pale she is, but all the men hear is a womans whine and all the women hear is bragging about good looks, which would sound extreme if the exact same thing hadnt happened to me in the past
 Its an examination of the ways women survive in such an oppressive society, and what happens to those who dont fit the mold
The final reveal of the girls storyline was something I saw coming by the time I got there but was hoping wouldnt happen all the same
The gameplay itself was clever, if simple
 The navigation was freer than you usually get in a VN, as the interface is of a computer system you can explore more or less however you see fit as the AI offers commentary though the AI will dole out information based on how you interact with them so the story itself it ultimately nonlinear
 In addition to reading snippets of the ships logs and chatting with the AI, theres also a command input console where you can type in whatever you please to the ships computer
 I thought the puzzles involving the commands were interesting enough to require some good thought while also logical enough to be solvable on your own
The weakest part of the game to me was the ending of the frame story
 The story itself is somber, serious, and tragic, but the AIs end up flighty, silly, and almost like caricatures
 Like, after everything thats gone on, Hyun-ae suddenly turns into terrible tsundere and decides shes in love with you and wants to get married
 What
 The LAST thing she should be interested in after what shes seen is some kind of weird relationship with a stranger
 The tone shifts from torture and oppression to some kind of parody with no warning whatsoever, and its like she just forgets what you were looking at
 Its jarring, but also comes off as though the game doesnt take its very, very serious subject matter seriously at all
 Oprression and mutilation destroy lives
 CAN I BE UR WAIFU
 Just wat
In the same vein, I thought calling the best ending a harem ending was ridiculously tacky
 In a story where women are literally being forced into harems, just what the hell
 Is it supposed to be a joke
 Why is that something to joke about
 Is it some weird attempt at meta-commentary on VNs
 Wrong place, wrong time
So yeah, the last five minutes or so of the game are bad
 Theyre just bad, theres no way around it
 But overall
 This is an engaging, emotional, tragic story with a message that hits close to home, and I really recommend it

This is a visual novel that does not overly rely on anime tropes, but instead draws from the darker points of Korean history, places the plot in a distant transhumanist future and uses this seemingly incongruable mishmash as a setting for a social commentary
 While the game has been called feminist, I would actually say it goes quite a lot beyond that
If you are interested in sentient AI's, dark family dramas and human rights issues, you might enjoy this strange little gem

An interesting and heartbreaking interactive fiction game
 Explores some pretty deep themes - sexism, being queer - in a sci-fi colony ship
 Well done
Posted: 16 February, 2014
I bought Analogue: A Hate Story on a lark
 It was on sale, and I was bored, so I figured I'd give it a shot
 I'm a big fan of the science-fiction and transhuman genres, and Analogue seemed to offer a bit of both
I was not prepared for what this game had to offer
Perhaps calling it a "game" is a bit generous
 It's an interactive novel, with almost no action sequences to speak of
 The closest you'll come to any sort of twitch-reflex or quick-time events is typing into a terminal while an angry countdown clock stares you down
 But still, there are choices to make and consequences to pay, with five potential endings - four of which can be carried right into the second game, Hate Plus
Don't go into this game expecting action and excitement
 If you're looking for that, then you're in the wrong place
 But if you enjoy a gripping tale of political intrigue, psychological horror, and surprisingly dark themes - then this is absolutely worth the price of admission
 Don't let the cute, anime-inspired artwork fool you
 This game is absolutely for adults, and not because of any sexual themes or nudity (although there IS a bit of the former)
If there's anything to complain about, it's perhaps the usual drawback of an interactive novel
 It's relatively linear, fairly short, and light on replay value
 Oh, sure, it's worth trying for the different endings (most of which require their own distinct play-through), but you'll still be forced to read a lot of the same letters and dialogue
 And, while the writing is absolutely fantastic, it still gets repetitive the second or third time through - especially once you've learned all of the twists and turns that the story has to offer
But still - if you're into mature, psychological tales of intrigue and murder, then this game is absolutely worth at least ONE play-through
 You won't regret it

"Hey, this game can't be worth $60, especially since I've seen every twist DR can throw at me
After the first trial

For any potential Customer out there, look for Reviews that don't focus on the ending - which will be hard given the Majority of negative Reviews focus on it
It's controversial given the fact that it can be interpret in many ways and many people missed some clues/hints, making them think the wrong thing
 I mentioned it before because I am legit annoyed at the fact that people review a game badly because they didnt like the ending
PRO- Most of the Characters are well written
- The game is always 2 steps ahead of you
- No seriously the amount of Plot-twists will change the way you think about cases
- Art + Music is p gud
NEUTRAL- It is not recommended to play the game as the first Danganronpa Game as it references the first one heavily, and the second one more lightly - However it wont stop your enjoyment of the game for around 90% of it
 If you are looking for an order on how to approach the series, I'd recommend: DR1 -> DR2 -> DR3(Anime) -> DRV3
- The game can hook you pretty badly
 What this means is that it's time consuming, and, if you dont have enough self-control, might start feeling like a chore to play
 If you start investigating, you dont wanna end because you dont wanna leave on a cliffhanger - then you cant end on the trial itself, because you wanna know who done it
 That's how you spend 4-5 hours in a session
- It reuses the Danganronpa formular
 As expected
 Some people find that annoying or boring while others don't mind it
 This only affects you if this isnt your first rodeo
CONS- The price
 The game is excellent, however 60 Bucks for it are kinda on the limit for me
 The game has an average time of around 40~ Hours to complete + has content that you MIGHT wanna check-out after that
- The port isn't the greatest
 The Team is patching the Issues slowly, however there are still some problems - like Fullscreen being problematic, sometimes inputs not being registered or slight FPS drops
Overall the Game is fantastic, and Id go so far as to rate it the best in the entire Series
 It ironed out some kinks and issues of the last few and had new fantastic twists to go with it

You should play the two first games (Trigger Happy Havoc and Danganronpa 2) before playing this because this game contains major spoilers for the first two games
If you've enjoyed the first two games, then you should like this new installment for the most part
 Gameplay is the same - people get murdered, you investigate crime scenes, and solve them in a class trial
 Now as for the overall story, I won't mention any plot details, it's better you go into this game blind and judge for yourself
 However in my opinion, although I enjoyed this game, the 1st Danganronpa (Trigger Happy Havoc) is still the best overall

 If you're playing on Steam/PC and using a keyboard/mouse, make sure you launch the Configuration Tool to select the keyboard layout before launching the main game (you can't switch in-game)

Time to watch all my favorite characters die
 Again
 For the third time

Product received for free
Target Audience:
Danganronpa or Story based Fans
Summary:
This continuation of the series is exactly what the series needed: more of what made the franchise one of my favorites over the past several years, but with enough uniqueness in this game to make it stand apart from the others
 I'm cutting right to the chase: the emotional rollercoaster this game puts you on is huge: and it's masterful in playing with your strings into getting you to react one way, only to pull you in another
 All the characters here are worth getting to know and understand, all the plots and cases are unique and have something to offer, and it's got some of the best gotchas in the series
 After playing the entire game, I was just left breathless on what it had pulled, and what it had put me through
 The series improves on the gameplay with small additions like the mass panic debates, along with the addition of the lie mechanic that actually adds some strategy in how you go about things in the case, and rewards those who pay close attention
 While I still wanted more out of the investigations, and some of the games fall flat over the long haul (Psyche Taxi), the gameplay has improved overall
 Small touches to the presentation have been enhanced, and the overhaul of the UI is WELL NEEEDED AND APPRECIATED CAUSE ITS AWESOME
 Yes, I'm praising the UI, deal with it
The post-game mini games are really fun and heavily addicting
 It's one of the highest scored games I have ever played in my own personal rating scale, and frankly I have to give it up to Team Danganronpa here
 They did not play it safe
 They could of: but they didn't They went for it
 And they knocked it out of the park
 Thank you Team Danganronpa for once again proving you know what you're doing
 Video Review:

v=d0rJYeQ87yk Lists: Positives:
Fantastic writing that is wound just the right way
 Enough flexibility to allow for you to guess whodunit, but connected enough that all the plots points connect in some way
All the characters actually mean something
 There's no Yasuhiro type character this time around, at least not in my mind
 The Writing
 Just the writing as a whole
 Brilliantly written
 Uses humor to balance out things nicely, and not keep you in despair the entire time
 Best first case in the series
 Several contenders for best cases in the series
Characters: Gonta, Kokichi, Miu  3 of my series favorites here
 All of the characters are great, but those 3 stand out so well
 Plays on series veterans expectations well, causing tons of misdirection and keeping you guessing
 The addition of the Casino actually gives a nice change of pace
 Case logic actually makes sense, and a lot less occurrences of evidence being presented that stretches too far to make a point
Twists are what you want: they make sense, and yet are just
well they are fantastic alright
 UI vastly improved with non-symmetric presentation and an eye for style, while minimizing space needed
 Presentation is inconsisent: but inconsistent for a reason
 Every element serves a purpose, and is clear on why they did
 Plays to the games strengths
 Everything is connected and my god they did such a good job in this area
 Lie Mechanic to skip parts of the trial really works and rewards those closely paying attention, while still making sense
Great voice work on both Jap/Eng
 Kokichi's english actor is the star here
 Just
fantastic range
Music/Sound design on point as always
 Cases feel more unique this time around too
 That ending
 No seriously, that ending
After-game mini game with board game/dungeon crawling RPG is addicting
 Really addicting
Extra mode with board game allows the series characters to interact with each other and it's pretty cool seeing them do so
Pretty much the entire game, if I haven't made that clear here
 Negatives: There will be a case that will divide people in how it's executed
 It's well written and all, but the way it goes about things may not work for everyone
The forced lie mechanic sections can be hit and miss, and does require some sense of disbelief with some characters
 Some times the localization feels like it's too
out there
 It still works, but once in a while you'll sit there going wait, what

watched all my favorite characters die again, would recommend
Posted: 27 September, 2016
pros:- visually appealing with cute art - interesting story- nice music that isn't distracting or obnoxious and matches scenes well- more than one possible ending- strikes the perfect balance between being spooky and light-hearted- likable characters with charming personalities/interactions, including npcs- multi-dimensional: solve puzzles, play a mini-game, explore the mansion and unravel a mystery, rescue mission to save your friend, etc- possibility to earn achievements- halloween and fairytale themes throughoutcons:- short gameplay- small map
 the game pretty much takes place entirely inside the mansion, which is large (5F if you include the dungeon) but is still just one place
 the story still feels complete, but it would be cool if we could explore different areas more, even if it were just the house we live in at the very beginning- puzzles are interesting but not particularly challengingYou can tell that the developer put a lot of care and effort into this game and it is very enjoyable to play- to the point that I immediately tried getting a different ending after finishing my first one
 In my opinion, the fact that this game is free is reason enough to overlook and even justify the cons I listed
 I really recommend giving this game a chance
