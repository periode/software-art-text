												I really don't undertsand the approach they were going for
You make a game about the second world war, the deadliest conflict on planet Earth till this day, 60 million human beings died in some of the most painful and brutal ways possible
But you're too afraid to include swastikas and the segregation and sexism that existed at the time? I mean, you put WWII in your game's title, but I feel like Return to Castle Wolfenstein is more historicaly accurate
-Zero historical accuracy, which we were promised for at least the campaign
-Delevopers censoring the brutality, sexism, racism, and the symbology of this game
-The voice acting for the Germans in this game sounds like someone typed that trash into google translate and copied the audio wav
s and used them in the game
-The characters in the plot of the campaign are extremely boring and forgetable
-The function of weapons in this game is far from how they truly operate (feels like none of the deveoplers actually fired any of these weapons at a range prior to developing them in game)
-The multiplayer makes me want to kill myself, enough said
I usually make parody reviews, and try to make people laugh, but I feel like this really needs attention

												This game's title is a disgrace
When I saw the initial trailer,  I was actually pretty hyped and thought that this might be a good game
Well, it's the worst CoD I've ever played
And it's not even so because the gameplay is bad
It's just that this game pretends it's set in WWII, when it's not
First of all, please save me all "this is just a game" talk
If you call a game WWII, and say you'll try to keep it authentic, you do it
Not include stuff that's totally out of place
--> black female soldiers--> fighting for Wehrmacht--> in London--> wearing american helmets, because apparently the devs don't care about creating an even remotely authentic feelingWhy not make ACTUAL WW2 maps??? London?? USS Texas?? Why?? What was the thinking behind this? Were there too few locations to choose from? Jesus Christ, what's next? New York?When I was a kid, I learned a lot about history from games like Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2
Kids playing CoD WWII will spread false knowledge
This is the first CoD since MW3 I spent money on, and definitely the last
This franchise needs to die

												Definitely not worth full retail price
  CONS:  - Campaign levels are incredibly short
60 minutes and I had already completed 5 stages on hardened - Enemies are all deadshot, even behind cover at any difficulty (difficulty only changes the rate at which they shoot you with 100% accuracy)
Hell, they are even accurate when blindfiring from cover
- Because of how accurate enemies are at any range with any weapons, mounted weapons are really fustrating to use, especially madatory mounted weapon sections where you absolutely can't dismount the weapon you are forced to use
There's no cover, and you  can't take cover 
Worse still, the gun requires a somewhat lengthy reload after just 50 bullets (some uses a cooldown system)
- Characters are pretty forgettable in all honestly compared to something else like Brothers in Arms, COD 2, or even Company of Heroes Tales of Valor
-  Ally
Useless (can't shoot for sheet) and annoying
Screaming "MED PACK READY BRUH" "GOT YOUR AMMO BRUH" every few seconds
- Microtransactions on a full priced AAA game
Solely cosmetics or not, just NO
- Settings between SP, MP and Zombies   DO NOT   carry over between each
So you'll have to manually set all of them again (i
e if you fine tuned your SP settings, you gotta do the same for MP and Zombie)
It's a hassle
- Bugs & errors (e
g error 4128)
- Hackers everywhere
Reporting them doesn't seem to help either
 PRO/CON  - Can't complaion about the visuals
It's not bad, but its nothing to rave about either
I won't go into nitpicky details on ulgy textures, but as a whole, so long as you're not going out of your way looking (i
e zooming in at a particular rock) for it, the game looks and runs just fine
- QTE
Not a fan, but not totally adverse against it either
Some QTE sequence require you to move your mouse in a circle (kinda like telltales games I guess?) and there are some variety of different buttons to press, so its not just smash X button all the time
- HP regen, I don't like it, but at the same time i don't not like it
I'm confused, it does what it does, but it doesn't feel as "fluid" as something from say, Dying Light, S
T
A
L
K
E
R, Half Life and Halo
I'm guessing that the slow animation to heal is for balancing purposes (i
e you can't just heal in an instant) but then again, I have played game with healing animation and they don't feel as off as this
It's not bad, but its not  good  per se? Idk its hard to explain
- Enemy AI aren't exactly stupid as they know when to try to flush you out while flanking you and blindfire as you try to advance towards them, but they do really stupid things from time to time like throwing a bomb that bounced back and killed themselves or "taking cover" right infront of you (and the cover is facing the wrong way)
- For a game that prides itself alot on "historical accuraries", there are sure loads of jarring historical inaccuracies, even on the very first level alone
But I'm not really complaining since some of them are beneficial, like german units using weapons they weren't suppose to have (e
g " troops "Sten guns", historically speaking, german made ones were called the MP 3008, and it was avaliable ONLY for the Volksstrum, not the Wehrmacht or any branch of the military, even in desperate times
The MP 3008 was literally a really crap copy made in haste to arm fanatical civilians
)  PROS:  - Sound designs are pretty good
they feel heavy when they need to be and ambience have its moments of tranquil breaking into a furry of bullets and explosions
- Zombie and MP are okay (zombie is really good imo, had always wanted something similar to COD WoW zombies for a while now), nothing much to shine or bash on
Aside from the absolute bs that is the microtransaction (and how they've impliment that degrading patent it into COD WW2), it does what it does
Though I'll admit it is really weird seeing a negro nazi running around
- Amazing settings design for PC, wide variety with helpful screenshots to better explain what each settings does at what setting (i
e Texture at med, high, extra)
Something like what you'd see at geforce
com- You cannot truly just ADS and empty the entire mag in a single burst with laser accuracy (atleast in my experience)
There's a very noticable weapon spread at range even while going prone
Hipfire is pretty inaccurate aswell
- Auto presets for lefties
- Surprising range of weaponary- WW2 themed (like finally i suppose)TL;DR: It's fun, but the asking price is too high for the content avaliable (Get it for 30 USD or less)
If you're buying this solely for SP, don't bother (even with discount) its incredibly short and unmemorable
The set pieces don't even feel grand or pumped (like COD WoW Downfall  or COD2 Ponte de Hoc)
Now I really wish there was a "conditional thumbs up/down" system because I'm recommending this game, for its base game content value,  AT 30 USD OR LESS  (absolute max I'll say is 40$ and that's really pushing it)
Buying the full edition that comes with the season pass and bonus map is really ludicrous for the average joe earning average wages (also if I were a parent,unless wealthy af, dropping 60$ or more on a game that isn't that content filled would make me squint at best and straight up no to buying at worse
Adding microtransaction ontop of that doesn't help either)
Oh and microtransaction is still crap, regardless if you're opening a box in private or a box that appears from the sky for everyone to see
edit: some spellings and making it easier to read
edit2: added some extra details about how the microtransaction is earned/worksedit3:   welp hackers are everywhere
   Details about the microtransaction (as I understand)  Something I believe lots of people are interested in knowing about
I'll put it in bullet points so its easier to read- They're all cosmetics (as far as I know)
Emblems, gun skins, helmets, emotes, icon, etc etc
- You can earn lootboxes via the game's "orders" (functionally speaking, they're pretty much challenges)
- What are "orders"? At the HQ, there's a place (the game will guide you on this) where you can go and choose which orders to activate
They range anything from "kill 500 enemies" to "win a TDM match"
Now, each "orders" grants a different reward (e
g XP reward, lootboxes, rare lootboxes, crafting materials), you can see what reward are tied to each "orders"
They come in daily (24 hours) and weekly (7 days) cycle which will refresh and load new "orders"
Upon completing a challenge, you have to go manually redeem it (HQ or loadout section)
  IF YOU DON'T IT DOESN'T REGISTER AND YOU LOSE YOUR POTENTIAL REWARD WHEN IT REFRESHES NEXT CYCLE   (subject to change imo)
- Crafting materials? Yes, like Overwatch, you get crafting materials (armory cred) through various means (e
g dupes from boxes, challenges, hourly/daily "mail" which gives you some amount of free crafting materials) which you can use to buy stuff and rank/prestige perks this which lets you buy weapon/class upgrades stuff
You can  technically  buy your way to unlock every weapon, perk and streak specials) via lootbox free exp (each rank gives 1 rank point)- Everyone can see what you get if they're around you, and any  Epic  quality stuff that was unboxed in the HQ (you have to unbox it in the HQ as far as I'm aware of) will be announced on the bottom left as a text (e
g Unforseen Lemonquences has unboxed an Epic item!)- When you open a box, nobody can "steal" it (since its considered opened the moment you decide to open one in a sub menu)
But they  CAN  troll you by blocking your screen (standing between your character model and lootbox), thus preventing you from taking screenshots to showcase what you got
- Lastly, yes, you can use real money to buy these lootboxes

												I played Single Player mode for 15 hours


which only would have taken about 7 if my save games hadn't been deleted every time the game crashed
I played through the first five missions 4 separate times due to this
Not enjoyable
Historical and military accuracy were terrible
Russian sub-machine guns in Western Europe? PVTs continually calling a Tech Sergeant "Sir" without getting chewed out? Many, many German uniform screw-ups (all officers won the Iron Cross, apparently)
I'm not talking about black or female soldiers, but the rest is laughable
			
Posted: 3 November
												Absolute tat, totally different to the beta, which I enjoyed, historically inaccurate (PPSH used by germans on D-Day?) just definitely not what was promised from trailers, interviews or anything else developers said pre-launch
Just go and see if anyone is playing WaW rather than this
Requested refund after 1 day

												I


I don't know where to begin
 I wanted this game to be good, really I did
 I have played the Call of Duty franchise from its beginning to its terrible, terrible demise during the Black Flops series
 Campaign-No, you cannot skip the cutscenes
 You WILL have feels for these characters, you WILL (but probably not because they're all lacking depth)
*-All those awesome moments in the trailers?  That's all of them
 In the whole game, right there
-The missions?  I expected more
 D-Day, sweet!  Oh, it's over


okay, I guess I was done anyway
 Kinda missing COD2 here though


 A car chase, okay


pretty sure you've done this before, COD, but this works
 Sneaking around a German compound, sweet!  Finally something


oh he saw me?  Wearing this German uniform, he saw me and is apparently upset about this
 Meanwhile all of his buddies are having conversations without actually moving their mouths or talking, that's cool Activision, I'll go elsewhere to fulfill my attention to detail
 A flying mission, sweet
 DEFINITELY did this one in one of the earlier Call of Duty games, but hey, we're repeating everything, so why skip this one
-Physics
 Did we forget this was a thing?  I just watched a Stuka divebomb a tank and pull a 270 up in a matter of maybe 10 meters
 I can hop for days, and hop I will, because


MULTIPLAYER-If you're not hoping or dancing or dolphin diving, you're dead
 Forget what I said, you're already dead, but you respawned so, no, wait, you're dead again
 Because the guns that you have are outmatched by his custom-pro-mod-why-the-hell-is-this-even-in-this-game-gun
-Okay, I'm a huge fan of games that people die when you shoot them, maybe I'll give Hardcore a try


 M1Garand shot, center mass, no kill, he returns fire with a pistol, instant kill at 20 meters
-Kill cam
 Watch it, watch the muzzle of the weapons jump, but the bullets go straight
 Just watch it
-All gripes and complaints aside, this game is an AMAZING


airsoft simulator
ZOMBIES-look awesome, now we know where all the dev's time went
**-It's Nazi zombies


did you expect differently?  There's some new zeds, bombs and fire and stuff
 1 map, hope you like it
-Honestly thought it was good my first run through
 Prologue was cool, read reviews about it being more linear and adventure-y, but once you've opened all the gates, it's a circle map with the old tried and true tactics every game
 Not my flavor, but a solid improvement still
Here's to getting TBagged by that black female German with an American helmet using a Russian PPSH in Gibraltar
*Edit:  You can, apparently, skip the cutscenes
 Lesson to be learned - do not remap your keys, no matter how bad you want them to make sense
 You'll miss things like skipping cutscenes and not getting stabbed repeatedly by that one German nobody wanted to shoot
**Edit2:  MORE INFO ON ZOMBIESTLDR:  Game looks great, plays like a Burger King toy, feels like a hot-and-steamy on a history book, has zombies

												Very short, alot of qtes and on rails sequences, cliche as hell story
Game is very good looking though, and runs at around 100fps on my 1060 on high settings
Same same call of duty multiplayer, certainly not worth full price, pick it up when it hits $20 or less for a bit of fun
			
Posted: 3 November
WARNING- I mean -CARIFICATION!A lot of people are commenting on my short playtime for this game
Some are claiming that its impossible to evaluate all the game's elements in just under two hours- which is true
I did not play every single multiplayer game mode and map or every single campaign mission
I only played some
However, its certainly possible to get a feel for a game by trying out a few things and not all
That's what demos do
And especially in games like CoD, if two or three multiplayer game types and maps are bad, the rest will probably be uneventful and boring as well
And if not, well, its certainly not worth paying $60 for that one game mode and/or map that's fun to play, is it?Onward to the Review!I played the first campaign mission, "D-Day", which was pretty cool in and of itself
It set the tone very well
As someone who loves history, it was a very somber experience launching off the boats and onto the beaches of Normandy
Granted, the campaign is not exactly historically accurate, but the opening still serves as a somber reminder of the hell on earth that was World War II
At least it did for me (I appreciate history)
But then I played mutliplayer


The game claims to have returned to the CoD roots
I can honestly tell you objectively, from an unbiased perspective, this is false
Of course, there's no space jumping and wall running, but it truly feels like Black Ops 3 with a World War 2 skin; which I suppose is fine for many people who liked Black Ops 3
I liked it, but I don't like a World War 2 version of it
I suppose I may have been expecting something drastically different, since I remember World At War being dramatically different than the CoDs that came after it
But either way, I did not enjoy the multiplayer experience
Allow me to explain: Multiplayer 1) The map design was fairly bad
I mean, the maps were dang beautiful to the eyes, but hideous and disgusting to the gameplay experience
Plus, there's only 8 maps
2) There's a new social space which is kind of


not really necessary, I guess? There's not really a point of it
Just some place you can hang out with people and


watch them gamble their real world currencies for a chance at winning a chance to obtain good-for-nothing and worthless items
3) The customization is rather poor, which is something I've heard many people say so far
Many complained about this in the beta, but it seems they didn't really listen to the feedback in this regard
4) As mentioned above, there's loot boxes in this game
That should be no surprise; as soon as Activision heard about this cancerous money-making scheme, they immediately jumped on board
I hate microtransactions in the loot box form, as does the majority of the gaming community
Gambling real world, hard-earned money for a chance at winning some worthless cosmetic or game-unbalancing weapons and cheats is disgusting and, quite frankly, immature for a studio of this stature
Loot boxes in free-to-play game models make sense
Loot boxes in a $60, supposedly fully finished retail game is absolutely unacceptable and ruins the already unbalanced gameplay of modern Call of Duty games even further
Zombies Now there's the Zombies mode, which was actually very well done
I applaud the designers behind this iteration of Zombies
Its not perfect, but its very exciting and brings back that stressful experience we all came to know and love in World At War and the original Black Ops
As much as I loved it, its certainly not worth buying the game for
I could never justify purchasing a $60 video game solely for the horde mode it offers
If the Campaign was much longer and there were more than two Zombies maps at launch, I    might    consider it
I'm not really going to talk much about Zombies, because its essentially the same model as its always been, but darker and with more grit
I will go over a few things, though
1) The Zombies are more animated, and less


undead, if you can believe that
When I say animated, that's not necessarily a bad thing
I'm not talking about a cartoonish appearance
They're far from that
But they seem like more than just mindless undead humans
They're more, "lively", if you will
Which is


not really a zombie
They also speak
Not English of course, but German
Which is also quite strange
But its not like these things are too much in your face
For most people, including myself, it doesn't break the experience
2) This is still very much Zombies
Its just not "Nazi Zombies" from World At War, which is what many of us wanted this to be
There's still perks, easter eggs, etc
Really nothing has changed gameplay-wise
Many of the perks are generally the same but with new icons and names
Some are new, though
I'll leave those for you to discover yourself if you decide to purchase this anyway
But please, save your money
Campaign  Normally the Campaign is the first thing I do in any first person shooter
I play games not for the multiplayer experience (although I most certainly do get my money's worth on the multiplayer modes), but I mainly purchase games for the single player stories they offer
This game certainly does well in it's singleplayer mode
The campaign is (generally for the most part) nearly an accurate representation of how dark and horrible the worst conflict in human history actually was
In fact, it surpasses Battlefield 1 largely when it comes to the "War Is Hell" mood that both games tried to set
Battlefield 1, which I enjoy far more than this game, did a horrible job at realizing the realities and tragedies of war, making its stories about being a fantastical War Hero performing stunts that were sometimes even near superhuman, whereas this game does it very well, for the most part
Its no Private Ryan, but it comes close
Summary Call of Duty: World War II is a fair attempt to recreate the World War II experience for Call of Duty, however, it fails to shake off the dust of the previous Sci-fi games, which had lead to the series' downfall
Its still extremely reminiscent of the latest games like Black Ops 3 and Infinite Warfare, and fails to return to the roots as it claims
Its almost as if this game's multiplayer experience is Black Ops 3 with boosting disabled and a WW2 appearance, with nothing else changed
While the Campaign and Zombies modes are certainly very interesting and would be entertaining to play for hours on end, they too fall short of being worthy of the $60 price tag
The Campaign is fun and interesting, but very, very short
The Zombies mode is great, but its not worth buying the game just for Zombies right now
If you loved Black Ops 3 or Infinite Warfare, you'll probably love this, but if you're thinking this game returns to its roots and is reminiscent of World At War or the first three CoD games, think again
This most certainly does not return to the roots of the franchise despite the claims, and thus, I do not recommend this game
Do not spend your hard-earned money on this quite yet
Have patience and wait for either a sale, or wait until there's more content
Unforunately, though, the latter will be very irritating, since you'll have to purchase the Season Pass to get the later content, which furthers my point as to why this game is not worth it
			
Posted: 5 November
												So, I was previously writing a review with a very positive rating
After reviewing my own review and also purchasing a copy of this game for the playstation 4 (please note my steam copy was a gift and I already fullfilled my ps4 preorder long before this) I will be rating this game negatively
I implore you read my full review as some of the issues that lead me to the negative rating may very well be opinionated
This is also mostly a review of the game itself, I will discuss PC specific topics towards the bottom
May Contain Campaign Spoilers
CampaignPros*Very well crafted, lots of nice scripted events that make the world feel alive
*Removes the overdone health regen system for a more dynamic squad system
*Has some very nice memorable moments making this a very enjoyable campaign
*Has segments of some of the greatest battles of WW2 with near photorealistic graphics
*Heroic events can be pretty intense in higher difficulty levels
*Engine overhaul allowed for mild level destruction which can be awesome during certain missions such as the tank one
Cons*Very cliche, overdone story
The tension between your squad mates is very predicable and you don't ever get enough screen time with any one member to actually form an emotional attachment to
*Relatively short, looking through my achievements I did it in about 6 hours and I didn't really rush it
*There are only 2 sections in which you aren't doing generic soldier combat, would have been nice to get another tank or plane mission
*I had a hard time getting immersed into the world when there was a major lack of attention to detail, an example being swastikas feeling insanely forced as if they were never planned to be in the game before the backlash
*After your squad medic is captured you no longer have access to a substantial amount of health packs, this can make the game insanely tedious while playing at higher difficulty levels
*Only real reason to complete the campaign is a simple helmet you receive in multiplayer
MultiplayerPros*Familiar Call of Duty gunplay, if you enjoy this like I do you will feel right at home
*Nice maps, while this is subjective, I found the maps themselves were fun to play, in certain situations (more info in the cons)*The inclusion of MWRs quartermaster system
*Supply drops are currently not able to be purchasable with real world money, and are obtained through game time and numerous challenges which ensure you get plenty of them sometimes (More info in the cons)*Some of the most iconic guns of ww2*War is a very underrated and unpopulated game mode
Cons*The headquarters, the headquarters is akin to the tower in destiny
In this game it absolutely does not fit
Many features that would fit just fine in its own menu are only accessible through the HQ
Meaning if I wanted to something simple like changing my emblem I would need to load up the whole entire HQ, run across the place, and access yet another menu
As of the writing of this review the HQ also consistently fails to load you into a lobby with other places making it just this empty area with nothing of interest to do
It just seems like an afterthought and only exist to sell people on supply drops
*Gun Balance is very poor and the gun roster contains few unique weapons
All but one sniper rifle are bolt action that kill from the chest up, 3 smgs that are high fire rate short range weapons, and 3 smgs are slow firing ones meant for medium range
Most of the ARs besides the M1 and SGT contain too few bullets and have damage profiles to similar to these two to actually be of use
There are only 4 shotguns, a decent pump action, a weak double barrel shotgun another weak double barrel, and a weak semi automatic
Most of the LMGs fire to slow, contain way too few bullets, and slow your player down so much it would be stupid to not just use an AR
Only 3 pistols, 2 of which have the same damage profile and the other being a machine pistol with insane recoil and 10 bullets
*Supply drops make a return in this game
As of the writing of the review this game does NOT contain any supply drops with weapons that alter gameplay
However, there are several bugs with them
Supply drops are constantly disappearing
(I have earned 7 and only been able to open 2) The developers took a step back and removed the “recently obtained” menu making it hard to find what you actually own
Sadly, unlike MWR the game does not contain any camos in supply drops
Pistol grips are what has replaced MWR camos for the bulk items in supply drops, they are very uninteresting and can only be used on 2 weapons
Like in MWR, once you collect a full “set” of quartermaster items, you earn a special item, usually a reskin of a weapon
However, it is obvious some of them were overlooked and special attention was paid to others
Some of the SMGs have full weapon overhauls and look fantastic while others look almost the exact same with their stock modified, which you don't even see in game
*Spawns are god awful
I have always been a lucky person and never had issues with spawns in previous call of duty titles, so if you thought those were bad you are in for a bad time here
You will constantly spawn within earshot of another player even on some of the larger maps
In smaller maps it is possible for an enemy to spawn directly beside you
*While the maps themselves are good when played properly, good luck finding a game where people play properly
With call of dutys return to boots on the ground combat, comes the flood of players who will prone in odd doorways, sit in the back of the map not contributing to the team, and flank you from BEHIND YOUR OWN SPAWN
Power positions on most maps have to many entrances to make them worth defending and add in poor spawn systems it can make for an unpleasant experience for the majority of your time
*The way penetration damage is handled is very different in this game
I do not have the 100% direct from the code numbers, but I have had situations where the M1 Garand (a 2 shot kill weapon) took 6 shots to kill through a thin sheet of metal
*Flinch is back and worse than ever, nothing is more infuriating than either getting your gun kicked up so high you miss every bullet, or causing another player to flinch giving them a free accidental headshot
*Map count is the smallest a cod game has shipped with
The base game contains 9 basic multiplayer maps and 3 unique maps for the war game mode
This brings the total map count up to 9 maps, but seeing how 3 of them are only accessible in a single game mode with little replayability it is mildly disheartening
*Despite cods recent addition of more 60hz dedicated servers, the way the game is coded to handle latency means you will still be dying around corners that you were fully behind on your own screen
*Some real attention to detail would be nice, clan tags on your weapon that look like they are written in comic sans is a prime example
*If you can think of a bug that's been in every call of duty release up until now, your gonna be in familiar territory
Launch servers still suck, certain challenges are bugged, the new item indicator is still bugged, certain maps fail to load on PC sometimes and so on
Due to steam character limits my zombies and PC related sections was removed, you can view them here https://pastebin

 Hello fellow gamers and curious consumers, take this honest but probably biased and most importantly very unprofessional review as a friendly advice  Performance  - The developers promised that the PC version was being developed in parallel with the other versions and their words seem to hold ground, I am seeing almost limitless settings to choose from and the game performs very good on my rig (i7 4790 + GTX 970) on High-Very High mixed settings
Surprisingly the Anti-Aliasing can only be set from Off to High, it doesn't specify what you are choosing (FXAA,SMAA), same thing goes for Shadows which can only be set from Very Low to Ultra High, I am not seeing TXAA or PCSS GameWorks and honestly I am glad about it
You can also customize the HUD Presets where you can turn off the damage numbers for example and generally reduce the amount of feedback you are getting on your screen
There is love displayed for the PC version and I am very thankful about that :) Controls  - I am playing as usual using Mouse and Keyboard and the controls seem responsive


at least for me, as for controller support I don't know much (since I play almost all my games using M+K) other than there seems to be Xbox controller support



as expected I guess? Gameplay  - It is the first time Assassin's Creed goes RPG and loot-based (I don't count Unity and Syndicate despite them apprehending some watered down RPG elements) and I can't say if this is good or bad for the series since taste is subjective so you be the judge, however the game hasn't fully departed from its stealth and action-adventure roots
The previous Ubisoft mechanics are still present, some of them implemented in their own interesting and different but yet familiar way
For example the horse carriage riding from Assassin's Creed Syndicate is present as a chariot racing minigame, or the drone/owl as your pet eagle etc
There are some minor bugs and glitches here and there (at least what I have encountered so far) but in my book they are acceptable for a game of this scale and they don't really bother me that much
However the AI needs some improvement because it can be really dumb sometimes and ruin the immersion for me, also some of the animations are weird and stiff, nothing game breaking but it would be nice if these issues get sorted out with a future patch
Combat  - Now this is the biggest change in Origins, the combat has shifted from animation-based system (or unscripted QTE if you will) to a hitbox-based system and I repeat, taste is subjective so whether you will enjoy or hate the new combat system is up to you, but I can tell you this much, it plays and feels better than it looks
Story  - Ubisoft over the last few years have been submissive (unfortunately) to a certain demographic and have been delivering some really lame story writing and shoving completely unneccessary modern political beliefs down our throats
As a result of this, the ''charming and intriguing mystery'' as I like to call it that the previous Assassin's Creed stories built is gone
I don't use this term often but I cringed through my entire playthrough of Assassin's Creed Syndicate and Watch_Dogs 2, both having the weakest writings in Ubisoft's catalog and their Disney bubbly characters with their over the top forced positivity made me sick, but hey Ubisoft, it's fine



you do you
I brought all that up because in this game they have ditched the Disney part at least, with Bayek being more mature, reliable and interesting than the previous sitcom toddlers Jacob and Marcus, anyway I won't go deeper than what you already know and have seen so far on YouTube due to spoiler issues so I will leave that experience and judgement to you
Graphics  - Amazing graphics as expected with no downgrades whatsoever, what was shown on E3 is delivered here
A joy to look at that beautifully rendered draw distance, and the beautiful color palette choice makes this game look absolutely stunning
Ashraf Ismail and his team have really created the best looking Egypt themed game on the market currently
Soundtrack  - I don't think the Assassin's Creed franchise has ever disappointed me in this regard, from trailers to ingame, the music has always been beautiful, eargasmic and most importantly fitting, and Ubisoft has delivered the all said points with this one as well
Thanks for taking the time to read this review but I would strongly recommend you read more detailed and professional reviews regarding the PC port (benchmarks), check gameplay footage on YouTube to see if the game appeals to your taste and make up your own mind instead of having your opinion swayed by ''game journalism-ing''

												I thought the other reviews were being hyperbolic but this game really does suffer some serious performance issues
Maybe its the DRM, I don't know but this is the first game in a long time that I've seen give my PC problems even at lower settings

												The game itself is brilliant from what I have played but I stopped before my CPU consumed itself
I'm getitng 60% CPU usage on the Title screen
I-5 3
2ghz Quad Core8GB RamGTX 1080 Asus Strix (Oc'd)100% usage on all cores and 40% usage on GPU
60 FPS in the desert and 30 fps in towns and cities
			
Posted: 31 October
												VMProject and Denuvo using 40% of CPU while we are playing this game haHAA clapChange that and I'll change the rate
Edit: Running on:intel i5 4690k @ 4
3GHzMSI nvidia GTX 97016GB ramSamsung SSD 850 EVOThe game is going on high settings except for AA wich is on low(in the cities go from 45-60fps), is sad to see that my gpu doesn't even go further 80% of usage and 70% power while the CPU is running all the time at 100%, not even BDO take that much CPU
Well, the game is really good on itself from what I've played, if it wasn't for that excessive use of CPU everybody would be happier, and if everybody is happier, that mean more sells wink wink
			
Posted: 31 October
												Bought and refunded
Listen to everyone people
My computer has more than enough for this game and my Fps was clipping down to 15 every 5 seconds or so
After about 15-20 minutes in the lag and black screen flicker was too much to even get to enjoy playing the game
SO;Do not buy till they fix the anti piracy software (by removing it) because it will run like trash
The game it self seemed kind of fun for the five minutes I got to actually enjoy

												I'll just say it, I love this game
If you've played Assassin's Creed games in the past, you pretty much know what to expect here
It's not doing anything we haven't seen in other games or pushing any boundaries, but it's a ton of fun and well worth your time and money
Pros+ Beautiful world set in a truly interesting setting (ancient Egypt)
It's a joy to get lost in exploring
I've had many times where, on the way to a quest objective, I've run off to see what's going on over there and suddenly it's an hour later and I'm no closer to my quest objective
+ Open-world stealth done well, though not quite up to the outstanding MGSV
I love assaulting forts, taking my time in picking off all the guards one by one
Using Senu (your pet hawk) to scout is a neat way to prepare your infiltration
+ A TON of things to do
Side quests are (mostly) well-written, varied, and fun
The main story so far (I'm 20 hours into the game at the time of writing) is intriguing, and I'm excited to see where it leads
+ RPG-lite mechanics
XP from kills, loot, ability points for new skills
Again, nothing too complex but it fits the game well
Cons- Overall it feels like they played it safe and went for accessibility over complexity
Like I said before, there's not much new here that we haven't seen
- Melee combat can be clumsy
I appreciate that they went away from the Batman style to a more dodge and position based combat system, but it doesn't feel entirely


finished
- Occasional graphics glitches
I had to restart the game once, and it went away
- Uplay
If you've enjoyed other Assassin's Creed games, and like the idea of exploring ancient Egypt, pick this game up
			
Posted: 4 November
												So this installment is about as close to perfect as you could expect
With about 35 hours in the game so far, I personally believe this is the best of the series
The map is immense, the graphics stunning, and the story line is quite awesome
 There are so many side quests, it's hard to decide which one to do next
I found the underwater swimming easier to navigate this time around as well as the character movement
 In short, it is very hard for me to find a solid complaint about this game that would not sound like nit-picking
 
Posted: 14 September
												Let's see:-Game releases in Early Access with a lot of promise-As it does Larian constantly outdo them selves with updates-They vastly increase the complexity of the AI-Improve the progression in several ways-Give us two well developed and deep extra skill trees-Create a truly grand undead race with interesting mechanics-AGAINST ALL ODD include full voice acting for a game with the amount of dialogue-And include a fully orchestral soundtrackAnd the reviews for this masterpiece of a game are going down because some Russians got salty over the translations being delayed a bit
This game lost it's Overwhelmingly Positive rating simply because they didn't manage to translate all of the 80,000 or so lines of dialogue in time for the release
Seriously
EDIT: To everyone asking, the game is FULLY voice acted, every NPC, no matter how insignificant has a voice
That is somewhere in the area of 80,000 voices lines, where a lot had to be recorded 8 times for each one of the player voices

												I'm 48
 I've been playing pc games since before Zork
 This is the best RPG I've ever played
 This is what, as a kid, I had always hoped these games would turn into
 Great Job!!!!  Great game
			
Posted: 19 September
												I'm 72 years old and these have been the best 20 hours of my life
EDIT::After playing through the game multiple times, including finishing it on Honour Mode, I have to say that my opinion of this game is even higher than it was after those first 20 hours
After finishing this game, it feels like my life is complete and there's nothing left to live for
This may be the last game I ever play and review I ever write
I would like to thank Larian for filling a void that has been plaguing me for more than half a century
I found the main story as well as every single side quest/story to be fun and interesting
There are no boring fetch quests as far as I can tell
How you handle side quests and whether you complete them or not 'does' affect the ending; as such, they could be considered extensions of the main story
(You could be unsatisfied with the ending if you just rush through and skip things
)You can build your characters any way you see fit and almost any build is completely viable
If you don't like the way you built your characters, just wait until you complete Act 1 and you can rebuild them any way you want as frequently as you want all the way up to the very end of the game; this is very good for testing new things out
By the end of the game my main character was a fire breathing Geo/Pyro battle mage that wielded a fire staff, used Warfare skills and showered my enemies in meteors with some necromancy for physical damage in case the enemy had too much resistance to those elements; she was pretty godly
I plan on trying a solo Honour mode run next with a similar but more diverse build
(I love the lizards!)For me, the best part of this game is the combat
It's extremely well done and very fun
I can't really say any more than what the other reviews cover though
Just know that if a fight seems absolutely impossible, that it really isn't
I've gone into fights where half my party was annihilated before I got to do anything, yet I still emerged victorious
There's always a way to win even if the enemy has you outnumbered and outleveled; just gotta think!Like many reviews state, there are still some bugs
As far as I can tell, they are all minor
After multiple play throughs on multiple difficulties I have not experienced any major bugs
Nothing game breaking and nothing that really affected my gameplay much
The few bugs I've experienced: - Many unvoiced lines in Arx
- Incorrect journal entries
- Sometimes a character would act blind in combat even though they weren't (could't use any ranged skills, couldn't see around themselves, but this was rare and only lasted a single turn
) - Sometimes the enemy AI would derp out and they'd just run around or repeatedly climb up and down a ladder until they were out of AP
- Custom undead characters do not receive the appropriate immunities, such as bleeding and suffocation
(though I don't recall any of my characters ever being afflicted with Bleed


) (Fane does receive these immunities) - Undead afflicted with Decay will not attempt to avoid poison puddles (Not sure if this is a bug or an oversight)
- Altitude does not affect many player or enemy melee attacks
(Entities 10+ meters above can be struck with melee
) But it does affect some skills, such as Dragon's Blaze, Laser Ray, charging skills, Battle Stomp, etc



I think that's about it
I'll add more if I remember them
Some reviews complain about enemies being omniscient and knowing all of your strengths and weaknesses (including whether you're undead or not), which is true, but it's also true for players
Any player with Loremaster on one of their characters can examine any NPC or enemy to gain insight into their strengths and weaknesses
Only one of your characters needs Loremaster
If you examine with someone that doesn't have it, they use the skill level of whoever does, even if that person is dead
(This even works on the final boss, at no point in the game is it unfair that enemies can spot your weaknesses
)So in summary, very fun game, great character customization, great combat, good story, a few minor bugs
It can be challenging in some scenarios but it's supposed to be; that's at least half the fun
I could mention the poor inventory management but countless reviews already cover that
Tip: Carry a couple pieces of +Thievery and +Loremaster gear with you to make sure you can pick any lock and identify any item
There may be times when your base skill isn't sufficient
TL;DR: Recommended, as shown above
10/10 on the Completely Subjective, Arbitrary and Useless rating system

Early Access Review
								You will love this game if


- You like games that don't hold your hand- You like games that allow you freedom to customise your characters and experiences- You like games that TRULY reward exploration and investigation*Legit, if you don't sit there scrolling over the map looking for hidden chests, ladders, ledges, etc, you're doing it wrong*- You like high strategy, turn based combat that rewards forward thinking and planning- You like finding, using, selling or collecting loot- You have 1 or more friends that will play with you
This game shines in multiplayerThe handful of little annoying bugs and glitches are completely and utterly outweighed by how captivating and enthralling this game is


And it's still in Early Access


I see a lot of complaints that the story isn't long enough, or really focusing on the bugs, lets get real
Bugs:- Sometimes your helmet will blink and flicker a bit- Sometimes your characters won't be within range, or have line of sight on a target they clearly should- Accuracy percentage seems to be a bit off, 80% chance to hit is more like 30%; anything under 90% is troubleThat's


About it


Story is too short? Well then play the rest of the game kid
You can speed run the "story" in like 20 minutes if you wanted, the real fun comes from exploring the world and finding everything else there is to do
I honestly can't believe how good this game is for an EA release and I can't wait for the full release come September
Could not recommend highly enough
Things I would like to see in future:- More races
- More in depth customisation options for spells and abilities
Think Champions Online or the Oblivion Spell-Creation
(asking for a lot, I know)- A little control over what armour looks like on your character
- More spells, more synergy between spells
This is already great, but why stop at great!The more points I list, the more I realise I'm just asking for more of the game
Give me more of the game mate

Early Access Review
								If more game developers had HALF the talent and attention to detail that Larian does, the market wouldn't be so saturated with garbage today
Larian is one of the best and the Divinity series proves it
By far one of the best RPGs I've ever played
KEEP IT UP

												I was tired of games that only tests your reaction skill
I was tired of games that say it's 60 dollars, only to have randomized loot boxes or micro-transaction implemented later in time
I was tired of games that were advertised to be wide as an ocean but ended up being shallow like a puddle
Then Divinity Original Sin 2 came out
Each encounter is well executed and designed flawlessly
Enemy design  is varied and leaves my friend and I saying "WTF is that!?" often
Every time my friend finds some epic loot, we cannot wait to identify it to see who can make use of the item
Quests are a joy to do and often leads you to find more quests that's filled with important decision making
Every choice you make has an impact on the world and I have been sent to jail multiple times for making the wrong decision
For $44
99 you are not buying a game but an experience
An experience to truly go on an epic adventure
Fights are never easy but once you learn the satisfaction of besting the enemy combatant that you failed to take down multiple times, you are left leaving for more glory
(Currently playing on Tactician Mode) I am not sure if anyone is going to read this review since this is my very first review with a positive rating (My other review is for Fallout 4 CREATION CLUB so you already know what rating I gave) but if you are looking for a game with challenge, depth, and quality give this game a try
I have been playing this game for over 102 hours and I have a feeling that this is only the beginning
			
Posted: 20 September
												I just bought this game yesterday and today I've already clocked 21 hours on it
I'm a grown man
I have a job, responsibilities, things to do
But all I did was sit in my damn chair in my underwear playing morning to night, stopping only to eat, sleep and use the toilet
10/10 would let this game suck my life away again

												Best strategy RPG in the 21st century
Beautifull story, wicked and funny as hell
Challenging, even on the lower difficulties

Posted: 22 October
												163 hours later, I've finally beaten this thing
It's a beast -- a sprawling grand strategy game full of nuance, lore, and emotionally engaging content
The AI is much smarter now
I had about a 100-hour learning curve, bouncing between different factions and trying different tactics until I really figured out how to play the game
This thing is amazing
I have to put it down for awhile so I can go get the million things done that I've been neglecting, but here are some pointers:1
Gain as much control of your continent as possible, as soon as possible
Make sure you can recruit some sort of troops anywhere in your empire, so you can quickly sprout new armies in the late game
2
Grab as many towns that produce your strategic game-winning resource (scrolls, tablets, etc


) as early as possible
Garrison these towns, and defend them
3
Station armies in your ritual sites before you start the ritual (bad guys show up fast), and have an additional army right outside the gate for reinforcements
4
Don't march armies of less than 20 units
Don't garrison armies of less than 20 units
As soon as you stretch yourself thin, this game devours you
It's better to march three armies from town to town than to try to take three towns with three armies in the same turn
5
What I did, in provinces: Minor settlements: garrison building/economy building/growth Provincial Capitals: Specialty and military buildings
6
Have a plan
Your plan may vary, but here's a good plan: Reinforce the crap out of your starting continent
Once it's nice and fortified, go forth and conquer
It will cost a lot to invade another continent
Don't give in to the temptation to build a bunch of economy buildings in your newly conquered territories
You'll need to build new armies on these new continents, or you'll quickly get kicked back into the ocean
So build some recruitment buildings when you get there, and start up your economic expansion as soon as possible
7
Buying interventions to attack your enemies is expensive and not very effective, especially late in the game
What's more effective is to grab up as many strategic resource sites as possible, garrison them, keep armies there, and outpace the enemy to the end
That said, if the opportunity presents itself to take the other guy's capital city, it's very satisfying
8
It should go without saying, but skill up your generals to buff certain types of troops, and keep those types of troops in his or her army
9
Old Total War tricks don't work (for example: lay seige, retreat when the army inside sallies, army follows you and attacks out of range of reinforcements, you kill that army


yeah, that doesn't work anymore)
10
Squishy troops stay squishy
Abandon all hopes of buffing up your weakest troops to someday be amazing
Build the highest level troops you can afford to build and maintain, and skill up your generals to buff them further
11
It's better to fight them over there, then to fight them over here! Keep your homeland heavily fortified (2-4 armies at your capital city, 2 for early game, 4 for late game)
Maintain a robust economy, so that you can quickly field strong armies, and keep strong armies stationed around your continent
Once you've established the TWWH2 equivalent of Fortress America, send your armies to kill the bad guys on their own continents
Late in the game, I played a continuous game of take three colonies, lose one colony
It sucked losing colonies and generals, but it distracted the bad guys from attacking my homeland -- which they could've conquered if I hadn't have divided their focus
12
Don't forget to trade
Trade is awesome
13
Get rid of all troops and generals you don't need
Use the gold you save to build and deploy armies that are needed elsewhere
14
The game is very well balanced, so doomstacks (19 dragons, etc


) can lose to their tactical counterparts (spearmen, for example)
15
Fighting Skaven sucks, because they constantly ambush constantly, and pick off your armies one at a time
You will love life a lot more late in the game if you just murder them all early in the game
Early on, they're pretty weak
If you let them take substantial territory and get a solid economic base, they'll become a huge pain in the butt
If you can kill them all early without fighting a war on two fronts (again, don't stretch yourself too thin), DO IT
They get truly awful later in the game
And that's all I've got
Good luck! It's a lot of fun
I highly recommend it

												I have been a Warhammer fan since I was 7
As a kid in the mid 90's the amazing world of Warhammer Fantasy was simply out of my reach financially
I had about 20 pewter models and they were not even painted, but boy did I cherish them
I would stare at the big Games Workshop catalog in awe, dreaming of commanding armies in lush battlefields
In Total War: Warhammer I got to play out my childhood dreams of this
The world map is massive, and as a 40k fan at heart I admit to my ignorance of the New World locales
The launch playable races are the Lizardmen,Dark Elves,High Elves, and the Skaven
Each of these four factions has two different leaders to choose from as of today on September 28, 2017
The large amount of quests,missions, and side story content (Some of which is voice acted) is very nice albit a little confusing at times
Currently only Vortex mode is out but I believe a sandbox style map will be available in the future
Unit animations are clearly a step up from the previous title and is quite pleasant to look at during the Chaos of battle
My only gripe so far is the strange AA effect on the trees in the world map regardless of the setting
(Which is FXAA, MSAA 2x/4x)Siege battles, which were nortoriously laggy on Warhammer 1 seem to be much improved and considerably better looking than the first
I even saw some background pillars and arches fall down during the melee fighting underneath them in an Elven city
My GPU is a 1080, and my CPU is a mid-range 4690k@4
6Ghz and I pull around 100fps on the world map, and about a solid 80 in battles
Of course this is with everything on Ultra and 4x MSAA @ 1080p
I really enjoyed the first title, and so far I'm really enjoying this followup
			
Posted: 1 October
												Total War: Warhammer II is the direct sequel to Warhammer I, and along with it, brings in a multitude of improvements from the previous title
The game takes place across four continents, Ulthwan, Naggaroth, The Southlands, and Lustria, each having it's own host of varied climates, unique building chains and factions
Furthermore, each of these continents bring along an individual, unique faction
The four playable factions being the High Elves, Dark Elves, Lizardmen and Skaven
Coming from a Total War perspectiveWarhammer II, similarly to Warhammer I, reminds me of the classic Rome I and Medieval II games, removing the one to one combat held in previous titles and replacing it with what we saw in the older titles, leading to a more varied and exciting combat
Cavalry charges are incredible and really do show off what more powerful cavalry units such can do, ripping through lines of enemies, potentially changing the outcome of the battle
ContentThis is probably the most asked question regarding newer Total War games, and with confidence, I can say that this game definitely offers a large amount of content
The Great Vortex campaign is a large change from the standard domination type victories from previous total war games and the introduction of newer races such as the lizardmen provide a breath of fresh air from the standard spearmen, archers and cavalry, with each race providing a unique way to fight each battle and make their way through the campaign, one example would be how the High Elves rely on more expensive units whereas the Skaven relies on hordes and numbers
Improvements from the first gameWarhammer II definitely takes a step in the right direction in regards to improvements from the first game, feedback has been taken in from the community, with inspiration taken from popular mods such as heroes in higher end garrisons and the ability to colonise anywhere, instead adding penalties such as negative public order when occupying climates that are not suitable for the race
Bridge battles have been added back and the campaign map has been extended to add treasure hunts, rites to buff your faction and specific abilities to each faction, high elves using influence to increase or decrease relations between factions, leading to yourself gaining the upper hand in diplomacy
Furthermore, minor settlement battles, while still fought on the open field, have been improved with new models that have been added to make it look as if it is outside a settlement, leading to a more aesthetically pleasing battle
Graphics, soundtrack, user interfaceThe graphics have been improved from the first game in regards to lighting, effects and textures, though nothing too dramatic that I can notice
The campaign map has especially been improved, with different regions looking exceptional, reminding me of some the improvements some of the mods made to Warhammer I's campaign lighting
The soundtrack is memorable, unique to different races and can really provide an epic feeling to the campaign and battles, credit must definitely be given to the artists such as RIchard Beddow, a massive improvement from previous titles such as Rome II
Lastly, the user interface
While it, of course, retains may of the features from the previous titles, CA has gone out of their way to add improvements that were, not especially needed, though definitely great to have, most notably the ability to change camera settings, designating different speeds for neutral, warring and allied factions
Events are no longer required to be opened up to be seen, though hovering over them in the panel leading to the information being shown and the ability the zoom in directly from the campaign map to an overview are all welcome improvements from the first game
FutureI am especially excited for the future of this game, with newer factions, units and improvements being added in time
No content has been locked behind a paywall such as Chaos for Warhammer I and I personally am excited for new content releasing in DLC, to prolonge the life and my playthrough of this game
Moreover, the well anticipated Mortal Empires expansion, free to users of both games, will combine both maps, introducing new mechanics such as "rogue armies, ranged breath-attacks for all dragons, treasure hunting, encounters at sea, storms, shallows and reefs, a whacking great number of UI refinements and improvements, 8 and 10-slot cities, chokepoint maps and, of course, universal territory capture and climate suitability mechanics
" and increasing the amount of settlements from 142 from the first game to 295 in both games, leading to an extremely large campaign map to conquer
Room for ImprovementsDiplomacy, while improved still requires some tweaking, with factions on the edge of destruction still refusing peace, trade agreements for both parties offering great positives still being turned down being two of the most frustrating
I have also come across one settlement factions fielding 4 armies at once, with no units, thus, were running away and raising more whenever I destroyed one
The AI, while great in battle, could also use some improving on the campaign map, the introduction of the ability to not retreat while in forced march and instantly destroying the army, similarly in a garrison is great, though the AI seems to use force march to stand right in front of your armies, therefore giving you the ability to wipe it out in one fell swoop
Another criticism are the siege battles, they are similar to the first game and thus are similarly, quite boring and sometimes infuriating
Towers still have unlimited range and thus are able to destroy your most valuable units before reaching the walls, one side to attack leads to less strategy involved and overall, makes sieges more of an autoresolve than actually leading
Playing the game some more, I have decided to update this slightly with the fact that siege battles, both in Mortal Empires and in the vortex campaign, are very easily exploitable
This is performed in one main way in which you stick your lord or heroes in front of any artillery, infantry, etc
you have available, and the towers thus prioritise your lord, heroes, taking minimal damage while your artillery break down the towers, thus giving any ranged units you have a chance to pick off the enemies, eventually leading to a mass rout when they lose enough
This is most prevalent when playing as the High Elves, Dark Elves, but also works with the Empire, Dwarves, and any army that has capable ranged units
Though I try to avoid using this strategy, it still shows the TW: Warhammer siege battles need some work
ConclusionWhile Total War: Warhammer II does definitely require some improvements in regards to diplomacy, sieges and the AI for example, it is still an extremely fun and interesting game, adding in new improvements and leading to an overall worth buy in my opinion
*I will hopefully be extending/adding into this review as the game develops

												I really wish there was a better ranking system than Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down from these
 The game is a great expansion on the original TWW
 However, all the new and bright shiny things don't take away from the core problems with the series as a whole and introduces a few new ones
  The long list of grievances will be in bullet point format
*  Building an empire with an ally is still very limited
 Let them grow with you and they will never confederate despite you being over 200 rating with them and being 10+ ranks lower than you
*  The new mechanic added is absolute nightmare if you want to do more than sit in a small territory playing spread sheet simulator (aka Romance of the 3 Kingdoms)
 The first couple rituals are not bad but, after the third they spawn massive 20 stack armies in random spots all over your empire and go on a rampage attacking the most obscure outposts that have nothing to do with the channeling event
 The worst part is you can see how the factions that need to do the hiring are losing out and are definitely not sitting on a stockpile of gold (10K to be able to summon such twinked out armies)
*  There still is no way to broker territory exchanges between allies
 Leaving both people with half completed regions
*  The game is too massive in map size (hard time calling it a con as it feels great exploring it)
Though it will leave you infighting amongst your own race more than you will even encounter any of the others
 Minus some small incursions here and there
 Except during the channeling ritual
*  Garrisons in cities cannot defend lands they are protecting
 Despite them now being 20 stack armies when a chain is fully walled and upgraded
*  Allied AI bee lines for objectives you need for campaign when they can not even participate
The resources for the channeling ritual are not shared between allies, which I can't wait for a mod to fix
*  The worst by far
 20 Stack to win
 There really needs to be a pacing mechanic in which everyone (player and AI) cannot field 20 stack armies until later in the game
 Until perhaps they conquered enough territories to support a massive military complex
 As it stands its whoever has the most 20 stacks is rank one and can auto resolve to victory
 Even adding a mechanic of supply and replacement lines would greatly counter this
 Assigning these routes could allow  for local recruitment bonuses at the front and allow weaker nations to contribute to war efforts by disrupting them with smaller armies in skirmish based scenarios
TLDR - Mods are needed to make this a great game
 As it stands CA did a great job expanding on the TWW universe
 While mods will be needed to make the game truly enjoyable as a game about waging war (much like all their titles)
 While drifting further into spreadsheet simulator in some enjoyable ways yet, they unfortunately don't add to the war experience
 Instead detracting from it

												I expected it to be a reskin of Warhammer 1 with a different map but I was pleasantly surprised by the game, it was a lot of fun and some nice twists in the story, it even made me enjoy playing an elf faction, something I never thought possible
Now I just cant wait for the Mortal Empires DLC to play the Old World map merged in to it

												If you're a Total War fan and you've wanted a fantasy setting to play with, this is definitely worth the money
I had 0 knowledge of Warhammer before coming in to this aside from knowing that it existed via the occasional sighting at comic book stores
I didn't particularly like the art style and couldn't bring myself to painting my own figures
I don't possess the skill or have the time to dedicate to such a robust hobby
I've always enjoyed high fantasy though, and massive LOTR-style battles are the kind of thing I live for
I can genuinely say that I now love the Warhammer universe thanks to what CA has done with this game
I've researched enough lore to probably earn some kind of degree and fought the most intense and climactic battles of any Total War game
I've been playing since Shogun and I am so glad to see that we're still getting amazing games in my adulthood
I do hope we get a mix of historic titles in the future, but the fantasy world they've built in this game is spectacular

												You have found your next 'One more turn' addiction
As a long-Time Total War fan, from all the way back in Rome 1, my expectations were mixed
 Rome 2 was a disaster, and TW1 hadn't clicked with me
 I was almost prepared to write off the series, I didn't think anything could match the old peaks of the series, Medieval 2 and Shogun 2
 Having now sunk a good 40 hours into playing a full campaign, well, color me shocked
 The slump is over, Total War is back, and in all meaningful respects, it has never been better
 There have been numerous major improvements to both campaign and battle mechanics
 Even the tutorial is the best I've seen in the entire series
 If you're a newcomer to Total War games, this is your entry point
The changes to the campaign are signficant
 The vortex rituals, in which you have to strike at the other major factions before they complete them to slow their campaign progress as well as defend your own give a well defined and transparent rhytmn to the campaign and help you craft goals and decide who to strike next
 The biggest change however, for my money, is just that, the money
 In TW1 and much of the previous Total War games, I found my coffers slowing to a drip, and stymying my building and tech progression
 Here however, you get serious cash for defeating enemy armies, and there are numerous shipwrecks littered across the ocean which sometimes yield A WHOPPING 10K EACH
 Enough to build almost any building in the game
 I can't put into words how much this improves the primary campaign gameplay loop
 You get cash injections, you get to do more exciting things
 There's a lot of options to make more money in general, with both hero perks, special buildings, and trade
 The Chaos forces are much less irritating than they were here in TW1, spawning at player defined times through the ritual, as well as being able to fully eliminate the chaos factions from the map without worry of unexpected respawning
 Anyway, I have only completed one campaign so far, and it was quality throughout, even adorned with high quality cinematics
 I'm looking forward to the next
Now, in terms of the battle mechanics, here's where things really get interesting
 Combat is now a many to many relationship
 Observant fans of the Total War series will remember this sort of combat in games like Rome, where you can watch a circle of spearmen all attacking together, sometimes against the same target per multiple soldiers
 Rather than a series of duels, you have a pushing wall of troops always attacking when possible
 I personally prefer this, and I expect many will too
 The battles themselves are thrilling, although the largest battles you may find yourself forced to play them in slow motion to properly micro with a large army
 Still kinda wish they would do the MTW2:K thing and let a friendly AI take over your second or third armies but hey, it's still pretty reasonable
 Oh and artillery are back in a big way, as the elves, you quickly get access to a basic seige unit configurable to be both a shrapnel shot or a singular, powerful shot
 The shots feels satisfying to me in a way I haven't enjoyed since Shogun 2's Fall of The Samurai artillery, which was similarly potent
I fully expect to get a couple hundred hours out of this, and if you're a fan of the series, you will too
 Especially if they fufill they promise to connect the world of TW2 to TW1

												if ur not playing the first one (original fairy fencer f) , then skip that game and just go for this one
there is many aspect that really similar to original one (the whole first half actually)
maybe anyone who have the original fairy fencer f could say this is DLC for additional route (like me) and dissapointed
if u ask is this worth the price? well if ur not play this series yet, then yes if you ignore the original fairy fencer f and go for this one instead

												Oh boy if it isn't a great JRPG Yes i would recommend to anyone who is interested in JRPG and good content story then this game is for you, the only bad thing about this game is that sometimes u can get constant drop on fps and weird graphics when playing on dungeons
Also, take note that this game has lots of farming to do as well especially on gold,wp and exp if u wan to max out everything


Overall would r8 it 8/10P
S
- Play it with a pc controller it has better controls than keyboard :)

												Way better than the original game but my issues is that if you listen/follow to the tutorial instructions, the game becomes too easy
I only hit level 10 recently and all of the mobs are too easy
Mobs either miss me and bosses only hit me for 100 damage max
Might have grinded too much but I only do each encounter per dungeon once, so all of my "levels" come from doing WP skill point increases
I also don't have any of the DLC so I am using the standard gear
If you are alright at being super massively overpowered at the start, then this is the JRPG for you

												If you've played one JRPG from Idea Factory, such as the Hyperdimension Neptunia series, then you already know what exactly to expect from FFF Advent Dark Force
Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force is like an enhanced version of Fairy Fencer F but with more contents
The amount of storyline gets tripled and has numerous of endings
The combat system is same as always but you're able to add up to 6 characters in your party! However, all of the enemies have higher stats just for this occasion, some were too OP
The soundtrack is really incredible especially the songs from the ending of each routes
The story is somewhat predictable but it didn’t bother me too much
Overall Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force is an excellent game with solid improvement over the original game that other JRPG fans will enjoy
Looking forward to the possible sequel!

Top Nep
Free product does not equal biased review
If I put a thumbs up, it's because I think the pros outweighs the cons, but that doesn't mean the game doesn't have flaws (which are written down)
This review pretty much mirrors what I've said in my review of the original Fairy Fencer F game, with some more things on the plus side, hopefully
You'd probably want to read it first if you've never played Fairy Fencer F games before, otherwise just read below
The good- True HD, say goodbye to the (720p?) upscale
It's extremely striking when you do a side-by-side comparison between the old graphics and the new ones
It's not just the textures, there are more flora and stuff overall
Colors are more vivid, and the world feels more vibrant
I won't post any more screenshots for now, I'll let you discover/enjoy the rest
- 60 FPS, stable (if you care about that)
- Whole new story route, and slightly revised story routes for the old ones
- New playable characters
- Party size increased from 3 to 6
- Menu interface slightly revamped (recolor mostly I'd say)
- New easier and harder modes
- New dungeons & enemies
- New story artworks
- Tuned down gold achievement (was 100M in the previous series, which was ridiculous)
- The new, highest difficulty setting can be a challenge if you go commando
- Fast loading times
The less good- Game still suffers from the "Mash the attack button and that's pretty much it" syndrome, albeit a bit less now
I still didn't feel the need to rely a lot on magic, although I recall using it more times than in the previous series
- Criticals from enemies are a joke
Normal attacks = 300, crits = 3000
Logic?When you're going for the 0 deaths/0 defeats/0 retreats stats, it's a real pain
- Elemental mechanics are barely, if at all, exploited in this game, which is a shame
Same thing for the formation feature
- No real incentive to play on high difficulties (higher than Hard especially), since the game doesn't provide any incentive to do so (higher difficulties do not give you more XP/Gold/BP, just "better drops"


apparently
Maybe
)
Enemies on high difficulties are just bullet sponges and all you'll be doing is wasting your free time pointlessly leveling to try to kill that boss that stops your progression
This is probably the aspect I regretted the most with this new iteration
- You'll have to do a lot of new game+ iterations to complete the gallery
Closing wordsOverall, the game left me with a positive impression, although I still feel that most mechanics are just an excuse for the story
But since the latter is enjoyable, I guess that's excusable
If you've never played the original FFF game, this is the iteration to get
If you've played the first iteration and wonder if you should get this one, I'd say go for it
I played the first one quite a while ago now, and I enjoyed coming back to it once again, replaying the story with better graphics, solid FPS, new route and all the stuff
A pretty decent expansion to the original game, for newcomers and returners alike

 Definitely a True Remake from its Original Counterpart 2 hours into the game, the first thing you'll notice is the graphical upgrade
Not the upscaled resolution from the Original game
This game offers a  true native 1080p  support and better textures
(For those who play games in 4K, you would have to wait for mods) As for language


 Englsih, Japanese, Chinese  are available for you to choose from!I'm sure most of the players who played the Original are much more interested on the new routes this game had to offer
Or you are me who just want to revisit the same route and see how much has changed
Everything feels much more satisfying than I expect to be
 Better gameplay, more party members, much more detailed story  (which is quite lacking from the Original) and so much more
For those who are new to the game, I would say if you are looking for a in depth JRPG, this is not for you
It's basically a visual novel with some light JRPG element (Pretty much like Neptunia if you ever play one before) PC Optimization I would say its way better than Megadimension Neptunia
Everything is stable,  no random stutter  (which is most likely the game is using Adoptive V-Sync)
Maximum Frame Rate is still  60 fps , don't expect something crazy like 144 hertz
MORE IMPORTANTLY,   DEDICATED PC CONTROLS 
Something that I always complain about an Iffy PC Port (although I use controller)
For some reason there is not much graphical settings for you to tweak in the game, lets hope for an update to enable us to tweak what we wanted it to be (just like Nep VII)
So for  lower end PC's , plz  do not buy this  for this very moment
It is much more intense than Nep VII
I saw the reviews saying that the game is buggy etc
For  NVIDIA users , try  add the game  in  Nvidia Control Panel 
If it doesn't work, try  uninstall GeForce Experience  (if you don't use ShadowPlay) because that thing is a bloatware! Unfortunately for  AMD users , there are a lot of times Iffy games just won't work properly with AMD cards
Your best shoot is to  wait for an update 
Plz Rate this up for the bug Steam is currently having on this Game Apparently if you buy the  Normal ver  of the game, you will get the  Full Deluxe Pack  for free
(Just check the Game Folder before you start rating down)EDIT: The bug has been fixed

												Despite not meeting the minimum system requirement, the game still runs smoothly on my sluggish MBP 2012 with an integrated intel hd 4000 graphic processor chip
Is that enough ?Edit: For anyone who can't start the game, change your system date time setting to any date that is before July 1st

												Pros1-6 character battle system2-Enhance battle system3-enchance graphics4-Dynamic character interactions/pairings5-Comedic dialog6-Dozens of hours of fun
7-Customizable combat8-New story paths are great and expand the overall experienceCons1- Cliche Character Personalities, 2-Linear, hallway like dungeons3-Despite strong on simple levels, many character interactions fall flat due to lack of meaning on a broad scale
4-Overly repetitive, bland side quests5-Predictable stories (if you have play the original game)For the fans of that series and its comedic tone, you will find the same style of comfort here
For newcomers, if you can put up with how contrived the story can be, it may be worth a shot thanks to the exclusive content
Fairy Fencer F: Advent Dark Force added much needed and requested changes, but not everything seems to have been addressed with this re-release
The different paths you are able to take add more depth to the already well told story
Though it more often feels like a Director's Cut than a true remake, 'Advent Dark Force' nonetheless turns a flawed PS3 RPG into a stronger experience overall, making it the absolute best way to play 'Fairy Fencer'
The story has been made a great deal more interesting, playing with concepts that the original only hinted at, and the combat has been given a big shot in the arm thanks to the expanded party sizes and rebalanced difficulty
The game's biggest issue is that it feels like it could've been improved a great deal more than it has, leaving us with a game that's good, but falls just short of greatness
Still, it's a worthwhile adventure that lays down enough strong groundwork that could lead to a truly excellent sequel
FINAL VERDICT: 4/5Advent Dark Force went all-out in order to make the most definitive version of Fairy Fencer F that it possibly could
This title should be a no-brainer for fans of the original Fairy Fencer F, and I would also recommend it to anyone in the market for a good JRPG
Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force provides enjoyable gameplay, memorable characters, and a branching story good enough to warrant multiple playthroughs – and hey, isn’t that all that matters?

												This review will attempt to be as spoiler-free as possible, although it may get a bit long
Full Disclosure: I received the game for free for participation in IFI's closed beta testing, although I purchased the original FFF myself over a year ago
What's New?For those who played the original FFF, this will probably be important
The entirety of the original game basically exists within ADF as the 'Goddess' route, which you'll naturally enter unless you do some very specific things early on
There are some slight differences with respect to dialogue, event details, and character introduction timings in order to facilitate better story flow, but the overall story is exactly the same
The 'New Stuff' is mostly the two new story routes
There are mechanical changes as well, with the most obvious being the doubling of the party size to an incredible six(!) characters, and a change in the way that Avalanche Attacks are triggered
There are also two new recruitable characters when you get to the third route
The story routes themselves are all separate from each other
I thoroughly enjoyed each of them, as they forced you to come to terms with, and get used to things you may not necessarily be used to doing
Some may dislike the fact that character rosters change (temporarily,) but in my opinion, the new routes are best taken in as the game providing you with "what if" scenarios
Each route also has its own set of character-specific endings
They each contain their own set of dungeons; Some are new, others are 'new' with recycled assets, and some are repeats of earlier dungeons
The game has also been rebalanced a bit from FFF
Should I Get It?I enjoyed the game, but I cannot overwhelmingly recommend it
For players who are familiar with other CH/IF titles (e
g
Neptunia series, or the original FFF,) you'll be familiar with how ADF plays out
For these players, I'd recommend it if you are interested in the story it tells, as I feel that the story is much better, and more coherent, than Neptunia's
For players who are not familiar with similar titles such as the Neptunia series, it's tougher to recommend
The problem is that this game (like most of their other RPG's) is not a very deep or complex RPG
If you are looking for a 'good' RPG for the 'RPG,' then I cannot recommend this game, as you will be let down
This game, instead, plays much closer to a Visual Novel with light RPG thrown in between
The majority of the game time will be spent experiencing the story through dialogue/event sequences, before running off to clear simple dungeons, then repeating the process
Thus, the focus is much more on the telling of FFF/ADF's story, than it is about playing an RPG
If this idea of a 'casual RPG' with a storytelling focus sounds appealing, then by all means, I would recommend the game
Price, however, is a contentious point
Certainly, there is enough content in ADF to justify being pricier than FFF; The new stories easily more than double the amount of content in the game compared to FFF
Couple that with the new visual upgrades, as well as re-hiring voice actors to voice entirely new scripts, and you come up with improvements that are more than trivial
However, the price is still on the high end (comparable to Megadimension Neptunia VII rather than the Re;Birth series
) Whether or not these improvements are worth the extra cost is up to you, but I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in the game, and it's on a decent discount
Why Are The Requirements So High?The required specs can appear to be fairly high, although that's the hardware IFI wants to recommend in order to reliably achieve 60+ FPS throughout the game
I have been running the game on an nVidia GTX-670 and i7-3770k at 1920x1200 with maximum graphical settings, and I was able to largely get 60 FPS almost everywhere
The exceptions were certain dungeons with heavy particle effects where I would dip to the mid 40's
The Bottom LineUltimately, I ejoyed the game, and I helped to beta test the game because I thoroughly liked the original FFF's story, and really wanted to see the new stories present in ADF
Story-wise, I can say that I was not disappointed; I loved every minute of it
However, I cannot provide a blanket recommendation because this game still hits somewhat of a niche audience, and you'll have to decide based on my comments above whether or not this is for you
If you are at all interested, though, I would say definitely!

 Basic information Title: BioShock InfiniteDeveloper(s): Irrational GamesPublisher(s): 2K GamesGenre(s): Action, First-Person, ShooterSingleplayer: YesMultiplayer: No Numerical Impression   Overall */10   AI 8   Atmosphere 10   Gameplay 9   Graphics 10   Characters 10   Optimization 9   Originality 10   Sound 10   Soundtrack 9   Story 9   Ratings 94/100  General Impression Bioshock Infinite was originally going to be more of an open world game with a variety of features but with disagreements in development accompanied with the limitations the product was facing on other platforms, they decided to scrap most of what they were working on to create the version you see before you
The product Irrational Games showcased at E3 2010 is significantly different compared to the product that's available to the consumer
Not every game has to have more than one ending, stealth mechanics, weapon customization, a third person player view, character customization, a variety of meaningful choices, manual save mechanics, modification development tools or have no scripted moments to be a decent game
Sure, any one of these features would have been great additions and dispite of the downgrade, I can absolutely recommend Bioshock Infinite if the price is right

												Bioshock Infinite is a masterpiece
The graphics are awesome, it's a cool experience to explore the flying city Columbia by hooks and railways
The best thing of Bioshock Infinite is the story, you can't stop playing without thinking about what happened or what will happen next
At the end of the game you will be speechless and sad that it's already over (but don't mind, you can play as many times as you want)
You have a solid variety of weapons you can use during the game which make the battles against the enemies very interesting
The DLCs are as good as the game itself
Bioshock Infinite is a MUST for everyone who likes great stories

												No game will ever affect me as much as BioShock Infinite did
After playing through the game three times (twice on Xbox 360 & once on PC) it still upsets me that Irrational signed over the series permanently
I'm going to keep this clean of any spoilers and say that this was a brilliant end to the revolution of the trilogy, and that Burial at Sea episodes One & Two are to be considered absolutely mandatory if you are to play this game properly
This game has been one of only a few games, that has brought me to tears on more than one occasion
Call me a cry baby or whatever, but I am as passionate about this series as any fanatic is about whatever they are obsessed with
BioShock will always have a special place in my life post of completing Infinite
I would recommend not only this game, but BioShock, BioShock 2 also
If you are thinking about buying this, do it, have fun, and pay attention

												This game was absolutely amazing
 Even a year after playing it all the way through, some aspects of the underlying story still stick with me
 I won't speak much to gameplay, because while I enjoyed the game immensely that wasn't what made this a true experience
 All of the BioShock games were excellent and a great journey - certainly at the top of my list for enjoyment
 Infinite was a little different though
 For me, it was the visually impactful segments and the deeply moving moments throughout
 Everyone connects with storytelling differently, but this one resonated with me a great deal
 For reference, my beloved list of games like this one are F
E
A
R
Perseus Mandate and 2, Dead Space 3, Mass Effect 2, Dragon Age II, Syberia I and II, The Longest Journey and Dreamfall, Half Life 2, Unreal II and a handful more
 This game was at the upper end of that list and I wish I could have stayed in the Infinite world for so much longer
 The ending for me was like the ending of the Hyperion/Endymion novel series - I understood it and knew at a visceral level that it was coming, but it took me a while to accept it because I was so invested in the main characters and I didn't want them to go
 It is so rare for a story to sit inside me casting around for a place to rest amongst my values and character
 In 40 years, I have experienced this with a very small collection of books, movies and games
 BioShock Infinite managed to find a place there

												What I've played of the game so far is brilliant
But being able to play the game is like navigating a minefield
Between save data being corrupted (have had to restart the campaign TWICE), seizure inducing flickering, alt-tab crashes, mouse cursors showing up in gameplay, I just can't recommend anybody purchase the game in its current state
I really want to support Single-Player FPSes til the day I die, but I can't support broken releases
It pains to me to not recommend this title, but I will gladly change my review once a drastic fix is released in the coming days

												Just finished the main story, and I gotta be honest, I feel underwhelmed
Something about this game feels unfinished - you'll find out as you play, all the elements are here - Killing Nazis
Cool guns
Great sound
Fantastic attention to detail
Everything in these departments is set - as the first game was
But it's missing a couple things as well - the story is simply not finished
I don't know if MachineGames ran out of time, or money, but it's missing the "Big Revolution" element it so desperately needed
I don't feel motivated to destroy the regime as much, because I'm not put in anywhere nearly as many positions where I see the struggling of the American People - similar to the Concentration Camp mission from the first game
There is nothing like that, and I think the game could have used a couple missions like that
Your buddy - Wyatt or Fergus - also is relegated to a backseat role - disappointing considering the amount of emphasis they put on the choice in the first game
At this time, I simply cannot reccomend the game at full price
While the first game had the depth and drama that a game like this should, this is lacking in that oh-so-crucial department, and has a pretty meager amount of time you can enjoy everything

												Let's be serious
Every time we consumers do not punish something poorly done we are encouraging that it happens to us again
I am no techie and when I buy a product I expect it to be finished and polished unless it is early access, in which case I know the risks I am taking (and probably would never pay 60 $ for an early access game)
I love you guys in Bethesda and Machinegames and I own and have really enjoyed a lot of the games you developed or published
But this time, someone has done a crappy job, and I don't see why I should pay for it
The game is so terribly optimized that you put a patch out yesterday that caused thousands of players (me amongst them) to not be able to start the game ever again due to "Could not write crash dump" error messages
Then, trying to find the solution has become a game in real life (maybe this is the real WII TNC game! Brilliant!): install this, uninstall that, cry here, shout there


and nothing works
I have a heck of a computer and a great bunch of games and never experienced any hardware issues, not to mention the impossilibity to launch my expensive, newly-acquired game
Therefore, buying this game right now is an act of irresponsibility encouraging the developers to put to sale more crappy job before it's finished
Let's not buy, let's refund and only when they get it properly done, we'll buy again
WII TNC IS A MUST-NOT as it is!EDIT 11/03/2017 10:00 am: I tried reupgrading my driver (again) to the latest version (after I had downgraded it since the crash error started) and this time it worked! Back in the game, working like a charm

 The game as it stands October 31st
After nine hours of play time on "Call me Terror-Billy" and completing the main story I started out loving the game
It was fast paced and had a fun enough combat system to keep it fresh enough through the entirety of the game
By the middle point of the game I started to feel a sense of dread as I began to realize that the story was coming to an end way too early for the $60 price tag
I would love to say I would love recommend the game but as it stands it is much too short, littered with bugs, poor optimization and the fact something as simple as the steam overlay crashing the game even in the main menu I have to give it a no
Maybe in the future when the game is patched and updated with the three DLC stories the game will worth the $60 price tag but as the game is it doesnt stand up to other single player games of the same price

												Oh boy here I go Killing again			
Posted: 29 October
												Since people complained:***SPOILERS FOR Wolfenstein: The New Order (a THREE YEAR OLD game) IN REVIEW***Sadly, I can't recommend Wolfenstein II at it's current price
Firstly, the game is extremely short
I beat the main storyline in two sittings
Granted I probably game more than most people but seriously, the main campaign is SHORT
I got about 18 hours out of the game, which might be long for a FPS, but as someone that most recently played Breath of the Wild, $60 to play for about 15 hours and watch 2-3 hours of cutscenes seems pricey
This game never reaches the heights of Wolfenstein: The New Order
Remember that surprising bit in TNO when you go to the moon and discover entirely new weapon types that feel badass and futuristic, and totally change the way the game plays? There are no moments like that in TNC
 I kept waiting to discover some cool new weapon, but midway through the game you have all the weapons unlocked and almost all of them are boring
They actually feel like a step backwards from TNO, especially the heavy weapons
They're so slow and unweildy they're functionally useless in most situations
You keep playing and playing expecting some bit "oh COOL" moment to happen, but all of the coolest moments in the game happen in cutscenes, to be frank
Stealth in this game seems like an afterthought
Most levels feature a small opening area where you can stealth around and kil a few guards, but there's very little chance of stealthing 100% through any level effectively
Granted its Wolfenstein but the game seems to try and reward you for stealthing and punish you for going in guns blazing, only to then make it nearly impossible to effectively stealth around
There also doesnt seem to be a "lost em" mechanic, meaning once you're spotted the enemies always seem to have a general idea of where you are from then until they're dead
 Remember that moment in TNO when you have to choose between your companions, who lives and who dies? Remember how terrible a decision that was the first time? There are no moments like that in TNC
Everything feels like it's on rails and you're just running from cutscene to cutscene
Remember the almost puzzle-like complexity of the prison camp? Remember the awe-inspiring reveal of the Da'at Yichud armory?  Remember the gut-wrenching sacrifice Bobby made to get BJ in for the assault on the London Nautica launch facility? TNC has so many opportunities to tell a compelling, interesting story, but instead uses almost all of it's time to hit you over the head with the "WHITE PEOPLE BAD" messaging
The cartoonish violence and hamfisted characters are never brought home with compelling and rich storytelling
Storywise, EVERY SINGLE PLOT TWIST is telegraphed way, way in advance
You'll see everything coming, for the most part
During some cutscenes I actually found myself bored, since there was nothing interesting or surprising about what was going on
There are no jaw-dropping "Oh WHAAAAT" moments like there were in TNO
Plus things about the storyline just don't make sense
For some reason in cutscenes the Power Suit is bulletproof


yet when you're playing it doesn't seem to matter that you have it on, you take damage just like normal
Whoever did Frau Engel's voice acting was stellar and some of her writing is superb, but she just wasn't given enough to do in the game
She is never as compelling or terrifying a villain as Death's Head
Also


Venus? What? It's never really explained why the Nazis have a gas mining facility on Venus, unless its explained in some collectible that I haven't found yet
The moon made at least a little sense, since it's strategically important and the plot did a pretty good job of at least handwaving why they had a base there
But Venus just doesn't make any sense
Also the developers don't seem to understand just how far Venus is from Earth
Venus is 162 MILLION MILES from Earth but for some reason ALL of the Oberkommando decide to make that their permanent base of operations on a whim? They couldn't move to like, California? Or Washington? The most optimistic estimate (even given sci-fi space tech) is that it takes about 100 days to get to Venus
So for BJ to get there and back would have taken the majority of a year


the game suggests he gets back in days
A lot of the plot just seems like the writers had a bunch of cool ideas they wanted to see in a game and they drafted a story around those ideas
Sometimes that works, here it's clunky
Having said that, if W2: TNC was $49
99 I would suggest maybe picking it up if you're a huge fan
But There's some good stuff here - the weapons are somewhat satisfying to use, though certain weapons just completely outshine others, so you'll find yourself using two or three guns through the entire game
Also as a quick tip - somehow tagging someone with a dieselkraftwerk DOES NOT raise an alarm if you're unseen
This is bonkers
Lastly blocking ACTUAL CONTENT behind a pre-order bonus is a turn-off
Overall the game just doesn't feel like it's worth $60
It's short, messy, poorly written, and while there are a few moments where you truly feel like "Terror-Billy" the badass, for the most part the game is boring and repetitive
I'd say wait for a price drop
Edit: Added more detail to balance the review

												Since this review is at mixed with 2,896, I thought I'd chime in with my two cents, and see if that is worth it, or more, to anyone who might be deciding whether to purchase this game or not
Wolfenstein 2 is less a sequel to Wolfenstein The New Order, than it is a Retro Future Nazi Killing Themed sidegrade to D00M
And that isn't a bad thing
Although it lacks D00M's parkour-esque mechanics, the gunplay has the same visceral, balls-to-the-wall, think-on-your-feet mentality
With that, there are different ways to play
Run and gun, pump and dump (as in just get the craziest heaviest weapons and go ham), or stealth
I tend to favor whichever I think works best for the situation at hand, but none of them feel contrived or played out
One of my biggest issues with The New Order was sometimes having no clear way of tellng where to go, and while that isn't completely fixed, it is addressed by giving you a sometimes difficult to spot waypoint marker which does help
As for the Elephant in the Room
Crashing
Wolfenstein 2 is one of the most optimized and polished releases I've seen on PC
From a technical standpoint it is sheer magic
The choice to stick solely with Vulkan has benefits for every platform, even our little Penguin Bros on Linux, and is absolutely vendor agnostic
This game does not pick sides
It doesn't cow down to nVidia's Gameworks, or AMD's Open Design Tools equivalent
Crashing on Team Green has been, and confirmed by the steady release of (to their credit), nvidia drivers to address their cards shortcomings
AMD has been quick to resolve some as well
It must be said, that them having to disable forced driver updates (which, is stupid, people you need to keep your stuff up to date) and also disabling Async Compute Shaders for nVidia shows that that DX12-ready sticker they slap across the box of the 900/1000 series is just smoke and mirrors
I prepped a PC with a Ryzen 1700 and a GTX 970 for this game, with Display Driver Uninstaller and clean drivers, 388
00, and 388
10, and 388
13 as they were released
Neither him, nor I, having an old 2012 R9 290X 4GB [the hot and spicy b-tard as it is] had any issues, save for one crash for myself
On one of the later areas, on a conveyor belt I had one crash
Reloading the game after losing about two minutes worth of progress, and no issues
At 1080p Ultra Preset with TSSAA I was able to maintain an average of 70-90fps, with drops to 35 and 45 in New Orleans (thankfully in areas where there wasn't a lot of fighting to do)
This is the way the PC Gaming Industry needs to go
TItles that push limits, that break molds, that hold card vendor's feet to the fire, instead of backtracking on comfortable, heavy-handed, vendor-specific features
Vulkan and DirectX 12 are the future, and Wolfenstein is its Flag-Bearing Vanguard, and deservedly so
One of the best FPS games since D00M, and one of the best sequels
A must have, a must own, and a must play, bar none

												Not a lot is different compared to the previous game
The game feels a lot shorter compared to the previous as well and all the new characters are simply just so unlikeable - especially Grace Walker (the stereotypical black woman) who is unnecessarily rude to everyone for no good reason
Skill upgrades in the game are so pathetic and useless that I forgot they even existed 2/3 into the game
Anya is pregnant, which is fine, but the devs must have some sort of pregnancy fetish because she is constantly sexualised in odd ways - like at one point she tears off her clothes and shoots nazis
It also feels like the game is ripping off concepts from other games
For instance - there is a mission where you have to go to Venus to do something - and I challenge anyone to convince me this level did not remind them of the game DOOM
You also unlock a new heavy weapon up there (BFG?)
Manhattan level felt like it was trying to be Fallout 4
etc etc
There just wasn't any levels that made the game feel original - compared to (lets say) the opening level of the previous Wolfenstein game - which felt fantastic
But most dissapointing of all is the ending - no spoilers - but you don't even realise you're fighting the final boss - just a couple of 'stronger than usual' enemies that you can beat without any problems - followed up by an anticlimactic ending

Tl'dr version: An amazing improvement upon the original, completely contaminated by some of the worst industry practices we have yet seen
Make no mistake, if the consumer base does not stop this now, we will be seeing not only microtransactions in $60 games but further degradation of the base game for them to wring every last ounce of money from us
DO NOT BUY THE LOOTBOXES
You can follow me, and see the rest of my work here:http://steamcommunity
com/id/StarSide/myworkshopfiles/?section=guidesElaborated version:Maybe from that you can already tell I will not just be talking about the base-game of Shadow of War for the whole review
Most reviewers policy is to separate industry practices from the game to judge the game "on its own merits"
Well, here's my issues with that
If you are compromising the product on purpose, in order to drag the game out, or purposely tear the game apart in order for you sell us content later down the line, that is most definitely an already compromised (ethically and mechanically) product
If WB had kept their grubby mitts of this game, I would most definitely have given this a positive review
However, since that is not what they have done, this review will remain negative
Microtransactions
Some in-depth analysis here
Firstly, the infamous loot box situation
You can buy orks from loots boxes, not just getting them out in the in-game world
This completely breaks in-game immersion and the economy of the game
You can either choose to ignore the loot boxes and go at it vanilla, where you're missing out on possible high-level minions, as the game was obviously intended, as the level of orks you find are introduced on a gradient; the higher level you are, the better orks you will find
Additionally, what are essentially ads for the lootboxes keep popping up in game, where you are prompted to go and buy them
Also, if you want any hope of being 'competitive' in the online game mode Shadow Wars, you'll need some super powerful orks, something the lootboxes have the slight possibility to help with
Consequently, you will notice every dynamic in the game becomes centered around these things in some form of another:You want an high level ork? Cough up! You want to upgrade your weapons and armor? You'll need additional gems to do that, cough up!You want to play multiplayer? Better have some good orks, so cough up!!Whether the game would have been constructed like this without the cancer that is WarnerBrothers getting their claws into the mechanics of the game is completely moot
Now, with that out of the way, let's talk about the game
Story
You a lord of the rings lore fan? This is going to be a rough ride
The game, for better or for worse, plays fast and lose with the canon to such an extent you wonder why not just set this in the time of the silmerilian and call it a day
However, if you can get past the desecration of established law (which I can), the story is actually quite compelling
Following on the last game, Ranger Talion and his ancient dead elf-friendo Calimbrimbor have made a new ring of power, just like Saurons
Great! What could go wrong
Turns out quite a lot actually
What follows is an epic, continent spanning war between the 'Bright Lord' and Sauron
All sorts of shenanigans ensue! Just don't get too disappointed if you were expecting high-brow Shakespeare
Movement and Combat
Like Shadows of Mordor but better
Everything is back from the last game, but with added upppf
Movement is buttery smooth, and really the game plays just like every other third-person openworld, Arkyum style game
Speaking of which, the combat system is straight outta Batman, which isn't a bad thing
Combat is fun and Talion's wraith powers are suitably beefed up from the last game
The Nemesis system
I was going to add this to the last section however, it more or less is one of the most original ideas in the last decade in gaming
Essentially, the Nemesis system allows every individual ork to remember you, and everything you've done to them
Burn that ork captain in a fire, he might come for you later on
This is extended to the 'meta game' aspect for creating armies
Your generals might betray you, or save your life
This creates some of the best dynamic stories in gaming really
However, sometimes the betrayals get a little too common, and you'll find yourself trying to game the system in order to keep your orks on your side
I won't say anything more, it really is something better to experience for yourself
Sound
Not the best, not the worse
Voice acting is passable, with a few exceptions
Talion seems mostly asleep during his cutscenes, the voice actor is clearly phoning it in for his paycheck at this point
On the other hand, Calimbrimbor is the star of the show
His gravely tones are both charismatic and slightly scary, especially when he gets all shouty
Combat noises are also quite good
Swords ring and the screams of orks will pervade your ears constantly
In this universe, all orks seem to have a slightly comical British cocny accent
You'll either love it or hate it
ConclusionNot concentrating on the poor industry behavior, this is a great game
However, I will not simply segregate them out of the review, because this stuff definitely effects the end product
Great game! But make a statement and wait for this to get to a low price
And DON'T, DON'T, DON'T buy those damn lootboxes!!

												DO NOT ACCEPT THE TOS! If you just click the accept button without clicking the check box it turns off the Microtransactions, marketplace, and people attacking your base while you are offline "multiplayer" there is NOTHING that tells you this is possible on the screen
 I detail about this further here at the very start! https://youtu
be/ur3-II1kvBEEdit: WB did change the game prerelease to no longer include losing your Uruks if you get raided while you are offline
The other points still apply
I wish there was a maybe option instead of recommend or not
In light of how this game is packaged I had to click no
Overall I am enjoying the game but it still needs optimization and all the loot box stuff removed

												So First off i played this game offline and online
atm 40+ hoursHowever there is a few things that is bad and a few things that is good
Update2!For once this will be a good point and update
With the first dlc released Slaughter Tribe they will be makeing Shadow wars Endless ( free update with or without additional dlc purchase )This is a good step in right direction hopefully they will solve aloot of the other problems as well later down the road
Lets take bad part first
Update3!Pitfight AI sometimes can be broken and the orcs just stand there for a minute and then suddenly go berzerk and kill some one
possible bugg ?Update!After about 40-50 hours into the game i started getting aloot of IronWilled Orcs wich makes them Impossible to dominate
This is no doubt a lockbox Mechanic wich is aimed at you haveing harder time to get a orc dominated
It was not in first game shadow of mordor for sure
IronWilled can be removed at a super low chance ( so far my chances have been 1 in 29 shames ) while you shame an orc but heres the kicker
If you shame an orc they have a chance to became deranged wich makes them lose their personality
Also ( if you have certain skill have  chance to make them a maniac wich can be quite insane strong but if ironwilled then they will proboly be hard time to deal with )Or in my case i ended up with aloot of very weak orcs and deranged and still ironwilled
Now this mechanic is aimed at you haveing a slower time to get orcs so you get bored and buy lootbox orcs i have no doubt in my mind about this
This only happened later down in the game and well it sucks to be frank
I found some very cool orcs i wanted but since they IronWilled i cannot get them without risking them to become insane and lose all their personality
VERY poor game mechanic
So Monolith lied about a few things in their interviews and such
First of all they said there would be no advertisements on lootboxes ingame in a published interview
But as soon as you open the game and anytime ingame you play and press escape advertisement for lootboxes shows up
Wich is bad
Next Monolith promised everything that was in lootboxes was in open world
This was also a lie
You see in the lootboxes you get scrolls that can customize your orcs
You do not get that in the open world only from lootboxes ( free or Pay boxes ) Below there is a few examples of what you get from lootboxes that is NOT in open world
Battle Training (raises a follower's level by 1)Archer Recruitment (grants a follower an Archer Gang)Hunter Recruitment (Grants a follower a Hunter Gang)Defender Recruitment (Grants a follower a Defender Gang)Mount Training (Grants a follower a caragor mount) Fire Training (Grants a follower a Fire Weapon)Epic Training: Mighty Savages (Grants a follower a boost to the effectiveness of nearby Savages)Poison Training (Grants a follower a Poison Weapon)Mount Training Legendary (Grants a follower a Defencive Graug)This list is INCOMPLETE we do not have all the traits scrolls here there is supposedly many many more locked inside the lootbox system and NOT avaible ingame
Below is a link to the official forum where people asked that this be put into the game and not into lootboxes Monolith preatty much ignored it
https://community
wbgames
com/t5/General/Please-make-training-orders-and-reassignment-orders-avaliable/td-p/1656682Next part that is bad about the game is Lootboxes in a single player game was kinda over the line and poorly done IF everything was inside the game offline as well as in lootboxes then ok np but it is not
Other than micro transaction things the game suffers from a little bit repetive gameing syndrome you do aloooot of the same things over and over with very little changes
Now that was the bad parts
Lets go to the good parts
Game features a very well made graphics engine and Npcs are well cordinated for the most part
Story is good as far as i gotten and sound actors are good but maybe little bit low on volume and subtitles can be a hit and miss
Optimisation is welldone i tested on my laptop and on my pc and both worked great
have not encountered any buggs so far wich is good
Nemesis version 2 engine is awesome! you will love it
Skill system is a little bit weaird at first glance but you get the hang of it later
You can respec free of charge at any given time great addition
Id say if it was not for the lootboxes this would be a perfect game
Now In conclusion If you do not mind microtransactions and some items being In Lootboxes only then you should buy this game
However if you do have something against microtransaction or you suffer from addiction disorders or similar problems DO NOT buy this game due to sublime advertisements in the menus
I do not know if they will ban people who have fun with the game with mods or cheats or such but i hope they do not since this is a single player game
There is a multiplayer section of the game but its like not worth mentioning couse its very very basic and limited
anyways there you have my review
PS the amount of bad decisions monolith and warner bros made when releaseing this game made the game dirt cheap before it was even released i got my copy 65% off from a retailer on gold edition
you can proboly snag this game with gold edition 50% of at any given time from retailers or digital merchants

												Shadow of War is one of 2017’s biggest disappointments for me
While its Nemesis system is better than ever, the rest of the game provides a flawed and repetitive experience with some unpleasant practices integrated into the menu
Imagine a single player game that advertises its microtransactions and season pass every time you pause
That may not sound too bad, but I easily spent at least forty percent of the game digging through the bloated and slow menu system
I must have seen them hundreds of times
In addition to that nonsense, you have the (microtransaction) Market section, filled with Gold and Mithril Chests that promise epic or legendary items and orcs
Other things you can spend your premium currency on include experience boosts and Featured Friday Chests™
Not everything requires real money in the Market
You can spend your Mirian (in-game currency) on somewhat useless Silver Chests and redeem rewards tied to the online component of the game (Online Vendettas and Sieges)
Those delicious rewards trigger a glowing circle right next to the Market in the menu, you know, to make you click on it
That way you can be exposed to more of their premium offerings since they’re all mixed in together
It’s just the other way the game is engineered to advertise its boxes to you
There is some serious free-to-play mobile game design philosophy wrapping its glistening, bulging arms around Shadow of War
Now that we’ve covered that nasty part of the game, let’s talk about the Nemesis system
It’s good and the orcs make it fun and interesting
You’ll run into and be killed by poet orcs, orcs that don’t know how to stay dead, and orcs that will save you time and time again (to my horror, which I’ll go over later)
Their responses to the numerous situations that can occur within the game impressed me
The voice actors put in some great performances as the orc and olog captains, especially when you earn the ability to shame them into insanity (highly recommended)
Unfortunately, the game overstays its welcome with its forgettable story and unlikable protagonists
The elf ghost seems unable to say anything that doesn’t involve the word Palintír™ and Talion doesn’t really develop or seem interesting
Shelob is apparently eye candy with her fine humanoid form and has a unexpectedly dumb storyline tied to her memories (one type of collectable in the game) that becomes apparent when you gather all of them
The other characters in the game are a slightly better while the orcs are #1
They have much more entertaining and interesting personalities than everyone else
The other big problem with Shadow of War comes in the form of highly repetitive and somewhat frustrating gameplay
If you’re the type that can’t help collecting collectibles, then you’re in for a boring and tedious ride
One of the worst parts about hunting them down is having to climb a tower that activates a mini-game that involves scoping out the territory until your crosshair shrinks enough to discover it when you’re close enough
Some of them have interesting lore pieces attached and others, not so much
The combat varies greatly in its quality depending on the encounter
You can easily find yourself spamming dodge or counter for extended periods of time if the captain has the right combination of immunities and traits
Some enraged captains will endlessly lunge at you if they’re Enraged leaving no room to do anything else until they chill out
Sometimes you’re stuck kiting the enemy or you’re facing a tank who keeps healing over and over again (don’t waste your time and run away until you’re at a higher level)
Other times, you’re being clever with all your tools and feeling pretty great about your conquest
Then again, you could end up becoming uncomfortably intimate with the game’s horrible targeting and wasting a powerful attack on an unintended victim
It’s a somewhat common occurrence with groups
Other issues involve traversal and glitches
Talion seems to have a fetish for climbing and will lovingly attach himself to any surface that’s nearby when running around
I’ve accidentally started climbing up a wall, pillar, or structure when just trying to travel from point A to point B
This problem happens frequently and with mounts too, especially graugs
However, the inclusion of the double jump was a very good choice and was fun to use
As for the glitches, I fell through the world once, witnessed silent speeches, and more
For the most part, my 33 hours didn’t have many technical problems and the loading times were fantastic on my HDD
The mission design could have used a better touch too
Too often would I be going out of bounds in an open-world game
And it’s not a matter of running 1000m in the wrong direction, the arbitrary boundaries are poorly placed to the point of causing mission failure and having to restart
It’s aggravating to see that message pop up and doubly so when it causes a restart
Let me use the environment to my advantage instead of forcing me in a weirdly confined space in a game where you’re normally able to move freely
Since orc speeches are unskippable, you can expect to hear plenty of repeated dialogue if you happen to run into a very difficult fight
The game has a weird grind going for it towards the end
Recruiting orcs means not collecting sweet loot off their dead bodies so each one has an opportunity cost between an item or convert, making the purchase of chests more attractive
I’m glad I got the Act 1 Starter Pack for 50% off with the 500 real currency Mirian which helped me stay geared up
Leveling up slows down too so again, I’m glad I ended up with a handful of 2-hour 100% experience boosts
Lastly, I don’t understand the balance in this game
The combat balance seems off when it comes to the difficulty level
Normal is too easy and Nemesis removes nearly all the hitstun that Normal difficulty has
I found Nemesis to be an exercise in frustration since some missions could end up turning into huge difficulty spikes while repeating the mission on Normal made it a cakewalk
You can tune the difficulty at any time, but nothing can fix that weird gap between the two
I lied, one more thing, before I forget
That heroic orc that kept saving me wasted my time
The upgrade system for items involving fulfilling some requirements that function like a mini-quest of sorts
The legendary ones tend to favor recruiting very specific orcs of a certain level, tribe, and class
This means staring at the Army section of the menu and going through the orcs until you find the right ones
You might even have to pass time if you don’t see any available
Now when I found the right kind of orc twice, they didn’t have the correct level
My plan was to let them kill me so that they could level up and allow me to upgrade my items when I recruited them
However, this one orc I recruited could not resist saving me and when he did, he delivered a one hit killing blow
In conclusion, the Nemesis system and great orc voice acting carry this game hard
2
5 out of 5 stars would be awarded based on that and the positive aspects of combat alone
Numerous things rubbed me the wrong way though and I cannot bring myself to recommend Shadow of War to anyone
Maybe at 40-50% off
It’s a horribly bloated experience with a sluggish menu
They needed to trim down a few things and go with refinement instead of having such a busy menu with too many functions
Oh, I do like the Photo Mode
Make sure to give that a “shot
” Hyuck

												Pros:- Better movement across the large maps- Similar gameplay to its predecessor -- doesn't completely change the formula- Grindy, if you're like me, you may enjoy spending more time killing captains and leveling up than actually playing main quests- Massive landscapes with lots of impressive views- Fleshed out army building: More interaction on recruiting and leveling up dominated enemies
- Some really fun main quest battles that slightly deviate from the repetitive side quests- Tons of lore that is delivered via main menu, in-game, and cinematic videos
- Despite reports, I was getting relatively smooth gameplay ~40-60FPS from my Titan X Maxwell (NOT the newer Titan X Pascal) running 4K: 3840x2160 on ultra
There was some choppiness when it came to assassin/ambush captain pop ins, otherwise been smooth
Also, no crashes in my ~20 hours of play
Neutral:- Microtransactions -- there's a lot of strife over this, so instead of writing about it ad-nausem, I'll say this: Aside from the trolly T
O
S
screen (desribed below), didn't affect my gameplay (I didn't purchase anything nor was I nagged in-game to purchase anything from it)
Cons:- The annoying T
O
S
-- I accepted the Terms of Service, but didn't accept the collecting of data (checkbox)
Now, everytime I start OR exit the game, the T
O
S
screen pops back up wanting me to accept the data collection
Instead, I have to accept and leave the checkmark box empty over and over and over and over and over
Never in my gaming history have I had a T
O
S
screen be that trolly
- Lack of customization -- the swords/shiv/cloaks/rings etc
are just stat upgrades
You can't customize the character's look nor can you differentiate between a level 1 sword from a level 25 sword
 - Predictable - captain assassin/ambush/betrayl pop-ins will mainly appear after sending death threats
Doesn't feel like RNG, but rather staged gameplay to distract the player
- Climbing walls -- when it comes to arch-ways, the climbing becomes super wonky, particularly if you're climbing on the front-face and are attempting to drop inside of/underneath it
Also, some of the wired "walkways" won't allow the player to move forward
He'll go into the crouched position and stick at the beginning of the wire
- The AI -- you can sneak in front a generic enemy's face and assassinate them
Or worse, they could be looking right at you and say, "Where did he go!?"
Some minor tweaks should fix this issue
- Repetitive -- the gameplay, so far, has become repetitive
Very similar to Shadow of Mordor, but with a touch of Just Cause 3 style of play, where areas need to be "liberated" (captured), before the story continues
Unfortunately, this becomes quite repetitive after about 15 hours
- The game size -- 100GB ladies and gentlemen
That includes the game, the 4k DLC cinemas and the DLC high-res texture packs
If you have a slower than 1 gigabit connection or have a data cap or have limited harddrive space


I'm sorry! https://imgur
com/m9gjJm0Glitches as of v1
01:- Captain loot -- Early on, I ended up getting a bow that I already had equipped at the time
However, since it's a level 1, I couldn't dismantle it
So I'm stuck with two level 1 bows with the same stats that I can't dismantle
- Broken Shelob memories - after solving ANY of the spider web puzzles, I get about 1-2 seconds of video before it rewinds, makes a loud pop and goes back to the gameplay: https://youtu
be/GbYwCjGYSUw ***This may only affect those who have the 4K DLC installed
***- Enemies respawn too quickly - After defeating a main quest/side quest/kill a captain, enemies will respawn in place within seconds
This mainly affects the side quests and mini-fortress battles, where another captain may respawn in an area you just killed the mini-fortress captain
Therefore, creating an endless captain respawn loop if you decide to kill the respawned captains
It does affect the main quests, but to a smaller degree
Regardless, enemies should respawn only after the area is left
- Loading - Occasionally, the loading screen would hang
When I alt+tab out and back into the game, it seamed to fix it
Other thoughts:Unfortunately, I feel that if you've played Shadow of Mordor, you've played Shadow of War
The game is just way too similar to its predecessor (same overall gameplay, similar storyline, same level-up grind fest, same animations, same in-game assets, same captain strengthes/weakness, same captain menu, same generic enemies, mostly the same dominated mounts


etc)
This game kind of feels like it should have been an expansion pack or DLC for Shadow of Mordor
It's not so much a new game with some fresh new features, but an old game that's been fleshed out
It feels like this: An author created a successful book
The fans wanted a sequel
The author takes his or her first book, adds in more detail, keeps everything else relatively the same, and releases it as a new sequel to the first
Would you pay for that? When it comes to Shadow of War, expect a different map with the same gameplay and a few minor game tweaks and army additions; otherwise, everything else just feels like icing on an already stale cake (I played Shadow of Mordor for 120+ hours, so I ate my fair share of this dessert already)
Recommendations:- If you've never played Shadow of Mordor: Buy it
- If you've played Shadow of Mordor and loved it: Wait to buy it on discount

												Shadow of War is fun until reaching the 4th and final act, which locks the ending of the game behind a monotonous and mindless grind
A baffling decision that can only be explained by the developer/publisher trying to strongarm you into buying their expensive XP boosts and Orc followers in order to get closure for the story
SHAME

												Great game that improves on everythign Shadow of Mordor had, but paying 60$ for a full game only to find i need to spend more money for buy my way thru the game to the "real" ending is what made this a negative review

												I'll keep my review simple
Also watch out for the spoilers(I rate this games features with plus and minus, 3 being the best/worst rating
)Pros:	++ ACT I & ACT II
+ 1 versus 1 combat is a pleasure, shame, because it doesn't happen too often
+++ Improved Nemesis system
++ Fortresses
(unlocks at ACT II)+++ Pit Fights; There you order your followers to kill other orc captains in order to level up your fighter/follower
(you also receive gear by winning fights)Really positive thing for this game, hope they would've focus more on this
Like adding an online feature (like 1v1 other players)or customization for AI behaviour
 (as watching these fights gets quite irritating after dozen of pit fights -- because of the Artificial Intelligence; turns out its horrendous)
++ Atmosphere and collectibles
++ SoundtrackCons:-- Feels like they rushed ACT III & IV (no real story behind these acts) and left the game without proper ending or late game grind
 If the continuous sieges at ACT IV were intented as late game grind -- they have failed big time (besides min-maxing your fortresses)- Battling amidst multiple enemies can be/is frustrating when you try to focus your single target attacks to single enemy
(due to poor camera locking/focusing)- Climbing could be much more fluent, as it feels really clunky
- Spending long time listening to every new orc captain tell their mocks, threats and what-not -- as you can't skip it, well it starts to irritate slowly later on
-- Also turns out if you fight in Online Conquest your followers are gone for good if they die,don't do the same mistake as I did; if you can't afford to lose the followers, don't fight
*edit* Seems you lose them in *RANKED* Conquest, unranked doesn't count
--- Fortress sieges are real lackluster because the template is always the same: Capture few points (like Domination from CoD), kill few warchiefs and go slay the Overlord 1 v 1 -- then claim the fortress for yourself
Spoiler: it gets boring real quick
Not to talk about the defending of fortresses: enemy AI is really terrible, in the end you may end up hunting some enemy warchief who is idling next to a wall doing nothing
(happens quite often)Also you are unable to command your forces, they are at the mercy of a terrible AI -- too bad
-- Hoped it would have more regions than just these 5, also Minas Morgul isn't really active region in late game that is
Neutral:I wish the skill tree would've had more in-depth mechanics, but as it turned out it has very little to tell and feels hollow,however gearing in this game covers for this flaw by a little bit
Loot Boxes seems interesting but the variety of different loot boxes is just too slim to make me interested in
(no cosmetics, nothing, just few different follower boxes, hope they do something about this)Also, as an AAA game I would've expected far more content, it feels like a lot at start, but later on you suddenly realize how little this game has to offer



Overall for such game 60 dollars is too much I fear,there could've been so much more content and potential for this game,but they chose otherwise for some reason
I guess upcoming DLC's could cover for this flaw,until then I suggest waiting for sale
I'd give it a firm 7/10*edit*Some of you asked why I didn't give this game thumbs up;well I don't suggest you to buy this game for 60USD,as it doesn't offer enough content for the price;Story is short and leaves you graving for more,and the few side storylines it has to offer doesn't fill up the gap
Also I feel this game doesn't have real replayability -besides trying to beat it in Nemesis difficulty
If you feel you don't mind paying 60 USD for +40 hours of contentwith poor late game - go for it
My advice is to wait for GOTY or sale

Issues thread: http://steamcommunity
com/app/244160/discussions/0/617328967243529430/Let me tell you something about homeworld (1+2 AND the lost game, homeworld cataclysm)
Even 15+ years later, it's still the gold standard for 3D RTS
Here's a few big points:Very intuitive controls
Movement control is a simple two step, where the first sets horizontal movement, then *optionally* holding shift or click and drag for height
I've yet to see another 3D RTS which even comes close to how quickly and simply that I can give move orders in a 3D space, even though mice and monitors are 2D devices
Extremely helpful *contextual* visual indicators
When in the process of giving a move order, a lot of supporting information for movement then pops up
For example, to show how high other ship's height are above yours in the 3D battlespace, an ecliptic disc is drawn centered on your ships in the move order interface, and vertical lines are drawn from that disc to those other ships
It GREATLY aids in plotting the movement order so you can order your ships to intercept over long distances
Once the move order is given, all of this goes away so there isn't information overload
Battles actually take place in 3D space as well
Skilled players WILL use height to flank from above and below to avoid being subjected to a full broadside of guns
Fighters zoom around ships without regards to direction, attacking from multiple angles
This isn't "2
5D" as I would call it, you NEED to use height, especially with fighters
Two camera modes
One is the standard battle camera, which you spend most of your time in for orders in a small area, and a strategic camera, which is an "at a glance" of the battlespace with a LOT more information and large map wide movement
The space bar is the simple key to switch between them
In the story, you must be somewhat careful of losses (but it's not so bad that it inhibits gameplay)
Every mission brings the resources, ships, and research that you have from the previous missions
You are quite literally a nomadic fleet
Resources on each map are *not* regenerative, even in multiplayer, so grab what you can! Think starcraft in terms of resources: it's plentiful, but resources will run out in a prolonged battle
The story itself: It's of loss and sacrifice, hope and victory
It's quite a roller coaster of emotion
Soundtrack: Very "spacey" feel that is well designed to suit each mission
Plus, mission 3 on HW1 had the best freaking use of a classic choir song (Agnus Dei - Adagio for strings) I've ever heard
My only regret: the source code to HW:Cataclysm is lost
There's no remastering it
It's not considered canon, but it was still fun playing as the mining faction's ship "Kun-Laan" and fighting the galactic cancer known as "The Beast"
EDIT: Made a grammar mistake, fixed
Kun-Laan is the mining faction's ship, but I forgot to mention that their faction name is "Somtaaw"

												Without a doubt my favorite PC game ever
Homeworld games are works of art
I still remember all the jobs I lost and exams I failed because of the multiplayer alone
Now I have a wife and a son
I am going to miss them

												As a kid, I remember asking my father about all the different ships as he was playing the original Homeworld
As soon as the Remastered version came out, I had to buy it
Overall I'm very happy with the game
The remastered version is beautiful, and in my opinion one of the best things about it is that it has a great storyline behind it
While I understand that not everyone cares about that, for me it makes the game so much more
Homeworld offers a rather unique experience as a strategy game in a 3 dimensional enviornment which isn't really like anything else I've played
Both HW and HW2 remastered versions seem to be optimized well, as I've never had any lag or framerate issues
I can't speak for the mods, as I haven't yet felt the need to utilize any - there hasn't been any that I've seen that have caught my eye as a "must have"
Some people have complained about scenarios being more or less difficult depending on how well you're doing throughout your campaign
Say you fail a mission, but you rememeber what's thrown at you and plan accordingly beforehand - the next time you start it stronger only to find there's even more enemy ships
Personally I kind of have mixed feelings about this aspect, it makes the game more unpredictible and more challenging, as you can't plan for everything the way you can with most other game's missions/scenarios
As a negative, I have encountered a couple small glitches with scenarios, such as objectives not checking off as complete even though you've finished it, therefore making the scenario impossible to finish
I also don't particularly care for HW2, the storyline and ship variants just don't do it for me
In my opinion the first game is far superior but that's simply a matter of opinion
I can't say I have anyone to try Multiplayer with but I think it would be an excellent MP game with a few friends looking to out-strategize one another
In conclusion, I recommend this game to anyone looking to try out a new type of strategy game in a 3D space enviornment, or anyone who gets their kicks out of a great back story like myself

												Homeworld 1 is a classic for its well done story and deep mechanics, and it's inclusion to this pack alone makes it a good buy
The remasters on the other hand are dogged by problems found in Homeworld 2 as they use the same engine, and are ok but still inferior games to the first
The reasons are complex, but boil down to the tactical depth you could achieve in HW1 thanks to the mechanics and physics system they employed to model ship to ship combat
For example, fighters have a impressive amount of maneuverability due to their speed and size, so any ship such as a frigate built to shoot at larger ships will have a hard time hitting them when the figher is at full speed
However when stationary they're sitting ducks and ANY weapon can easily hit them, which is more often than nought when they require refueling after some time in combat, or docking to get across the larger maps
HW2 and the remakes dump this for a simpler probability and RNG based system when calculating if a shot hits, so that the same frigate would find it difficult to hit a fighter even if it was completely stationary, simply because it's classified as a fighter
Couple this with the removal of refueling, higher damage weapons that'll see your fleet destroyed and remade multiple times per mission, as well as sometime broken trigers and mechanics in singleplayer (due to being ported), and it becomes clearer why Homeworld 1 is considered a classic and it's sequels (and remasters) haven't earned nearly as much praise from players
Buy it if you're really keen for a great (if old looking) RTS that set the standard back in 1999, otherwise wait for a sale

[Description]Homeworld is a space strategy game that redefined the RTS genre, and remains today as the only game that did it right
A deep and thrilling story (30 missions over 2 campaigns), powerful and anomalous music, and a very unique style of play
A true space opera![Intro]Even though games are nearly 15 years old now, the mechanics and gameplay don’t feel outdated
Instead, they are still unmatched by any other space RTS that have released since
The three dimensional environment requires a whole new level of thinking when it comes to strategy
Now let’s talk about the remaster and a company that actually put some effort into a remake
This was crafted with the assistance and guidance of the original creators as well as the help of a passionate fan community
[Important changes]- Complete overhaul of the games engine- Significantly upgraded visuals, including high-res textures and models- Up to 4k resolution- Sound and music overhaul- Upgraded cut-scenes with clean artwork and some new 3d animations- Redesigned UI for HW1 (from HW2 which also got an update)- Mod compatibility and workshop support- Compatibility with newer operating systems- Combined Multiplayer between both gamesAs you can see, they put a considerable amount of effort into this remastered version of Homeworld and that's why I totally think it’s worth the price tag, unlike any other HD remake out on Steam
You also get both of the original games with this package, which were previously hard to get ahold of, and they are even updated to be playable on modern operating systems
[Conclusion]If you enjoyed Homeworld 1/2 or other real time strategy games, you should strongly consider giving this a try, as it really an experience that is unmatched to this very day! Let’s show the industry that there is still demand for strategy games like this, so that we can expect more in the future!Enjoyed this review?

												Let me start by stating this: - I did not play the original games, so my review comes untainted by fandom both possitive and negative
OVERVIEW:At this time the game is best enjoyed single player
The campaign in HW1 Remastered is amazing and I expect HW2R's to be great as well
The story, cinematics, music and atmosphere all get 10/10CONTROLS:Some players have a little trouble getting used to the controls and while this is in part due to the fully 3d nature of the game I also feel it is in part down to the developers descision to keep the old control system rather than improving upon it
That said, everything works nicely and I found everythign easy to get used to
8/10GRAPHICS:The game is simply stunning close up, ships are well detailed, docking ships looks awesome, the enviroments and FX are great
Could they be better

Probably

Are they good enough, definitly
9/10MULTIPLAYER:PvP is still in beta, so it is hard to judge, but so far things seem real good
There are objectives and that is something I find very interesting as it is unheard of in other PvP games I play
AI is skilled enough for skirmish games and will give you a real run for your money, Changing tactics from game to game and really testing you
Only real issue is possibly balancing still needs to be done on some units
But hey, this is something completely new to the franchise so it was always going to take time
There is however no co-op campaign

Something I find sorely lacking as it is my prefered game mode ussually
7/10OVERALL:An exellent game, I highly recommed it to anyone who loves, RTS, sci-fi, or who is just looking to try something new or find a great story to be immersed in
9/10

												The first thing I noticed on playing HW:RM was how the HW2 UI and seemed to be everywhere
It was as if the whole HW1 game had been transplanted into the HW2 engine


turned out I wasn't far off
Homeworld 1Unfortunately there are a few things that bring the quality of the remaster down as a whole - players aren't able to experience HW1 with it's Ballistics physics engine intact (shots fired could be evaded or go on to hit something else), instead shots fired by ships generally always hit (some RNG seems to be involved) the selected target as in HW2
This is a large part of what made HW1 stand out from other RTSes at the time (in fact most RTSes nowadays) and made certain manoeuvres such as doing increased damage to ships when attacking them from behind, etc, possible since damage resistance was also modelled as part of this engine
As far as I can recall this was not something that was taken through to the original HW2 or the Remaster
Pretty big deal in my opinion
Formations in general are completely borked, meaning that a lot of the tactical (and at the time, genre defying) flavour of HW1 is completely absent; while I don't particularly miss the fiddly micromanagement and lack of context sensitive clicks, I do miss the extra depth of tactics that formations offered
If Gearbox ever start work on a Homeworld: Cataclysm remaster (the original HW:C = my favourite game of the series) they have to get this fixed
Good news is that a patch may be on it's way to restore formations to their intended form
Overall I still enjoyed playing through the HW1:RM campaign, and ultimately found it more "playable" than the original (especially while using a Steam Controller)
Basically I found the game easier and more accessible than it used to be, which for newcomers and busy old-schoolers like me is not a bad thing
I think it's a huge shame we never got to see the original ballistics physics etc on todays capable machines however
Homeworld 2Being completely honest I originally played Homeworld 2 the least of the games in the series, however I feel that the remaster did a solid job of restoring and enhancing the game for compatibility while staying pretty faithful to the original
The remastered graphics really shine here, fleet battles are a thing of beauty
Seriously, pick a fight and soak in that goodness, JUST DO ITSince the remaster has been so good to the game I have in effect enjoyed HW2 anew - I'd basically offer this collection as an instant recommendation for fans of the original
The only issues HW2 fans might have is that the voice actors from HW1 have been used instead of the ones they may remember from HW2, as well as a few other VA changes here and there (notably Makaan)
GeneralGearbox have been patching things up slowly, with various bugs and issues like bad pathfinding (crashing into asteroids) being fixed
There are still issues like formations not working properly and friendly ships merrily continuing to pour heavy firepower on ships you are boarding/salvaging to add to your fleet, amongst other things
Scoring based on faithfulness to the spirit of the originals;-GFX/FIDELITY 8Glorious hi-res Fleet battles and Furballs, gorgeously updated and retouched
The UI scales perfectly and there are sliders allowing you to adjust the scale of varying UI components manually
-AUDIO 7Remastered audio (apparently; I can't tell I'm no audiophile), original voice actors (notably Fleet Command/ Mothership from HW1) brought back and re-recorded
HW Classic sound effects are particularly dated and low-def when compared to the remaster, so good job I guess
-GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS 6In regards to HW1 the best I can say is some patching is definitely needed
HW2 on the other hand is in a good place
If Gearbox attempt a remake of Homeworld: Cataclysm, I hope they get a better handle on what made these games great in the first place
As a Remastered Collection It's a good update on the originals, however it's not perfect by a long shot
It's also a shame that some of the technical limitations that held the old games back have not really been challenged (in fact the opposite, much has been dumbed down)
The unfulfilled potential is pretty crushing in my opinion
Multiplayer is also a bit hit and miss, in that Gearbox are clearly putting a lot of work into the facilitation of mp matches, but the bugs/missing mechanics are keenly apparent at higher levels of play
In any case I have to thank Gearbox for bringing back these games, and can only recommend this Collection as an essential for RTS fans, and those gamers who enjoy a good story alongside a challenge

												At first, I was not pleased with this game
It was very buggy and frustrating, with numerous other issues like HUGE pathing problems, stupid ai and automation problems (Several harvesters waiting to get to a single asteroid to harvest when they're surrounded by unnoccupied other ones)
However, the largest problems lay in the fact that "Homeworld 1 remastered" was essentially just homeworld 2 with homeworld 1 ships, because a lot of mechanics which gave the original tactical depth had to be removed so it could fit into homeworld 2's engine
This meant that the whole collection was a buggy, broken, imbalanced shadow of the originals
But then the June 7th update happened This update (in my experience so far) fixed everything that was wrong
It has fixed formations, ballistics, tactics, pathing (mostly), targeting priorities, balance, and all general bugs (that i've experienced so far)
I can now safely say that:  Both campaigns offer an amazing narrative experience, complete with incredible music and visuals
Both campaigns provide a great challenge, as does the AI in singleplayer modeEasy to use and pick up basic mechanics, with complex ones to pick up laterTrademark 3d movement and map are very well implementedIncludes the 2 original games, fixed to run properly on modern OSs and hardware Maps allow for potentially hundreds of small fights at once which can be really intense as larger strategies take shape Gorgeous visuals and sound, which all run very well Multiplayer supports up to 8 players I think, which can lead to some titanic fights
Overall a great experience and a very solid recommendation after the update

5/10  
Posted: 2 March, 2015
												Let me start out by being fair and pointing out what Gearbox got right with HW:R - the ships look beautiful, it's quite obvious a lot of time and effort was spent lovingly crafting them and they feel very solid and real
The other eye candy like HDR and shadows is very welcome and really calls out to my first experiences of playing HW1 in 2000
Sounds and voice-overs are also remastered to a very high standard though some of the inflections aren't to my personal taste, but that's just me
Now then, onto the bugs and why I can't recommend HW:R in its current state
If you've read the other reviews by now you'll probably have found some pointing out the bugs with formations and strikecraft in general
I am no purist, but quite frankly I think these issues have been understated so far
Not being able to put your fighters or corvettes into formations massively affects the combat effectiveness of your strikecraft (less so for capitals)
Since they refuse to maintain formation (regardless of tactics set) they will not fire en masse and you the player cannot position them precisely where you need and want them
A wall of just 9 heavy corvettes in HW1 would easily demolish a flock of enemy fighters if managed correctly
In HW1 the same force takes at least 3 times as long to complete the same engagement and you’ll probably take losses
I've seen positive reviews on here downplaying this issue which I find hugely disingenuous to say the least
I'm going to have to make a video showing HW1 and HW1:R side by side to really illustrate just how much this affects the game and almost everything you do in it, it really is that fundamental
Formations aside, the path-finding for strikecraft again is quite poor
Ships like the heavy corvette with heavy forward firepower seem to insist on circling the enemy and trying broadsides to no effect, which is probably why the fights take forever to finish
Because your ships refuse to stay in formation they will also largely ignore player attack-move commands during combat (ctrl+A)
Other reviewers have already pointed out the firing system changes as well, but I really have to emphasise just how much this negatively impacts the game
Basically, in HW1 your ships would fire bullets that would actually travel through space i
e
no hitscan or RNG
Since this is no longer the case your ships are at the mercy of the Random Number Generator and setting them to evasion tactics has literally no effect where as in HW1 it could vastly improve the survivability of your strikecraft
I understand a lot of these changes were implemented to allow compatibility between HW1 and HW2 to enable multiplayer which is just fine imho
However, I consider the formations and tactics issues as bugs since they severely handicap HW1 strikecraft compared to their HW2 counterparts, not to mention that it robs the player of a huge degree of tactical control
I love Homeworld, but being unable to control my strikecraft effectively reduces the whole thing to pumping out ships, sitting back and hoping for the best
The pathfinding and formations issues are major bugs and I hope to the almighty Gearbox get on top of this crap

												We all know what made Homeworld great
We all know Gearbox made a visually stunning remaster
What needs to be said now is what Gearbox did to make the remaster a disappointment
While the following things may sound petty, they fundamentally change how the game is played and the emotional tenor of the story:-removing formations-removing stances-removing fuel for strike craft-reworking repair mechanics (repairing is now not feasible in combat, it's more meant for between battles)-making diffculty scaling much more aggressive-replacing the ballistic simulation for random number generation combatHomeworld was always a story of disempowerment
Of overcoming long odds at the brink of genocide
You were perenially starved for resources, and forced to be extremely careful when shepherding your tiny little fleet
Put your craft into evasive mode and they'll live longer
Put them into aggressive mode and they'll kill faster
Use your support craft to keep expensive ships alive from mission to mission
Use the almost Napoleonic wall formation to concentrate firepower, but don't try complex maneuvers with it
The level of care you had to put into your fleet assets, great and small, contributed a lot to the overall feel of the game
Now, stances have been removed
Formations have no effect, and fall apart the moment your ships enter combat
Fuel for strike craft has been removed
Support ships are now so unwieldy and take so long to engage that they are only useful outside of combat
Individually these changes wouldn't be so bad, but taken together they rob Homeworld's story of it's gravitas, and it's gameplay of almost all its depth
It's hard to care about your fleet because your ships are now throwaway items, and honestly there isn't much for you to do with them other than throw them at the enemy fleet and designate targets
What was once a game of tactics and risk management has been reduced to a laser light show
Pretty, but ultimately there isn't much for you to do but sit back and watch
If you want a pretty game with all the familiar sights and sounds from the Homeworld we played back in 1999, then this fits the bill
If you want a game that captures either the spirit or the tactical depth of the original, then sadly you should look somewhere else

The writing can be as funny as heartbreaking The Voice acting is one of the greatest i've ever heard A lot of the time , the many side quest were as awesome or even better than the main story (That is already amazing )Pro : The whole game Con : Absolutely nothing It's one of the greatest gaming experience I've ever had in my 24 years on this earth

												I am 75 years old and really enjoyed this game
In this game I could do all the things I was once able to do but in my twilight years can no longer do
There should be more games like this for us seniors
The graphics were exellent
I very much dislike and dismiss the cartoon type graphics in most other games
The visual aspects of the game were superb, realistic and sometimes even breathtaking
The attention given to detail needs to be congratulated
The storyline was only just satisfactory but this was complemented by all the interesting charecters involved
Please continue to amaze us gamers with your excellent work

												The best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and second part of The Witcher
You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better
- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,- Story, which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something what makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which makes from every single battle - an unforgettable memory,- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally something dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his misery
The Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions)
Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them
All in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade)

Ignore me having 8 hours on this account, I finished the game twice and have 100+ hours on this game
QualityRatingReasonPerformance8
5/10You need a great PC to be able to run this game at maxed graphics, I got a steady 60 FPS on all ultra settings, with the occasional drop in the capital
Controls9/10Controls using a keyboard and mouse is weird, I had to get used to it
Once you've learned the controls it feels natural though, it's not like there's any inconvenient keymapping
I still recommend using a controller since it's a hell of a lot easier
(I didn't use a controller since I'm not comfortable with it, it was still fine for me)
Ultility7/10Playable only on Windows
GameplayRatingReasonChallenge9
5/10If you play this game on easy, it's a walk in the park, you destroy everything you see, and Geralt is some sort of God who almost can't be killed
On Death March however, everything else is a god and it's so hard to get further in the game
I found this the most fun experience, for a reference; On Death March enemies have 80% more health and do 230% more damage, also you only gain 80% experience from everything whilst on this difficulty
Content10/10A big open world, with a lot of things to do, hours upon hours of content after you've finished the main story
Side quests, collectibles, bounties, amazing DLC (some free some paid for)
One of the few developers that give free DLC that aren't just reskins or anything, but actual quests
Big + on CD PROJEKT RED for this Story10/10I compare stories like this with other amazing storylines like The Last Of Us, it doesn't even get close to how good the story of The Witcher is
Such an indept story, amazing eye for detail, and I really got involved in the characters
Diversity10/10The main story gives you a whole lot to do, exploring the entire world, even going back to Kaer Morhen
Whilst all the side activities give you even more to do (as I've said with content) all the bounties, collectibles, quests for armour, quests to help strangers, ''random'' events and DLC, you'll be busy for quite some time
DesignRatingReasonGraphics10/10The graphics are insane, I can't describe how good like they are, I suggest you search for some video's just reviewing the graphics if you really want to get an indept view of it, all I can say is that this game will be pleasant to watch / play

Everything is just amazing really
Great music whilst in combat as well, makes me want to keep dodging the enemy so the music doesn't stop, it really puts you in the right mood for this game

9/10I wish I could give this a 10, but it's really hard to call something perfect, but there's always little flaws with something like mapping, if I really wanted to start nit picking on them
But the world of Witcher is amazing, it feels alive and even though it's a really big world, there's little details everywhere
Interface10/10The interface is solid, it looks great, and does what it's suppose to
Not really anything else to add there
Final Score: 10/10Don't let the score fool you, it's not perfect, nothing is
Yet this game is at the same time
I love it, 99% of the people who played it love it
Do you like killing monsters, a medieval setting, a great story line, or just a good looking game? You'll definetly love it

												So we got a game in 2015, the complaint of which for many people was overwhelming contentWe got a DLC for the game in 2015 which was better than all the games in the yearWe got a DLC for the game in 2016 which was better and had more content than most games in the yearThe base game and DLC together costed less than most AAA games of the yearA game that had an artistic vision, a game that wanted to push boundaries in terms of narrative and choice/consequence based decision making in a living and breathing open world, with characters that are memorable and relatable
A game whose developers knew what gamers wanted
WItcher 3 has launched CDPR into the league of great developers like Looking Glass, Rockstar, Valve, old-Bioware etc




My only complain with this game is that it made other modern games feel obsolete
This is the game of the generation by such a huge margin, it's not even funny

'There's nothing behind me
I'm a Witcher, I'd have heard it
Just like I can hear your heart
Which is pounding


like a liar's
'Geralt of Rivia__________________________________________Introduction'The Witcher III: Wild Hunt‘ has won so many awards and has been praised by so many people that it’s kind of impossible to miss or ignore this game
It’s the third part in the videogame series based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski and represents the end of the famous videogame trilogy of Geralt of Rivia, a
k
a the White Wolf or the Butcher of Blaviken
To cut a long story short: The game lived up to every expectation I had and exceeded them with ease
Even the games‘ minigames are better than many full-price titles – yeah exactly, I’m talking about you Gwent, you awful little drug that I can’t get enough of…The main story connects to the events of the second Witcher game 'Assassins of Kings‘ and brings the overall story started in the first part to an end
Witchers are infamous monster hunters, magically improved mutants that are simultanesously feared and needed in a world threatened by dark creatures, evil spirits and living nightmares
Geralt of Rivia is a famous specimen of this kind and thought for a long time that his former friend and love, the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg, was already dead
However during the recent events in Loc Muinne he learned that this was not the entire truth and so he decides to start a new journey to finally find answers to his questions
A huge world with fascinating lore and characters awaits the White Wolf - the sheer quantity of places you can visit, persons you can talk to and monsters that have to be slain would be enough to  fit in several other games
This world is not only packed with interesting stories, dialogues, quests, fearsome monsters and an insane amount of details behind every corner, moreover it is convincing and far away from all the happy fantasy clichés you've already seen a hundred times
There is neither black nor white, just many shades of grey
Elves are neither the glorious archers nor the kind tree people, humans not the friendly guys that accept every race the same and dwarfes are no gentle stone-loving miners
In this world you have to make choices that you won’t like and to live with the consequences
Morally ambiguous is the description you’re looking for
__________________________________________Graphics and AudioRegarding the technical aspects this game conquers Mount Olympus easily (despite the much complained 'technical downgrade‘) as it is one of the most beautiful RPGs I’ve ever seen, with amazing sunsets/sunrises, spooky nights and gorgeous views over detailled landscapes full of nature and terror - this game is definitely gorgeous
You want to see some examples? Let me show you some screenshots taken from the game using only the additional E3FX and the free camera from the console:http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=639380403http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=657195325http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=626638385In addition to the stunning visuals there is also brilliant music and fantastic voice acting that will catch you during dialogues or pumps you up during the fights
Together with the exquisite characters, the superb dialogues and all the deep little stories the game suceeds even more in creating a credible fantasy world
__________________________________________ConsSo now there's the question: Are there negative points at all? Yeah some minor flaws: Talking to every person and looting every stash is kind of unsatisfying as there is no wide variety of things that you may accomplish or find this way, so after some time you will visit mostly the important places and persons while ignoring the rest
Furthermore if everything else may be a 10/10 for me, the fighting mechanic is not as fantastic as the rest
It has definitely improved since the second part but it’s still somewhat 'special' as it lacks unique aspects, a good feedback for the hits and suffers every now and then from targeting problems, camera angles, weird controls or some questionable hitboxes
That now may sound worse than it actually is - from my point of view it's 'still' an 8 out of 10
In addition I encountered some small visual glitches and sound errors during cutscenes but they were so small and disappeared after reloading, so I don’t even care about this at all
Compared to the games‘ size and content there are nearly no problems at all and everything runs more than just smoothly for me
To be honest there is only only real downside that I have with the game: My journey with Geralt will end some day and it set new standards regarding characters, lore and dialogues that future RPGs have to be compared with - and this will be a tough struggle for many of them
__________________________________________ConclusionSo in the end, would I recommend the game? Yes – and no
It’s a fantastic RPG with an amazing amount of content, exquisite characters, dialogues and interesting stories, so I’d recommend it for everyone who has even the slightest positive attitude towards RPGs or the fantasy genre in general
However at the same time I wouldn’t recommend the game for anyone who has only little time to spare, doesn’t want to be immersed in a massive world full of lore or just wants to rush the story - this game needs time
A lot of time
However it pays off by providing a brilliant experience that will take you on a journey that you’ll never regret or forget


…or to be more precise let's call it 'a journey you’d like to forget'
Just to experience this masterpiece again from the start and to get these great feelings again (damn I even ignored the fast-travel option and turned off the minimap and the quest hints willingly for many hours (I’ve been lost so many times) to enjoy the world and the quests even longer)
I rate it gladly 9
5 out of 10 points
__________________________________________Let's end this review with another badass quote of the White Wolf:'I'm a Witcher
Heard you wondering about my swords
Well, one's for monsters, the other for humans

												South Park: The Fractured But Whole is not a terrible game by any stretch of the imagination
But for a full 60$ game I really expected more
I absolutely loved the previous game, The Stick of Truth, and naturally had high hopes for the sequel
However, TFBW just fails to deliver
It absolutely has the South Park feel to it, with tons of humor and references
The problem is that the game just can't coast by on that alone and the rest of the game is just


boring
The story isn't particularly interesting and you never felt there was anything at stake, something to drive you along
In the 20 or so hours it took me to play through the game I felt I spent most of my time fighting trash, searching for collectibles and doing fetch quests
Only at the very end do you see anything in the way of stakes and it all ends with one of the worst final battles I've ever seen and an incredibly anti-climactic ending
There are also other issues I have with this game, the price being one of them
At 60$ I expect more content than I received
The game is very short, even with all the side content included
And the inclusion of a very expensive season pass and day one DLC doesn't help either
And of course the cherry on top is the fact that you have to use UPlay whether you want to or not
Ubisoft


no one likes your stupid client
Stop pushing it
And there are some technical issues as well
I didn't have the black screen problem others have had, but I did have to play through the entire game with a very annoying grey bar at the top and bottom of the screen because my monitor uses a non-standard resolution
Oddly enough, The Stick of Truth did not have this problem so I don't see why this game should have it
The game is also very resource intensive, excessively so compared to the Stick of Truth
And finally the game feels very much like a console port, this is glaringly obvious with the in game phone menus and the control scheme, particulary when trying to do the toilet challenges
In the end I suppose the game is worth a play if you loved the previous game, just wait for a steam sale, it isn't worth the full asking price
But all things considered, if you haven't played the previous game I would suggest skipping this and picking up The Stick of Truth instead
It's just a better game in every way
Final rating: 6
5/10			
Posted: 21 October
												I am confused about this game
The critical reviews are overwhelmingly positive, stating that it's superior to The Stick of Truth in every way, but I couldn't disagree more and that is very disappointing
The story-line is largely dull and though there are a few laughs here and there, the writing is much weaker than the previous game
The cast of playable characters is much, much bigger, but the consequence of this is that each of them gets remarkably little time to say or do anything particularly memorable
This is clearly a poor console port
The controls are odd in places to say the least, particularly the toilet challenges, to the point where your inputs are simply not registered - which cuts you off from successfully completing part of the content you paid for
Crafting is good, but the downside of this is that it makes 70% of loot drops redundant and worthless as you will almost always have artifacts that are superior that you personally made than what you were rewarded with for defeating a boss or completing a challenge
This makes the achievement of success a bit lacklustre
The battle system is better than The Stick of Truth, but frustrating in a few ways
You are only able to attack in one parallel axis with the vast majority of attacks
I'm not sure why we're not able to attack from the vertical axis given the vast amount of freedom we now enjoy in combat
The music is weaker than the previous game and is not memorable
I would imagine that most people can recall without having to think terribly hard what the battle tunes were in The Stick of Truth - I can't do that with clarity for this game
The game has quite a few bugs that absolutely should not be present given how long the game was in production and for how long the delays were before release
The most common example of this is that the game has a tendency in places to soft-lock during combat or following a loading screen
I also experienced a black screen at one point, where the game continued to run in the background, but I could not see where by characters were navigating to - forcing me to hard reset the game without being able to save
I'm at the end of the game at the moment but cannot complete it due to a game breaking bug in a boss fight that has brought progress to a halt and until that bug is fixed I cannot finish the game
That is simply rediculous for a AAA £50 game from a major publisher
The length of the game and therefore the value for money is also questionable
To be clear, this is a very expensive game for what is a 20 hour RPG experience
There should either be higher quality and a greater depth of content available or a lower cost
The forced inclusion fo Uplay, whether you want it or not, in order to play the game is another irritationt that I did not expect, considering this was not present for The Stick of Truth with the publisher remaining the same
All in all, I am not sure why they did not just ask Obsidian to make the sequal
I'm fairly certain that they would have done a much superior job

												I wanted to recommend this game
I really did


but I can't
Let me stress South Park: The Fractured But Whole is a great game - even better than Stick of Truth
The combat was expanded upon exponentially - the tactical nature of the grid-based combat requires so much more strategy and planning than the rather basic "been there, done that" nature of the combat in Stick of Truth
The game world was expanded upon and is even more interesting, with plenty more secrets to find than before
Every great thing Stick of Truth did, Fractured But Whole does even better
However, Fractured But Whole is only a good game when you play the version on consoles
Sadly, it seems like Ubisoft gave this game the "Arkham Knight" treatment for this PC port
Any enjoyment you could be having is ruined by a plethora of bugs, framerate issues, and other various problems
Let's go over the first, most glaring, and most often brought up problems - the DRM and Uplay
Denuvo is infamous for causing players a various amount of problems during their experience
Enough said about that
As for Uplay, forcing people to download your own specific, barely funcioning service in order to play your game is a scumbag move, even more so when you use it as an exuse to lock much of the content of the game behind microtransactions
Not to mention, in order to make this game work for Uplay, you have to link your Steam and Uplay accounts -  a process that can be rather confusing and unintuitive
That, however, I might be able to look past in order to enjoy the game, but Ubisoft royally screwed up this port
If it's not the constant framerate issues or the abysmal loading times, it's the bugs
Dear God, the bugs
Often times, cutscenes will play without sound for no reason, characters will load incorrectly when entering a new area and you'll be unable to interact with them, and if you're really unlucky then the game will just crash on you without warning
In fact, there's a very infamous bug that appears right as you start the game - the game won't load and will just display a black screen, and the only way to make the game continue as intended it to make it go into windowed mode
For the love of God, do not buy this game off Steam
Literally any other version of this game is much better, and much more worth your time
			
Posted: 17 October
												Multiple layers of DRM, need to make a uplay account
It launches on a black screen IF it launches, have to make it windowed mode to pass the black screen but then your UI is scattered around randomly and then there's a ladder in the first area with a bug that makes the game crash
This will be my first ever Steam refund, sad to say
			
Posted: 23 October
												Great story
South Park never disappoints


However, Ubisoft does


I can't believe I paid 60 dollars for this buggy POS dumpster fire
Everything from frame rate drops, sound file malfunctions, black screens, freezing, uplay, dlc and dlc ads
Ubisoft must have cut South Park studios one hell of a deal
South Park sold out
IMO Ubisoft and South Park studios gave a big middle finger to the gaming community
I expected more, expected better


This is a $29
99 game at best
Kills me to say this


DO NOT BUY THIS GAME			
Posted: 17 October
												Game runs on Uplay (not steam), making the steam purchase obsolete (and overly complicated)
 Would love to review the game but Steam and Uplay don't want to play in tandem
 The Steam staff are not helpful, and refuse to refund a non working product all because i got a second copy of stick of truth during pre-purchase that i did not even want away
 Will never buy a pre order steam again if this is how they are going to treat loyal customers
 Steam and Ubistoft are thieves
Do not get this game for Steam
It is daylight robbery
Update:Problem was resolved no thanks to the Steam staff at all
 The game is great, but I'd suggest getting it on Ubisoft since Steam have no work ethic in their help department, and with needing Uplay to play this game does not need steam as a platform
In short cut out the middle crook (steam) and get the Ubisoft games on Uplay it will save you time and might just make Steam think their choices in the future
Still a thumbs down report due to the long winded and useless service from the platform I brought it on
But do buy the game through Uplay it is worth it, the achievement prize system rocks too

 Congratz Bandai Namco and CyberConnect2
You made it
Now can you do all of us a favor? Port the Rest of the Franchise to Steam
Oh by the way we also need more Tales of Games
Gameplay is 10/10
If you've played the Game on PS2 you can't go wrong
Oh and the Price is also a huge pro argument
For 50€ you'll get 4 Volumes and each of those are 20-30 Hours long
So feel free to put in atleast 100 Hours of Playtime to complete all 4 Volumes
Soundtrack wise this Game is pure

												I played the GU series back when in the PS2 version, and I am primarily getting this for the nostalgia
So far, I do not regret getting it
Two things I want to point out:1) I find the price pretty fair as it is 3 (or 4 if you count the newest one, not sure how long vol 4 is) games into one
2) People in the forum are saying this is a copy of SAO, I just want to refer those people to re-watch the intro
This game is being released as the 15th anniversary of 
hack, which means the original 
hack series goes all the way back 15 years ago
 On the otherhand, SAO is from 2009 (light novel)


so yea

 Welcome to The World
 Intro to 
hack//Franchise For those unfamiliar with the 
hack (or dot hack) franchise, I'll start with a basic, spoiler-free introduction
Dot Hack is a now 15 year old multimedia franchise with books, graphic novels, anime, and games, regarding a fictional MMO known simply as The World
This franchise started in the early 2000's, just following the early days of MMOs, inspired by titles such as Ultima Online and Everquest, successful MMOs before World of Warcraft popularized the genre in a more mainstream level
Each entry in dot hack tells a self-contained story about the fictional MMO and covers topics pertinent to online interactions, online indentities vs
real identities, identity politics, virtual reality, social media, urban legends, and so on
Very forward-thinking for a series conceptualized in the early 2000s
Each entry is also fairly self-contained, not necessarily requiring someone to pay attention to every book, game, anime, or movie to understand the one they are currently on, although consuming more of the franchise does paint a wider picture
It's kind of like Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear franchise in that way
On to 
hack//GU: Last Recode This game is a remastered package of 
hack//GU, a trilogy of action RPGs for the Playstation 2 console
It is the second series of games in the 
hack//Franchise but this is an ideal package to start with
The reason why is that it contains a series of 'Terminal' videos that explain the events of the first game series, so while it's not a replacement for sorely needed remasters or remakes of those games, it's a great alternative to ponying up $200-300 for that series, as it's been long out of print
The videos covering the first games are not necessary to watch for 
hack//GU but it provides some extra context and lore for those who care
As for the game itself, from my experience so far it is a competent port
Not a lot of options on this PC version, but it runs well at seemingly a locked resolution of 60 frames per second, ideal for any high-motion action game
The graphics are way better and less muddy than the PS2 originals, although obviously polygons are still obvious, especially on rounded objects
The style of the graphics are in a cel-shaded style, however, so that aspect has not aged as poorly
You can jump into any Volume you want, including a new 4th Volume created specifically for this remastered set
There is also a parody mode I have no experience with yet, but it allegedly contains spoilers and is not meant for anyone who hasn't completed the games
The gameplay of 
hack//GU: Last Recode is a story-driven action role-playing game, framed as an MMO
You have 'servers' which function as hub towns and another parameter to keep in mind for dungeons
Dungeons are accessed through key words acquired through your player character's emails, the message boards of the world, or story events, and the dungeons generated with the key words change from server to server, so trying the same word combination in different servers will give you different dungeons to complete
The Server hub worlds themselves are filled with shops, quests, events, and NPCs that roam around as if they were player characters in an MMO, and you can trade with them
A lot of effort was made to try and immerse you in the idea that you're in an MMO
The combat in dungeons is honestly very simple; one attack button, a block button, and skill triggers
It plays out like a basic brawler with repetitive combos
Do not expect depth of gameplay akin to Dark Souls
Dungeons are generated with differing objectives, but honestly from my memory it's just different floor layouts of maybe 3-5 specific types of dungeons with different aesthetic tile sets as you go along to at least change up the visuals from time to time
If there's two things that make this game (and usually, the entire franchise is strong in these regards), it's the story and the music
If you read my summary of the franchise, the story part wouldn't be too much of a surprise
It holds up pretty well with the topics and themes presented in the plot of these games becoming more and more relevant over the years
Again, I must compare the story to Metal Gear
Specifically, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, except with less pseudo-politics on a national scale
The music is very well-composed and catchy in GU, a large improvement over the soundtrack in the original dot hack games in my opinion
Not as stellar as the soundtrack for the first anime, 
hack//SIGN, though, but it fits the action of the game well
Conclusion If any of what I have said sounds appealing to you, I would say that this package is worth the price of admission as it is at $50
Previously, the games were only on PS2 with no ports to other systems, and physical copies long out of print and produced in limited numbers in the United States, where I live
Saying that, before this I was only ever able to get the first two volumes, and a complete set nowadays of the physical copies would set you back over $100, WITHOUT the extra volume, Terminal videos recapping the original (also rare) $300 
hack//Games, new stuff like the Parody mode, difficulty options, and upgraded visuals
All that said, you could argue this is a way to get roughly $400 value of previously hard to acquire content at the much cheaper price tag of $50
Although I would still very much like it if Bandai-Namco and CyberConnect2 would just invest in remaking the original dot hack game series already
If you're on the fence, I would say wait for the eventual steam sales to take their course until you feel ready to take the plunge
This series has a long history and can be overwhelming for newcomers, so buying it on a sale is much less of a risk if you are unsure
As a fan of this often-ignored franchise I would definitely reccommend everyone to give it a try eventually
This franchise is especially fun to people with experience or interest in games and their development, tech, and AI, even if the series often takes creative liberties with the subject matter

I lent a buddy my original series games, and after he finished he wanted more
After some reluctance I let him borrow the entire GU series
I never saw them again
I assume he found out how much they were worth, I haven't spoken to him in years either
Now its been 10 years since I purchased Vol

I am very grateful they came to steam as I don't own a PS4, I have been waiting for this for so long

												A solid port of a classic RPG series
As a veteran of the games, it took me 16 hours to beat Vol
1's main story, plus an additional 10 hours of (fairly repetitive) grinding for 100%
Volumes 2 and 3 are similar in length to the first, so expect 45-75 hours of playtime depending on how much you want to invest in completion
As for the fourth volume, I hear it's shorter than the first three, but haven't yet gotten to it myself, so I can't comment there
A few comments, take them as you will:-Except in certain instances, characters' mouths do not move when they talk
-There are a few very minor glitches and I have experienced the occasional crash while playing; not nearly enough to stop me from continuing
-The previously-limited-edition Terminal Disc is included, which will help bring you up to speed on the lore and the story of the original series for new players, and expand on the existing lore for veterans
-The trailers claim to have taken the various improvements made in Volumes 2 and 3 and applied them to the first game
This is only partially true; some features from the 2nd and 3rd Volumes are still not present in Vol
1, such as the improved combo mechanics of the twin blades or better charge attacks of the broadsword, or, perhaps most importantly, the quick-switch mechanic
-Some of the Bonus Content cutscenes are not updated to HD, and are displayed in a small window within the game
This does not apply to the cutscenes seen throughout the games themselves; only the extra ones you unlock at the end
-The game's EXP, Skill Points, and Attack Power have been rebalanced to provide a much smoother leveling curve
This version, therefore, is much easier than the originals
-Features a "Cheat Mode" that allows you to play through the story at max level
Considering the point above, this is mostly inconsequential, as you will rarely have to grind in a normal playthrough anyway
-Textures and models still look decidedly old, but passable
The lighting engine and cel-shading go a long way to help this
-The game was made for the PS2, as such it is meant to be played with a controller
It does support DirectInput, as well as all the modern controller APIs
-Keyboard controls can be re-mapped, but mouse and controller cannot
All-in-all, I think this collection has been well worth my $50 so far, and I haven't even beaten half of it yet

												"I told people online about my problems
In real life, no one would care about them, but online, everyone cares
My online friends are all so nice
They worry about me, they give me advice
I just wish real life was like my life online
" -Quote from an article in the game DAMN
This is perfect if you're a fan or a new player wanting to play this franchise (ps2 copies are rare and expensive)
I never had the chance to play vol 2 and 3 because of the price years after it went rare
I had beaten vol 1 a few times back on the ps2 years ago
When this release was first announced I was nothing but excited to get my money's worth
The quality of the game feels really good and smooth
The combat is pretty straightforward and simple with a one button attack but you get additional skills to execute
Additionally, you also have recovery attacks for more strategy if I may say so
It doesn't sound fun from words alone but it is when you have your hands in control of the game
Gameplay allows you to do general things you'd expect from an actual mmo like guild management, arena, improve gears questing etc

The game isn't complex by any means
It's straightforward fun as a game should be

Hack GU has a great narrative that give reason to invest time in the game
There is more than enough cutscenes to entertain the story and develop the characters
Furthermore, the fictional forums the game provides in its internet sphere offers branching narratives and lore to the world of 
Hack in game and the real world
The game was ahead of its time tackling issues relevant today about technology when it becomes too much a part of our lives not just for a solution but more so for convenience (which you would have to read in the in game forum)
It also makes you feel like you are in a forum with people discussing these topics like in real people
But even if you don't read them, the narrative will allude to these things or some characters will mention them
There are some minor pop in issues in open fields which can be annoying as well as the LOD for distance in the outside maps
The graphical quality is a decent improvement
			
Posted: 5 June
												So I have bought this game on 05/25/17 and have been only playing this game till 06/04/2017 with an accumulate of 139 hours
Update: 06/22/2017 accumulated about 235 hours and I have payed a month of my Subscription :)
I am reupdating this for the Summer Sale for people who want to try this game and also for the StormBlood DLC update
Positive:-Noob Friendly-Tons of content (heavensword content might be needed if u want to max to 60)-Chocobo-The godlike music-Multiple classes to choose from
-The community seems better than most MMO'S that I have played
-New DLC for more new content
-Heavily Story relient
Most mmos have faied to make a decent story line but this game manged to pull it off
-Fun with friends
-Options to change your HUD settings
-Dungeons/Trials/Raids
Probably the best thing in this MMO with each bosses being unique and it does require everyone to cooperate
Update: Graphics: Even with a Low end PC you can still run this game smoothly
For Medium-High End PC the game looks gorgeous from Cutscenes to the most simplest flower it looks amazing
Free Companies: Aka guilds- If you can find a dedicated Company you can obtain tons of benefits and some can help you run dungeons
(Just joined one so not much info there)Enternal Bondings:  So there is something called the enternal bonding (sorry if I am saying it wrong)
Which are marriages
With an actual Wedding
Why not lol
Not fully detailed about this but I find it kinda suprising to have in an MMO bc this is the first I have heard about in an MMO
Fates: Open World Events that can award you EXP if you can find a good amount of people to run with
(Gotten popular since a StormBlood Update)]-Tons of Mini games that can let you obtain costumes/mounts and cards for tripletriad(Similar to Gwent)Gear: Pretty easy to obtain high end gear that can be obtained from Raids and other methods
Also Relic/Anima Weapons (aka legendary weapons) for a specified class that could take you probably days to weeks to obtain the highest stat
(Looks pretty cool)Classes: Not sure if I was specific with classes in this game, You will have a single character with multiple classes to change into
There are 9 DPS,,3 Tanks,3Healers, 7 Crafters, and a class to obtain ores/fishing
This helps prevent anylack of endgame content
And they can be all maxed out to lv 70
Negative:- Past 50+ the story just feels somewhat dreadfully long, It's mostly for you to unlock more dungeons and trials (bosses), But the story starts to take a much better turn after 
-Targeting system when your in a 24 vs 24 vs 24 PvP Match
(still figuring out how to fix/improve on that) update:  Targeting is difficult because being able to just find the target you want to click will end up clicking your own teamate
Even the random targeting system is random sometimes not sure how it works
(still figuring it out)
Update: Ok its pretty difficult for me to even find any negatives in this game
It doesn't mean its flawless
-lv 1-40: This could drop off alot of people playing this game from probably the story or the amount of content unavailable until you reach lv 50
Neutral:-Monthly Payment: Even I didn't know about this but, It is possible to pay your monthly subscription with Steam Credits
And yes you can pay through steam if you have purchased the game from steam and its connected to your final fantasy account
There is constant update and content just given through this game so I can see why its monthly and I can say its worth it
-Servers, I don't really have any problem with this but if your in an empty server and your asking for help, it might be difficult for you
So its better to do some research
You will que up with other people in different servers if your doing dungeons or any other instances
Also a paywall if your planning to transfer servers with your character
-Leveling: Took me about maybe 50-70 hour just to max out 1 of my classes to lv 50 then an additional 12-18 hours to max out to 60
I don't have any problems with this but sometimes I felt that the gap between 50-60 just makes you want to murder your own chocobo
But its generally worth it if you reach end game
-The story: This is probably the most important
The story took me about approximetly 2-4 days just from the standard edition
I haven't finished Heavensward and that took me about another 2-3 days just to finish 60%
The point being is that YOU will feel rushed and proably feel like skipping cutscenes,texts and other moments in the story
The cutscenes are amazing and the story is good but It felt like the mistake being is that I rushed it just to reach end game
The story could probably take you a month or 2 if your mostly on and half the time
Which is good
Update:-Queue times: This just happened at the Launch of stormblood probably because the amount of Players switching from Tank to DPS
Of crouse it isn't an issue if you are either a healer/tank or if your group at least one of the 2
The Queue times could sometimes average around 20-30 minutes
(Square Enix might plan to fix this issue so this might not be an issue later on
)-Pricing: Not going too complain but for most people they might be stingy about this, If your planning to buy this game I would extremely suggest you to get the complete edition for the standard and stormblood(comes with heavensward) that will be about 55-60$
Reason is because if you were to buy this game individually (like I did) your going to pay more
Free trial: I want to suggest you to play on the free trial before starting this off but it feels like its going to be difficult to get into until you reach the first dungeon trial at 20
I want people more people to play this game but some of my friends dropped from the free  trial probably because they didn't have any dedicated commitment from leveling 1-19
The Free Trial is capped at lv 30 but I get the feeling you still won't be able to experience all the features in this game
But you can max out to 30 before purchasing the game
Updated:I am probably missing out more information about this game than I am right now but majority of it is positive
This game is highly underated and I wish that people would at least try the game at see the amount of potential this game has
To be honest this game feels like what WoW became popularr when Wrath of the Litch King was released
(Not a hate rant)
This game feels like it has more content than GW2 endgame
Both are amazing MMO's but, Final Fantasy 14 feels like the MMO that I was missing in my life
If Square Enix keeps up the constant updates I am willing to keep playing

												I gave up WoW (or World of Warcraft) For this game
Why? You only need one character to play every class
The classes build off of eachother to add diversity to your play style as well as to upgade into more role focused jobs
You can craft your own gear, you can make your own food and you can play 90% of the game ALL BY YOURSELF! You don't have to be in a guild or part of a click
The people who play this game are shockingly friendly and supportive
Dungeons are part of a finder in game
The story line is epic and the cinematics are breathtakeing
The opening video almost had me in tears just because I knew what was happening without any words
Square has really outdone themselves with this title and I can't wait to see how they wow me with FFXV!Edit: As per a commented question, The sub options come in 30/90/180 day increments and can be set up as recurring (thanks Pasty858)
180 days is roughly $78
Also, anyone who would like to share in the recruit a friend benefits, message me
SO! Its been a while since I've played
after logging over 200 hours that weren't counted on here, and doing everything short of Savage content, I have to say that I never thought I would play a game that would tug my heart strings so much again
But this game
The most recent MSQ line just keeps the punches coming
It was amazing! If you love FF games, you must give this one at least a one month (or 14day) trial period!

9/10 - Would Manderville again
This review was written based on version 3
0Pros:Consistent, large patches about every 3 months
Gorgeous graphics engine
Deep crafting system
Probably the best storytelling in an MMO I've ever seen (but it does take 30+ hour to really get into the meat of it)One of the most friendly gaming communities around
Cross-platform play with the PS3 and PS4, excellent controller support for PC
Possible to play casually and still enjoy/experience the game with hardcore friends
Hildebrand - Game doesn't take itself too seriously and just has fun
Neutral:Game doesn't reinvent the MMO wheel
It is a pretty standard "theme park" MMO
That being said, it is extremely polished and everything in the game is executed very well
Subscription model, I was almost tempted to put this in the Pros column
One of the few games to do this model well in a sea of F2P MMOs
Cons:Tens of hours of monotonous fetch quests sprinkled throughout the game
Usual MMO fare
Long PvP queues, slightly unbalanced
(Not enough people play PvP)Endgame content can be very grindy at times
(Ex: Relic Weapons, and "Run the same 2 dungeons over and over to get currency to buy gear"
)Gil sellers - I realize this happens in pretty much every MMO
This didn't make the list because it happens, it is strictly on the list because of advertising chat spam
On an average day you will see a lot of messages (unless you're like me and are so fed up with it you go /away)
Expect the spam to be cranked up to 11 whenever a large piece of content is released
I really feel SE could implement better countermeasures with respect to advertising
It does seem worse than in many of it's other AAA MMO competitors
On a side note, I'm told the JP servers are practically gil seller free
I've never tested this myself however
Overall, not a huge con, but an annoyance none the less

Posted: 19 January, 2015
												I've never been an MMO player
Briefly played Tera - liked it but found progression slow - and briefly WoW - disliked the combat, just felt like button mashing
I also played Mabinogi for a short while and really disliked the game's mechanics
One day I felt the urge to play one and I knew a friend was planning to start this so I bought it but neither of us started
9 days ago a friend of mine was looking for people who wanted to start and I decided that if it was in my steam list I may as well try it out
I am now 95
9 hours in according to steam and I love it
I've just hit level 50 and got my Paladin armour and I'm still looking at all the content coming up
As I speak server is going down to patch even more content into the game
So here's the detailed review:StoryThe story is a good one as far as MMOs go (based on my limited experience)
I'd equate it to WoW in some ways as FFXIV builds off of an already established lore but is still extremely easy for new players to get into
I don't want to say much about it but Square Enix really put work into making a good story
It teeters a bit at times, especially around the middle (lv30-40 is a bit slow) but it's very enjoyable if you get into it
ClassesCombat classes are fairly traditional: tank, support, ranged DPS and melee DPS
Still within these wider definitions, each individual class is fairly unique
To add to this you are not restricted to the classes that you pick at the beginning of the game
You will unlock the ability to train any and all classses as you wish which allows for a lot of flexibility
But "Oh, the grind ¬¬" you say
Nope, all classes trained beyond the first receive exp gain bonuses which really speeds up the process
This is alongside the quick levelling options which I'll discuss in a later section
There's more though! All combat classses have a progression called a "Job" which is earned by reaching a certain point in the story, getting a class to lv30 and the corresponding second class to lv15, and then finishing the job quest
It's actually really easy to do and it encourages you to try a different role
All combat classes are unique and don't overlap much at all which is great
As for crafting classes, there's a fair few of them and I have limited experience of them right now but crafting itself isn't just sit there and wait for things to appear
There's an active process and is fairly enjoyable
Just like the combat classes, new skills are unlocked and it becomes a sort of strategic minigame
Quick synthesis for bulk items is available as well so you don't have to do it for each item
Still I can see crafting becoming tedious
repetitive and boring at some point but that's no different from any other mmo
Also, unlike the combat classes, the crafting classes aren't really unique
CombatThe combat system is targetted, which honestly I was sceptical about when first going in as I'm not a big fan of targetted combat but it grows on you
This is mostly to do with how the game feels since you really have to think about movement, positioning, skill orders, skill timing etc
from more or less the beginning of the game
This is a big deal and playing the first 20 or so levels in WoW feels boring and just mashing buttons in a certain order
The 2
5sec global cooldown adds to the strategic element of it too
You have more time to think and decide what move would be appropriate, but you also have a longer window to be punished for choosing the wrong skill
I honestly think this is way more fun and interesting compared to other games with a much smaller global cooldown
Another important point is that this game is very controller friendly
It's on the PS3/PS4 with cross platform support so that would be why
I personally play with a controller and it feels very smooth
I don't feel too overwhelmed with skills and I've unlocked all of them for my job with 3 cross skills in use as well (I have 2 full hotbars but it's very easy to switch between them)
It's down to preference in the end but the option is really nice to have
LevellingThere are so many different ways to level it's crazy
Though the main story quest is compulsory, there are loads of side quests available
If you think quests are repetitive you can switch over to doing FATES which are events that spawn that give gil (money) and experience to everyone that completes them based on the level of participation
If that's boring there are many different dungeons to do with solid exp gain on all of them
Duty roullete will give you bonus exp once a day so deffo worth doing that
No? Then you can do levequests which are contracts to do certain things in certain places which you can get by using one of your levequest allowances (which refill regularly)
Levequests are available to crafting classes too and are considered the fastest ways to level them
Still not enough? Then Guildhests might be for you
These are very similar to levequests but you're put into a duty (instance) with a party and asked to do it as a group
There's a daily bonus on guildhest roullete as well so that's good
Also, the first time you do a certain dungeon, levequest or guildhest you'll be granted bonus exp which is always a definite plus
Still too slow? Not enough content? Too repetitive? Well if you're that hard to please then I guess I should tell you that there are these things called logs which grant bonus exp for doing certain things
A hunting log will ask you to kill x number of y, while a crafting log will give you the list of everything you can craft
The king of all these is the challenge log which refreshes weekly and gives you a lot of exp for completing tasks like "complete 3 dungeons" or "complete 5 levequests"
Honestly there are so many different ways to level that players can pick something that suits them and though some can get repetitive they're fun for the most part
EndgameYou only need to google the game to see the amount of post lv50 content
The game's been out for about a year and there are things constantly being added
The first expansion is coming out soon so keep an eye out for that
Most people will tell you that lv50 is just the beginning, and they're probably right
I'm only just getting into the endgame and I look forward to everything coming up
PriceWell
This is the one major downside I see to the game
It's very expensive
Though nothing new for an mmo, it is a pretty heavy financial commitment compared to most other steam games out there
Especially considering you can get Tera, Mabinogi, and loads of other mmos for free now
You can buy gametime online from other sellers for a bit cheaper but it's still expensive
I suggest playing the trial to give you a better understanding of whether you'll enjoy it
I highly suggest it and will be playing it, but I can appreciate that a few years ago I could never afford to play a game like this
ConclusionI honestly think this is the first mmo to seriously impress me with its ability to keep you interested
It doesn't overwhelm you, nor does it leave you with nothing to do
Bosses are often really cool and have interesting mechanics, even from an early point in the game
I really do feel that besides the price this game is practically perfect
It's a great game - buy it if you can

												I was a WoW player
I played every expansion, I did HC/Mythic raiding, I spent thousands of hours playing it
If I could go back and get this on launch day instead, I would do it in a heart beat
If you are an MMO players, this  is hands down the best MMO on the market
 I've played every major MMO since Ultima Online back in the 90s
FFXIV has every element you could want in an MMO and executes them extremely well
The class system, all classes being available on a single character, is amazing
No alts, not that you can't have them, you just don't need them
The story is captivating, you actually want to read the quests and see what happens rather than just click through to get the objectives
Speak of quests, there are a ton, even without the myriad of side quests, and only completeing the main story, you can reach level cap on a class
Then roll in dungeons, raids, leves, hunting logs, challenge log, etc etc etc there is never a shortage of things to do, and they have made all of them entertaining
If you like MMOs even a little bit, stop reading and click the buy button
Really, stop
Why are you still reading
Stop it! Go play FFXIV, seriously

												Final Fantasy XIV, the original one, was a mess
The servers were terrible, payments were unfair and confusing, and the game just made it so difficult for you to enjoy
Square Enix realised, "holy hell, this is bad" and revamped the game, leading to the release of A Realm Reborn
And boy did they do good
A Realm Reborn is not only a more polished FF XIV, it is a new game
It offers so much more than the original
Better service, better gameplay, more engrossing quests, everything an MMO can offer is in this game
A Realm Reborn is by far the best Final Fantasy of the last console generation, and it is perhaps the best FF I have ever played
It stays true to it's roots, but still manages to not be a total copy cat of previous FF games
It borrows alot from the orginal series, when Final Fantasy was at it's best, but adds a sense of freshness so that FF new-comers could pick up the game and play it as their first FF and still have a wonderful experience
Detail is where this game excells
The amount of effort into making this as refined as possible is staggering
You could honestly sit at the character creation screen for an hour, picking the tiniest things about your hero
The environments are fantastic, and it's hard to believe that an MMO looks this good
As well as being the best Final Fantasy in years, it is also groundbreaking in the MMO genre
It offers so much to the genre as a whole, it has made a name for it's self as one of the greatest MMOs in recent years
It is addicting
It is enchanting
It is simply bliss
Square Enix have really made me regain my faith in them, and I hope that they let future Final Fantasies learn from A Realm Reborn
I cannot wait until more content is added into the game, and clock in a few more hours
Get yourself this game now, even just for the free trial, it's worth it
Even if you're a hardcore FF fan, or a newcomer looking for a game to start with
This is the one
+ Essentially has it all
Near enough limitless gameplay hours+ Environments look stunning, attention to detail is incredible+ Smooth gameplay, easy to learn mechanics+ Makes great homage to previous Final Fantasy games- A lot of fetch quests- Occasional bug here and there10/10
This is a fantastic game
Get it
Now

UPDATED MAY 08, 2016: You can still find people in multiplayer
			
Posted: 25 November, 2013
												Whether you prefer Single Player, CO-OP or Multiplayer, this game has all three of them
I have reviewed all three parts of the game if you are considering buying this
CAMPAIGN REVIEW (Single Player):The campaign is about 6 hours long roughly
It can be shorter or longer depending on your selected difficulty
The story itself is very good and is set 5 years on from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
It is not a Hollywood Blockbuster but at the same time it is not some random quickly written story that was put together in a few hours
Every mission has different objectives and you can feel the climax building up to the finale of the game
Every level is action filled and there is never a dull moment in the campaign
As you progress you will play in different locations in the world such as: Afghanistan, Brazil, Russia, the Atlantic Ocean and the United States
Even after completing the story there are Intel collectables to find and of course Steam achievements
There are also quite a few Easter Eggs in the campaign levels
The story for this then continues on into Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3SPEC OPS REVIEW (Single Player / CO-OP):The Special Op missions are mostly the campaign levels but switched the other way round and with different objectives in the level
There are a total of 23 spec ops missions in MW2
21/23 of these can be done on your own or with a friend
There are 2 Spec Ops missions that can only be done with a 2nd player
The missions get harder and harder as they go on
Some of the levels in this have been re-used from COD4
There is no matchmaking for the Spec Ops so the only way to find another player is to invite / join a friend and begin playing
There are also quite a few Steam achivements for this like with the Campaign
MULTIPLAYER REVIEW (Multiplayer):The Multiplayer is what is considered the strongest part of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2
Unlike COD4 this time the game uses Steam Cloud, so your rank will all be stored online and will sync every time you close MW2
The highest level you can reach is level 70 with the addition of 10 prestige levels
When you reach Rank 4 you will have the ability to create your own classes where you can choose your main weapon, secondary weapon, perks and equipment
You can also stick attachments to pretty much all of your weapons on here
You can also unlock weapon camos for your main firearms, which some look very cool when placed on
You have the ability to join friends in a session and vice versa (provided there is space) and host your own private matches for this
Conclusion: I highly recommend buying this game if you are reading this out of personal interest or if the game has gone up for sale
I recommend playing the Campaign before going to Multiplayer to get a feel of the game, but it is of course entirely your decision
Things to be aware of - There is no direct controller support for this game
If you are considering the DLCs, it should be noted that there are less players than that of 2009 - 2010, so the only two main playlists are the base game and those who own both of the DLCs
If you only buy 1 DLC, you will find literally 0 games on there
MW2 Multiplayer has no dedicated servers
It uses a matchmaking system that will pair you up with other players in the same playlist and game mode as you
This game uses VAC
So if you are banned for cheating / modding the game, your ban will be permanent
There is no way to lift a ban
You have been warned
At the time of posting the Multiplayer peak for this is around 10,000 players which is more than enough to find a game and play
Campaign / Spec Ops population doesn't go above 5,000
If you have any questions or concerns with the game feel free to leave a comment

												Pros:+Amazing soundtrack+Very well written plot and characters+The different city districts all feel unique+The cutscenes look amazingCons: -All missions (but the prologue) are the same
Rush or sneak in, kill everyone, steal something/interrogate someone/destroy something
-The weapons all feel kind of weak
A 44
Magnum should feel like a hand-cannon, not an Airsoft gun
-Most of the cutscenes are not real cutscenes, so no cinematic effects and just two characters moving their badly animated lips
-The open world looks nice, but you can't do anything but car races and missions
I can't complain about a ripoff or anything like that since I bought the game for 5 bucks, but as a fan of the original Mafia games I just feel let down
I really want to know how things will end up with Vito and the other characters, or what happened to Joe (Yes, it's revealed in this game), but it's just not worth playing through this grind-fest
If you want to know anything about the story look it up on Youtube
4/10			
Posted: 31 October, 2016
												It took me almost 23h but I finished it
Here's what I think about it after beating it
Pros:- Really cool atmosphere of 60s
Huge detailed city and great soundtrack add to it quite a bit
- Solid story with great characters and awesome voice acting
- Solid game mechanics - shooting, driving, cover system, etc - all works well, but there's nothing really new about them
Cons:- My biggest gripe with it - it doesn't make you feel like you are mafia- AI is pretty much brain dead
Especially if you are using stealth approach
- Repetitive samey side-quests that are forced onto you as gates to main quests- Poor optimisation (performance-wise this game sucks on most machines, even after a bunch of patches)- Little variety of cars and guns- Lots of things hidden behind unlocks that are too boring to achieve (wanna get that rocket launcher? be ready to do more side quests, if you are not sick from them yet!)- Game has a bunch of pretty meaningless unlocks, instead of giving you fun stuff (e
g
unlock to steal cars quietly, that comes after an ability to call in car delivery)- No fast travel - and since city is big, be ready to spend quite some time traveling aroundAnd in general, the game feels as if they didn't have enough time to finish the game properly
If they'd allow only doing story missions (the most fun part) and beating the game in ~6h or so - it'd be so much better in my opinion
Unfortunately, now you have to fight those boring gate-quests to get to fun stuff
Which is

well, not fun
I definitely wouldn't recommend buying it at full price
Maybe once it's heavily discounted

												I don't care about what other people say but goddamn i enjoy the hell out of this game
The killing is really fun, the car races are exciting and customizing the cars is cool! To me the graphics are really good and the story is fantastic
Yes it's true the missions are repetitive indeed but they are extremely fun to play, and I really like the mechanic of choosing who you want to give parts of the city to
The guns and the outfits are awesome! Especially the "Special" guns and outfits like Burke's or Vito's style of clothes with cool revolvers and silenced pistols! Man my rating of this game is : 8,6 ! Just because the bugs, low framerates if you dont have a powerful pc, some mechanics that are in Mafia II but not in this one and the repetivness of the missions
Though I do recommend buying this game if you want a fun time killing dudes, racing, getting a good ol' 60's vibe, customizing your character and enjoying a great story!

												I've updated the review after finally beated the game
Just in case, I'll say it
This is my review and nothing but my opinion
Feel free to agree or disagree as long as you respect it
The bad
Part 1
30fps never dies
Tech-wise this game is a disaster
It's not polished at all
Plenty of bugs, blurry textures, upscaled from 720p, capped to 30fps at release (yet even with the unlock, the game is so poorly optimized, it's quite hard to maintain 60fps on high)
Extreme popping and poor lod
I've seen a few times traffic spawn right in front of me
There's this time when the cops chased me just because some random car spawned right in front of me while I was at 120mph and, as you can guess, had no time to react and avoid the crash
And let's not talk about the lighting issues this game has

com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=778292157Most of the models and textures seem taken from 2010, animations are clunky (Except during cutscenes), physics are completely broken (making your car do a barrel roll for hiting a pole)
I can't understand what kind of QA they did to the game and also, where did all this extra time to polish the game go
Let me remind you that this game is sold as AAA for 60 bucks on release
That means, the game must have AAA quality in every aspect

The bad
Part 2
Or what's wrong with the rest of the game
But ofc, as always, who cares about graphics, optimization and animations and all that bs, right? Well, content wise the game is a chore
Main missions are interesting, sure, but there are few and far between filled with repetitive side content in between that you have to do in order to unlock them
You will spend more time driving and doing the same tiresome tasks over and over rather than enjoying the story or the unique main missions
Even some "Favours" that your Capos ask you to do are the same thing over and over and those missions are considered "unique"
The territory system isn't anything new in the genre, you can select who takes the territory but in the end, it doesn't matter
Yes, you get certain bonuses depending on who gets the territory but that's about it
You can't decide what to build, how to expand, how many men you want to assign to certain districts, there's no gang wars (They just don't have any problem giving up their territory to you), it all feels so cheap and simple
A wasted opportunity
Now moving on to the AI, it is dead on arrival
Simple as that
They are utterly blind, they sometimes try to flank you or use nades/molotovs to force you out of cover but most of the time are just dumber than a sack of bricks waiting for you to shoot them in the head
You kill one of their comrades a few meters right in front of them, and they don't even notice
Cops are also a joke, they can see you carrying a dead corpse and not even bat an eye
Pass next to them at 120MPH? Fine
Shoot some explosives? Like I care, Steal money from a shop? Go ahead!, but boy oh boy if you scratch their cars

Many open worlds also have this problem, however, the devs clearly mentioned that they wanted to preserve certain "realism" the franchise is known for, like having to respect the speed limit, traffic lights and such
I guess in the end, they have decided to pull out a Saint's row/GTA
The story is kinda simple and straight forward, and sometimes, cheesy
There's not a single plot twist
It's as simple as they can get
It has some interesting dialogues but sadly, except a CIA agent, a friend priest who helps you, and sometimes the "nemesis" of this game; the rest of main characters are completely forgettable, including Lincoln
The game doesn't develope them during the game enough to even feel anything for them
I could include Vitto to the list of memorable characters, but only because we know his past thanks to Mafia II and that helps to understand his character
The rest, well, you will see them in a few scenes during the whole game and that's about it
You will get more info by reading their bios than conversing with them
 Lincoln through the game till the end is, by far, the worst main character in this franchise
Lacks depth or complexity
His character seems so disconnected from his actions that even a rock, is more complex than him
Imagine a grunt that is most of the time in a state of anger, not giving a fudge what others say to him, and only cares about revenge with 0 moral or any kind of thoughts or personal reflections
That's Lincoln
At the latter "stage/level" of the game, even the nemesis of this game is WAY more interesting and has a more interesting dialogues than Lincoln
And the ending, is abrupt and unsatisfying
After spending almost 30 hours, I was expecting at least something more elaborated
The only enjoyable part is a scene that happens after the credits, and it's not even about Lincoln! Proving again that the strenght in franchise in terms of story telling, situations and characters is completely (except for a few characters and certain moments) and utterly gone
The goodNot everything is bad, the city and environments are recreated with great detail (The few details one can distinguish in that blurry mess)
Great 60's vibe, awesome soundtrack (So many great classics are in the game) all this mixed with the racial tension suffered in the south
And like I've mentioned before, surprisingly the cutscenes are well done with superb facial animations
Gunplay is on point, with many different weapons
There's also good ammount of vehicles, fictional though, but perfectly keeping that 60's style
Cover system works as it should, so no complains about it
You can also use a stealth approach, but only works because of the stupid AI
It's very lite, so don't get your hopes high on that regard
ConclusionTo wrap things up, the game could have been better if the devs had more ambition
This feels like a cheap game from last gen
Like one of those "poor quality/GTA clones" we got a few years back (Like godfather or scarface)
In certain aspects, the game does a good job, but not enough for a game that asks 60 bucks, let alone a AAA game in 2016
Neither brings anything new to the table, everything Mafia III has to offer has been done before in other games, bigger or better
I have forced myself to finish the game (Because after paying for this, I felt like I had to squeeze as much entertainment as possible) but I clearly not see myself coming back to this game to replay it
Where the game shines is at the beginning and certain parts of the latter stages (except for the closure to Lincoln's adventure)
I guess that's why many, who haven't played the game that much, praise it
But once you spend enough hours into this, you start to notice that this game is far from perfect or being that good
Would I recommend its purchase? Only on sales (75% off) and after some patching
At 60 bucks? Hell no
Another game to add to the long list of dissappointments of 2016
I can't wait for this year to be over

												PROS:- First 3 hours of gameplay are really great and enjoyable
- America's 60s - New Orleans


ehm

Bordeaux- America's 60s - Soundtrack!- America's 60s - Cars!CONS:- Pretty much everything else
(Story
Missions
AI
Repetitiveness of game mechanics
You name it
)Let me be perfectly clear
It's NOT a bad game! It is just very poor Mafia game
Everyone who played 2 previous titles knows how story-centric these were
You simply can't remove storytelling from Mafia and expect that you will get away with it
Unfortunately, thats exactly how this game feels - like a sprinter who tries to run a marathon
First 3 hours of gameplay are a blast and then entire experience dies slowly
We already have a great sandbox game which does it very well - GTA
Mafia used to be open world story driven game and thats what players expected and didn't get
There is no reason pretending that Mafia is anywhere near to qualities of GTA 5 when it comes to variety of activities
Result:Establish Czech development team again, hang budget cutting managers on the nearest tree and let former team  do it properly
Unfortunately, Hangar 13 doesn't seem to have a clue about what original Mafia games really were about
If you really like America's 60s its worth a shot, though

												From pre-release trailer this game looked to be like a more expansive version of the amazing Mafia II, but no
Pros:+The story, like Mafia II's is very well written
+The facial animations in cutscene are the only thing the game truly exceeds at
Cons:-Gameplays is needlessly dull and repetetive
You know UbiSoft towers? That optional "content" that was bascialy padded on to every Ubi open world game from 2012-15? That's this entire game essentially, yet somehow worse
-Speaking of repetitve, you literally go back to the exact same areas and do the exact same things in very short periods of time
-Something about the gunplay feels off and so does the driving
-Even on hard, the enemy AI is useless
-The lack of content that wasn't there at launch despite being shown in trailers like changable clothes just highlights how much of an unfished mess this was
-Despite updates to add new features and slighly improve performence, this game still full of glitches and crashes on a more than capable machine
-In general, the game looks awful
Its far more bland than the colourful screenshots used in advertisements and the games lighting in infamously abysmal
-Depsite the well written story, there is so much padding between key story missions that I'd genuinly forget what' was happening
So yeah, this isn't good
Don't buy it
Not even if it's cheap
It's a sub-par bore-fest

wat?			
Posted: 12 October
												Do you like Resident Evil?Do you like Silent Hill?Do you like Alan Wake?Do you overall like 3rd person atmospheric survival horror?Did you play and enjoy the first game?If your answer to any of the aforementioned questions is 'yes', then stop what you're doing right now and buy this game! Let the horror and weirdness galore begin!FULL REVIEW SUMMARY:Now, that I'm almost 80 hours into the game (and still not entirely done yet), I want to share my final thoughts on this incredible experience
Obviously, it's one of the best games I've played this year and there were a lot of good games
Now, I'm not good at categorizing reviews, so I'm going to summarize my thoughts as best as I can
First of all, it's inevitable to compare it to the first game and I personally have mixed feelings here
There were a lot of great things in the first game that are absent in the second, but the second added some needed spice, especially for NG+, which immensely improved the replayability, which was very weird in TEW with the chapter selection nonsense
Right now, I'm attempting the classic mode and it's a total adrenaline rush! I know people loved the AKUMU mode in TEW, but it was a bit too much for me to handle, while classic mode is much more manageable
I feel like if you're a diehard fan of the first TEW and RE4, you might be slightly disappointed, since the game ends up feeling way more mature and closer to RE7, minus the 1st person aspect, which to me was a huge plus
As a side note, I liked RE7, but kept asking myself "why is it in 1st person?", I really hope they'll be back to the classic 3rd person view in the future
Otherwise, the gameplay felt great! You got your green gel, but in addition, there's now a crafting system, which really added the much needed variety that the first game lacked
Both gun play and stealth feel great, mostly letting you decide how you want to approach certain situations
At first, I wasn't on board with the open world sections of the game, but I eventually warmed up to them and now can't even imagine the game without them! The non open world areas are on a whole different level though, as they are stunning, confusing, horrifying and yet brilliant, as expected from the ingeniously twisted Shinji Mikami!The enemies and especially the villains were great, not as iconic as the first, but still fascinating on their own
The story is great, while not being a direct continuation per se, but instead expends on a substory from the prequel
I've seen people debate on whether they should play the prequel and I say absolutely! While not being as great, at least in my opinion, there are too many references during the sequel, especially some throwbacks to the incredible DLC, that it might get a bit confusing as to what really happened in Beacon
Again, I highly suggest playing both, if you want the complete story experience, preferably playing both back to back
To wrap it up, I cannot recommend this game enough, as it will sadly be overshadowed by many other great games coming out this Broketober
If you love 3rd person psychological survival horror, it's a must buy!

												The true survival horror returned!*Short Version of Review*+ Graphics! Stem engine is pretty cool!+ Open area gameplay it's deeper than the first game+ Whole new upgrade and progression system+ Now this game have side quest and main quest like an RPG game- This game might be hard for some people- Some movement glitch on Seb and enemy you will see them turn around to the circle for sometimes
My score 9/10This is better than the first game and a lot of new things
And harder than the first game
If you asking for real survival horror this is your place
*Long Version*Alright after i cooked this game around 4 hours i should say The Evil Within 2 is really really better than the first game
This is dark and deeper than the first game
And so many new shape of gameplay like- Now this time The evil Within 2 is a open area
This mean you can go anywhere or find some supplies and do some side quest before you rush to the main quest
- New progression system
Just not only use green gel for upgrade your weapon
But this time you can upgrade ability like an RPG Game and so many weapon upgrade for the better journey
- A lot of new weapon- AI looks smart than the first game a lot- New enemy type
Some enemy you can't kill them with a 1 sneak hit
this make the gameharder and more challenging
And so many things new in this game
And this time The Evil within 2 is looks like Survival horror than the first game
Because you have to face a lot of enemy with a little ammo
You have to be better man on the first game
Because enemy you've kill they not drop ammo anymore but you just got gunpower for crafting
That's why this game has be improved stealth system
And you will ending this game or not
It's all up to you
Like an RPG game if you explore a lot your character will strong and you got a lot of supplies for use
But if you go on with only story quest
you will feel the pain because your character is so weak your weapon is so low damage
I gotta say this is really survival horror than the first one
Because you can't kill every enemy anymore but you have to choose your way for run or sneak kill on them Or just run away and go on your business
And with new progression system this is really make The evil within 2 have fun more than first game
			
Posted: 13 October
												I'll keep it simple and to the point
The Evil Within 2 is Resident Evil 7 meets The Last of Us
It combines the third person action/stealth of one with the item conservation and "horror" of Resident Evil
The game encourages exploration and good aim and minimal use of resources
A light RPG/crafting system gives an incentive to take risks
And it's got a hot nurse
			
Posted: 15 October
												To me this is the peak, the cream dela cream when it comes to a pure singleplayer experience
A weak beginning that only draws you in deeper and further, a plot that grows on your spine like the undead that stands behind your back as you read this
This is a snapshot in how to make a game without cutting content out for DLC, season passes or loot boxes, something that scares me (more then this game) we won't be seeing much of in the future
If you still care about games that gives you chills, want to support creators visions in this media then buy this game, buy it and remember this game when you are playing Resident Evil 14 and think to yourself "where did it all go wrong"
11/10 - What Mass Effect 2 was to the trilogy and a killer GOTY contender
			
Posted: 14 October
												Didn't expect it to beat the first game but it did by a mile
Difficulty has increased, the story got even more twisted, enemies are more interesting, free roam, side quests
Everything that I liked in the first game seems to be amplified in EW2 so, can definitely recommend
			
Posted: 21 October
 I created this world, you cannot keep me here
  The Evil Within 2 fixes many things from the first installment but some of the things I liked was also gone
 You are  Leon  Sebastian, trying to find a girl in a town where everything went wrong and must use everything at your disposal to get to her


if you are playing on classic mode difficulty, that is
The game is not that hard to be honest, even in nightmare difficulty after you upgraded some abilities and guns
If you are familiar to action-adventure genre, this game won't challenge you much
The design of the monsters that appear in the town are good enough for me, but it's the boss designs that I'm underwhelmed with
In the first game, every boss was unique and some of them even had their own little backstory
They were memorable
In this one, the antagonists are unique and do have their backstory which is great but they lost their creepiness
Only the chainsaw lady freak and the ''obscura'' is what I liked in terms of looks
Also, the final boss is better than the final boss of the first game but is still bad
 Shoot the glowing parts, really?  The semi-open world style areas are not a bad addition in my opinion but I can understand if some players don't like it
It's a good thing the developers didn't just make the whole game resolve around in the same big area
There is variety, as you progress you start to visit different linear and semi-open areas
The environment design is nice and detailed, it is not boring to look at
Now, onto the good parts :) + Controls are much better! You don't automatically stand up when you aim anymore, don't have to stand still while using syringes, can reload while sprinting and stealth is much more polished with the addition of stealth upgrades for Sebastian
+ Upgrades are separated into two parts and the addition of crafting! No more using green gels for upgrading guns
Instead, you have to collect weapon parts to upgrade your guns
Another new addition is high-grade weapon parts and red gel, you use these two items to unlock the next tier in upgrades, these are found or given to you as you progress in the story
This system prevents you from upgrading to the top tier from the very start so you don't get overpowered in one category
Also, you can craft ammunition in workbenches using less crafting items or on the run using more items
+ Better voice acting! I admit the lines can be cheesy at times but still Sebastian is not dull and actually has a personality
+ The story! A father who feels guilty and trying to find his own daughter story is as generic as it sounds but what makes the story interesting is the involvement of mobius and STEM
I also would like to thank the developers for answering most of the questions that were asked in the first game and not forgetting the events of it AND building up on it
But I still have 2 questions: 1
 How did Sebastian and his team went into the STEM in the first game and why?  2
 WHERE IS MY BOY JOSEPH!? + You don't find the story interesting? It is still fun to play!+ A polished game overall!  If you were a fan of the first game: + Tatiana!+ That part after you reach Theodore! + That feeling I got when I opened last projector slide ;_; and after I talked to kidman about it!In the end, I think this is a solid sequel
Thank you Tango Gameworks! and thank you for reading! :)

												As someone who really disliked the first game, I had a lot of fun with the sequel
Combining open world gameplay with more linear environments, allowing for stealth or combat against enemies and catering to both casual and hardcore survival horror fans
The Evil Within 2 tells a pretty interesting story about a guy stuck in a nightmarish world trying to make sense of things and just rescue his daughter
It's scary at times, action packed but always pretty polished
New Game Plus mode allows high replayability and there's plenty of unlockables and collectibles for completionists
With an I7, GTX 1080 and 16gb ram I've had no peformance issues either and the game looks stellar most of the time
If you didn't enjoy the original game maybe wait until it's on sale, but otherwise I'd say check it out

												>Observer_ is the latest game from the developers behind Layers of Fear
Set in a dystopian cyberpunk world, you play as Dan Lazarski, a neural detective known as an Observer
With your augmentations, you can hack into peoples minds to solve crimes all while reliving some of their biggest fears and nightmares
One rainy night you get a call from your estranged son, seemingly in danger and asking for help
Once you trace that call to a decrepit apartment complex in the slums of Krakow, your investigation begins
This game hit me just like Soma did
I wasn't sure what to expect at first, but the environment immediately grabbed my attention and before long, i was immersed completely in the world and its characters
With a mix of Blade Runner, Midgar from Final Fantasy 7, the movie Brazil and the developers own unique touch, the gritty look, feel and atmosphere of Observer are pretty much perfect
We're talking Rapture/Arkham Asylum/Tallon IV (Metroid Prime), level of detail and quality here
While most of the game takes place in and around a single apartment complex, its size and labyrinth like layout are deceiving
I was often reminded of how Stanley Kubrick purposely built the hotel in The Shining to be confusing and off-putting
You constantly feel a sense of unease at the multitude of tight hallways with rooms that are so close, or at such odd places, they couldn't possibly fit inside the building
While the observing (hacking minds) parts are interesting, thrilling and a nice change of pace, the true star of the show in my opinion is the incredibly realized "real world" aspect of the game
Whether you're going door to door learning about the residents, or finding rooms that are open/unlockable and searching them for clues, or simply just exploring this steamy, crumbling, wire-strewn slum, each aspect is immensely enjoyable and rewarding
I would love to see a sequel someday focused purely on these things
The gameplay strikes a nice balance between a walking simulator and a more action orientated title
While you can't jump (something i always miss when it's left out of a game), you can kneel, run, interact/pick up certain items and open things like drawers and cabinets
You can also use two different scanning devices (think of Metroid Prime's scanning ability) to search for clues or learn more about important objects
Although most of the apartments can't be entered, the majority do have someone to talk to inside them, whom you interact with by using a video device located on the door
You can ask/answer different questions which will give you different responses from the tenants (adding to the replay factor of the game)
At first i didn't know if this would get old/boring after awhile, but because the personalities from room to room were so different and entertaining, by the end i was like an addict running around to each door again just make sure i hadn't missed one
Add on top of that the gruff voice-over work of Rutger Hauer (the actor that played Roy Batty in Blade Runner!) and you have one of the highlights of the game
When it comes to the horror aspect, just like with Layers of Fear, the developers chose to use more psychological means than just jump scares (although there a few of those thrown in for good measure)
This is most apparent when you've hacked into a persons brain, where it can genuinely feel like you're in a bad nightmare
Once you make it through one of these segments, you definitely feel a sense of relief since most of these people have some pretty dark places in their minds
And even when you aren’t in someone else's thoughts, you can still find yourself in some disturbing situations like where you have to make a decision to end a life (which in this case, might be the better choice), or safe a life, or just walk away and not deal with it yourself, since neither option is a particularly good one
There are also few chase/hide sequences as well, but nothing too bad once you realize where to hide and what path to take
Graphically, Observer is a joy to behold
The art direction is so dang good, even simple hallways looked like expensive movie sets
Sometimes you'd have slick Matrix like computer code running all over the walls, while other times it would just be filth (this has some of the grossest bathrooms i've ever seen), dangling wires and computer parts
Regardless of where you are in the game though, there’s always something interesting to look at or examine and because each room/area has a unique look or layout you're always excited to see what's around the next corner or doorway
The lighting, texture work and effects are really well done too, adding another layer of polish to the presentation
I especially like the heat/light rays coming from the lights behind windows
The graphics menu has a decent amount of options although there are two things i think people would like to see added
One is a FOV adjustment since it feels a bit low and is only made worse by the claustrophobic design of the building, and the other is a way to turn off the Chromatic Aberration (which i turned off in the 
ini config files)
Hopefully they'll consider these options for upcoming patches
The music, like everything else, is top notch, mixing dark and dreary segments with more futuristic sci-fi pieces and has a very cinematic tone overall
As you can probably tell by now, i really loved Observer
I played through it twice, one right after the other (it should take around 8-10 hours to beat), even though i knew most of the story's twists and turns
I think that speaks to the compelling nature of the world Bloober Team has created
If you're a fan the cyberpunk aesthetic and/or psychological horror, this is probably a must play
But even if you're not the biggest fan of either of those things, you might still want to look into this one, since it just might change your mind
Highly highly recommended
Thanks to Bloober Team for the review copy

												I


don't even know what I don't know
I just got finished beating the game in ~9 hours in one sitting
To be fair, I could have finished it faster but I explored and attempted to do side missions and achievement based things
That being said


WTF did I just play? I finished the game feeling immensely satisfied, but left with more questions than I could even possibly think of answers for
My mind has never felt so royally scrambled after playing a game before
The story itself gives you just enough to follow along and piece together the complexity of it if you REALLY take the time to focus and decipher the situation and all the subtle twists
On the surface it's easy to follow, but each area has SO much more to it
Even without understanding the nuanced undertones to the journey, the story itself leaves you feeling breathless
This is one of those games that I feel MUST be played a second time to even remotely begin to understand all the details that are easily missed or not understood the first time around
And the great thing about this game


I'm left feeling as though I actually *want* to play through it again
This was a HUGE win for Bloober Team
____ Overall, 9/10 rating!Graphics are incredible and gorgeous throughout
Story is


out of this world
As someone who does research in Psychology, this was


wow
Game Engine was very smooth and didn't have any issues with controls or functionality
ONLY reason the game isn't 10/10 is because there were a few areas that didn't seem wholly optimized
Experienced a couple spots where framerate went from 60's to mid-high 20's
I feel, given this is such a newly released game, that this will probably be addressed in future patches
If that's the case, I'll amend my review as necessary
But again, I cannot recommend this game more! I still am just left with an utter sense of astonishment and "Wow!" If I had the time, I'd start a second playthrough right now
			
Posted: 25 October
												The game is really good, but it's too buggy
I encountered two game breaking bugs so far
The support was really friendly in resolving the first by sending me a savegame from after the bug
Of course, this lost some of my achievement and side progress, but that's fine
Shortly thereafter, another game breaking bug appeared and all the support could tell me is that I should restart the whole game
What's the guarantee that everything would work when I get to that point again? It's just not fun like this
I'll have to give it a "no", because it's just unreliably playable at this point

 Bite-sized review Mind matters Review in 30 seconds There is no denying that visually and audibly ">Observer_" is a tour de force
Incredibly stylized, with some of the prettiest and most striking graphics you will see all year, not to mention one hell of a harrowing soundscape, playing ">Observer_" often feels at times like one is being violently assaulted in a dark alley by a dangerous entity
">Observer_" starts out as a cyberpunk thriller set in an futuristic apartment block where a detective, Daniel Lazarski (Rutger Hauer), is summoned by his own son - who it appears is in some kind of mortal danger -  but gradually becomes bone-chillingly more patricidal the further into its labyrinth of broken memories you venture where past, present and future collide in such a way that it would make M
Night Shyamalan turn green with envy
While not perfect (it takes a bit too long to get going and therefore might lose some of its audience) but once the game kicks in proper you had better make sure you are strapped in tight
Absolutely hair-raising stuff and next to "Resident Evil 7" one of 2017's crowning chillers
One word to sum up the experience Mind-bending Performance/Bug related incidents Some slight FPS dips but for the majority ">Observer_" runs really well
  Similar to games "Resident Evil 7"; "Layers of Fear"; "SOMA""; "Narcosis" Suitable for Suitable for teens and up and those with a strong stomaches
At times ">Observer_" gets all "Alien: Isolation"-like scary
Position in my games of 2017 cleared list 7th favorite

												If you enjoy Bladerunner and other cyberpunk movies/games alike, this is the game for you
Pros:- Amazing voiceacting (Rutger Hauer being in this is beyond cool)- Great atmosphere - Intriguing story- Very unique- Incredible original soundtrack- Fantastic Visuals Cons:- Confusing at times- Could be boring if you don't enjoy heavy narrative- No combat could be a con for many people, didn't really affect the game for meThis isn't my type of game at all, but I enjoyed my entire playthrough :)Hope this review was helpful :D			
Posted: 15 August
												I'll say right off the bat that this game has insane atmosphere and detalization
From what I can tell, the horror of this game is not about the jumpscares
It's about psychology
This game tells you the story about people's scars through masterful surrealistic visuals and amazing dialogues which brought to my mind some famous movie directors known for their artistic vision that is quite uneasy for the general public
Not to mention that you're playing as a Rutger Hauer himself, which is pretty symbolic for me as a Blade Runner fan who enjoyed his performance as Roy Batty
Sounds and music of this game match the overwhelming tone of a dystopian world just wonderfully
But if you're not a fan of slow paced games, observer might not be for you

IntroductionI wanted to finish Observer’s story in its entirety, similarly to my review method for Layers of Fear
Not only are these two linked through a few common themes, but they’re both the skilled work of Bloober Team SA
This developer made the perfect transition from fairly superficial arcade titles towards atmospheric video games, more suited for an educated and mature audience
Spelled as “>observer_”, it’s an obvious reference to programming and command inputs among other things
I would never regard this game as being boring, as some of the negative reviews on Steam pointed out, but I have to agree that Observer is in dire need of optimization and glitch fixing
As long you don’t expect instant action, all will be well
It’s a detective tale with an even slower burn than L
A
Noire, but just as exciting!StoryRarely do I write about a video game whose sources of inspiration are drawn from numerous works of literature, movies and even other games
In Observer’s case, the strongest influence comes from 1982’s Blade Runner (a Sci-Fi masterpiece I highly recommend watching) and this can be noticed by the character likeness and voice acting provided by the Dutch actor Rutger Hauer which played the main antagonist’s role in the aforementioned film
Tables have turned and in Observer, Rutger gives life to Detective Daniel Lazarski, arguably the only character in the game which doesn’t have any hidden intentions or motivations
And that is truly ironic since our detective is a titlular Observer
A mix between a Blade Runner (given his interrogation methods) and a cyborg, who’s constantly dependent on a self-injecting substance, in order for his implants to work flawlessly
Just by that last sentence, the Synchrozine subplot can be seen as shout-out to Deus Ex’s Neuropozyne or the Prozium II injections from the 2002 dystopian movie, Equilibrium
It’s evident that we’re dealing with a bleak dystopia in Observer as well, only that instead of a Big Brother (Orwell’s “1984” is present in-game as several easter eggs) or a Tyrell Corporation, the all-seeing digital tyrant is Chiron Incorporated
The game’s action takes place in Kraków, 2084
The Fifth Polish Republic is an abstract yet still oppressive regime whose leaders are never mentioned and they carry little importance to our story
This is in fact a neo-noir tale detailing the struggles of a classic anti-hero cop with a dysfunctional family
The trope doesn’t go all the way though and Lazarski is driven by a strong desire to reunite with his distant son
On a rainy night, Adam finally calls his father
He needs help
What might have given the impression that the level structure is open (Daniel is seen inside his Matriarch AI-assisted squad car, in Observer’s first few minutes of gameplay), turns out that in a same manner as Layers of Fear, players shall get to thoroughly explore a closed albeit highly detailed environment
In our case, a run-down tenement block
A glimpse into a society which is controlled on all levels by a corporation which has CCTV cameras, hidden microphones, informants and death squads everywhere
A devastating war from the past and the still lingering threat of a debilitating plague are the perfect excuses for Chiron to exert its twisted power over all aspects of life
That includes its own employees (Observers, as well) which are kept on the same short leash as the “Class-C Citizens” from the apartments which Lazarski is currently investigating
GraphicsObserver features some state of the art visual assets, courtesy of the Unreal Engine 4
What it shouldn’t have contained though, are the severe frame rate drops experienced on most resolutions I tested, from 1080p to 4K
I ended up settling for 2K since I wanted the screenshots to feature the right amount of details for them to be used as desktop backgrounds
Took close to 200 screens and more than half of them were subsequently linked onto my Steam account
I like the game, especially from its graphical perspective
It fits the story like a glove and many of its visual glitches are a game design choice
The bugs may not be game-breaking, yet I fell through the floor on a couple of occasions and had to restart from the previous autosave point
Fortunately, the game progress gets saved fairly often and it can be triggered by moving from a room to another, sometimes
The frame rate dips are my main concern with Observer
I’ll explain why, without having to boast my system specifications
They are high-end and I keep all my drivers updated along with properly maintained hardware
No highly detailed UE4 games I tested so far on Steam (and there must have been at least a dozen) would drop from 60fps to 30 or less, WITHIN THE SAME ROOM
This is a clear red flag for unoptimization and it happened on a resolution of 2560x1440
When I tried running Observer on 3840x2160, I could expect even 10fps in the troublesome circumstances I already mentioned
The developer needs to fix this ASAP and I can only hope that an update or two will provide the much needed stability
Observer looks amazing, but it doesn’t sport lush jungles and intense gunfights to warrant the digital punishment it currently renders onto my GPU
By contrast, the Unity-powered Layers of Fear ran maxed out@4K, never dropping below 45fps on my PC
I know, we’re comparing apples to oranges but my point is, perhaps Bloober Team should have stuck with Unity Engine 5 instead of Unreal Engine 4 which always represents more trouble than it’s worth
AudioAlong with Hauer’s excellent voice acting, the other characters also sound convincing and the soundtrack was an adequate collection of futuristic instrumentals that would shift towards more classical sounds, during some illusions or interrogation sequences
As for the script itself, there are more than a few swears thrown around by either Lazarski or the NPCs he interacts with
It’s part of the good cop/bad cop routine, right? Still, the detective seems like a troubled mind and he occasionally slips off another one of his monologues
As much as I’d like to share with you the clip for “tears in the rain”, a touching soliloquy by Rutger near Blade Runner’s ending, I’ll let you see the entire movie first without spoiling anything

												This


is a tough review to write
The game has hundreds of points of exceeding brilliance
The game is frequently a battle with the level layout and the UI, trying to figure what's desired of the player next
(especially in the "dream" bits)The game explores topics in ways that haven't been adequately covered in years
(think: puree Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner, and William Gibson books; add salt and rat poison to taste)The game has an autosave system, and at least one point-of-no-return w/o a clear warning of the same
If you're looking to feel like you've mainlined Noir and cyberpunk-based drain cleaner
 If you're looking to feel confused and bewildered most of the time
 If you want to wade neck-deep in poverty, despair, and black humor
 Then get it
(on sale, natch)Otherwise, just wait for some poor b@stard to make a Let's Play, and laugh as they proceed to lose their minds
TL;DR: I have no way to reduce this one to a number which will do my feelings justice
 I really liked it, but I'm still not sure if I hate it too

Early Access Review
								Another match-3 game from SakuraGame, mixed with short visual novel segments
I assume it's similar to Hell Girls, although I don't have much time playing that one so I can't make good comparisons
I'm writing this review after playing the first 2 1/2 chapters of Mirror (out of 8 total in the current build)
Bottom line: For a day-1 Early Access game, this is easily worth two bucks
Even if development stopped today, I would have expected to pay between $5 and $10 for what's there now
The artwork is very high quality, both for the characters and the backgrounds, and there's a lot of variety for both
The visuals overall are the best part of the game, on par with some of the more expensive VNs on Steam - Example (SFW)[steamuserimages-a
akamaihd
net]
The only fault I could see is that the style isn't always consistent - some backgrounds have a watercolor-style appearance while others are crisp and CG-like, but it didn't bother me at all
Music is okay - mostly unmemorable but it fits the game fine
The title track is a standout
The English translation is not great, but it's better than most other games published by SG on Steam
There seems to be at least some human involvement in it - not completely done by machine
I didn't have any trouble understanding what was being said 80% of the time
Hopefully they will make another pass or two and by the final release it could be relatively polished
Each chapter of the game appears to be a self-contained story, with unique characters and plot
Although the gameplay is primarily match-3 in the style of Puzzle Quest and the like, there are also short visual novel vignettes before each battle
They are a few minutes in length, and each one has a dialogue choice that results in gameplay modifier (e
g
-10% enemy health, +20% enemy attack, etc)
The modifiers don't seem to have much impact so I wouldn't worry about making a bad choice
This is because there isn't a lot of strategy involved in the battles
There are only 4 primary icons on each 8x7 board, so you'll be getting a lot 5x and higher combo chains without really trying
These battles are the weakest aspect of the game
I hope they take the time to add some more variety and make them less luck-based, but I don't think that's likely to happen by the time the game is finished
There is an in-game shop where you can upgrade stats and get new abilities, but I haven't spent much time experimenting with it because I've only lost a single battle so far
Again though I don't think it would make a difference
At the end of each chapter is a slightly longer VN section with a sex minigame with the opponent you defeated
The sexual content appears to be mostly bondage-related - nothing unusual for these sorts of games
The explicit portions are censored and there's no patch to undo it at the time I'm writing this, but pretty much every other SG release has one so I would expect it to appear before too long

								Interesting puzzle game
I thought the back story is rather interesting too
You have a little choices matter sort of dialogue
I have a few SakuraGame titles, lives up to their art style, to put it simply
A little on the lewd side
R rated but not completely full frontal, but then again its more echi than adult manga
Honestly I'm very surprised they charge so little for this title
And  with a promotion of 40% off at launch, its a no brainer

 First ImpressionMy first impression is that this game is that the games will be full of nudes, just a linear elimination games
That's all
I bought it since the early purchase will entitle customers to 2 more free gift games
Maybe sooner or later will start having cards, so it is an investment
  Playing Experience	But, I was wrong, not about the nudes things, yes there a lots of them
Few of them are somehow a bit too much for me
(maybe i am a bit conservative)
I was wrong that this game is just a game that use sexy anime girl to attracts weebs
They offer more than that
The animation is nicely done, story lines created are interesting and different for each of chapters/levels/girls
The elimination gem games combined rpg character skills builds so that the gems eliminated will have difference effects
The music is pretty good
It is enjoyable to play this game while listening to them
Character voices are good and such and ear candy for me
Since it is just early access game, i hope they will add more contents, more characters, and more diversity in the game play
I personally would recommend the game
It is not a waste will worth every cents spent

												Have you ever noticed how, in a typical RPG (and, now that I think about it, most games in general) battles don’t really mean anything? How many times have you defeated a miniboss, only to have it stand back up and laugh at you, saying “I have underestimated you! You are a worthy opponent! This is not the end! We shall meet again!” and make a getaway? Think about it
How many times do you beat up Balrog in Cave Story only to have him fly away without a scratch? How is Black Knight able to keep running away after Shovel Knight stabs the hell out of him? How come you black out if you lose a Pokémon battle, but none of the other trainers do? And how does the big bad villain always seem to get away, even if their HP hits zero, so they can reappear in the sequel?Undertale asks the question, “What if defeating an enemy in battle always means that they die?”This might seem quite inconsequential in random encounters, but Undertale will also pit you against several main characters
If you defeat a main character in battle, they’re dead for good, and the whole story changes to reflect it
Heavy stuff
But thankfully, as the game advertises, you don’t actually have to kill anyone! The game offers a second option to get out of battles: talking the enemy out of fighting
This involves solving a simple puzzle, almost always involving the “Act” menu in battle
The puzzle changes depending on what kind of enemy you’re fighting; sometimes you’ll just need to give them a compliment, other times you’ll need to survive several of their attacks, and so on
Once they’re not emotionally invested in the battle anymore, you can “spare” them, and the battle ends
You won’t get any EXP for it, but you’ll still get gold
It’s a very unique fighting mechanic!I admit, after my first playthrough of the game, I was disappointed in the story’s presentation
I thought that both the very beginning and the final area of the game were fantastic, dripping with shocking emotional dilemmas, but the middle 80% of the game’s content seemed like it relied too much on oddball humor and not much else
The game hilariously plays with expectations and has no shortage of genuinely witty satire of its genre, and I found myself amused by nearly all of it, but after the first two hours as I was walking across long linear worlds and listening to dozens of characters try to tell me jokes, I started to wonder where the emotional gravity had gone
“Why is this game making me laugh, when I thought it was supposed to make me cry?” I asked myself
“Where are the feelings? After such an excellent and powerful prologue, why is the game taking so long to show me more?”Later that night, as I was lying awake in bed, the answer hit me: the game was quirky and lighthearted because I was sparing everyone’s life
I wasn’t playing as a murderer
If you want this game to have drama, you have to cause it
And I think that’s where all the hype is coming from, all the talk about player choice
This is a game about being a tree-hugging pacifist, or a murderous psychopath who kills anyone who gets in the way, or anything in between
You only need to live with whomever you decide to be, because the game won’t let you ignore what you have done
Though it isn’t the most visually impressive game, and the stage design isn’t always the best, Undertale has left me feeling that I have just witnessed a work of art
It tried some new and ambitious things and isn’t ashamed of what it wanted to be
It's about 6 hours long; I’d recommend anyone to play it at least twice, just to be able to say that they've made their own choices and seen what the game has to offer
It’s hard to imagine that anyone would regret the experience

												Ten dollars
Only a few hours of gameplay
16-bit graphics compared to the flashy 1080p stuff in standard games
But


wow
Undertale blew me away
It doesn't need flashy graphics or even fanservice to falsify its enjoyment
It just does things right, and boy that was one immensely enjoyable experience
I think most of the magic of this game comes from knowing absolutely nothing about it
I got this game from a friend and just decided to play it since it looked very interesting and it was getting good responses
So I went in completely blind, knowing nothing but the game's name
And I'm glad I did, because everything the game presented to me was unexpected, notably dark in places, and very emotional, which would have been lost entirely if i watched someone else play it
So, if you happened to have been flooded by everything Undertale on tumblr (god help us) and the entire story's already laid out for you, the magic has been lost and the game won't be as incredible of an experience
I'm sorry
Of course, I call Undertale an "experience", not a game, only because it does such a fantastic job at it
Following the motto on the store page, "the game where you don't have to destroy anyone", the game always tries to nudge you in that direction, taking a back seat in your mind and reminding you to "Spare them!"
And of course, you answer with "Why? Why should I do that when it offers me the option to kill anyone I want right in front of me? What's in it for me?" And that's where the game literally turns into a personal experience, as everyone has a different response for the game's selling point
And boy, does it turn to black or white pretty fast from here
Undertale's ability to completely turn the tables of its story depending on your actions is massive
Upon your game's startup, every little thing you do will be set in stone in the game's story pathing
If you're the type who immerses yourself into the game's charming music, laughs at the childish but hiliarious anctics, and is willing to hork down healing items just to prevent yourself from killing a monster just because a fight is difficult, the game rewards you
It opens up a very character-developing and world-unfolding story, along with some of the most emotionally invested boss battles I have ever experienced
You know a game is good when it breaks the fourth wall so well that you're shaking in your seat in true fear and can't stop the shivers, all while having to fight a hopelessly overpowered god of a boss
The amazing writing only starts once you beat the final few bosses, and the story doesn't stop being good from there onwards
On the other hand, what makes this game different is that it keeps its dark side from you, and its entirely your choice to experience it
If you scoff at the game's sparing choice since you're too cool or grown up to possibly be nice to people, you can go around and intentionally sink your weapon into a monster who just wants to be a friend
And unlike many other games, this isn't just a simple moment of "Oops, I killed another unnamed enemy, let's reset the game and nothing changes"


the weight of a dark choice is huge
Nothing can be taken back, and it forever changes your playthrough
Reset the game, and the characters know
Events change
And with each curious kill, you, in turn, turn from the only human in a land of monsters into the biggest monster in a land of innocents
In the end, ignoring what Undertale sets out to do, which is to let you experience childlike innocence and fun, only makes it delibrately change the game into a quieter, more grim story
Very little character development, and the world isn't explained to you, nothing
There's very little reward for going through this route
Yet it is a choice you can do
Granted, you get two of the hardest boss battles by becoming the murderer and will be forced into Game Overs repeatedly from them, but even that is a message from the game


It's trying to stop you from getting to the end of this route
Before its too late
It's as if you're doing deeds in an actual living, breathing world
And that's what makes it even more terrifying when you decide to become a murderer instead of a savior, because only you know that you're willingly going forward to obliterate every weakling in front of you
It's a test of your willpower, and it's your choice
The worst thing? The damage cannot be repaired
Go clean, or go home tainted
The game even gives you the choice to completely delete everyone's happiness after the most satisfying happy ending
The happiness you worked so hard to earn
And you can even become the murderer after saving the world, which will only permanently taint your game and never let you have a satisfying ending again
That's absolutely brutal, and yet that's still a choice
Amazing
Yes, this game might not be for everyone
The humour may become dry after a while for some people, and tons of gamers nowadays like to bash at popular games instead of trying it out, just because they feel accomplished by doing it
But, if like me, you are willing to experience why everyone's been talking about this game, give it a shot
Hell, even if you hate the game to bits and want to kill everyone, buy the game, do so, and at least have your own personal experience before refunding it
This game does the morality concept so well that other games can only dream of doing the same, and it is one not to be forgotten
It is a sin to call Undertale a game
Doing that would categorize Undertale into the bland and consequence-free "kill-em-all" genres that a lot of games are falling into now
Undertale is a story-driven, emotional experience

												This is one of those few games that come along when times are bleak, and games have become regularly bland and heartless
Where you feel disenfranchised with the whole idea of video games
And you begin to start ask "Why?"


Like "Why should we play games?", "Why are games different from other media?", "Why should you use games as a form of expression?" and even "Why even play games at all?!" Undertale come along and says, "This is why
"

												(Mostly spoiler-free review)I hate turn-based RPGs
This is my Game of the Year
What
After becoming ULTRA-JADED about gaming with the cancellation of Silent Hills, this game re-established that games can be really, really frickin good
This thing was made with an incredible amount of love, and it shows in every nook and cranny, every joke, every secret conversation you never thought a game dev would have thought to include
Tobyfox is the most thorough dev ever
I'm continuously impressed with how many things he thought to include in this game, and how he managed to make it all extremely fun the entire way through
You'd think you've seen everything in this game, but you haven't
There's always another amazing thing, another way to turn the genre on its head, another great joke you didn't see coming
And it stays engaging the entire time, supported by a cast of fantastic, endearing, hilarious characters
Great puzzles too, imo! It avoids all the things about (turn-based and non) RPGs that I despise: -There's no grinding (unless you want to)-Battles are a great length and never overstayed their welcome for me-There's no boring menu-navigation-only-based combat (bullet dodging/timing-based stuff really spices it up, as well as bossfights always having a new, really fun gameplay twist on them!)-There's no unlikable/unrelatable characters that go on and on about you being the "Chosen One" or whatever-No plot where you gotta go to the 7 temples and find the 7 sacred whatevers and then oh wait now that you've gotten those 7 sacred whatevers, you gotta go to 4 extra places and get 4 SUPER sacred whatevers


-No backtracking (unless you want to! Backtracking is actually usually rewarded with more fun conversations and such
)-No constant equipping and unequipping items because, oh, this one is +2 Def but -3 Speed but THIS one is +3 Speed and -2 Def but THIS one is immune to fire and this one is


-It actually has a way more complex, useful moral than "Evil is Bad, Good is Good
" Everyone has relateable motivations
-The writing doesn't suck like 90% of RPGs
It has a wonderful sense of humor and a simple plot that is underlaid with complex emotions
-Has jokes about anime, doesn't take itself seriously
I could gush about it forever
Undertale's not only made me less jaded about gaming, but also less jaded about real life
It has a strong message about empathy that stays everpresent, while somehow not being cloying about it, or shoving the message down your throat
It's simply a wonderful experience, please play this thing!!

												I have never seen so many interesting "scare mechanics" in one game before
The whole game plays like you are walking through a haunted house, and it is GREAT
Every time you walk into a new room, you never know what to expect
Bear in mind however, this game is VERY dark, and I'm not talking about brightness settings
Some themes in this game can be very disturbing
A very short but very good horror game with a dark and interesting storyline
Highly Recommended
			
Posted: 1 May, 2016
												I picked up Layers of Fear after I noticed it had come out of early access
I refuse to buy games in early access anymore, so I just add them to my wish lish and wait for them to be "finished"
I am posting this review after I played and beat the game
Layers of fear is kind of an interactive story, puzzle, survival horror kind of game
You play as an artist returning home to work on his opus magnum
At what first appears to be a basic jaunt around his home, quickly turns into a psychological horror, the house appears to be (possibly) haunted as the layouts change, you are confronted by visions of your dead wife and other various paranormal-esc situations
Along the way, you'll collect notes and other memorabilia within the house that offers quick glimpses into the painter's past life, his family and even the state of his mental health
The game isn't as "scary" as other games of this nature may be and in fact, you are put in several situations in which you can avoid confrontation entirely if so desired
As far as I am aware, there isn't really a way to die in the traditional sense, which is nice, because the game is set up in a way that you won't have to restart entire chapters of a mistake you may have made
The writing for the story is farily good, I'd say much better then games such as Penumbra
It's a fairly unqiue and engaging story that made me want to continue playing just to find out a little bit more
The puzzles are (generally) not too hard and there was very few moments I was actually stuck
Unfortunately the game doesn't help you in any real sense, besides some hints scattered about the game and as a result some of the more obscure puzzles can leave players scratching their head
While I did enjoy the time I spent with the game, there are issues with it that I feel inclined to inform people of
For starters, when you first start playing the game, it's fun and fascinating to explore the artist's big, beautiful house
The problem is that very early in the game, the exploration aspect of the game is all but removed, Instead the game becomes somewhat of an "on-rails" adventure game, instead of walking freely through the house, instead you'll be traversing hallways and single rooms
9 out of 10 times, as you enter one room, the door will close and lock behind you, denying any sort of back tracking in the game
This can become an issue, because the game feels as if it were meant to be explored and it was just a concept that was throw to the side
On occasion you may be given the opportunity to travel off the beaten path, but it is almost always just for a moment and it usually results in a dead end or locked door
The missing exploration concept bothers me, because I have always loved horror books, games and movies that involved big, old, beautiful mansions
Another problem that I had with the game is it never really changes scenery too much
A large majority of the game just looks the same
Expect to see a lot of dark, dingy rooms, broken walls and floors and broken furniture
Also expect to see the same art, furniture and random junk over and over and over again
This becomes an even bigger issue when the game starts to begin recycling rooms
Finally, the last problem I had with the game was the story
Remember earlier when I said they had a good story? They do, the problem stems from the fact that there's a lot of information presented for players to process and it's never really tied together or explained in any real sort of meaningful way
While I enjoyed the game while I played it, after I beat it, I felt very dissatisfied because I really didn't learn all that much and the game doesn't really make a good attempt at helping you understand
I have questions, no one appears to have answers and frankly, I am no really into the entire "fan theory community" in which the developers of a game simply don't inform or release information to players, instead they just wait to see if someone gets it "right"
For me, it just seems like a really lazy form of writing and I tend to get high aggravated with it
Don't get me wrong, I love reading long books, I like guessing at the story, or the plots or even coming up with theories as I enjoy whatever book/movie/game I am playing
But I expect the writers to eventually tie down and explain what is going on in a clear, concise and satisfying way
If you like games of this nature, if you have enjoyed games like 'A Machine for Pigs' and 'Penumbra', you'll enjoy this game a lot
If you like psychological horror, you'll appreciate this game
I can without hesitation recommend this game to horror fans, even given the rough spots of the game

												This is a game that genuinely tried to scare me by throwing a bunch of garlic in my general direction
THE BAD Here's how the plot of this kind of games is structured
1
You launch the title
2
You know that everything that happens around you is a visual metaphor for one of the following (because it always is): you being dead you dying right now you being an, ahem, bad person your family/children/loved one being dead your family/children/loved one dying right now your family/children/loved one being, ahem, bad people you having killed someone you having killed yourself you planning to kill yourself you being in denial about a traumatizing memory trying to resurface3
You then play the game, eliminating the wrong options and thus arriving at which inevitable MINDBLOWING AND UNEXPECTED twist this particular one features
(In case you're curious, in LoF's case it's a combination of  3, 4, 6, and 9
)What I'm trying to say is, the plot of Layers of Fear is so horribly cliche and delivered in such a stilted, overwritten, and unnatural way that it actively hurts the game
The story of a Super Tortured Artist living with a Super Tragic-slash-Insane Wife (who is also a person of art, a musician) in a Super Posh Mansion is one that would fit on fanfiction
net, not in a game with a price tag
The worst part is, the writer of the game that is supposedly about art seems to know very little about it, which is why all plot points, letters, and discussions of art remain incompetently vague, afraid to go into specifics
We keep reading how the main character's art became bad, but—how? Why? Did his linework become weak? The use of colors, blurry and muted? The composition, skewed? Did he become repetitive and second-hand? What was the context of his creations?For a game supposedly about art, Layers of Fear has surprisingly little to say on the subject, if anything at all
THE GOODFortunately, the rest of the game is good—great even
Keep in mind that this is a walking simulator with mild optional puzzles (either skippable or impossible to fail)
However, among walking simulators, this is definitely the most visually impressive and robust I've played
It tried very hard to reinvent something as simple as walking—often successfully
For the most part you will follow a linear path along a corridor of rooms
Each room is a carefully-crafted separate experience that does its best to be surprising while still using an extremely limited number of mechanics
Sometimes you need to find an item in a drawer
Or walk past a painting
Or, say, look up
Or turn around twice, with the room changing behind your back
Or maybe just move along unobstructed
And then something surreal happens
It also thows original challenges at you, like instructing the player not to look back and then playing an intriguing/scary sound behind them
It's not too complex, but it's hard not to respect the thought that went into turning Layers of Fear into something more engaging and interactive than a common walking simulator
THE PRETTYThe horrors are of the common screamer variety—you won't find subtlety or taste here
However, there was a particular type of screamer that I really liked, and that was huge paintings sometimes appearing behind your back
They do nothing, they don't even move—but unnatural size and proximity definitely make them uncanny in a not-so-overused way
And yes, the paintings are beautiful, as are the rest of the designs
All in all, I would recommend Layers of Fear to fellow lovers of the genre—especially those who are ready to look past the cliches and enjoy this beautiful and oftentimes inventive game for what it is

								This is a great horror game:1
It's not build up on jump scares, there are some jump scares, but not to the point where it gets annoying
2
The graphics is very very decent3
The controls are okish, but could be awkward sometimes4
The music and sound effect


OMG!5
The way the atmosphere and sense of horror builds up gets scarier and scarier as you play
Man, this is some true horror6
You can actually get killed7
The story is good and very rewarding as you reveal it

Early Access Review
								Being a huge fan of horror games, I absolutely had to pick up Layers of Fear
As described it as a “psychedelic horror” game, as you play a painter who is feverishly attempting to complete a true masterpiece, while going mad in the process
“Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter
” ~ Oscar Wilde The game mechanics are incredibly refreshing, as there was no specific villain you were trying to escape from, for the most part, which meant that the 'environment' was what you needed to fear, including several jump scares along your way
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=519450951Atmospherically, Layers of Fear is astounding from the moment you enter the house you will be exploring
Rain is falling heavily outside, with occasional bursts of thunder crackling behind you
The entire game is influenced by art and décor from previous centuries, particularly the architecture and design of the 19th century, and the visuals are very well tied together with this theme
What also worth mentioning is the incredibly alluring and chilling soundtrack during the gameplay, that gives you the emotions the situation pulls you in
https://www
youtube
com/watch?v=7sB_6mk-XTwI’d recommend the game to anyone who enjoys horror games as a genre, particularly if you don’t mind games where you can’t defend yourself and it’s all about you, the antagonist, and the spooky atmosphere
Despite the game 'still' being in Early Access, what IS available to play is deeply engaging, if in need of a little polish here and there
The game relies heavily on its ability to set you on edge, so if you’re the type with nerves of steel you likely won’t get too much out of it
To horror fans, however? I wholeheartedly recommend Layers of Fear to you!9/10

								This is a keeper
I don't usually play scary game's unless they're top-notch in terms of overall quality and production, and this game is one of them
A high quality horror/thriller game that I really hate myself for playing and continually playing
So far an hour in and screw me, screw this game, but love the quality in the controls, gameplay, features and voice acting
https://www
youtube
com/watch?v=MpweuoNAgdQThe graphics are really great and beautiful alongside the atmosphere being really tense and immersive
The level of quality in this game and the attention to detail can be put just below P
T
if not alongside it
The voice acting is just lovely and the dialogue that it has in relation to what you see in the game alongside to what you interact with that's story specific is really awesome to read
And speaking of story, from what I understand so far it's pitting crazy with crazy and I love it
If you're wondering about jump-scares, there are in the game but within the realm of confusion and mystery the game has so I appreciate it more so than the usual crap in other scary games
Still playing it and will continue to hate myself as I continue to play it
I whole-heartily recommend this game because of the combination of the high quality production in every aspect, the low price point and the amount of crazy in it in terms of features and story
Update: So I finished it, the "early access version" in about 2 hours, but damn was it fun
Yes, a horror game that I had "fun" in, and even though I mentioned that I hate myself for/while playing it, I wanted more
The game is just a joy and I don't mind if the price goes up if they add more and more crazy and content to it
To re-confirm what I said, I love the game because it's high quality and has a lot of crazy trips in it, and it's definitely worth the purchase

Early Access Review
THIS GAME IS TERRIFYING!To be completely honest, I was nearly scared into a coma by this game
Layers of Fear offers a truly immersive horror experience
The story takes you on a tour through the mind of a madman
As you progress, you find clues that give you details about life of the character before he went crazy
I actually had chills during certain areas of the game
The environment is constantly changing around you, and you never know what is waiting for you at the next turn
I would definitely suggest picking this game up while it is in EA (Early Access)
I was left hanging because the game is unfinished
The cool thing about being a part of this game while it is in EA is that the game is constantly changing
You can help the developers iron out the kinks and help make this game better
Plus, you get the game much cheaper than people who will purchase the full game when it is released
I cannot wait to see where the developers take this story! Even though it is unfinished, I consider this game a horror masterpiece!+Story+Jumpscares+Immersive environment+Visuals+Creepiness+Early access offers a chance to help the developers make the game better+Early access means you get the game at a cheaper price-Cleaning urine from my chair-Feelings of dread-Nightmares-Uncontrollable cryingIf you have any questions about the game, post a comment here and I will answer it!One of the jumpscares you could encounterhttps://www

												My five-year-old daughter likes to scare me occasionally, sneaking into my room while I’m busy brushing my teeth and screaming as loud as her distressingly-powerful lungs will let her
It’s jarring and unpleasant but I laugh it off because she’s just trying to be funny, and more importantly she doesn’t do it that often
If she screamed in my face every morning and afternoon and evening it would quickly reach tiresome and cruise straight on to aggravating
My five-year-old daughter understands this, but for some reason the people behind Layers of Fear do not, despite crafting an otherwise beautiful and fascinating game to house their cheap jumpscares
The game opens with very little explanation, you alone in a palatial Victorian mansion stuffed full of art supplies
It soon becomes clear that you are a painter, a husband, and a father, and these aspects of your life do not coexist peacefully
You are compelled to complete your greatest work, but there are demons pulling at you every step of the way and the further you get in the closer to home they hit
As you battle through the twisted mansion to achieve your goal, the true nature of your painter avatar is made shockingly clear
In gameplay terms, this is a walking simulator
You wander the halls of your mansion, free to open drawers and cabinets in search of collectibles or rare discoveries like keys, ever onward towards your goal
Every chapter starts in your studio and takes you through a seemingly random assortment of nightmarish halls and chambers
There are points where your path will branch in subtle ways but it always ends in the same place, a dramatic setpiece that reveals key events in your character’s past and supplies him with one of the necessary pieces of his masterpiece
I don’t use the term “walking simulator” derisively, in fact I rather enjoy these guided tours of nightmare mindscapes
Layers of Fear is near the top of the pile in aesthetic, at least, with an impressive amount of detail on every wall fixture, desk drawer, and pile of rubble
The many halls of the manor are distinct enough to be memorable, and setpieces often use huge numbers of small objects like checkers or books to give locations a tactile, lived-in feel
It’s a wonderfully dreary place topped off with some incredible effects like melting furniture and paint flows that make you feel right at home in a twisted projection of reality
There’s plenty to marvel at as you explore the vast mansion, but you’ll be scouting around under a permanent air of dread
This is a horror game after all, and all those magical details are designed to make you feel as fraught and threatened as possible
Flickering lights, broken doors, scrabbling in the walls, melting paintings, and darker things still will accost you as you slip further into the madhouse
The atmosphere reaches a number of feverishly oppressive peaks, always capped off with a shock like hurtling books or slamming doors or screaming ghosts
And honestly, that’s where the game loses me
It doesn’t just lose me, it actively drives me away in a huff because as much as I love the atmosphere, I DESPISE the jumpscares
I’m a jumpy person and I don’t care much for big shocks like screamers, but I’ll tolerate ones in games like SOMA and Oxenfree because they’re infrequent and earned
Layers of Fear, in stark contrast, ends almost every single one of their building spooks with a loud noise and jarring visual
There’s hardly any break between them, as scares usually come only three or four rooms apart
What’s worse is that they’re often telegraphed, too… anytime a door locks behind you or the next one doesn’t open immediately, you’re in Scarytown for the duration
Combined with the ultimately linear nature of the game, this sucks a ton of the fun out of an otherwise promising horror game and turns it into a cheap carnival ride
Walk 10 steps, watch a screamer
Walk another 20, get books thrown at you
Turn the corner, a window bangs
It becomes utterly perfunctory, yet keeps trying harder and harder to shock you by getting louder and more audacious
By the end Layers of Fear feels like a game that was designed to be moody and atmospheric, and then was harangued endlessly for not being scary enough until it was completely over-tuned
The cheap jumpscares are so much more annoying because they’re not even necessary, yet they persist and fight ever harder to shock you
That should tell you everything you need to know to decide on this one yourself, but if you’re in the mood for spoilers I’m going to talk about the story a bit
I don’t normally dabble in spoilers but by the end I was so fed up with the main character that I simply couldn’t manage my ire anymore
Your dude is a tortured artist who is obsessed with his work, obsessed with professional validation, and obsessed enough to neglect his family to literal death
Ostensibly this is a story about redemption but you’ll soon find he’s so irredeemable that you’ll almost wish his demons would just kill him
I actually did that in the later chapters where his dead wife is wandering around, I would run him right into her cold, fatal embrace because after everything I had seen and heard from him he deserved nothing more
Seriously, to complete his masterwork he’s searching for pieces of his family, tanned skin and blood vials and an actual eyeball, to paint with
The man turned his wife and daughter into art supplies and we’re supposed to believe his soul can be saved? Really?Ultimately, Layers of Fear is a horror game with an incredibly promising base and a painfully inept structure built upon it
The technology and artistry on display is undeniable, the game looks amazing and has a talent for surprising and impressing
But instead of using that talent to build a compelling story and atmosphere, the game settles for cheap, mindless scares and a story that simply doesn’t work
I won’t deny that I enjoyed admiring the squalor of the mansion and rifling through dressers for clues, but the knowledge that another dumb room with a dumb screaming scare was coming up always filled me with the wrong kind of dread
When I finished the game I felt such relief, not at the conclusion of a compelling story or at the accomplishment of a goal, but at the fact that I would never have to play this wretched thing again

Early Access Review
								I'm going to start this right off the bat by saying this is by far one of the best horror games I've ever played
I cannot get enough of it
It's a bit slow paced at first, but it builds you up for all that's to come - and does an amazing job at that thus far
The graphics are phenomenal, the game is absolutely stunning
It does need a bit of optimizing, but that's understandable at early access
The voice acting is amazing, the attention to detail, the music and sounds, everything is just superb
It all came together so nicely and the developers can only make it better from here on out
Now I, and most people, have come accross a bug in which a room just goes pitch black - causing you to go back to the menu and then back to the game
A bit of a drawback, but can be fixed nonetheless
This game outshines most games and I just cannot recommend it enough
If you're an avid horror fan looking to add something new to your library, this is it
10/10 buy this game naow
EDIT: My goodness, this game just gets better and better with every update
Layers of Fear is incredibly unpredictable and because everything just comes together so nicely, you're constantly on alert; I have yet to come across a game that does that so smoothly and efficiently as this one
You're in for one hell of a ride if you get this game

												I had no idea what I was getting into with this game
From what I'd heard you just sit at a border checkpoint and decide if people are allowed to enter the country or not
And that's exactly what I got, but Papers, Please is so much more than that
It's not just a job simulation, it's a story of moral choices and corrupt government
It's not just about a border guard, it's about a man who struggles to provide for his family, who must work for the smallest of wages to make some of the toughest choices
You sit in your little checkpoint booth
A man comes up and hands you his passport
You skim over the information and stamp a big green "APPROVED" for him
He thanks you and starts to walk away, but before he does he says, "my wife is right behind me, please be nice to her
" Sure enough, up steps a nice young woman
There's her passport
You look down and see an expiration date of last month
"This document is expired" you say
She stares at you, eyes wide and pleading: "Please, if I go back to my country they will kill me
Please let me in
" What do you do? Do you risk losing your paycheck and therefore leave yourself unable to buy medicine for your sick son? Or do you abandon all morality and turn the woman away?Papers, Please is not an easy game, nor is it free of consequences
Not only does it become insanely difficult to reivew piles of papers and make sure every little details is accrate and correct, but every choice you make determines who you are and the path you take
Will you work tirelessly for the glory of Arstotzka, or will you join the Order and be a part of the uprising against the tyrannical, corrupt government?

												In theory papers please should not be a fun game
 It is literally a simulation of performing a monotonous, tedious and thankless job
 But the game is definitely a good game
So what makes the game fun?I have concluded that the game survives almost completely upon atmosphere
  There is a tragic realism to horrible job you have in this third world nation
 You live in so much poverty with the risk of illness or starvation being a very real threat
 It gives you many moral dilemmas and will test your principles in ways games do not normally expect you to
 You are paid so little that you find yourself accepting bribes to let terrorists, smugglers, etc
into Arstotzka
 And you will accept the bribes, because often it is the difference between eating and not
 Yet at the same time the game is humorous
  The customers make it so and some have very humorous personalities
 You will get to know your favorite customers and favorite scenes
 The world is so overblown with propaganda, corruption, etc
that the grim world becomes humorous (to those not in it)
 Finally, the world reacts to the player
 You’d be amazed how big of an impact deciding who to let into the nation can have on the nation
 You let an assassin into the nation a high ranking official may die and the government will respond with harder boarder policies
 It is generally simple things, but these really complete the atmosphere
The game play itself is a point and click adventure
Were you will face a number of customers which you must either let in or find the error in their paperwork
 It is all done on a timer forcing you to be quick
 It almost becomes stressful
The graphics look like they belong on an Atari and yet somehow seem appropriate
 You are matching blurry faces to other blurry faces
In conclusion I recommend this game
It is fun and addictive
Glory to Arstotzka

												Papers, Please has no right to be as fun as it is
Papers, Please has no right to be as poignant as it is
Papers, Please has no right to be possibly the best PC game of 2013 I've played
Papers, Please is all of these things
The gameplay of Papers, Please is more or less a tedium simulator
It's Paperwork: The Game
And yet, you know that you need to process as many of these poor people as you can so that your family won't starve
You know that the old lady who you just denied will probably never see her son again; you know the young man you just let through has less than glorious ambitions in your city
Will you support the rebels? Will you toe the party line? Will you let the young lady through, even though her passport is clearly fake, because her fiance was just before her and bribed you to do so? The choice in this game is staggering, and the simplicity of the game itself allows for complete assimilation of your mind into the mind of your character
You feel bad when your child gets sick, but you know that food is sometimes more important than heat
Papers, Please is a work of video game brilliance - a work of art
I give it seven out of seven stars

 East Grestin, 1982Here comes that weird guy again
The one in the red sweater and with the crooked smile always plastered on his face
It's the third time already, this month
I look at him through the glass as he waves at me in an oddly familiar way that makes me feel a little bit awkward
«Old friend, hello! I am back again! This time everything set!»
His voice is loud and cheerful, and I just can't help but wonder what the heck is wrong with him
There's nothing to be so happy about in this rotten place, you old geezer
«Papers, please» I simply say, ignoring his greetings
He grins while handing me his brand new passport
I chuckle
Definitely better than the last one, at least this one is not pre-approved
«So this time you're from Obristan, I see, Mr


Jorji Costava? Is this even your real name?»
His grin grows even wider and he starts laughing again
«You a funny guy
I didn't like Cobrastan that much anymore
Obristan sure is a better country»
He speaks with a tick foreign accent that makes me wonder where he is really from
«Cobrastan isn't even a real country, in the first place» I point out matter-of-factly
«Where's your entry ticket?»
His smile fades a little
«Arstotzka so great, we don't need an entry ticket!»
«This is the same thing you said last time about passports
I'm sorry, an entry ticket is required»
I hand his passport back
«Wow, you run very strict border here»
He puts his paper back in the pocket of his trousers, shrugging
«That is good
Do job right
I look for entry thing and come back»
Before leaving the booth, he stares intensely at me
«You a good guy, but I have business in Arstotzka
I see you soon»
He waves me goodbye and then disappears in the crowd, with that big careless smile on his face
                                                                                           *I keep staring at the ceiling of my bedroom
In the end, it seems I can't really sleep at all tonight
I can hear my wife coughing weakly beside me
The doctor said it's just a cold, but she's getting worse day after day
I'm slightly worried
Our son is sleeping in the next room, the only one lit by the sun in the morning
He is turning 7 next week
I'd really want to buy him a special present for his birthday
We are currently living in a small apartment provided by the Ministry of Admission, here in East Grestin
The rooms are small and the heather doesn't work half the time
On top of that, our neighbours are awfully nosy
Living here is not that great, but there's really nothing I can do about it
                                                                                           *A week has passed since Jorji Costava last showed up
Maybe he is having a hard time finding a fake entry permit
Maybe he just gave up
Quite unlikely
The siren's ringing, another day of work is starting
A tall figure silently enters the booth
He's wearing a green hood and his face is hidden behind a grey mask
I'm about to call the security, but he gently slides a paper note under the window and stares at me
«There's no much time, be quick please»
His voice sounds young- he's probably younger than me- and unusually relaxed
My hands are shaking and I don't even know why
There's an odd symbol drawn on top of the card, a star-shaped one
I slowly open the note and start reading
I can feel the masked guy's staring gaze on me
  ARSTOTZKA IS GREAT COUNTRY POISONED BY CORRUPT LEADERSWAR HAS MADE GOV'T GREEDY AND PARANOID - YOU HAVE SEEN FOR YOURSELFHELP US FREE ARSTOTZKA FROM ITS SHACKLES+ THE ORDER OF THE EZIC STAR  I'm in a cold sweat
I look up at the masked guy, I'm at a loss for words
«Our agents are ready», he helds out his hand, eyeing the card
«Starting tomorrow
Let them pass»
In Papers, Please you play as an immigration inspector working for the Ministry of Admission of Arstotzka in East Grestin
Your job is to check on people trying to enter Arstotzka and decide who can pass through the border and who has to be denied or even arrested
Most of the time, your decisions will lead to a different ending (not always a good one!)
Choose wisely, the destiny of Arstotzka, your family and many other people is in your hands
Pros: -Well written dystopian settings-20 different endings-Lovely retro graphics-Jorji Costava-Great plot and sub-plots-Shooting terrorists from your inspection booth since 1982-Did I already mention Jorji Costava? Cons:-Maybe old school graphics are not everyone's cup of tea (I personally love it though)-Stamping visas and check out papers will probably sound boring to someone-There's no "Escape to Obristan with your newfound best friend Jorji" endingPapers, Please is hands-down one of my favorite games
Be sure to give it a try, you definitely won't regret it

"Ideas are more powerful than guns
We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas?" - Joseph StalinCongratulations! You've won the lottery and earned the "right" to become a nameless, faceless little bureaucrat who is responsible from the border station of a fictional socialist country in 1980s, alongside countless entrants and their tons of paperwork
Glory to Arstotzka!Before describing any kind of gameplay, I'd like to warn you: Papers, Please is a highly political satire that parodies Stalin's Russia, or any oppressive totalitarian regime in human history
The humor of the game is comedy noir: cold, immediate and careless with an appropriate dose of existentialism, presenting some genuine examples of your good old-fashioned political dystopia
If you like your sarcasm served cold, and patient enough to go through a simulation of routine banality to observe a comment on the dynamics of government, keep reading
The game manages to set the mood for it perfectly
Papers, Please doesn't even closely resemble any game that I've played so far
It is a basic simulation that lets you try and decide whomever is eligible to enter the country, and whomever is not
And guess what? The rules change daily, always getting more and more complicated until the point you cannot possibly "not" hate the government
Endless political conflicts between the government, the neighboring countries and terrorist groups that are ever present don't make things easier or even safer
You live, work and try to earn enough to feed your family, but life is impossible for the honest as always
So things start to get interesting both financially and politically for our bureaucrat as the scenario progresses
The game has 20 or so ending, which presents huge replayability and contains some hidden achievements to hunt for
As a plus, the game takes each save file for each day separately, so it is real easy to load a specific day and replay for the achievement or ending needed
As the last call: I really liked the game, and probably gonna try to achievement hunt for a while
I advise the game for the curious, the bitter and the know-it-all
The graphic lovers won't find anything satisfactory though

												Papers, Please is one unique snowflake in the massive ammount of Indie Games that is turning up lately on Steam
If you get to pick one Indie game to play, make it this one
While playing it you will not only be confronted with moral dilemmas and unexpected inspections, you might also be encouraged to think about oppressive regimes and what they mean for the people that have to live in them
Bonus points to you if you start pondering about what a state should do for its citizens and what not
And even if you are unable to grasp the deeper facettes of this game, you will have still a great time stamping "Denied" or "Approved" into Visa markings
The game gets more and more complex the longer you play it
Discovering all the endings and unlocking Achievements also add to the fun
I also enjoyed the music in this game, its suprisingly nice
You should plan your next holiday in Arstotzka, make sure you get your Papers in time
Glory to Arstotzka!

General Thoughts / ReviewEvery once in a while an indie game comes along that, to me, is not a clear like or dislike
 I started playing Papers, Please and go to day eight before quitting the first time
 I thought to myself, "Who the hell wants to play a game based on stamping visas?  I can't wait to get done working for the day at my REAL job!"Two days later I found myself thinking about the game
 I wanted to know what happened to the people I approved or denied
 Was it better to deny them entry, or to be a tyrant and detain them?  I mean, who doesn't know that their visa information is incorrect
 LIAR!  YOU ARE A CRIMINAL!It is just a game though, why do I care?  I did not, really
 I played again, anyway
The game kept my enthusiasm up as the difficulty ramped up, money was tight, and I seemed to be responsible for the lives of so many more pixel people than I anticiapted
 I enjoyed it up until the very end
 Good job, author
Pros Amazingly enough, makes stamping visas intriguing if you are the type of player that can get immersed in pixels
The save system is AWESOME
 Almost like a source code repository, if you start playing at an existing day, you create a branch at that day and continue playing in a parallel universe
Many different endings depending on choices made throughout the game
 Reminiscent of Chrono Trigger, you do not have to get to the last day to trigger some endings
Even though simple and interactions are quick, you can feel sympathy or opposed to certain characters
Cons Replayability was low for me
 The game has very varied endings, but I found that after I meta-gamed the Steam Achievements out, I was not inclined to go back through and try to get the endings for which there are no achievements for
Certain things feel pointless in the game - although that might have been the developers intent
Can be frustrating and wig out your OCD
RecommendationI would recommend Papers, Please if you are type of gamer who does not need flashy graphics or rapid game play to be entertained
 If you are a fan of indie game development, Papers, Please is an enjoyable title that may grow on you as it has grown on me

												So, I often think of CRPGs as different GMs
Balder's Gate 1 is kind of a crappy GM - they don't know how to really roleplay and their plot is kind of rote
But they did a TON of homework, so you can go anywhere and find something there
It may be kinda stupid, but it is there! Balder's Gate 2 is that GM, but they got better at writing and roleplaying
Now, characters are better written and the plot is more interesting!Planescape Torment is the dude who may railroad you, but they've got such a great plot and setting that you don't really care
Tyranny? Tryanny is the GM who watches as you walk into their carefully pre-written campagin of evil and chaos, with deep lore and politics in mind, and blink as you say: "So, I stab my ally in the back
All of them
At the same time
" Tyranny blinks again
Then Tyranny smiles and says: "Okay, so, now, you find yourself working for


" Tyranny has some of the best choice based gameplay I've ever seen
Work for one side? Work for another? Work for a third? Work for yourself? Play people off one another? An amazing number of different choices lead to different outcomes
I've played the game three times and still haven't seen everything it has to offer
Add to that a fun, fast paced combat (which you can set to the easiest mode if you just want to enjoy the narrative) and my presonal favorite companion NPCs, and you've got one of the finest RPGs out there
Plus, you can do drugs with grandpa Lantry and have fun for the whole family!

												4 hours in and I can already say it's gonna be quite the adventure
Very unique setting for the genre - bronze age works for me, I felt immersed within the first minutes, and I can't say the same about Pillars
I'd say it's more streamlined, even more than Pillars, but I don't really mind
I feel like a kid running Arcanum or Baldur's Gate for the first time, immersed in a beautiful world full of interesting stories
Shame I have to sleep (and go to work tomorrow) because I can't wait to play some more!If You, like me, had trouble being immersed in Pillars, consider picking this game up

												I rate 7/10
A solid isometric RPG with unusual story and engaging combat
Definitely worth a try for any fan of old-school western RPGs
Story+ Unique and refreshing: forget your usual boring saving the world from The Evil Overlord - you will conquer it in their name instead
+ Your choices actually matter
+ High replay value thanks to the amount of choices
+ Very detailed character creation system
~ Solid, but straightforward
Don't expect plot twists or deep philosophical themes
- The last act feels rushed, some plot lines remain unexplained and unfinished
Let's hope that's a set up for a sequel
Combat system+ Fun and complex, with a large and diverse set of abilities and status effects
+ Active pause and fast/slow modes allow you to tune the speed of combat to your liking
+ One of the most detailed magic spell customization systems I've ever seen
+ A neat combat log with all the rolls and effects explained in detail
~ Some spells/abilities combinations are really overpowered
I am looking at you, volcanic weapon accent
This + any weapon buff + Verse's Fury's Embrace = Fire Minigun of Instagib
- Balance is pretty skewed
The game feels challenging in the beginning, but gets too easy in the end (mostly due to the previous point)
Don't play on anything lower than "Hard" if you want at least some challenge
Companions+ Memorable and likeable
+ Detailed backstories and dialogues
+ A loyalty/fear system based on your actions
~ No waifus
This is no Bioware date-sim, if you were expecting one
Appearance+ Good graphics for an isometric RPG
+ Animations are smooth, magic/ability visuals are nice and not overly flashy
+ You can change the freaking font size!~ Music is whatever

One of the best games of 2016!Tyranny is definitely a very good RPG
Every choice affects the lives of the people and the overall story
The maps are small, side-quest scarce and the story is short
However it does have one of the best choice makings I've seen in RPGs and the story itself is very engaging
There isn't much to explore and the story might seem rather linear but what's in the game is done well
StoryYou are in middle of a civil war
The Overlord Kyros has won and rules over the realm
The last conquered land, the region of the Tiers, has a rebel uprising and two of Kyros' armies struggle to bring order as they are fighting each other almost as much as the rebels
Insert The Fatebinder
You bear a powerful Edict: If order is not re-established within a certain amount of time all life in the valley will perish
You have to bring justice, peace and order to a wartorn country full of madmen
GameplayTyranny is an isometric RPG
It's similar to Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale but the best comparison would be Pillars of Eternity
You can control a small squad of up to four people
Each party member can be customised to an extent
You can switch out their gear and colour their armor
Each party member also comes with a unique set of skills and spells
You can either turn on auto leveling or meddle with their skilltrees and attributes yourself
You spend half of the game reading through A LOT of text
As any other RPG Tyranny isn't just about combat
Half of the game is interacting with NPCs and making tough decisions
ConclusionI'd say that Tyranny is the most linear RPG I've ever played
The maps are few and seriously tiny
There is only a handful of sidequests and party members
The exploration is almost none existent and you're almost always on the main quest as there's nothing else to do
HOWEVER it does have quite a bit of replay value and it has one of the best choice making I've seen in RPGs and a very strong story making this one of the most memorable games of the year

												Tyranny is another masterwork created by Obsidian, but a real surprise seeing how little coverage and hype it got
Funny enough this game surpassed even Pillars of Eternity in many aspects
What you get is a real crpg in the veins of Baldurs Gate/ Ice Wind Dale or Pillars of Eternity, but by no means a simple Pillars of Eternity 2
Many mechanics have changed, grown and been improved upon by a mile and then some
The whole character-system is now even more refined and works alot better than it did in Pillars:Endurance is gone, the leveling and building of your char/party is alot more complex and interesting
You still gain levels, but this is by far not the only way to progress your character
Level-ups let you increase a singel attribute and allocate one talent point (which can be spend in various skill-trees, featuring active and passive talents); but now also many skills work similiar to the Eldar Scrolls games and level/increase by use
This goes for combat skills (like 1-handed weapons) to conversation/enviroment skills like athletics
Also the combat has a way more polished feel to it than in Pillars; micro-managing your party, all the options you got in combat feels now much more fluid and meaningfull while still beeing quite complex
Furthermore everything else flows into the character-system: standing with factions/npcs and all the choices you make in the story/sidequests grant you whole new abilities, talents, actives and passivs
Last but not least there's even spellcreation now included, which means you can sorta creat your own spells, modify em and adapt em to your liking
The even more impressive part is the game itself


sounds stupid, but the game is a piece of art
Music (one of the best soundtracks i've yet heard in a game), the amazing voice-work, the art-style/design of the U
I
and every little window (character-menu, inventory) or even more so the actual game-world is just incredible and polished to the rim
Many backdrops are jaw-droppers, many scenes play out as they would in a play
Ontop of all that the story and even more important the writing is topnotch
When Pillars was nod to Baldur's Gate, Tyranny is a wink to Planescape Torment
Leaving out spoilers (which you should avoid at all costs): the game-world is very unique (demons, greek/roman inspired art, etc
) and the story-line feels very fresh and not just like another iteration of "antihero becomes hero, saves world, end"
Every little sidequest i encountered was interesting, every conversation filled with lore and just the feeling of exploring this intruging new world
Tyranny does one thing no other crpg did for me this good: game-mechanics and story, combat and quests, standing with factions/npcs, everything works together


it's hard to describe, but very enjoyable if you are into the immersion crpgs can offer
On a last note: finaly a game doesn't just give you a forced good/evil deeds/reputation-system


no your actions here are never this clear defined, your actions may instill fear or favor and give benefits (combat/character-stat-wise) and story consequences which never feel like a choice between "right" or "wrong"
In my opinion the best way of implementing a standig/reputation-system i've ever seen in a game
All in this game came kinda out of nowhere and surprised me alot; one of the best games i've yet played
If you are into cprgs and still look rather for immersion and a complex game-system instead of the shooter/hack'n slay mechanics other proclaimed cprgs offer, go buy this game and take s a vacation, you won't regret it
what i would like to ad as final note is the impressive love for detail this game shows and thus the developer
the old static portaits for example are still here, but conversation show the actual characters talking and their physical reactions, missives between you and the different enteties who live in this world ad not just lore but life, backrounds are filled with enviromental effects, arcane spells are not just lore-wise cast by invocing sigils->the characters actualy draw them when casting, the same goes for all the animations


most of it is just stunning once you take a moment and look at it
All in all this is the next-gen-leap from old Infinity-Engine games to a newer age of indepth, immersion heavy crpgs, Pillars layed the groundwork, Tyranny is the next step

Product received for free
												It's too bad there's no neutral option for Steam reviews because I recommend it to cRPG fans, but don't recommend it to everyone else
Tyranny is Obsidian's latest cRPG with a twist
Instead of trying to save the world and beat the bad guys you're working for them
I received Tyranny for free for review purposes
My thoughts of Tyranny are not biased, or brought in any way
I always give my honest opinion on games and just because I didn't pay for this one doesn't change that fact
The Great:Graphics:Tyranny is a really good looking game
The environments, spells, particle effects, and even character models looked great
Usually cRPGs would do one thing really good while lack in other areas
Tyranny does everything good
I was really surprised by how good the character models looked and it made me want to spend some extra time creating my first protagonist
Character Creator:I didn't care much for the character creator until I got to the end of it
After I finished creating my first character I was able to choose my past exploits and how I helped Kyros take over the world
It was really awesome because my choices actually affected how certain factions acted towards me in game
If I decided to kill the queen the Vendrien Guard would call you, "Queenslayer" and want nothing to do with you, but if made peace with them they'll approach you with respect
There's a lot of replay value here because I want to know what the game would be like if I choose other options in the character creator
I've already started my second playthrough because I want to get a different ending in the game
Sounds:The soundtrack is awesome
As soon as the game started I heard this epic music in the background
It set the tone for the rest of game
It was imposing and sounded like a theme that a world conquering tyrant would have in my opinion
The other sounds in the game are good too
Casting spells sound like you would expect them to sound in a cRPG
There is voice acting in the game, but it's not fully voiced
I don't like this at all and I wish games like this would stop doing it
If you're going to add voice acting in your game that's fine, but make sure you do it for the whole game or don't bother doing it all
I could be talking a companion of mine and they'll speak a few sentences, but after that they won't talk anymore
I'll have to read walls of text until they decide to speak again
Thankfully the voice acting in this game is really good
It's Well Optimized:The only bug I ran into in my 25 hours of gameplay was a weird animation bug
Instead of my companion walking behind me like she should have been she was sliding all over the map
My FPS never dipped, and I never experienced any game breaking bugs
This is one of the better optimized games that has released this year
The Good:Story:It took me a while to care about what was happening in this game
I'm a fatebinder of Kyros and I help impose his will on the frontlines of battle
The lore in this game is really interesting, but the execution leaves much to be desired
I know Obsidian wanted to give the player as many options and branches as they could, but I would have preferred a set narrative over the many that we have here because none of them feel complete to me
I don't want to give out any spoilers because the game will be released in a few hours
Some of the storylines were really awesome and they way I could end a certain edict was fantastic
Getting to know my companions, the Archons, and plotting in the shadows was fun, but I never really got invested in any of it
The ending was really cool even though it ended abruptly and I do want to play through the game again to see what different choices I could make this time around
The Bad:Gameplay:I don't really enjoy playing cRPGs
I'm more of a aRPG guy, but the gameplay here is good if you don't play as a mage
There was a good variety of weapons for me to choose from, but I ended up going mage and regretting every second of it
Playing as a staff wielding mage was really boring to me
Staffs attacks are really slow and the magic system is slow too
It doesn't matter how many points I put into my quickness my spell cooldowns never changed
I don't know if this is a bug or intentional, but I stopped investing in the quickness stat just to be on the safe side
Another thing I don't like about magic in this game is the way I acquired new spells
In order to learn new spells I had to hunt them down and find them
This goes with the lore of the game because only Archons can create their own spells, but it's a bad game mechanic in my opinion
Leveling up my skills in the magic skill tree is pretty pointless if it doesn't teach me any new spells
In order to learn how to do AOE attacks I would need the right sigil and have a certain amount lore points
The problem with this that by the time I had enough lore to do AOE attacks I was at the end of the game
I never had a chance to enjoy my new abilities
Playing as  warrior or rogue is a lot better
Skill cooldowns are faster, I do more damage, and battles are over faster too, but when compared to Divinity Original Sin's gameplay this is just average at best
UI:I'm not a fan of the UI in this game
It's not modern enough for my tastes
Most cRPGs have a below average UI and this game is no different in my opinion
Loot:There's plenty of loot to find in Tyranny, but very little of it was worth my time
The legendary items that I found were great, but the majority of the items were worse than items I had found a few hours earlier
I never found any good staffs in the game
The most dps I got out of a staff was about 9dps while the rest of my party did a average of 25-35
A
I
The A
I
in this game is brain dead on every difficulty level
My party members did a decent job of engaging enemies without me having to issue them commands, but there were too many times when no one did anything even after I gave them a command
They would just stand there running back and forth doing nothing
This has got me killed a few times on higher difficulties and it's really annoying
The werewolf companion's A
I
is the most broken of all of the companions while the mages seem to have the best A
I
out of the bunch
Other npcs A
I
was just as bad as my companions
I can't tell you how many times I engaged in combat and murdered everyone because they wouldn't fight me back
The Verdict: I had a lot of fun with Tyranny, but I can only recommend this to hardcore cRPG fans
If you love games like Baldur's Gate, and Pillars of Eternity you'll love this game
You probably already preordered it and is just waiting to play it like everyone else, but if you're just a regular gamer trying to find a good game to play to hold you over until the next AAA title releases I would recommend waiting for this one to go on sale before buying it because it's not worth $45
The gameplay will satisfy the hardcore cRPG fans, but do little to impress someone new to the genre or anyone that's grown tired of it
75End NoteI purposely left out some features, and details in this review because I don't want to spoil the game for anyone on release day
I would rather you play and find out for yourself rather than having it spoiled by a game reviewer

												An odd game, very odd


The character creation part and Act I of Tyranny is some of the greatest work in the entire RPG history, I dare say
30 minutes into the game, you could easily see that whoever developed this game has got some brilliant, or even amazing ideas
Proceeding through the first act, you might feel the weight of history like Dragon Age, crafty political maneuver like Wheel of Time, and a shroud of darkness like Pillars of Eternity
If only the developer could stick to this level of quality, this game would have the potential to make history
The problem is that good things don't last for very long
Act II is somewhat exhausted in the creativity department
By the time you see Act III, it's already obvious that the developer has run out of either money or patience, and can't wait to get this game over with
Just when you are trying to cope with it and waiting for things to get better after hitting such a low point, the game's over, credit's rolling, leaving a ton of stuff either unexplained, or stupidly tied off
Would have recommended this game just for its breeze of fresh ideas
But the drop (or shall I say free falling) of quality between Act I and II (not to menion the joke pretending to be Act III) is TERRIBLE
Buy this game simply to experience the starting part if there's a damn nice discount, or else don't bother

												A very forgettable and short experience
This is my main problem: 1 to 2 minute stages, most of which are extremely linear with lots of straight/automated paths and QTEs
Really brings the input the player has to an insultingly low level
It was really difficult to get enthralled with the game when the levels are over in the snap of a finger, and when you did so little yourself besides boost and attack a chain of enemies
For Classic Sonic, it's just some mediocre platforming that really pale in comparison to Mania's level design
My second major problem is the game is absurdly short
I beat the main campaign in just 2 and a half hours
Worth 40 dollars? Hell no, I got MUCH more time out of Sonic Mania which has much better replay value
Finding red rings isn't fun, and S ranks are very easy to obtain just like in Generations
I also found the controls very strange and awkward
Both Sonics feel really floaty and their momentum feels like they stop to a screeching halt in midair the second you turn in the opposite direction
Modern Sonic controls terribly when in a 3D space so you pretty much just need to rely on quick steps to reliably move around
All the characters are just needlessly difficult to control in the air, and it really feels like momentum isn't taken into account which makes everything random and unpredictable, comparing it to something with actual good momentum like Super Mario Odyssey
The Avatar just feels like a slower version of Modern Sonic stages with a weapon
They have exactly the same moves, besides the avatar not being able to boost
It makes the stages themselves feel incredibly samey, and the weapon/grappling hook doesn't justify enough differences to make this a "different" playstyle
I really don't know what to say when the boss battle stages are the longest levels in the game
Those aren't hard either, just tedious
Forces didn't do too much wrong, but it was way too short and simple with little player input
Generations and Unleashed did the boost formula much better than this
			
Posted: 7 November
												My experience so far:No crashing (post-patch)Rock solid 60fps with no stutteringNo cutscene issuesFun gameplaySounds good right? Well


The game is only 2 hours long
No joke
I beat the story in just over 2 hours
Extra activities and side mission might bring that up to about 4-6 hours, but even then it's not worth 40€
This is why I wish there was a "maybe" or "meh" option when reviewing games
Wait until sale or price drop

												Only Sonic Team could have the talent of taking an existing and proven formula and run it into the ground which can be seen blatantly in their latest effort Sonic Forces
The game features 3 distinct gameplay styles of Classic and Modern Sonic as well as the new addition of the Custom Character
The Custom Character in my experience was the most enjoyable
The levels felt large and the wispons were a nice addition to help with the average platforming found in these areas
The OC controls like a gimped modern sonic without boost but has more of a focus on combat with flamethrowers, whips, hammers, etc
These don't matter for the most part as enemies are destroyed in 1 hit
The Character Creation is simple but allows for some hilarious character models and some nice homages via the clothing items available
Modern Sonic hit a revival with the boost era of games and Sonic Team have somehow took a successful formula almost 10 years old and destroyed it
There's much more momentum in his movement but it's much harder to control
The biggest example of this is when you need to go around corners that would normally use drifitng but since Sonic team removed drifting if you try to speed into the corner you will either bump into the wall present or fall of a ledge into your death (This is especially prevalent in Modern Sonic's Metropolis level)
There is no reason to remove abilities such as light speed dash and wall jump if they have been present in the boost gameplay since Sonic Unleashed as it removes oppurtunities to create interesting levels
Levels are basically hold boost to finish as most of these levels can take 1 or 2 minutes to complete if you don't fall off into bottom less pits due to trash sense of controls
It wouldn't even matter since the game takes control away from you for half the duration of the level anyway to throw in some rubbish quick time events for some "set piece"
Classic Sonic's gameplay is what you expect from Sonic Generations
For the most part his level design is better than Modern Sonic and does use multiple routes to discover the best areas to speed past but is nowhere close to the complexity of Sonic Mania
Classic Sonic's physics are also notably worse than in Generations
The biggest example is his nerf of max speed, unless you are drop dashing every 2 seconds it can be a chore to try and speed through the levels
Another problem is his spin jump, often I would misjudge if Sonic would be able to hit an enemy or jump to another platform and as a result get hit or die in a bottomless pit
The physics haven't felt this 'wrong' to me since playing Sonic 4 Episode 1
The game does look nice and runs really well however the game does lack zone variety with there being 7 different environments and 3 out of the 7 areas are just areas from the genesis era whilst the remaining 4 are just generic city or jungle environments
Soundtrack is great but that's expected from a Sonic game at this point
Sonic Forces is probably the most baffling game I've played in a long time
I don't even know what Sonic Team was doing for 4 years since Lost World
It took me 3
5 hours to beat the game along with the episode Shadow DLC
If Sonic Team think that releasing a game of this quality with that length of playtime they should realise that this isn't 1992 anymore
This should be a wake up call for Sega to find a different development team that is willing to try different ideas for Sonic because if Sonic Mania can prove that the hedgehog can have a great game from a Western Developer it would be time to invest elsewhere
If not Sonic Team needs to know, just because a game looks nice, sounds nice and incorporates elements from fan favourite games doesn't excuse a game that plays like complete garbage especially compared to  Sonic Generations

												man, i don't care what everyone else thinks
i haven't had this much fun playing 3D sonic since generations, and the more i play it the more i start to think i actually enjoy it more than generations
at the very least, i never bothered to 100% generations with all its tedious side-missions, whereas this game i've already gotten all the collectibles and S-ranked every level, and am still itching to play more
(clarification: i think in terms of the main story, generations had better levels
however, i like the side content a lot better in forces
)maybe i'm just weird, it's so bizarre seeing everyone trashing on this game and yet i'm having the most fun i've had with a 3d sonic game in like a decade
edit/disclaimer: i'm not some sonic fanboy who was convinced to like this game before it came out
i am a sonic fan, and have been for over 20 years, but i was pretty sure i was going to hate this game going off the promo material
i pretty much just bought it out of obligation as a genesis kid
but i'm glad i did because i love it

												Not Good
Not bad
Mediocre
That's the short of this review
Sonic Forces has renewed public opinion that Sega isn't really sure how their Sonic games even work anymore
With the positive reception of Generations, one would think they would continue to refine the formula
Boost gameplay is controversial, but certianly works
Ideally one would hope that their next game would be split in some way between Boopst Gameplay and something more akin to Adventure style gameplay in order to appease their divided fanbase
Sonic Lost World was their answer the praise bestowed upon Generations
A rebooted gameplay formula altogether that received mixed reception and did not appeal to fans
Since there was a negative backlash over straying form the proven gameplay, Sega decided to stray yet further with Boom
Boom received all around negativity from general and fan audiences
With Forces, I was hopeful they would at least bring back a refined version of boost
Generations had shown cleanly what the strengths of the gameplay could be in learning the courses, discovering the faster shortcuts and managing meter and prepping you reflexes were paramount to getting those extra few seconds faster
 Sonic Forces feels like a completely separate dev team of a completely separate company tried copying the gameplay formula by watching the game being played
Watching Modern Sonic's gameplay in trailers or seeing someone else play makes it look like the gameplay style seen in Generations, but it feels anything but
The controls feel stiffer than ever
Sonic doesn't respond well to inputs
Time and time again movements like the quickstep or homing attack don't seem consistent in execution
You might be boosting down a ramp, dodging spike grinders with quickstep, only for a random quickstep to take one or two seconds to come out, by then it's too late
 I checked multiple controllers and even different input methods and this occurred semi-frequently
Even having someone else play yielded similar results
Sometimes Sonic doesn't do the thing you want, as if there's some degree of input lag that spontaneously rears its ugly head
My system maintained its FPS throughout the game, with only one instance of slowdown in an unrelated section
Combined with this is the floaty nature of Sonic's platforming
Unlike Generations large, oversized platforms are mostly gone, with smaller platforms instead, that require more precision that Sonic's near weightlessness doesn't really afford
It feels overwhelmingly common that a jump you performed with perfect timing doesn't work because Sonic careeens in midair into a pit at the slightest touch of the movement stick
Other times it's like he's a stubborn brick and doesn't respond to your input at all unless you push the stick all the way (This may be the aforementioned potential input lag)Classic Sonic has this je ne sais qoui to how awkward it's platforming can feel
It exists as a some kind of weird hybrid of Generations and Mania
They have some kind of momentum based mechanic I can't seem to figure out that throws all of your predicitons for a loop, but they didn't commit to it like Mania does, making the entire set of stages feel inconsistent
Avatar stages suffer from inconsistent character speed, sometimes slow and speeding up, sometimes 0-100mph in a second
The cinematic grapple sequences sometimes broke causing it to just drop me off a ledge during the swing
Wispons either slow syou down to an absurd degree (Hammer), Obscure the playing screen, making it difficult to make out projectiles through the effects (Busrton), or completely rocket you off ledges with their attack animations (Drill, Whip)
Partnered stages bring about both the issues fo modern Sonic's gameplay with the Avatars
Inconsistent speeds and and overabundance of screen clutter
In addition, actions for both characters are mapped to different buttons on your input device as opposed to having a dedicated switching mechanic
If you're boosting and try to do a homing attack, to hit a higher platform route, you will instead find the Avatar coming out with his hook to swing himself under the route using a grapple-point you didn't even see
By the time you figure out the controls for these stages, they'll be over
There are only 4 in the game
Level Design is wholesale cut and pasted across characters
Find a video and compare Modern Sonic's City stage to Avatar's City Stage to Partnered City Stage to even Shadow's City stage and find them all traversing the same expanse of level with some minor twist at the very end
In terms of setpiece, Stage 16/30 is the most interesting setpiece I think I've seen in a Sonic game so far
I was really interested in what was going on around me, even as I struggled to ge the Avatar to cooperate
It even far outweighs anything offered in the final "climactic" stages
I'll take a moment to point out that the visuals are overly complex
It can be difficult to make out exactly what obstacles are even ahead of you at times (mainly in 2d sections) because they blend in so well with the background
Metroplosi is offensively white
Making out walls, ramps, curves, etc
is sometimes infuriating when the sky is white, the background is white, the walls are white, the ramps are white, the curves are white, hell, even the shining enemies can be a pain to pick out sometimes
Boss fights were mostly forgetable
Modern Sonic's issues almost dissolved during his boss fights, which is a definite plus
Classic Sonic, all I did was drop dash back and forth acros the arena and was basically never hit
Avatar, I literally did the same using the drill
Partner boss fights were functionally identical to Modern Sonic's
Story was honestly pretty bland
It starts off pretty serious, like it's actually intending to go somewhere interesting, but once you hit Stage 4 it's just going thorugh the motions
Even the characters seem to sotp caring about what's really happening and just start saying generic "Let's do it!" line delivery
Even Sonic is lampshading in the story that there's no actual stakes "We always win
We just don't know yet how we're going to do it yet"
Music was largely forgettable
I think Ohtani is running out of steam here
The vocal tracks were pretty catchy in their own right, but those compose just 10 of the apparent 87 tracks in the game, Those other 73 of those remaining just sound like generick synth-guitar beats without much feeling
Just background noise
This may be because Sonic games now basically focus exclusively around just Sonic instead of the varied beats you got form games like Adventure 2 that could style themselves differently to suit the personalities fo the character
Overall, the game just took me a couple hours
Something I wans't expecting with 4 gameplay styles present in the game
I figured one or two of them (Avatar and Partner) might be used for significant padding in some way, but those two stylesa are essentially frankensteined versions of Modern Sonic
It's not really worth your $40 value, and with the cut and paste level design and how all of them are only about a minute anyways with few interesting shortcuts, there's no reason to go back and replay them
This includes going back to get a higher rank because the game aggressively distributes S-ranks even if you do poorly and die several times
What's most infuriating about this game is that every so often while playing, I could almost feel like I was about to enjoy myself, but the issues and blandness of delivery caused me to disengage form the experience, creating an overall mediocre experience

												I've been out of the Sonic loop for a pretty long time, and Generations was the only game I've fully played since Sonic Adventure 2, so I admittedly am not the best person to speak on this subject
I had no idea that the series had switched gears almost entirely by switching to the "boost formula", which from what I've gathered from Forces means that the 3D levels are essentially roller coasters where you just hold the "gotta go fast" button until you win and occasionally choose left or right if you want to super win
Even if you wanted to turn right or left you can't do much beyond using the sidestep buttons that usually overshoot whatever you were trying to hit, because once you reach more than like 5 miles (or kilometers if you so desire) per hour the game might as well just disable the left and right movement controls for how much good they do in controlling Sonic
I admittedly wasn't expecting miracles from the patented DeviantArt™ Sonic OC Creator, but they somehow disappointed me anyways
The character customization in the beginning is as barebones as it gets, and it's nearly impossible to make someone that actually looks good without copying an existing character
You do get clothing options that let you flesh them out, but the game seems to randomly allocate them after each mission, and even if you get the piece you want there's no guarantee that you'll get the color you want, since that's random too, and some of the parts are things that should've been in the creator from the start, like hair styles
Port-wise, it ranges from adequate to not so great
There are no mouse controls, but that's mostly fine because there aren't any camera controls in the first place, even in the 3D sections
The game's full of surprises, and you never know exactly which bugs you're going to get in this grab bag
You may find that uncapping the framerate makes all the environmental effects run in turbo mode, or you may have the opposite problem and have the game only run at 30 FPS when set to 60 FPS and won't run at 60 FPs unless it's set to uncapped
Some people have jittery cutscenes, some don't, some people crash, others run it fine
Will you? Find out! To top it all off, the game is fairly short, clocking in at 30 main missions that last about 2-3 minutes each plus a handful of bonus stages that are usually even shorter
You can fill the rest of the time with replaying them for better times or collecting medals, but if you're just in it for the story there's not much here
Admittedly the game does only cost $40 compared to the usual $60, but considering Mania was $20 it still feels like you're not really getting a value here
I wanted to believe that there's some kind of secret ending or something, because one of the classic Sonic bosses they show in the cutscenes doesn't even have a fight and the game just abruptly ends without even giving you a hype moment where they play the game's theme (they do finally play it in the credits, but the credits aren't long enough to actually finish it because they spend most of it playing some lame pop song)
If you just really like the Sonic boost games, or if you just really like the modern 2D segments and are okay with the knowledge that you're not getting a whole lot of it here, or even if you're just a masochist who really loves Sonic despite his near-constant blunders it might be worth picking up, but if you're a new (or long-returning, like me) player there's not really enough here to sell you on it
It's just an all around "okay but not great" game, which is hard for me to recommend for $40
The 2D sections are still fun, and even the 3D sections aren't necessarily bad, but there are better options out there
			
Posted: 8 November
Following up on Sonic Boom's unpopularity and Sonic Mania's return to the great era of the 90s classics, Sonic Forces proudly returns to the boost gameplay first introduced in Sonic Unleashed (or officially Sonic Rush lul)
In his battle against Eggman's successful world takeover, Sonic is once again joined by his Classic counterpart, as well as, for the first time in the series, a custom made character introduced as a rookie to the resistance
There might even be a special someone who hadn't been playable in a main series title for over ten years
Though you might be asking yourself, is the game good? Let's find out
PROS:- Sonic Forces introduces us to a darker story than what past and/or recent Sonic titles got us used to
It's no longer only about kicking some evil scientist's butt for the fiftieth time
It's about taking back a world from an evil scientist actively hunting anyone who wouldn't submit to his rule
- Played on the High graphics preset, the environments look amazing
Not sure what else to say about that, so rip
- As always, Sonic offers an amazing soundtrack, and just like in Sonic Adventure 2, each playable character gets their own kind of music for their stages, with modern/electronic/synth songs for Sonic, more classic-themed songs for Classic and the return of vocals for the Avatar
And for once, we didn't get yet another remix of Green Hill
- For the first time in the entire series, you get to create your own edgy Deviantart custom character, or as they call it, Avatar
With enough options to make a truly terrifying cheap Sonic, if you're into that
Your Avatar is also a full important part of the story, even appearing in cutscenes! As an added bonus, and if connected to the internet, you can choose to have a second Avatar, with you on the next stage, created by another fellow player, allowing you to switch between yours and theirs with the simple press of a button!- Shadow the Hedgehog returns as a playable character in his own free DLC, with three exclusive stages explaining Infinite's origins
He is also playable on a few Sonic stages in the main story! (Only after completing said stages once as Sonic
)- I see all these people talking about crashes, though my game has only crashed once from start to finish, and an update was quickly released to fix these issues
Weird
- Vector the Crocodile is still looking for the computer room
CONS:- The main story is rather short, and can be completed in roughly two or three hours, excluding the bonus levels and Episode Shadow
- Just like the story, most stages are really short, lasting one to two minutes for a decent player
The wispons also make the Avatar stages really easy due to how powerful they can be
(CUBE)- The gameplay can seem really rough and unfinished at times, mostly in the Mystic Jungle stages where the character will just ignore a set of springs covering an entire waterpipe and just fall straight to their death, or on some Sonic stages where the boost doesn't seem to follow the intended path it wants you to take, sending you flying off the stage
- Similar to Generations, most characters from the cast make their return, but only as side characters, restricting the playable cast to Sonic, Classic, Avatar and Shadow
- SOS Missions feel really intrusive
What if I simply want to replay a stage, without being bothered by a mission where I have to help someone else's Avatar? Nope
If a SOS Mission spawns on a stage you wish to replay, you'll have to go through said mission first, even if you ragequit straight out of it
- The Hero Rental system only offers up to nine Avatars from other random players, and there doesn't seem to be an option to play as your Steam friends' Avatars
- This might just be me, but the keyboard controls are rather difficult to get used to
Thankfully, they're rebindable!CONCLUSION:Sonic Forces doesn't quite live up to previous titles like Unleashed or Generations, but it remains as a decent game with unused potential
Hopefully the remaining issues will be fixed at some point
EDITI feel like some people are downvoting this review just because they hate the game to begin with
Sad

												This is a game that just screams playing it safe
Considering that this game is $40 from the start, my expectations were pretty low to begin with
Some aspects in the game are great, other aspects of the game are things that I don't ever want to revisit
The Avatar is one of the aspects that I don't see myself going back to because it doesn't really wow me enough to go and try out the stuff that I've unlocked
The other weapons that you unlock with the Avatar are inconspicuous and the game doesn't do a good job in telling you that you have them and how to use them
Another thing that I don't find myself revisiting is the Classic levels; I feel like that the level design of the Classic levels are mediocre, especially in comparison to Sonic Mania
Modern Sonic to me personally is the only redeeming quality in terms of gameplay
Coming from a person who's spend over 100 hours on Sonic Generations, I can say that Modern Sonic's stages are fun, but it's definitely a step down from Unleashed and Generations
A lot of Modern Sonics levels are very linear and have very few open pathing to flesh out this gameplay style
This is not mentioning that I feel that his controls are a lot more clunky compared to the two previous games that I've mentioned
With the exception of the first stage, I like all of Modern Sonics levels, though I will admit that there are better levels than others without question
The thing that defines Unleashed and Generations for me is that both games allow you to go fast while at the same time rewards you for exploring the enviornment
Good examples are Seaside Hill from Generations and Skyscraper Scamper from Unleashed
The pathing in both stages are fantastic; tons of alternative paths that lead to different areas instead of being a alternative route to the same area
From a technical standpoint the game looks absolutely fantastic; I feel that the visuals are expertly crafted in this game, fully immersing you in its world
The soundtrack is also pretty good, a lot of tracks I can see myself listening to in the future
But honestly I'm a little dissapointed on how Sonic Forces turned out
If Sonic Generations is a B+ to me, then Sonic Forces is a C+
If they fleshed out the levels better and give me better reason to replay the Avatar stages then I have no doubt that this game would be better
I love Sonic, but I cannot deny that this game is a bit of a let down

												Once upon a time, Call of Duty was a legit, epic, vietnam shooter
There was a time where snipers camped and didn't run around quick scoping
There was a time where submachine gunners ran around and didn't camp in corners
There was a time where thermal scopes didn't exist and smokes actually did someting
There was a time where 2-3 bullets actually killed you instead of 10-12
There was a time where shotguns weren't OP
There was a time where 12 year olds didn't sleep with your mum
There was a time where squeakers didn't dominate over people
There was a time where trolls didn't anger over-sensitive people
All in a place called Call of Duty: black ops

												IMO, one of the better COD available to PC
Had a rough launch but Treyarch seems to be the only activision COD developer who cares about PC gaming; rolling out bug fixes quickly and including FOV slider
This has true Dedicated server support and support of unranked modded servers
The community has very much diminished, and most of the lower latency NA servers are mostly Nuketown forever game types with almost no servers hosting DLC
Buying DLC for this is only justifiable if you desire to play the Zombies game mode; which is an absolute blast, especially with friends; going for those higher levels and finding all the easter eggs
My favorite part of this COD is the gunplay
Trades in gunfights tend to go to the more skilled player rather than the player who sees the other first (like we see in newer COD titles)
In summary:Pros:Twitch Shooter with skill oriented gun playTrue Dedicated Servers with Mod Support on unranked ServersZombies gametype with tons of replayCons:90 FPS Cap (Old Quake engine bugs when running over 120 FPS)Lack of Eyefinity or Surround multi Display support (Flawless Widescreen or Widescreen fixer solves this)Small CommunityNuketown everywhereNo point of buying DLC unless you like the zombies game type

												The first Portal had genius, original gameplay mechanics, great story, great level progression, great voice acting, great characters, great engine and such a nice british humour it originated a ton of memes
If you didn't play, finish and love Portal 1, you are a bad person
This sequel brings all those qualities to a new level: _the story is deep_, lots of wow moments, graphics is beautiful, much more levels, environments and elements to solve the puzzles, the co-op multiplayer is so fun it's epic
In my heart and in my mind I have no doubt: _this is the best game ever made_
If you didn't play, finish and love Portal 2, you understand nothing about videogames

												I have no idea why I waited so long to review this game
Here goes nothing, and I hope you rate this up
If you already know a thing or two or hate reading, visit my Pros and Cons section as it helped many customers decide if this game is right for them
-------------------------------IntroYou know how when you are on vacation and say, "I am so glad it isn't winter right now
"? Yeah, that sums up the power this game has on you
When you play the game, it is so


crisp (Vacation-like) and when you have to leave, it is like that miserable winter I was talking about
-------------------------------Summary:This game, as you should know from some other reviews and through the fact that it is one of the best selling games of all time, leaves an effect on the player
It is a beautiful story-line
You play as a female test subject through the campaign
She (I won't spoil her name) is forced through many tests GLaDOS (a powerful robot who took over Aperture) has prepared for her
You learn a lot about this character as you portal around puzzles of rooms, and a lot is learned about yourself
The programed-to-be "idiot" (whom you will find out through the game) is something to look out for as you think he is helping you escape
It is a clever twist
You will learn that the industry you are escaping from used to be a shower curtain/part factory
Yeah, It will all make sense when you play
-------------------------------Multi-PlayerThen there is the multi-player mode with Atlas and P-body who are trying to free the humans or whatever
That itself (with a partner) is totaly worth a lot of Friday nights
Now that they are implementing items/loadouts into the game (or hats/taunts/clothes/flags to those who are uncertain of the term), the game will be more interesting
Now, I may not have many hours, but I assure you that I have beaten multi-player in about 4 hours, and the single player in 3
I mean, the rest of my hours come from exploring more/community maps
And that is the amazing thing about this game


no matter how many times you have beaten it, it is still fun
Also playing multi-player with a different friend every time makes you find a lot out about their creativity/teamwork/leadership/meatal abilities
-------------------------------Other important thingsThe many achievements with variety are also something to look on about
There are many things you will NEVER notice no matter how many times you play unless you YouTube some of it
The deeper you dig into the storyline, the more interesting you find the game
There were many rumors that we are still uncertain of, which makes this excellent
To dumb it down:-------------------------------Pros+Amazing graphics for a non-stop beautiful gameplay
+Wonderful audio and music for a great experience
+Well-designed maps and challenges
+Unlimited maps (user-created)
+Fantastic story-line
+Many users own this game
(Lol I remember the commercials)
+Holiday sales make buying this game super affordable
+Gender neutral
++Helps with cognitive brain activity
-------------------------------Cons-Limited story-line (I wish there was more to it, but there is always Portal 1)
-Some levels take seconds while others take many minutes
(Not really progressive difficulty wise in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing here to me
)-Limited campaign exploration
(Some repetitive looking levels here and there
) -Restricted to the short story line
(However, there are some mods which are amazing, but if you want more, you have to manually download them instead of them being included with the game
)-------------------------------My opinionated reviewI would say the cons are so minor that I shouldn't even have mentioned them because it may not make you buy the game
DO NOT let that happen
Get this game
I recommend buying during a sale to get Portal 1 and 2 for a cheap price together for the full experience (because they raised the price of this game recently)
This is a classic game and will go down in history as one of the best - revolutionizing the way we think/game
It was such an amazing thought that I hope you guys consider for yourselves
-------------------------------RatingOut of 100, there is nothing wrong with this game
You may not like it if you aren't creative, don't have friends to play it with, or can't appreciate an amazing "Portal transportation" concept
But listen, you will fall in love with this game and stack hours to it
There is no community to worry about other than wonderfully made maps from users like you
Definately get this game if you don't have it - that being said, my review shouldn't even matter
I would give this a 97/100 after all of that
I hope you read everything before looking at my rating
-------------------------------FinallyThanks so much for reading, so I hope you share the love and rate this review up, as it took some thought to make
If you are still wondering whether you should get the game or not


well it always will be a must-have, and YES! Get it!~thedubmark(I write reviews now :))			
Posted: 27 June
												this is one of my impulse buying on summer sale and i love it! it was dirt cheap considering how well polished this game is
this game makes me somewhat feels stupid and smart at the same time
PS:if you can't solve one of the puzzle, here is the to-do list :1
check your surrounding carefully2
find the exit first, and try to back-trace the route
3
always think physics with portal, more importantly, momentum
this is the most used physics in this game

												So


I've just over 350 titles purchased through Steam over my years of gaming
This isn't a humble brag, rather a picture of perspective
I have never written a "review" for any of those games, but I want to write a bit about this one
Look


the game starts off sucking
I don't know how many times I said to myself "This game is SO bad" but, I don't like losing to challenges
That's what this game is
A challenge
A challenge of fidgety controls, a challenge of stiff combat, a challenge of convoluted  quests, and I should preface this by saying I have never played any of the Gothic games to completion, but I have played the Risen series, and came to very much enjoy those
The game starts off with these milestones that seem unreachable at first, requiring seemingly way too many stat points to learn any skills, get any upgrades, or progress your character at all
Right around the 6 or 7 hour mark it was like


all these milestones came at once, and then all of a sudden, the game was playable and started making sense
I hate saying this about games, but you have to put a little time into the game before it gets good, and I guess you could argue that this is the "Piranha Bytes" way, but I felt it more in this game than in the Risen titles
So give the game a try for a while and power through the garbage first 5 or so hours, get your first companion, and THEN you will have much better grounds to make a decision
I am SUPER glad I didn't push this one to the side
UPDATE: So a little over 20 hours in, and I have to say, the game has done nothing but get better and better
I am at the point now where the world building is incredibly well done, and I have had so many awesome experiences with the quests moslty due to the lack of "Here's the morally good choice, and here's the morally bad choice"
There are SO many more grey areas than that, and choices that you made at the beginning of the game come full circle 20 hours later, and I am hoping the game continues that trend
I also want to note the companion system
I LOVE these guys
They have their own motives and views on the world, and will change their disposition towards you if your choices conflict with their goals
The companion quests, so far, have been really interesting as well
I havent cared for a companion in a game this much since KotOR, I just wish that there were more banter between your companions themselves
I feel like that was a missed opportunity that could have been interesting, and added even more to the world building
So far if I could sum this up with some cheesy quote, it would be "Shoot for the moon, because if you miss, you could still land on a star" and then I would add "


And eh



if you don't land on a star, theres all kinds of other cool stuff hanging around in space"
			
Posted: 18 October
												Pros:--------One of the most immersive and interesting open-world RPGs I've played recently
-Runs smooth as BUTTER on my computer, and my hardware isn't even that new or great
-No borders or invisible walls

you can go anywhere
-The world is fairly large, and also not empty
 A good balance of vastness, and denseness of stuff to do
-Various combat systems come together in harmony for a smooth experience
 Melee combat may feel a little stiff to some, but I got used to it
-Rich world full of character and an interesting story and lore
 Great blend of fantasy, modern, and high-tech
-Controls for Keyboard/Mouse and Xinput-compatible controlers is both very good

though I wish you could disable double-tap to dodge on keyboard
-Tons of room for changing your style of play

weapons ranging from sharpened sticks, to laser rifles all availible here
 Assign your own attribute points when you level up

learn a ton of skills, and find yourself some armor and accessories that suit your needs
 You can even learn magic, and psychic abilities
Meh:--------It takes a pretty long time to get anywhere in this game
 Be prepared to sink a dozen hours or so, before you really start to feel like you're getting significant things done/ are strong enough to do more interesting quests and go to more interesting places safely
 This may be a turn-off for some
-This game world does not give a crap about you
 It's tough
 You're meant to run away from some encounters, especially early on
 It will test your patience and skill
 Sometimes you have to dig around to figure out what to do
 This may be a turn-off for some
Cons:--------Some clumsy little things in the controls, like interacting with the wrong person/item occasionally happens
-Sometimes enemies and followers kinda slip inside objects
It doesn't happen too often, and they usually pop back out just fine, but it's a bit weird
-If a follower doesn't want to be involved in a fight because it is against his/her morals or whatever, they will just blankly follow you around while you fight, making it appear that they are simply not reacting to the combat taking place
 It'd be better if they'd go retreat off to the sidelines or something maybe, instead of getting in the way, but it's usually just a minor annoyance
-Might be too difficult/slow/frustrating for some
 Already kinda covered this in the 'meh' area
 I personally like the pacing of the game, but I know that some people will not be into it
Bottom line, I love this game, and I recommend it, but not necessarily to everyone
 It's a pretty hardcore experience
 Difficult, and time-consuming
 Immersive and wonderful
 Free and sandboxy
 Easily worth the money, if it looks like the kind of game you'd be into
			
Posted: 20 October
												Long story short: yes, this is Gothic 2, with all of its pluses and minuses
And I mean ALL of them
If you haven't played Gothic before and are trying to decide whether to grab this game or not, you should understand what Piranha Bytes games are and, more importantly, what they are not
Speaking generally, despite having dialogue choices, character progression and inventory management, I wouldn't call ELEX an RPG in the same sense as, for instance, Pillars of Eternity or Divinity: Original Sin
Mechanics of ELEX are much more straightforward, the stamina-based action combat is simpler and easier to understand, the conversation options are mostly limited to either accepting quests or rejecting them, leaving no room for a philosophical debate akin to Planescape: Torment
No, the real backbone of ELEX is its sense of adventure and real, hand-crafted world to explore
The game doesn't feature randomly generated items or level scaling for enemies, meaning that everything and everyone you meet out there is hand-placed by the developers
This, in turn, means that no matter at which point of the game you currently are, you're free to use your skills and speed to discover and loot whatever you fancy
Fall down a pit and emerge with a hefty pouch of coins, explore the dried well and find a forgotten sword stuck in a stone, fly to the top of a cliff and be rewarded with a valuable amulet that'll increase your abilities - all of this feels extremely satisfying, because it gives you a real advantage in both conversations and combat
Since the content always remains set, every small item you get, every little thing you find brings you one step closer to achieving the heights of your power
Speaking of heights, I can't help but ask myself whether it's ever a bad idea to include a jetpack in your game, because you'd better bloody believe it makes the world of ELEX so much more enjoyable to traverse
Can't win a fight? Fly to the top of the nearest cliff and flip your opponent a bird
Want to check an interesting spot far away on the map? There will definitely be a way to get there without putting yourself in mortal danger
Love to chill and enjoy the scenery? ELEX has plenty of vantage points for you somewhere up top
It feels good
It feels right
Anyway, the worst thing I can think of about this game is getting used to it
Even in the days of Gothic, the control scheme and clunkiness of movement took me several hours to get accustomed to
I suppose that's just the way Piranha Bytes operates - the movement feels a bit heavy and carries a certain amount of momentum, and that is true for both exploring and fighting
However, once you put an hour or two into ELEX, this won't be a problem anymore, and you'll be able to enjoy the game to its fullest
And there's plenty to enjoy even without venturing to the farthest points of the vast world, because every NPC you meet will most likely greet you with not just one, but two or more tasks to handle
Earning their trust to eventually join a faction is also a trademark of Gothic, and this just makes the characters you meet more believable and likeable
In the end, I think ELEX is not a game for everybody, because some of its aspects could definitely use improvements, and it's not even that polished yet - I had the game crash on me twice during the first two hours of playtime
However, for those of you who are sick of the silly open worlds a-la Ubisoft that somehow found its way into so many modern games (sorry, Geralt, but I don't feel that destroying my 837-th drowners' nest only to find a chest with useless loot counts as a good exploration experience), ELEX will be a welcome relief

												My first "review" Currently like 40 hours in i believe and the game is amazing
The start of the game is really punishing but that's a classic PB game for you :) (Which is great btw)I love how PB lets you learn about the world in the beginning and introduce to so many characters to tell you about the history of the world and their view on it
It's nicely explained by the characters
The world is amazing and there's literally 0 loading screens, only when using fast travel (Which takes literally 2 seconds to do as well) Graphics overall are very well made and im really amazed how PB managed to pull this off with only 25 people! game is voiced acted very nicely
Many people complain about the combat, at first i did too
But in like 5 hours it's something you learn and get used to, how to parry enemies and juke them as well
Most PB games require skill when fighting enemies, not just brainless clicking
If you already played gothic or risen then you should really buy this title
many "Youtubers" make videos about this game being trashy when they only shown like 2 hours of gameplay


You really need some patience when playing this game and it will be rewarding
Exploration of the world is amazing as well
I was so side tracked i didint do any main story missions
started around 27 hours in
The game does have some issues but hey, which games doesn't have them on release


The AI of companies is a bit glitchy but it's not really a major issue
Some AI do glitch and dont move from time to time but it should get patched soon
If you never played a PB title  i would wait until the game gets patched or goes on sale
For most PB fans we know that glitches often happen in Gothic etc :P but some of them are super funny so its not even that bad
I'll rate the game a solid 8
5/10
not 10 because of the glitches mostly
 I haven't been so hooked on a game for ages and Elex finally brought me back nostalagia from Gothic !  Thank you PB for this game <3 looking forward for a next game!

												It's an episode of South Park that goes 10 to 20 hours instead of 20 minutes
			
Posted: 15 June
												For South Park fans: It is a 11-hour interactive episode of South Park that you would enjoy if you like the crude humor from South Park, definitely worth purchasing
Positive points:+ This is a light RPG with few status effects and simple combat
+ The story is extreme to say the least
+ Four classes to choose from, each with different play styles
+ Interesting achievements
Negative points:- Balance is skewed towards being too easy
- Glitchy at times
- Locked at 30FPS
(not really an issue but still a worthy note)- Steam version is censored

												Fantastic game
 The whole way through, the experience feels like watching a really good South Park episode or South Park movie, and the game is a *really* solid RPG, to boot
But the game isn't without its flaws
 I want to spend a few paragraphs on some criticisms of the game, and then we'll talk about what makes the game awesome
The game feels heavily "consolized
"  Loading screens are far more frequent than they should be and the controls often don't make much sense
 Throughout the game your character will be taught "magic spells" from various NPCs
 Each time you learn a spell, you are taught a series of controls to use that spell
 However, these spells can be used both in and out of combat, and in both situations the controls are different from one another—and in neither situation is the spell invoked the same way the game inititally taught you!Your out-of-combat utilities (like firing a ranged weapon at something in the environment or sending a buddy to perform a task) are equally awkward to select and use
Now, here I should note that I played with a controller attached to a PC
 I started the game with a keyboard/mouse but changed very, very early on to give my normal gaming posture a rest (I play games a lot with the keyboard/mouse), and also because South Park: The Stick of Truth seemed to be tailored more toward a controller
 Perhaps the controls are better with a keyboard/mouse, but using a controller felt awkward in many parts of the game
 But not in combat
 In combat the controls felt great
 More on that later, though
On top of that, the game's humor can be off-putting in some parts
 This isn't a real criticism so much as it is a warning—it IS South Park, after all!  The show has a reputation of making comedy material out of even the most sensitive of topics, and this game also doesn't hold back
 I like to think of myself as a fairly easy-going guy and I try not to take many things too seriously, but there were parts in this game that I felt myself somewhat rushing through or avoiding just to get away from an uncomfortable topic
There's a lot of back-and-forth running around the map in this game, and loading screens are absolutely everywhere
 The loading screens are a real slowdown
So let's see
 The loading screens, the really iffy controls in much of the game, and the warning about how the game remains very South Park in its humor are all the things I wanted to make sure to mention
 So, now we can talk about the stuff that makes this game a fantastic one!While moving on the map and navigating menus is often awkward with the game's controls, combat is something the game gets very, very right
 As I mentioned earlier, this game is a very solid RPG, and The Stick of Truth's turn-based combat is airtight
 This isn't your typical "select an ability and watch what happens" kind of turn-based combat
 Here, you'll select an ability, and then you'll influence the outcome of the ability with some simple, but fun controls
For example, Butters the Paladin has a "Hammer of Justice" ability
 To use it, you select it and then choose a target
 The game then has you rotate the left control stick in circles to make Butters spin (think Olympic discus tossing), and at just the right instant, press the A button
 Succeed, and you'll deal bonus damage to the enemy!  If you mess up, Butters will still deal damage, but not as much
 Again, this is coming from the perspective of using a gamepad to control the game; I'm sure this is different for a mouse/keyboard, but the principle is the same
Combat is filled with awesome stuff like this
 When you are attacked, most of the time you are given the chance to block some of the enemy's damage by pressing A at just the right time
 Some enemy attacks strike multiple times, requiring multiple well-timed blocks!  Different enemy attacks have different timings as well, so you'll always need to be on your guard
These combat mechanics make even turn-based combat a very active affair
 The action is fast and challenging, so you'll need to be spot on with your controls
 Thankfully, controls in combat are responsive and intuitive, and anytime there's some ambiguity about what to do in battle, there are useful tooltips and pop-ups to remind you of how to use an ability
While combat is great fun, the game also very often presents you with multiple ways of dealing with foes
 Sometimes you can distract them and sneak by
 Other times you can use the environment to defeat your foes without having to confront them
 Keen awareness of your surroundings and appropriate use of your abilities out of combat can speed up your progress and yield satisfying results
It should be noted that if you sneak by enemies, you probably won't get experience for dealing with them
 But in the cases where you can use the environment to defeat them, you'll be awarded experience as if you had battled them!There are many quests to accomplish throughout the game, and a few side quests can be completed as you progress
 As far as questing is concerned, it's your typical RPG fare—pick up a quest, complete the objectives, turn the quest in
 The game does nothing to revolutionize questing, but it handles questing very well
The story-based quests, however, are always greatly satisfying to accomplish because you are awarded not only with experience and often loot/money, but also with story exposition done in only the way South Park can
 It really does feel like you're earning a little piece of a South Park episode or South Park movie when you complete a story quest
The writing in the game is spot on
 You'll get to watch the South Park characters you're so familiar with do the things they do, in the way they do them, while interacting with one another and with your character
 I found the story largely fun and interesting
I was often quite pleased with the developers' efforts to include as many South Park characters as they could in the game
 This could not have been an easy task to accomplish, but the game is solid through-and-through with the show's characters, and because the show has been running so long, these characters bring with them their histories, backdrops, and references that the South Park fan should thoroughly enjoy
Character customization is very in-depth for a game with such a simplistic visual style
 You'll begin the game by choosing a class, and then customizing your looks
 As the game progresses, you will find, like, a bajillion different ways to customize your charcter's costume ("gear"), hair, facial features, makeup, and accessories
 You'll even find "strap-ons" (for weapons) and "patches" (for armor) that let you add significant bonuses to your gear, letting you really specialize or round out your character and playstyle
I did make a warning above about the game's humor, but for South Park fans, that (most of the time) means you're in for more of what you enjoy about the show
 There were plenty of times I found myself actually laughing out loud at the characters' antics; or at the writing; or at the timing of a joke; or just at South Park being South Park
 It's a funny game
There is also a difficulty slider bar
 Early in the game I cranked the difficulty to max and didn't look back, and for me, it was quite rewarding
 The window of opportunity to block enemy attacks seemed drastically smaller, necessitating more precise timing, and enemies often didn't go down without a fight
 I had to stay on top of my gear choices and customize appropriately
 Which buddy to bring into battle with me was also a serious consideration, and more than once I had to stock up on potions
Overall, it's just a really solid RPG, and I'd strongly recommend it to any South Park fan
 I could go on about it, but I feel I've covered most of the relevant aspects of the game, and apparently Steam has a character limit for reviews

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE:I have played this game extensively when my internet was down (which was 3 days long) so Steam did not record my game time
Steam does not record game time while offline and if I remember correctly I should have 10-11 hours clocked in
INTRODUCTION:South Park: The Stick of Truth is a 2014 role-playing game based on the popular TV show South Park
The game was developed by Obsidian Entertainment, and surprisingly enough, published by Ubisoft in one of those occasions where they release a game that is not broken or tied to Uplay
Good job Ubisoft!PLOT (No Spoilers):The story takes place in the town of South Park where you, the player, take on the role of the 'new kid' who holds a mysterious power of making friends really fast
Upon arriving, you quickly learn about an ongoing 'Battle' (game) between the Human forces of Cartman and the Drow Elves loyal to Kyle for the control of an artifact of limitless power called 'The Stick of Truth'
PROS:+ Great art style that mimics the TV Series with great accuracy making the game feel more like an episode of the TV show rather than a video game
+ High resolution art works and good animations+ Great sound design that remains true to the TV series' quality+ Wonderful voice acting featuring the original cast and Adolf Hitler[www
imdb
com]+ Good old fashion South Park humor (See NEUTRAL #2)+ Very fun and well integrated gameplay mechanics+ Good amount of Easter eggs from the TV Show+ Excellent overall presentation starting from the character creation screen until the end credits+ Excellent Story+ Fun Canada mini-game+ Good amount of character customization however


(See CON #2)+ No Uplay account neededCONS:- Gameplay becomes repetitive after a while- Very limited armor & weapon customization and selection- No crafting mechanic to fix the above CON- Useless DLC itemsNEUTRAL:+/- Excusable 30 fps lock because it works well with the graphics, gameplay and artstyle+/- The South Park toilet and black/dark humor may not appeal to everyone (so if you don't like South Park to begin with, you will probably not like this game as well
)+/- The story is fairly linear but the presentation makes it feel as if it was open worldCONCLUSION:EXCELLENT game for South Park fans all around
This game preserves the look and feel of the series while integrating very fun and entertaining gameplay mechanics that would rival even some of the much more established RPG games
WORTH IT?:I can RECOMMEND this game at its full price only if you're a South Park fan because chances are, any fan of the series would fully appreciate all the extra content and easter eggs from the show
 However, if you're not a fan of the series but don't particularly hate it, get the game during a sale
If you hate the series and/or you're easily offended / triggered by dark / toilet humor I would not recommend purchasing this game

												(TLDR? This review is also available in video format if you scroll down
)Since 1997, South Park has graced television with its profane, unabashed, and satiric humor
 With its success it has managed to become a part of American culture and spawn a full length movie and several video games along the way but none are quite up to level as South Park: The Stick of Truth
With the help of Obsidian Entertainment, Matt Stone and Trey Parker have created the most accurate transfer of an intellectual property to games ever made
 That being said, this is a game made with longtime fans of the series in mind
 If you're not a fan of the show, or don't appreciate its style of humor your experience may differ drastically from the intended audiences
The Stick of Truth picks up shortly after the trilogy events of Season 17
 After an initial character creation screen you wake up as “the new kid” in South Park
Upon leaving your house, you'll befriend your neighbor, Butters, and venture on over to Cartman's house where he and Kenny, along with an ensemble of South Park regulars, are role-playing as a warring fantasy faction of humans that guard a sacred relic known as the Stick of Truth
 After a brief introduction and Cartman honoring you with a chosen name his kingdom is assaulted by a band of elves who manage to steal the holy object
 As in typical South Park fashion, the small and insignificant somehow manages to eventually involve the whole town and powers beyond as the story snowballs you through the town's workings, aliens, government interference, and of course


Nazi zombies
One thing that's blatantly obvious from early on is that this isn't cable television's South Park
 This is a humor much more akin to the 1999 South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut, except on steroids and about 15 hours long, which is relatively short for a game of this genre
 Much of the humor is crude and meant to be insulting, but fans of the show will find it quite satisfying
The South Park writers were really on their A game and the show makes constant references to its own history, from every single piece of junk you pick up to who or what is in each of the boy's closets
 The amount of detail and respect this game has for the source material is really quite amazing
Its visual style makes you feel like you're actually playing the show and people walking by may not know the difference
 The game play involves you picking one of four classes, each with their own unique playing-styles
The combat plays out similarly to most JRPGs with a turn-based system that rewards timed button presses similar to Super Mario RPG
 You’re also able to choose one of six companions to follow you at different points of the game each with their own distinct abilities
 It's a streamlined but fun system that forces you to pay attention while you play, although its simplicity doesn't offer much in the way of a challenge
 Occasionally you'll also be presented opportunities in which combat can be avoided or reduced by taking advantage of the environment around the foe
 It's a great feature to have, as with most turn-based RPGs, combat isn't the high point and creates a nice rewarding dynamic when you see an opportunity to kill an enemy without direct confrontation
To offset the impressively accurate paper cut out visuals, Stick of Truth employs a very serious orchestral soundtrack
 You'll frequently be reminded of Game of Thrones and Skyrim while listening
Its contrast to the material creates a great comedic effect
The voice acting remains true to the show, with Matt and Trey supplying most of the voice work, often with the same voices for different characters, with the Nazi's having an effectively hilarious voice track
While the content provided is an impressive representation of South Park, its accuracy raises the expectations enough so that when something from the series doesn't show up, it can be a bit disappointing
Some characters and locations are missing and one can’t help but think they were deliberately left out to allow for DLC and/or a sequel
South Park: The Stick of Truth is a great game for people who appreciate the show or have a similar taste in humor
 It can be a bit polarizing but that's to be expected with a title such as this
 The writing is rich and full of references that fans will truly appreciate, but sometimes, as with the show some of the jokes can get old at times
Luckily however, there are enough jokes in this game to be thoroughly enjoyable throughout its somewhat brief duration
A relatively easy difficulty, and lack of post-game content and a somewhat questionable quest reward system, where you'll frequently get items well after they've had any use to you can cause a bit of tedium to set in
The gameplay holds its own, it doesn't do anything new or amazing but the charm that saturates every aspect of it makes it feel special
This is, hands down, the best South Park game ever made
 If you're looking for the definitive South Park experience, waiting for season 18 or just want to laugh, this is the game for you
TLDR? Here's a video my friend and I put together: https://www

												Let's be real, if you played Life is Strange you're probably starved for any way to revisit our favorite heroines and would buy this game even if it were rated "Overwhelmingly Negative"
The good news is that you don't really have to worry about that
This is a good game, though it lacks the ambitious exposition of the original
While Life is Strange violently plunged you into a world of secrets and conflict armed with a rewind button, Before the Storm focuses on smaller, and maybe more mundane happenings of Aradia Bay like teen angst, familial strife, betrayal, and the fast formed bond between two very different girls
Without the superpowers of her best friend Max, Chloe's tale in Before the Storm shapes up to be a much more intimate, personal, and human tale than the original

												Deck Nine had an impossible task in Before the Storm: Not just to create a prequel to a story-driven game with a cult fandom, but to do it with:- A different game engine- Different writers- Different voice actors- Different music- No rewind mechanic(Is now a good time to mention that Deck Nine's previous work includes "Neopets: The Darkest Faerie," some remastered Playstation ports, and a forgettable snowboarding franchise?)In light of that, my expectations coming in were pretty low 


and they've been absolutely blown away
Episode 1 of Before the Storm isn't just true to the original game — as a one-to-one comparison, it's better than Episode 1 of the original Life is Strange
I feel exactly like I felt playing the first game, and I haven't felt that way since the first game ended more than 2 years ago

												I want my homie Max back
			
Posted: 3 September
												This is probably the most thorough review I'll ever write on Steam, so I want to say some things before I start:I'm only reviewing the first episode in its release state
I don't know yet if I'm going to update
I'm going to refer to the original game as LiS, to this one as BfS
LiS was a great game
People are hyped and give BfS 10/10 ratings, disregarding its obvious flaws
I would give it neither a thumb up nor a thumb down, but a "meh" rating
BfS isn't developed by the same studio and you notice that extremely
My review will get lots of thumbs down because the review system is broken
Giving a thumb down means telling that the review isn't helpful
People abuse the thumbs to vote down everything that doesn't agree with their opinion while voting up single sentence reviews that don't help anyone
I'll try to keep spoilers out of my review as much as possible
Let's take a look at some negative aspects, starting with technical stuff and proceeding into more "relevant" things:- GraphicsWhile LiS was based on the Unreal Engine, BfS uses the Unity Engine
Believe it or not, but the simple graphics are a lot worse
I actually loved the art style of LiS, but in BfS I actually deleted every single screenshot I took (and I take a lot of screenshots) because they just weren't pleasant to look at
Textures often completely lack detail, anti-aliasing is non-existent (even on maxed out AA settings) which is actually a huge problem in this game, even though I usually don't care much about AA
All my screenshots were heavilypixelated
- ControlsRemember how you chose an action in LiS by holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse into the direction of the action? In BfS, you hold the left mouse button and use WASD to choose
In other words, in order to look at stuff or interact you need two hands now instead of only one
It's not a big deal, it just makes the game less comfortable at many scenes
- VoicesYou've probably heard already that Chloe has a new voice
You probably still have her accent from LiS inside your head
That's gone
Not a big deal, you could get used to that - the problem is that her new actress just isn't good
At  some points she sounds completely unmotivated and just talks her text down without any motivation at all
Near the end of the game you will also notice heavy breathing and hear clearly that she was standing to close at the microphone
Chloe isn't the only character with a new voice, for example the famous angry David Madsen sounds really soft now
- AnimationsLots of animations look really clunky and unnatural
I wanted to call an exorcist when Rachel was turning her head
In dialogues, characters often lack facial expressions
David gets angry and raises his voice, but his soft and calm expression stays
Until BfS I never noticed what a killer missing facial expressions can be
- Paradoxes and other minor flawsFor example, there's a photo of pirate Chloe and pirate Max hanging in Chloe's living room
However, the Max with the eyepatch on the photo isn't the young Max we know from flashbacks, but the old Max you play as in LiS
In Chloe's diary entry about a schoolmate she writes something such as "He's exactly like my class schedule
We have history, but no chemistry
" You can read this while following the task "Go to your chemistry class
"The game is full of those details
- Chloe's characterAlright, Chloe's a rebel
But sometimes it's just too much
In the beginning of the game you can look at a knife stuck inside a wooden wall and Chloe says something like "This looks exactly like the knife my mom didn't want to buy me for my birthday
" She also likes tossing items just to the ground after using them, even if she borrowed them from a friend few seconds ago
I mean, come on


- DialoguesSome dialogues actually make me cringe
I won't go into details here due to possible spoilers
There's a new feature which enables you to argue with people
Everytime you have to persuade someone, just look out for the "arguing" sign and you know that's the way to go
It triggers a minigame like in Monkey Island, where your enemy delivers a statement and you have to counter with a fitting insult
Despite the fact that everyone beyond twelve years of age knows that you basically lose an argument as soon as you just start insulting your opponent, the arguing dialogues are just the worst in the game
They are just completely incoherent
You answer to a statement and suddenly your opponent starts about a completely different matter
After winning the minigame, it always seems to me like people stop arguing because they are annoyed by Chloes inability to argue, not because she "won"
But of course Chloe had to be as rebel as possible and so it works in the game's context
Furthermore, the reactions and answers of characters sometimes don't seem logical at all
- Other charactersExcept for Chloe and Rachel, the characters in this game mostly completely lack depth
You meet them, they start talking about a topic, you choose one or two answers, you go on with the game
I don't even remember what we talked about
I didn't like Rachel at all until the ending of the episode, but that's just my personal opinion
- ExplorationRemember how you strolled around in LiS, trying to find out everything about the world and its inhabitants? Trying to find motives for a good photo? It's almost non-existent in BfS
Chloe's a rebel and there's a stage play coming up at school
Everything you'll find are some posters about drug abuse and the upcoming stage play, without giving you any more information
Instead of taking photos, you can draw graffitis at walls now
There's a graffiti in every scene, so you just walk along walls until you find the spot to get your achievement
Now, some more positive aspects:+ ClothesAfter the intro you have to change clothes
You can choose the outfit you want to wear during the episode
There are two different T-shirts in the base game, you unlock three more outfits if you buy the deluxe edition and you can play as classic Chloe (without blue hair) if you preordered the game
- I probably don't have to mention that this feature is just a huge cashgrab for Square Enix
It's a neat feature anyway
+ SoundtrackJust like LiS, BfS has a nice indie rock soundtrack which fits well into the game
- Remember the scenes in LiS, where you just enjoyed the scenery and a nice song to it? They are in BfS too, but somehow they don't seem to fit into the game or they were just executed half-heartedly
They are nice to have anyway
+ GameplayWell, the gameplay won't surprise you
If you liked the gameplay of LiS and can live without time travel puzzles, you'll be satisfied
+ New ideasAfter the cool intro and the unfortunately very tedious middle part, the developers suddenly had their own ideas in the end and this is where the game finally shine
This might be a little spoiler, but there's a difference between Max and Chloe
While Max was very calm, Chloe can become very angry
At some part in the game it suddenly gets emotional, and instead of only showing Chloe's emotions, you actually get to live out Chloe's emotions
And it feels great
The arguing minigame is actually quite exciting, despite it's obvious lack of logic
For each graffiti, you can choose between two different messages which will also show up in your graffiti diary
Neat little gimmick
+ The endingJust like every LiS episode, episode 1 of BfS has a great ending
It didn't only leave me sitting with my mouth open, it actually sent a chill down my spine
Conclusion:If it wasn't for the first 20 minutes and especially the last 20 minutes of the episode (3
5 hours in total), I would actually give the game a clear thumb down
I give it a "meh" rating
It has very obvious flaws, but it's quite enjoyable if you're a LiS fan

												I love this game
It's different, rich in story, and will make even the coldest of hearts feel emotional
First time finishing the game (before I got it on Steam) I was up at 3 in the morning bubbling like a baby when I finished I chose the save Arcadia Bay ending and if you played it you know how upseting that ending was
This game, although it has it's flaws, is a masterpiece
DontNod made a wonderful game and has proven that their small team can make an amazing, beautiful, heartfelt game
I paid for the 1st episode before it was released on Steam for free, but even spending a few extra dollars was worth it, as this game has taken me through the incredible and emotional journey of Max Caulfield and Chloe Price
Pros:Beautiful indie sountrackFun use of timetraveling powersDifferent (and stunning) graphicsRelatable characters/situationsNot afraid to talk about uncomfortable topics (assault, deaths of loved ones, suicide, ect)Most small choices still have a meaningful impactStrong replay valueMany subtle refrences to shows/movies/memes Likable charactersVery atmospheric, it feels like a real townHas an unusual but nice mechanism where you can take a "Moment of Calm" and sit down on a bed/swing/bench, and just look at the world around you while calming music playsBeautiful locations and sceneryCons:Voice acting/script can be cringy at timesDespite the choices you make there are only two absolute endingsIs short (but as stated before is replayable)Can be cliche at timesOverall this game is not one to miss
Even with it's flaws, Life is Strange is one game you shouldn't miss

												It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game
I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror
And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute
When I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it
I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag
It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning
I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined
Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless
Imagine if games held this standard
Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution
You can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way
The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it
Most adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games
I've never felt so fulfilled after "playing a game" as I did today
Original, beautiful and masterfully executed
I can't wait for the next episode

												I bought this game for £5
I now realise it is worth so much more; how I missed this game for two years I don't know, I'm glad I finally got around to playing it; I haven't felt like this in a long time after playing a game, a completely lifechanging experience
Life is Strange is slightly similar to games of the Telltale series, your choices affect the outcome of the game and make subtle and huge changes throughout
You feel empathy for the characters in the world, and whilst handling mature themes such as depression, the game grips you to your seat
It is amazing! A masterpiece
The writers are on par with some of the best TV shows and films out there, it makes you question every choice you make, your own reality
As a player you actually feel like you affect the relationships between the characters
The music and art design are unique and aesthetically pleasing, which is a nice change from the usual games I play
The voice acting's brilliant, the lip synchronization is not so much, but it is not awful
Without spoiling anything, the twists in this game, WOW
I can see why this game has critical acclaim
Finally I must end saying how much I recommend this game
I've experienced nothing like it before, if you read this
Please try this game
You won't regret it

												Life is Strange isn't hard, yet it hits you hard
Life is Strange isn't challenging, yet it shows daily challenges
Life is Strange isn't long, yet its impact lasts long
Life is Strange isn't a puzzle, yet it leaves you puzzled
Life is Strange isn't giving questions, yet it offers answers
Life is Strange isn't replayable, yet finds in the replay its core
Life is Strange isn't real, yet it feels so
Life is Strange isn't about relationship, friensdhip, love, hate, light or darkness
It's about the most underestimated gift: life
I am unable to call it "game" as it would lose all the artistic veil surrounding Arcadia Bay
Art is something you perceive, it is something that comes out of the blue without a reason or a purpose
Art is something you can perceive in every step Max takes, and this is how I would label Life is Strange: art
Dontnod has made a terrific job and gives us lessons that we can easily detatch from this title and apply it in our everyday life
All the serious themes covered in such a little time amount made me understand the reason why the developers have opened a support group for those who felt really affected by some of them
And perhaps the core of this experience is simple and complicated at the same time:Life is hard, life is challenging, life is short, life is puzzling, life is uncertain, life is one only, life is strange
But life

is life

Basically, this is what Call of Duty should've returned to with its release of Call of Duty: WW2
Fantasic game! Basically, you play out three stories in one Campaign; Soviet (1941-1943), British (1942-1944), and American (1944-1945)
This game is more historically accurate than Sledgehammer's promiseThis game is what Call of Duty is all about
This is coming from a fan that his first COD wasn't MW or BO2, but was Call of Duty: Finest Hour on GameCube back in 2004

												Ok


the game


oh gosh, my tears, I can't hold it



Because THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
Here are the pros and cons (or not) for this game
The pros:+ Well-written and touching story about love, forgiveness and sacrifice
+ Beautifully hand-drawing, from characters to every detail of the environments
(Too much clear water :)) )
+ Ahhh, musics to my ears



It made me cry




+ Responsive control
Nice
+ The platforming section is really well-executed, tricky gameplay
+ As the upgrade version of the original game, with more contents, more balance, more secrets,


more grinding for the ability poinits
+ Now it has 4 difficulties, from Easy to One-life


I hate one-life mode :))
+ A huge map with lots of exploration
+ There are parts of the game when it requires you to escape from certain death
Well, It's time to ultilize your skills to get you through danger
+ This game reminded me of the game named "Cat Mario", the game which makes you suffer from falling, dying, danger at every corners
RAGE!! :))
+ The game now is more compatible than the original one
+ The game is best example of Unity Engine Games that can run smoothly on low-end pc
+ No FPS drops
+ First playthrough with 340 deaths for finding EVERY SINGLE SECRET in hard mode, how bad could it be? :))
I bet that i will die even more if the game were bigger
+ Can you make a speed run from beginning to the end without using ability points, no death, under 3 hours in one-life mode?  How long you guys can endure it? :))
A MUST-HAVE GAME for anyone who want solid (with some trolling and surprise moments :)) ) and challenging gameplay with pure story-telling
And I am still waiting for the sequel "Will of the Wisps"
Oh boy, I cried even more when i watched the sequel trailer




Amazing game to the end




_Epic Final Score: 10/10

												Every now and then there's a game that changes the way you look at all types of games in the same genre
Take Witcher 3 for example, good RPGs are now bad because we now know that is possible to do better, MUCH better
For many of you this game will fly under your radar, many of you might even ended up here by mistake
Whatever the reason i don't care just BUY this game
This is a masterpiece, this is the Witcher 3 of metroidvania 2D plataformers
The story is beyond good, is beautiful, it'll break your heart and make you smile, it wont bore you and it has enough to keep you engaged
The MUSIC? The music in this game has life, it tells a story in it self, without a word you can understand the world around you, it whispers in your ear, never yells, it tells you a secret for you to keep
The art style is stuff of dreams, the color palette is vybrant but also dull when it needs to be
The hand drawn vistas and landscapes are worth the games price, just so you can bathe in how good this games looks
The controls are just good, and they have to be, because this game is HARD, it rewards acuracy and quick reflexes, have you got those?I died 422 times on my first playthrough and let me tell you, i'd die 422 more just hoping this game would be biggerThis IS the 2D plataformer to beat, this is more than a game is an EXPERIENCE

												This is an action platformer in the Metroid style
As you explore areas you gain new abilities that allow access to previously unpassable ones
It plays as good as it looks - which, considering it looks phenomenally gorgeous, is no small feat




The controls are responsive, and the platforming gets nicely tricky (though not too frustrating)
It also has several really cool "escape" setpieces that are just right for being challenging, and making great use of your skills
You get the ability to slingshot yourself off of certain objects, which includes enemy projectiles, and these sequences make crazy use of that
Mixed up also with various jumping / gliding / wall jumping bits that make them very exciting to do
For a 2d platformer it really is quite thrilling when these setpieces kick off
It's an exceptional game mechanically, and hugely enjoyable - plus its also surprisingly hard on the highest difficulty, so represents a fairly big time to complete
There is a downside depending on your tastes - the story and music are pretty twee stuff, and the "voice acting" is just kiddyish gobbledygook
But other than that its a very engaging, artistically stunning game, and I highly recommend it
			
Posted: 22 June
If anyone ever told me a video game cannot be a piece of art, I would show them Ori and the Blind Forest (soon to be the Ori franchise)
Ori and the Blind Forest is one of few games that recieves very little negative attention (only notable negativity come from those complaining about the Definite Edition release)
There is very little wrong with the game itself in terms of gameplay, glitches, and music
The story itself is known for making even the toughest of men cry as well
Everything in the game itself seems to come together and forge a masterpiece
The main gameplay of Ori and the Blind Forest is the platforming
It features a unique respawn system I have not seen in any other game (though someone else may be able to name one), utilizing an ability to create a respawn point anywhere at the cost of energy
This energy can also be used for a blast charge that can break some walls
Respawning by itself needs strategy, deciding whether the energy could be used for a better cause or not
Platforming itself isn't frame perfect like many say, the game was very responsive with the jumping and was never frustrating at any time
This is one of few games where I had not one issue with the movement and controls
As for glitches in Ori and the Blind Forest, they are so few that you are highly unlikely to experience any in the entire thing
You aren't going to be coming across a Spore: Galactic Adventures experience here, where you have to be purposefully avoiding things in order to prevent glitches
The lack of game-breaking glitches is actually rather impressive
Yes, there are some, though it appeared to me you have to be purposefully trying to cause them to occur
The art and music in Ori and the Blind Forest is the most notable thing in the whole game
The music score by Gareth is incredible
Once you hear the songs, with how emotional and fitting they are for the game, you could easily see as to why they recieved such praise
The art design is incredibly unique compared to similar games as well
It is a 2D game that looks and feels as gorgeous as a 3D game
The backgrounds and foregrounds are utilized to their greatest potential, being able to see the antagonist, Kuro, flying at you from a distance to Gumo hiding in the foreground behind tall grass
The two combined, art and music, end up creating a visual masterpiece that is incredibly pleasing to look at
Despite how simple Ori's sprite appears to be, it is at the same time very detailed with the animation and look
Everything in the game looks and moves like something that is alive
The final part of the game, the story, is known to make grown men cry
While it isn't the most unique story when you first start, with Naru perishing and Ori going on a quest for 3 elements, it ends up becoming apparent as to why it is unique later on
Gumo, Kuro, and even Naru end up making the story incredibly unique for many, many reasons
Each character has a lot of backstory, and it is incredible how it is told without words
Gumo, Naru, and Kuro are incredibly detailed and interesting to learn about despite how simplistic they appear to be
We learn all about Ori throught the whole game, similar to Kuro
Every character, even the dead ones, have so much thought and effort put into them that it shows what Moon Studios is capable of
Gameplay: 8/10 - It could do with better combat, but since the platforming was nailed incredibly well with the platforming being the main focus as well, the combat can easily be looked over
Soundtrack: 10/10 - This is the only soundtrack I can say I have never enjoyed more in my entire life
Every song fits the scenario and changes the mood drastically
Without the work Gareth did, Ori and the Blind Forest would not be so amazing
Art Design: 9/10 - The game looks and feels exactly like you are playing a painting
The characters move and look like they are alive as well
There is very little I could say bad about the art of Ori and the Blind Forest
Story: 8/10 - Every single character has a massive amount of thought put into them and has their entire story told without the need of text
Even the least interesting character, Sein, is still incredibly interesting to think of
Every character in the game has incredible amounts of story put into them and the game tells it without saying it directly
What happens to Kuro, you have to piece together
Why the ending is sad, you have to tell yourself as to why
The character's stories are incredible, and the game might have been even better if it was even more focused on them as opposed to the elements Ori and Sein were searching for
Bugs/Glitches: 9/10 - While there will always be bugs, I did not experience a single one during my entire time playing the game
I thought this was incredible, considering how buggy many games are today
The game still has some glitches as expected, but the lack of any glitches that occur during the playthrough of it is astonishing
They seemingly have to be activated purposefully
Overall: 9/10 - Ori and the Blind Forest is perhaps one of the greatest games I have ever had the chance to play
I highly urge anyone who hasn't play Ori and the Blind Forest to do so
With Will of the Wisps coming out soon, now would be the time to play the original masterpiece that began my new favorite franchise

												(Already played the original game? => skip the first few paragraphs)Ori and the Blind Forest is a very beautiful metroidvania platformer
It has won several awards for it's art and music
The entire world is handcrafted and every area has a unique feel to it
You play as Ori, a tiny being in a huge forest
Your task is to restore the elements and restore balance in the forest of Nibel
During your adventure, you will gain abilities and skills that give you access to previously unaccesible locations
The game has a unique save-system where you can place a checkpoint ("Soul Link") almost everywhere
Are you stuck? Create more savepoints
Forget to save and die? -- Too bad, you're going to have to do that all over again
Besides that, the game allows you to pick skills from a skill tree that give you more freedom in how you want to play
Want to explore, pick some of the exploration skills
Need more fire power, pick a damage increasing skill
This game is an extended and improved version of Ori and the Blind Forest and is a stand-alone experience
You do not need to play the original game first (the core game is the same)
Why buy this if you already own Ori and the Blind Forest?- New abilities that both change how you move around and change combat in a new way
- A large, optional, beautifully crafted and varied new area which tells Naru's backstory
You need to backtrack to find it
- No more closed-off areas; Spirit Wells can be used to warp across the map and you will have access to every location, even after you finish the main storyline
- Difficulty scaling
Was the original game too hard (or too easy)? Try the new 'Easy', 'Hard' and 'Single Life' modes, each with their own leaderboards
- Behind the scenes content and concept art!- 7 new achievements to get!Like the original; probably best played with a Xbox 360/One controller, although not impossible to play on kb/m

												This game was already good
Insanely good
Unbelievably good in fact
But now it's perfectLet me try to explain how the new areas look, if i even can
The new areas are definitive (heh) proof that video games are indeed art
This isn't even a game anymore
This is a painting
You are literally playing a painting
Seriously,  Moon Studios went to WORK on this game
If you walk over a leaf, the leaf moves
If you step on a single blade of grass, it waves along back
If you run across the ground, it glows in response
The environment, the atmosphere, it's all perfect
You could set steam to take a screenshot every 10 seconds
The soundtrack to this game is hands down the best soundtrack for any game i will ever play
Gareth Coker, you take a bow
Even if you don't play video games, or don't have a computer, or anything you owe it to youself to listen to the soundtrack at least
The Definitive edition expansion to the soundtrack is name your price
GO DOWNLOAD IT
Listen bud, you had better go download this game
Yes, you
Right now
You're missing what will likely be one of the best game's you'll ever play if you dont

												I just finished my fist playthrough of this game, and I think it's become my favorite ever
 I generally play action RPGs or just RPGs (souls series, witcher, elder scrolls, fallout etc
) and I've found some phenominal titles
 But I've felt that every game I played up until now has been lacking something, for example, The Witcher 3's story and quests are fantastic, but the combat is sometimes clunky
 The mechanics of the souls games are great, but you have to go out of your way and do research to figure out the story, which I've done, and still the stories haven't really grabbed me
 Ori and the Blind Forest is as close to a perfect game as I have ever played
 It has some really unique mechanics that all work beautifully, the story is bittersweet and wonderful, the music and artstyle are perfect for the game and its environments
 In summary, this game is a work of art
 I had one problem during the entirety of my 11 hour playthrough, which went through almost 100 percent of the map: I got stuck under a rock and had to quit out
 That's it, that's the only thing approaching a glitch or a mistake I found
 If this game is on sale, it's criminal not to buy it
 If it's not on sale, it's still criminal not to buy it
 This is the first game I've written a review for, because these developers deserve more attention for this masterpiece

												So Meta, Even This Acronym
OneShot is cute, imaginative and, at times, simply mind-blowing—and blowing the jaded mind of a modern gamer is not an easy task
The meta nature of the game is highlighted by its name: you only have one shot at it, and then the save file becomes corrupted
There won't be a second journey
Only


how is it fair? Whatever you do, you will have to face a dilemma in the end, and choosing either of the cruel options is reductive and simply wrong
Can you


rebel against the whole thing, perhaps?These, however, are the thoughts you'll deal with by the end, but even before it the game is littered with charming meta-humor
The main character needs to sleep, for example, and when she does, the game closes
Some puzzles require thinking very much out of the box and using unexpected approaches
All the while the touching and lovely story of a hero stranded in a strange land and carrying a lightbulb to light up the local sun continues to unfold
The game is at its most poignant during the moments when the hero interacts with you, the player, whom she considers to be a god
You get to chat, encourage her, and fight your own enemy—often outside the game
The execution of OneShot leaves something to be desired: while very sweet in terms of visuals, it's often clunky and makes you do a lot of unnecessary walking back and forth solving various puzzles; coupled with imperfect location layouts, it gets frustrating sometimes
However, I'd say the game itself is charming and unique enough for it to be easily forgivable
			
Posted: 11 June
												I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam
I've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot
I don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context
(I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party
Be warned!)Transistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life
They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you
They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously
However, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason
In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters
When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the "eyes" of the protagonist
OneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story
Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all
It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close
It was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game
It's really hard to put into words


but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees
:DAnyways, random game comparison tangent over
It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended
Extremely solid 10/10
If you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc
, this is basically a must-buy

NOTE: This spoiler-free review is accurate as of the newest update (Solstice)
Due to the content and ending added through this update, I highly recommend this game, and if you have finished the game before this, I implore you to replay it to experience the true ending
I was introduced to this game by Markiplier's playthrough
I only heard 10 seconds of what he said before I closed his playthrough and decided to get this game myself, feeling that this game is worth going in blind, and would be one with a lasting impression
It's True
This is the most emotionally-invested game I've had the pleasure to experience
Even after the end, it haunts me till today


and my emotions are so messed up just thinking about my experience that it's difficult to even review it
Even so


I'll try
Oneshot is A story-driven puzzle-adventure game
You play as a cat-like persona named Niko in a Mission to restore a world's lost sun, a large lightbulb
You only have one chance to save the world
It seems very straightforward



Except you're not playing as Niko
You are considered a separate entity



yourself
By opening the game, you unwillingly become "god", in charge of a world that operates, exists and disappears at the click of your mouse
Niko, meanwhile, is just dragged in as the "protagonist", waking up in a different, crumbling world


a child trying to get back home, to the waiting arms of mommy
You are essentially Niko's guiding voice, in a world both of you have no understanding of, and are in charge of leading Niko to bring light back to the lands


and at the same time, bringing Niko back home
Of course, its not that simple
The game is sentient, aware of how it's a program running on your computer, and will attempt throughout your journey to keep you from returning the sun
But in the end, it is unable to control your final decision


and yet, it still gives a last stand by denying you a perfect ending
It's in control of the story and is hiding things, and without you thinking outside of the box to beat the game's coded "story"


Niko, the world, and the game itself


will never find peace
The writing and story in and of itself is one of this game's strong points, as the amount of fourth-wall breaking and events that reveal the true nature of the world is extremely compelling, especially since its all addressed to who the ingame people think is "god"


you
The biggest draw to this game, however, is simply How personal it makes the relationship between you and Niko
Leading Niko feels like leading a younger sibling, in which Niko doesn't really understand what's going on, but will deal with events in their own childlike, innocent way
During your advanture, Niko also comments on Every action you take and even questions you about our world all in your own name


which further got me attached to Niko
Standard game mechanics are also used to strengthen this bond, as when Niko is tired, you have to find a bed to let Niko rest in; this is the only way to save and close the game "naturally", and also initiates dream sequences along with more dialogue between you and Niko
If you decide to close the window instead, Niko will be afraid and in a state of shock when you open the game again, as you brought darkness to the World Niko is in
This happens often, to the point where you'll likely be afraid to hurt Niko by closing the game
Yet, despite your cluelessness and inability to explain how you can access things out-of-game


Niko trusts you
It's a sort of child-like trust towards an adult that's so innocent that you can't help but love Niko back
When the game denied me the Opportunity to respond to Niko, who was frantically calling my name


I Realised that I could do nothing but stare at the screen
That feeling is horrid, accompanying a person almost all the time


and then being denied the chance to say "I am here for you"
Eventually, I wasn't playing for the sake of the world


I was playing for Niko
For Niko's happiness, and to hear Niko speak to me again
Niko felt real
I wasn't ready to let my little cat-like child go, even though that's what I was fighting for this entire time
And that made the full game's ending all the more painful
You wouldn't expect a person's happiness


to hurt you so much
OneShot is initially a story of trust and moral decisions, but its true lesson is of attachment


before Letting go
The initial ending will make you think of your consequences
The true ending will make you cry, reluctant to pass the credits
You only have one shot, as once you complete the story


you'll want it to stay completed
And yet


I Don't want it to end
I'll never forget you, Niko

Product received for free
												Do you like a game with a story line? Like to solve puzzles that makes you think twice? Like games that make you feel soemthing? Then this is a game that you've been missing out on since December 6, 2016! As you might have noticed with all the comments, "trying to explain the game would spoil the game"
 All I can say is that OneShot is an experience that you won't forget anytime soon
Just a small note though, "Prepare yourself for a great OST, along with some pancakes
We love pancakes!!!!"

"The world knows you exists"I cannot describe just how amazing this game is


OneShot is a game where this game breaks the 4th wall and knows about your existance
You are guiding a character named Niko
Niko wakes up in another world that is "decaying"
This world is dying because its sun went out and your mission is to save the world


However


your choices will affect the gameplay
This game breaks the 4th wall by knowing that YOU exist
It has puzzles that you have to find out using your computer, and not the game itself
This game, is by far, the most amazing game I have played


I never know that I can grow attacthed to a cute character as Niko
The soundtrack is really good, the storyline is amazing, and the characters are well placed
This



is the first game that legit


made me cry


I would totally recommend this game to people, because its simply really good
Edit: I just completed




the "original" ending





I'm


crying

												Like Undertale, this game is about a young child trying to get home after falling into a land of strange creatures while being blessed with a "videogame" power
However while Undertale is bright and cheery, OneShot is quiet and somber
If you liked Undertale, give it a shot!

												I summoned a mad phantom with the intention of dueling him, but instead he sat down and offered to toast with me
We continued on throughout Undead Settlement together despite my wariness of him and he helped me take out all the mobs in the surrounding area
After a while, I became accustomed to fighting alongside my newfound friend and started turning my back to him knowing full well that he would protect me to his last, dying breath
We were a team
The best of friends, and nothing could stand in our way
He may not have been a Warrior of Sunlight, but Solaire's legacy thrived on within him
Jolly co-operation resumed until we neared the Curse-Rotted Greatwood


 And it was then that I decided to take yet another chance and summon a second Mound-Maker to see if we could rally him to our side
The plan seemed successful at first
But it wasn't long before I noticed some suspicious patterns in the phantom's movement, and his interest in my backside became a significant concern
My anxiety was proven justified when the phantom took a swing at me with his greatsword and missed
My loyal protector raised both his hand and his middle finger at the attacker, before charging forward with fury the likes of which none in Lothric had seen
He made it his personal duty to end the traitorous life of the one who would dare attempt to strike at me, and before long the violent fool was fleeing from our jolly wrath
He rushed up a ladder and leaped across rooftops before finally dropping a harmful distance to the ground, giving us an opening to attack
My companion launched himself from the rafters and his flowing cape waved majestically in the air as he readied his sword and plunged towards the infidel who would dare spit on the tenets of co-operation and sunlight
The valiant protector lunged his sword deep through the attacker's back before he could escape, the weapon grinding through bone and flesh and rendering him a lifeless husk
I dropped down following this, and we waved and spun our capes at one another in excitement and victorious glee
But this was the end of our time together
We gave each other one final wave before my friend's body started to fade away as he was whisked back to his own dimension
It hit me I'd never see him again

												After putting these many hours, I must say that this is one of the best, if not THE best RPG
Period
It's hard, yes
It has a steep learning curve, also yes
But this game is a rare gem among the simplified, straight-forward, linear games that are currently in trend
Rare indeed for a game that actually rewards you for patience and restraint and encourages players to slow down and observe the surroundings and the enemies
Of course, the same can be said about Dark Souls 1 and 2
But Dark Souls 3 is really much more refined than those in a good way
Relatively faster paced combat not only feels more fresh but I think is a necessary step forward in making the gameplay more interesting
Also, the enemies are much more aggressive to compensate for this faster paced combat
Though the lore does not appear to be on par with the one in Dark Souls 1, which I personally believe to be the best in the Souls series
But it is still well above Dark Souls 2, which I personally didn't like all that well
I could go on and on about this game, but for brevity I must say: Everyone must try this at least once

												Tip from someone who recently beat the game
You can use the cord for your controller to hang yourself
Due to many responses as to having wireless controllers bash your head with it until you forget about the game or you die doing it
			
Posted: 15 September
												You'll try
You won't know what's going on
You'll think dying is bad
Your friends will explain things to you, using words like, "Estus shard" and "Praise the sun" and it won't make sense
You'll give up after dying repeatedly on the tutorial boss only to finally kill it and then die to a dog that scares you into falling off of a cliff
Three months later, your friends will convince you to play again
You try it out, only to fail yet again
This time though, you understand that's part of the process, just as your friends had reassured you
You'll roll
You'll roll again, then again
You've done it! The dog that once scared you into jumping off a cliff is dead and you've miraculously taken no damage
Renewed vigor fills you and you continue on
This time you ignore your friends, resorting to the wiki to answer your questions and your own curiosity to guide you to treasure
Suddenly things begin to make sense
You go to bed
You wake up with this incessent urge to play again, oddly intrigued by the story even though you're "not that type of gamer"
"Why do I enjoy this?" You'll ask yourself
Soon, you're rolling in real life, to dodge your responsibilities solely to play this game
Didn't think it'd happen to me
It did
Buy it while it's on sale so the first three months of you not really playing it don't feel like, "Such a waste of money
" It's not a waste, even at full price
Amazing game and story
So damned confusing at first but it's worth it
I promise you

 Positives: + Gorgeous looking
+ Level design is great
+ Massive areas
+ Game rewards you when you progress
+ Difficulty
+ Well designed enemies and bosses
+ Best PVP in souls games
+ Amazing soundtrack
+ NPCs are interesting and well done also their quest lines are pretty fun
+ If you want to CO-OP with a friend it has never been this easy
+ Good and smooth controls
Negatives: - Sometimes framerate drops but not too often
- Areas aren't connected like in Dark Souls I
But it's not a big deal
- IMO some of the bosses need a little buff
Summary As a Souls "veteran" this is the best Souls game in my books this is just amazing piece of work to be honest i didn't even expect this much
FromSoftware did amazing job and hopefully it doesn't end here
This is how you make a game

Spoiler free reviewIf you didn't enjoy the quality of Dark Souls II and are wondering about the enjoyment of Dark Souls III and the fact that it may be overhyped, worry no longer
Dark Souls III is the true successor to Dark Souls
The third entry in a game series renowned for its outstanding unique storytelling and its sinister difficulty, FromSoftware has brought us again another game worthy of praise
Taking place in the land of Lothric, you will encounter grotesque beasts of the unknown, epic bosses, the most beautiful environments and a lore deeper than any ocean
If you are tired of hand-holding games where the game seems to shove tutorials in your face even to end-game than this is the game for you
Dark Souls is NOT a HARD game
One of the reason that I hold Dark Souls in such high regard is not because of the difficulty but rather the fact that it doesn't treat the player as if they're a child
The game will punish you but know that it doesn't mean the end, rather every death you face is nothing more than a stepping stone to a greater success, a hard earned success is honestly the greatest feeling ever
You will learn new skills and eventually adapt, the game knows you aren't stupid and will treat you like you are; a human, something a lot of games these days are sorely missing
DifferencesAgain, Dark Souls III feels more like a sequel to Dark Souls I than II ever did
Borrowing things from all their previous games you will see happy changes to the overall game
Fans of Demon Souls will be happy to know that the hub world shares an uncanny resemblance to the Nexus as well as the Maiden
Extremely well designed bosses inspired from the creatures of Bloodborne and its engine as well as Dark Souls II's accessibility to the series
Positives: CAMEOS! Returning characters will make appearances
Extremely well optimized
Keyboard and Mouse controls aren't that bad
There is now no permanent health loss when dying
Amazing soundtrack that will soothe your ears
Extremely well designed boss fights
Full of amazing locations to explore
 Great level design
Rewarding difficulty
Playing CO-OP with a specific player is very easy now
Stances
Combat has been reworked for the better
No more Soul Memory
Interesting NPCs, to encounter and converse with
PVP is better than it ever was
Classes don't lock you into anything, you can make your build into anything you want, e
g
magic user
World fits together nicely in a way that makes sense
Open world, areas are massive
Approachable systems, deep and very easy to learn and master
Mage builds are rethinked, they aren't as broken and overpowered like in Dark Souls II
Matchmaking is a breeze
This is NOT the final Souls game
BACKSTABS ARE BACK! At the very least better executed than in Dark Souls II
You can easily switch between OFFLINE mode & ONLINE mode now
Negatives: Though rarely, at the moment there is a few framerate hiccups but other than that PC version is very well done
Somewhat noticeable pop-ins
The world isn't inter-connected like in Dark Souls I which may upset some
CAMEOS! Though I've written it as a plus, some may dislike it as some may think of it as lazy where From could've very well created new and interesting characters
Not necessarily a negative but having an unstable connection while online will bring you back to the main menu
 Is this game worth it?Yes, very much so! Though I am biased, this is truly an amazing game
It doesn't matter if you are a veteran, new or old, Dark Souls III takes the best part of all of From's previous games and makes it even better
It surpassed my expectations, even more it completely destroyed what I should expect from a game
All upcoming games, Triple A especially take note, this is how you make a game
This is a true game
Thank you kindly, Alex for giving me the chance to play this wonderful game

												Sometimes, second impressions are more important than the first


I picked this game up last year, not long after finally playing "Divine Divinity", which quickly became a favorite of mine, due to the off-kilter writing, challenging and free-form battles, and stellar atmosphere and audio
With all the buzz around the latest Divinity and overwhelmingly positive reviews, I finally plunked down the premium price for the game, and entered a world of initial disappointment: The complex mechanics, challenging difficulty , and voice acting that comes out of all corners, on top of convoluted quests seemed to be a bit too much for me at the time
I put several hours into the game and then shelved it, rather disappointed
I couldn't see how the game received such overwhelming reviews with what a mess it seemed to be at the time
Fast forward about a year later, and I give it another whirl, just on a hunch


that maybe, just maybe I'd be able to find it more palatable this time
I'm sure glad I gave it another go
After reading up a bit more on the game's mechanics and stats, I started with an open mind and a brand new character
I decided to devote a good four or five hours into my first session back and really get a good undertstanding of what's going on, and that's when it just *clicked* for me
The attention to every detail, every line in conversation, every battle, every creature, scroll, skill book, ingredient and object you can interact with is unparalleled
This game gives me the same feeling I got when playing Ultima VI and Wizardry V back in the day


you want to keep exploring, learning, experimenting, and not stop playing
I'm 40 years old and have many responsibilities in life, yet I've found "Divinity: Original Sin" keeping me up until the wee hours of the morning, going to work exhausted, telling myself "I'll take a break from it tonight", but going back to play again and again
I've put about 30 hours into this play through so far and I feel I'm just scratching the surface
The writing takes some of the fantasy stereotypes and rewrites them in such a way that makes them unpredictable
Once you understand the battle mechanics and the different ways you can win a fight, it becomes very rewarding
Plenty of loot in the game, even the seemingly useless items can obtain value by crafting or sellling for a few extra gold pieces
Speaking of selling: most random NPC's you can trade with, which is a great touch: just like in real life, most people will have some sort of currency or item you'd want
Digging graves, making traps explode, talking with animals, setting random things on fire, breaking into inn rooms, the list of things to do goes on and on


and unlike a lot of RPG's, none of it feels like "filler" or busy work
I'm very much looking forward to checking out the sequel when it's officially released in later 2017
For now, I see "Divinity: OSEE" keeping me plenty of busy, and rewarded, until that time

												In a world where "enhanced edition" has started to be synonymous with "will run on modern hardware if you shell out $20" it's absolutely refreshing to see Larian deliver this masterpiece free of charge to owners of the original
You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards
Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features
The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game
New features for EE: Fully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting
The voice acting is really good too Dual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield Grenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades
 Tactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix
Classic mode still available obviously
Split screen co-op  Controller support Updated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects Updates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspectsI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game

Posted: 3 January, 2016
This is a review/list of a 2 player Co-op experience (not split-screen) of the Enhanced Edition (without mods) played around a month after the release without any prior experience of any Divinity game
We played the entire game with keyboard and mouse on both computers
Character creation, roleplaying, exploration and story
+ The characters are shaped during the travels allowing you to diverge (if you want) from the class you created at the start
+ Reading books, letters and listening to NPCs reward the players taking their time doing those kinds of things
+ LOADS of side-quests with varying components such as VIP-escort, bosses, storylines for your mercenaries, puzzle solving and rollplaying (duh!)
+ There's voice acting for (almost) all the dialogues in the game
+ (Co-op only) You and your Co-op friend may disagree on matters in the story and this will change your characters traits in different ways, giving you different bonuses based on what you reply
+ (Optional) The Tactician Mode offers a fun and innovative harder playthrough where the enemies have new tricks up their sleeves
+ (Optional) The Honour Mode = Permadeath + Tactician Mode combined
No resurrection scrolls, saves over your one and only saveslot when someone in your party dies and deletes your save if both your main characters die
~ The Puzzle elements in the game can both be fun and frustrating at times
~ We didn't even use half of the spells in the game, yet somehow we felt like there were spell classes not even present in the game
- Keys/arrows/books will clutter up your inventory and it's hard to keep track on what to keep/throw so you might end up keeping them all in a bag
Maybe a keychain & a quiver would be an alternative
- Renaming/customizing bags so that you can identify what is inside without opening it would be a nice addition
- Got stuck HARD on one of the quests due to the way we wanted to play
Minor spoiler warning
"The Councillor's Wife"-quest forces you to break in and steal things
We were trying to play without stealing/breaking in anywhere, but it seems to be the only way you can do it
Combat
+ The elemental system offers alot of options in fights, puzzles and character development
+ Enemy encounters feel challenging throughout the entire game
+ A large variety of enemies to encounter
(which gets even better in Tactician Mode!!)+ Being able to sort your spells and action items into 5 different "hot-bars" is a life saver later on
- Selecting enemies during fights can be a pain because you might miss them due to their animations
- From time to time the enemies and other NPCs don't know what to do during a fight so they just stand around and skip their turn after ~10 seconds
How does it look? What does it sound like?+ The massive 7 hour soundtrack was one of the biggest surprises for us, it is very enjoyable
+ Refreshing environments in contrast to many games that go for the gloomy look
+ It's easy to see what is going on when you're in combat or out adventuring
+ A smart system that makes things see-through where your characters are
+ Great and easy to use camera controls
- The cinematics could use a visual overhaul
- A few times in the game uninvolved NPCs won't shut when you are fighting
Options and performance
+ We didn't experience a single software-crash during the entire game!+ The option menu included everything that we wanted to change, including a sound mixer with the following sliders available: FX/Music/Ambient/Voice/Cinematics and Master
+ Has built-in support for mods
However, there aren't that many mods available at the time of writing
+ Includes a variant of borderless fullscreen called "Fake Fullscreen"
Jumping in and out of the game is as fast as you'd expect from a borderless feature, but it will minimize as soon as you're clicking on something outside the game
- The top part of the UI doesn't show the correct values such as your health, the turn order and which buffs/debuffs you and your enemies have been exposed to
- Both of us experienced sound problems in certain areas of the game: King Boreas' treasury and right outside Icara's Ice Prison
- (Co-op only)Sometimes the game won't show (or even load) the same data for both players
Examples: The second player won't see the correct animations, what gear anyone is wearing, your stats might go back to 5 on each point and/or it will show you that you don't have full health even though you do
The Verdict
9/10A fantastic co-op game that makes you look at the clock and say: "woah, have we really been playing this for 8 hours straight?" and then play some more
Great value, it really had everything we were looking for and more
The only reason not to get this must-have-game is if you're an impatient person
We can't wait until Divinity: Original Sin II gets out of Early Access!

EVERYTHING
THE RATS TALK
			
Posted: 11 January, 2016
												Divinity: Original Sin is a roleplaying game developed by Larian Studios
The game was also partially funded through Kickstarter
This enhanced edition of the game was released in October 2015 for PC, PS4 and Xbox One
It came as a free upgrade for everyone that owned the original game which was released in June 2014
Gameplay in Original Sin follows a very classic RPG style of play
You control two heroes, and you take part in battles which are turn-based combat
 The game play is very tactical, and some fights can last up to about forty five minutes at times
Positioning, making sure you use potions and spells at the optimal moment all play a key role to success in Original Sin
The combat system can be considered to be slow paced, but I personally enjoyed the tactical thought you have to put into every action you take
The game’s tutorial system at the start of the game is done very well, and introduces all elements of gameplay in a satisfying manner
 A lot of the game is based in dialogue as well; I will say this now, if you aren’t one for reading masses amount of text (or listening to), then you will probably want to avoid playing this game, as there is a boat load of text and dialogue to be found here
There are times when you get to make key choices in the dialogue scenes, and also offers branches to find out more information about lore and plot as well
 Overall, the gameplay is really well done, and if you want to find a game that you can absolutely get completely lost in its gameplay, then you should stop here and just pick it up
Graphically, Original Sin looks gorgeous
The enhanced version of the game improved the graphics quite a bit over the original release, and how managed to reduce the install size
The colourful environments and lush greenery just look amazing
This is one of the best looking games I have played in a very long while
The animations of all characters is done very well too; never did I see any janky looking movements or action, which helped at keeping me fully immersed in the beautiful world
As with all RPG games, the story is crucial to the reception it gets
Original Sin does not disappoint here either
On top of the games over arching main story line, you also have the chance to branch off into other lesser side plots which can sometimes make you forget all about the rest of the game as they are so in depth
The side quests in this game would probably be main stories in another; that is how good the plot behind Original Sin is
You will of course have to be up for reading the text if you want to get the full effect out of it though
The majority of Original Sin is voice acted – this helps a lot given the amount of text in the game, but there are parts, which are sometimes quite randomly selected, which aren’t voice acted
This is where you will need the patience to continue reading the dialogue to fully understand what is happening in the world
The sound effects and soundtrack are really good too; nothing seemed out of place so it fits in well with the game
I found the game to be fairly tricky, I had never played the classic RPG games, I was just too young to understand them, and so I felt as if this game took me on a crash course of learning about them
I have to admit, I did have to use wiki’s and FAQs at times to progress and work out how best to tackle a few bosses; but that should be taken as part and parcel of the gaming experience with something of this size
Researching the best action to take for me makes the game all that more fun
The world in which this game is set in, feels so alive and active
When you are in towns you can hear plenty of market sellers in the background selling their goods, you can find countless amounts of side quests, and plenty of items to interact with and loot
If you are looking for a game with almost perfect level design, look no further
In total, this game took me about 54 hours to complete, this was with doing as many side quests as I could find and listening/reading to all the dialogue in the game as well – that is on single player
Where Original Sin gets above other games of its type, is that you can also play the game in co-op mode as well; that alone means you can probably hit the triple figures for the amount of hours on offer in this game
 There is an absurd amount of content to see
Since this is the enhanced edition of the game, I didn’t find any technical issues
The game runs like a dream on 4k resolutions
Loading times are almost none existent as well
Like I said above, they have somehow managed to get the install size down on the game as well, which is something of a mystery given the amount of improvements they have added/changed

To sum up, Divinity: Original Sin is an absolute masterpiece of a game
The gameplay whilst slow paced is so well done, it will keep you interested and wanting more after you first battle
The plot is one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of seeing in any video game, and one that I will remember for a very long time
On top of all this, you the amount of content on offer is amazing
I cannot recommend Divinity Original Sin enough, even if you aren’t a massive fan of the RPG genre, this could be the game that changes that opinion for you

												This is my first steam review, and it probably won't be read in the sea of other comments on this title, but I felt that despite years of gaming (okay, decades) I've never felt the urge to strongly recommend a purchase until now
Sure, there are things I would have preferred to be more complex, spoilt by the combat systems of Dark souls and the Witcher, but what's so special about this game is the storytelling and the creative courage Ninja Theory bring
This isn't just a game
This is a sincere artwork, using game design, to tell the most compelling story about psychosis I've ever experienced
They did their homework, not just with the depiction of mental illness, but also on the wonderful Norse mythology, joyously wrestled from the bubblegum claws of Marvel studios and told with all its blood and guts and grim darkness
Senua is easily the most human heroine I've seen in any game ever, and while there have been more 'strong' female characters, there's no heroism like the heroism of the truly broken and crippled
She has to fight her demons, and it's all the more meaningful because unlike fem-Shepard who eats Reapers for breakfast, you can see in the gorgeously motion captured performance of Senua's face, that she is truly terrified as she fights
This game is short
This game probably has awful replay value
All the same, this game is a MUST play

 Do not play without HEADPHONES
AT
ALL
 EDIT: The real fun for me was actually sometimes ending up looking back hearing a "Watch out" over the headphones
You may have an awesome sound system (I dont) but still, the experience changes a lot over headphones
FYI - There is a lot of walking and finding symbols, easy puzzle solving with an easy to master combat
If that isnt your type of game,you probably wont like this
If you seek Environment, Immersion, Good story - Welcome home my friend
You & me both found what we were looking for
First thing first, running solid 60fps at 1920x1080p res on a Ryzen 1600 & RX-580
No stutter, no lag
Very high preset
Two bugs encountered in entire game
The graphics were bleak
Very bleak
The first 15minutes sets up the tone of the game
The much talked about binaural voices and the initial psychosis plays out right in front of you
And the voices get creepy over time
EDIT: Really really creepy as the game progresses
The concept of Rot is also nice
Cool exposition on Norse mythology along the way
Combat isnt too tough to master
(Just would have preferred a different button to Parry / Block attack tbh, changed it anyways)Also, Melina Juergen's performance as Senua
TOP NOTCH
The motion capture shines in later stages as you can actually feel the angst of Senua
Oh and there is a cool photo mode in the game
Story : This is a clear and simple Love story between Senua & Dillion
The way the story is presented through flashbacks and voice overs, gives it that much a tragic touch
The demons Senua fights, both in the  World & in her Head  is what makes this conflict that much interesting
Sometimes it blurs the line (e
g in one instance Senua refers a monster to her father)
And that ending  is something I am not going to spoil here, because it was confusing in a lot of ways
Too CONFUSING!! You fell for it, didnt ya? XD The Mental Disorder part has been presented in a way that it literally made my jaws drop
Flashing colors , Blackness, Hallucinations, Voices  actually ends up being disorienting in game
This is probably one the best "Campaign" mode games released this year so far (for PC)
Hats off to Ninja Theory
I wouldnt have mind paying the AAA prices for this game

												How best to enjoy Hellblade1
Stop Reading reviews on this game
2
Get a set of good headphones set up
3
Don't read any guides4
Go nuts
But if you INSIST on reading a review I will try very hard to relay some fine points of the game in order to help you decide if you would like it without giving anything away
That by the way is a very difficult task
1
The pace is very slow, you will have long periods in between combat
2
The sound and graphics are the best I have played in years
3
The combat is completely devoid of ornementation
No skill points to earn, no weapons or inventory to upgrade/manage, no quick time events (thank god), and only one special power
Essentially it's just your skills of observation and reflexes against some tough enemies that want you dead
4
The puzzles are a large part of the game and rely on non isometric level design (think of a dumbed down antichamber)
None of that is why I consider this the best game I have played this year
It's the story, and the deep immersion in the way the devs manage to connect you with the character
It is one of those games that shows that a game can transend just being fun, and become meaningful art
If you want a great hack n slash



skip it (the combat is good, but better can be had)
If you want to enjoy masterful storytelling, this game is a must play

 A Beautiful and Innovative Masterpiece I was initially excited to play Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice because of the celtic mythology themes and settings
While it is the most involving and seriously visceral treatment of the subject that I've experienced in a game, it has turned out to be so much more
 There are those who want so much to see beyond the veil
But when they finally do, all they want is to cover their eyes and pretend that what they've seen doesn't exist
 Story The story is the fundamental feature of this game
Certainly it deals with the richly textured mythos of the ancient celts, but from the vantage of a character that may be unique in gaming
I have to say that I was, and still am, more than a little irritated by the intro screen from the devs addressing the depictions of psychosis in the game
To me, this is a spoiler
As good as the story is, it would have been so much better if they had allowed the player to gradually realize this aspect on their own, as it unfolded in the narrative
Instead, as the true nature of the character and her circumstance becomes more apparent, it has lost all its impact
We already assumed as much from that intro from the devs
And they did address the theme in full detail in the video that one could view at any time, but best viewed after completing the game
So this spoiler screen was completely unnecessary
That being said, it is still a powerful and moving story full of universal truths and existential wisdom
It is groundbreaking for its treatment of the central subject, the role it played in the character's society, and the effects of stigmatization still present today
It brings to mind the old saying, "Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad
"http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1104885933 Visuals/Sound The game is visually gorgeous
Ranging in theme from horror to fantasy, historical and surreal, it is among the very best uses of the Unreal Engine 4 that I've seen
It would have been nice to have advanced options for post-processing features so that I could turn off chromatic aberration, but it's a minor detail
With both Nvidia Ansel support and its own photo mode, the game is a screen archer's dream
Character models, animations and expressions, are digitally rendered from live-action actors, lending these aspects an ultra realistic look and feel
Also worthy of note is the excellent sound design
Ninja Theory put a lot of work and emphasis on this aspect of the game and it has certainly paid off, adding to the atmosphere of the game in a way that has to be experienced to be fully appreciated
These qualities set the production values for this game very high
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1104952378 Gameplay Another of my initial expectations about this game was that it would be an interactive movie, having learned the average play time and seen some cinematics
I was, happily, wrong
The combat is fun and fluid, with a variety of difficulty settings to suit anyone
I would liken it in style to the Batman series or Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor
While not as complex or involving as those combat styles, it has the same feel, with blocks and dodges, heavy and light attacks, and truly satisfying slow motion finishing moves
Along the way there are many puzzles that I found to be fun and innovative
I love puzzle games and have not encountered any similar
They deal mainly with pattern recognition in the environment, or in reconciling a dissonance in patterns
Having watched the video from the devs at the end of the game and learning their reasoning for this style of puzzle, I find them all the more interesting
I love that there is no hud, no user interface, no hovering directions to "Push F to interact
" This is refreshing, and rare in games
The things that can be interacted with are logical and fairly apparent with a little exploring and expirementing
It is a facet of the game that adds immensely to the realism and immersion
Detractors may accuse the game of being linear rather than open-world
But in my experience, an open-world setting doesn't always work well for some games
Here, the gameworld is a means to an end, that end being the telling of the story
So the world design and progression feels natural and right for the story
It is not entirely linear, there are many areas to explore
But in the instances where there was a clear path, I was glad for the guidance
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1105593243 Value I had thought that 29
99 US would be a hard sell for a 6 hour game
At an average of 5 dollars an hour to play, it had better be something truly extraordinary
That's exactly 5 times more than the highest I am usually willing to pay
But it took me just over 11 hours to complete, and earn all the achievements, over the course of two days
It seemed like much longer, because this game-world is dense, no filler here
And I can honestly say that if it had only taken 6 hours, it still would have been worth every penny
Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice reminds me why i play video games to begin with; to be transported to other worlds, other realities
To suspend disbelief
To live as another, if only vicariously, if only for a short time
No other medium achieves this quite as well as video games, and few games achieve it as well as this one
Bravo Ninja Theory, Bravo
All I can say is, more please

												Lines from the Creator of this masterpiece


"Mental illness has been with us as long as we have been on this earth, but why ? Why hasn't evolution stamped out this weakness from within our gene pool ? I often Pondered this question until I realized that the question had an in-built flaw
It assumes that being and thinking differently is a weakness
The only reason we have computers, spacecraft, medicine, poetry, art and yes even video-games, is because individuals were able to simulate new abstract realities in their mind and share them with the rest of us
We need people to be willing to see differently in order for us to progress as a society
And we need to be open to these new ways of seeing
And it is this spirit that motivated me to create Senua's story and share it with you
"My Review


Exceedingly atmospheric, this game runs deep in your mind, somewhat philosophical too, wisdom peers throughout the entirety of the game
A beautiful & unprecedented approach to storytelling
Sound engineering is outstanding aswell
A Must Buy & Must Experience

												Probably the most immersive game I've ever played and definitely one of the most beautiful
The audio is also on another level compared to any other game on the market
I HIGHLY recommend you play with headphones on, won't be the same experience if you don't
Combat doesn't have any real depth but it's fluid and satisfying
Story has been awesome so far and the character performances are excellent
I have enjoyed the puzzles as well
They are not too difficult but require you to think and pay attention
No game has ever sucked me in and held my attention with a vice-like grip as this game has
If you enjoy immersive, story driven games then you absolutely should not pass on this game

												Hellblade might be the most atmospheric game I’ve played in years
Ninja Theory combines Norse mythology with the beautifully developed character Senua, who is plagued by psychosis
She hears whispering voices
Lots of them
All the time
Those voices tell her what to do, or what not to do
Sometimes they reveal things from Senua’s past, tell little stories, other times they try to encourage her, or even predict her certain demise
Only one thing is certain – they won’t stop talking
Not ever
They are also the main reason why you absolutely should play the game with a headset
This is in my eyes Hellblade‘s strongest element
There is constant feel of insanity and not only because of the voices in your head
The environment often changes, based on your mental state
When Senua just can’t bear it anymore, starts screaming in agony and despair, the voices in her head get louder and the world around you transforms into an even darker, dirty looking place
These are the most intense, atmospheric moments I have seen in a video game in a long time
And you often wonder if what you see is actually happening – you are in a very dark, mythical place after all – or if it all just takes place in your mind
Here reality becomes a very questionable concept
While having incredible atmosphere, Hellblade’s combat system is pretty standard for the most part
You have light and heavy attacks, which you can use to perform combos, you can block, evade and parry (timing is important here), as well as a kick attack
The game does not tell you how to do any of these things, yet you will learn everything on your own in no time – which I find fascinating in a way
It is almost refreshing to have a game that does not flood the screen with button prompts and tutorial messages
You also have sort of a time-slowing power that charges over time
That one can be of great help in situations with multiple enemies
While the combat system might not be particularly innovative, it is very well implemented and definitely a lot of fun
In between the fights you mostly solve rune puzzles and those are probably the only thing I can truly criticise about the game
You usually have a closed gate with a rune on it, then you have to search for the image of this rune in the surrounding area
The image often consists of several objects in the environment, for instance, you have to look at a pole and part of a hut at the right angle
While I certainly enjoyed these puzzles, they were the weakest part of the game and they are the only reason Hellblade doesn’t get the highest possible score from me

												UPDATE: The bug I mentioned below has now been fixed in an update
I've also finished the game and there are no substantial issues with the game, or any real changes outside of the fact that the stealth sections have paths on the minimap showing you where to go now in order to make them easier
The game's last moments still leave a bit to be desired, but the majority of the story is good enough that I would definitely recommend this
As a word of warning, at the moment this game seems to save your game based on your steam name
What this means is that changing your name causes the game to forget where your save is, and if you have any quotation marks, question marks, or any punctuation that isn't allowed in a windows folder name, the game just freezes after you choose your language at the start
I haven't played the game past the opening yet, but I finished the original Indigo Prophecy and the original Fahrenheit release from GOG and assuming they haven't broke anything it's a great game aside from the ending so I'll leave the recommendation at a yes anyways

												At $10 regular price this isn't bad
I remember playing the demo for the game when I was younger and always being intrigued
Having played the whole thing now I can say I was a little disappointed
+ Story holds up well until the final act+ Port runs very well
Maxed out and only had a few weird FPS drops in cutscenes
+ Acting is pretty solid all around+ Gamepad support+ Uncensored version :)- QTE's in this game are ANNOYING, simon says stick moving that goes on forever or controller breaking button mashing- Like I said, the story kinda falls off towards the end- Awkward camera$10 is a fair asking price for this game, but if you're on the fence, wait for a steam sale

												Back to 2005, Indigo Prophecy (or Fahrenheit as uncensored version) developed by Quantic Dream
It's first game that introduces new combination between adventure game and interactive cutscene
The idea is to provide the movie-like experience and let audiences participate on each event rather than watch the whole scene
The story introduces supernatural drama thriller where all the things begin in one of New York's Diner as very strong intro
You take control the character perspectives for both murderer and investigators
Each character is intriguing and has their own personality where you learn from story and your interaction
Whats make Fahrenheit unique is storytelling and choices, most in-game interactions and dialogues have consequences in term of moral and ethics
It could impact on your character mental state or change the pace of story or both along with well-executed and connection between characters
The gameplay involves environmental and dialogue interaction that required mouse swiping as it gives strong feelings of control
Some scenes allow you to explore small section and interact at you own will or switch between characters to observe and progress the story
The game also contain heavy QTE in most physical action sequences
Require player's reflex action which might distract player from whole cinematic scenes
Remastered version offers sharpen textures, new UI, and some typographical changes which are slightly different from original
It's also uncensored version which contain some nudity contents I used to play on retailed version
On the other hand, mouse interaction are quite unnecessary in some parts
Transition between two types of QTE might get annoying and bit over usage
The story pacing also heavily change in final
It's bit letdown and less interaction compare where the first act is so interesting
Fahrenheit might have some gameplay flaws and story itself left some unexplained answers
But it first brings fully interactive movie into video games
It's classic, unique, and intriguing in direction
Set the new standard of video game as we see nowadays
Plus, I personally did love songs and ambient soundtracks			
Posted: 24 October, 2015
Short version: 64%Imagine a DVD player which is powered by you playing Guitar Hero on Expert mode with a mouse
Combine it with a terrific thriller to get Fahrenheit: a horrendous video game hiding a great cinematic experience
Long version:When it came out in 2005, Fahrenheit offered something new by focusing exclusively on the narrative and nothing else
It was a true interactive movie with cinematic techniques like split scenes displaying the same events from multiple points of view (like in the TV show ‘24’)
The plot is entirely character-driven and focuses on three main leads: Lukas, a murderer on the run; and Carla and Tyler, the two detectives on his trail
Their stories are split into more than thirty chapters on two separate threads that eventually meet in one big finale
A finale about superpowers, Mayan prophecies, an artificial intelligence, and somehow preventing the freezing of the planet with a martial arts showdown against an immortal priest
If you thought the end of Matrix: Revolutions jumped the rails, it has nothing on this game
Sadly the derailment of the plot is vastly overshadowed by gameplay issues
The controls are horrid, no matter what control scheme you choose: for example, basic actions like picking up something require at least four-five mouse or stick gestures with bad movement detection
The few puzzles make absolutely no sense, and all key scenes are progressed by playing a double quick-time event that obstructs the entire screen
By the way, on easy mode, this minigame leaves roughly a quarter of a second window for each action before failing
I have no doubts that Fahrenheit was one of the best things ever in its time, but it aged horribly
If you missed it originally, you are far better off just watching a longplay than trying to suffer through its controls

												I'm really on the fence about this one
I'm glad I played it, but at the same time I feel relieved it's over
Good stuff:- Interesting story
- The idea of controlling the characters the way you do in this game is interesting
- You get to play many different characters
- The boxing match
- It's a unique experience and you'll get to say to your friends "I played that game
And finished it"
- Nice music
- Police isn't stupid
- I want Carla's apartment
Bad stuff:- This game has the WORST camera controls I have ever seen
I watched almost half the game with the camera stuck behind a column, desk or another obstacle
Especially when you really need to see where you're going (for example the stealth missions) the camera stays at your side showing you the scenic view and won't budge
- The controls suck
They are awful and buggy
Half the times they won't register
- Even after so many years, playing the remastered version, there are so many bugs, characters circling around themselves for no reason or going through walls
- I could take the joystick pushing (even enjoyed it some times), but the left-right clicking hurt after a while
- Guys -and only guys- shower with their underpants on in this game
- Choices don't matter as much as you think throughout the game
Only a couple ones really matter
- It's weird that you can't make your character run when in a hurry
I clicked "Yes" on the recommendation, because you might end up enjoying the experience and you would miss out otherwise
But the frustration level is really high
Be warned

A cult classic with a unique approach to storytelling and a polarizing third act
2005’s “Fahrenheit” or “Indigo Prophecy” (the latter was the name given to the censored version released in the USA and other countries) was marketed as the first interactive film
At a time where few games dared to be like movies, David Cage (who was lead director and writer) aimed to bridge the gap and show that video games can also tell deep and meaningful stories
Whether Fahrenheit actually did this successfully is up for debate, but what’s known for certain is that David Cage changed the landscape of video games in a huge way
The idea that this game is indeed a movie or movie-like experience is reinforced several times
As soon as you launch the game you’re greeted with a main menu with several options
One of them happens to be “New movie”, and when you hover your cursor over the option, a billboard with the game’s title appears on your screen
When you decide to start a new game: your screen becomes permanently letterboxed (which once again gives you the impression that you are watching a movie)
This game desperately wants for you to think it’s a movie but thanks to the intuitive controls and surprising amount of gameplay, you’re greatly immersed in this adventure
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=686668516Controls are a pretty simple affair
The WASD keys move your character around whilst left-clicking and swiping your mouse is needed to interact with objects and other people
This all feels very natural and you can even just hold right-click and left-click at the same time and use your mouse to move the character instead
In-between regular cutscenes are action scenes which are essentially long QTE sequences
There is a hell of a lot of QTEs in this game, which some have likened to a game of “Simon Says”, and they can be quite annoying unless you stick with them
It’s arguably Fahrenheit’s biggest flaw and I had to warn you all in case someone comes to my house and kills me for recommending this game
There are also lots of choices to make, which directly ties in with the game's mood mechanic (certain options or a combination of them will either make your character happy or send them into a depression), but the game is ultimately a linear experience in the end and this mechanic is not as irritating as it sounds
Fahrenheit’s story on the other hand, is harder to judge fairly
Fahrenheit has arguably one of the best intros in all of video games - and there’s so much potential - but by the time you’ve reached the end of the game: the tone, pacing and story has changed so dramatically and so quickly too
This is sadly due to the fact that this game was meant to be part 1 of a trilogy, but at the last minute this plan was ditched… and the developers tried their best to conclude the game with what they had
It’s not a terrible ending, but most players will definitely be left confused after thinking that this was a crime-thriller title
I guess this is why Fahrenheit has become a cult classic
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=686638376Even as a huge fan of this game I have to admit the writing from French developers “Quantic Dream” is pretty hit and miss
One character named Tyler (who is African American) is treated in such a stereotypical fashion which undermines the serious tone of the game and David Cage’s intent to honestly tell a deep and meaningful story
Tyler has become something of a running joke in the Fahrenheit fan community but I guess it’s just another one of those things that led to this title becoming a cult classic
All of this aside, Fahrenheit’s story is still decent for me and there’s some truly epic moments sprinkled throughout
I really felt what the characters were going through at certain times (this can be attributed to some of the great tracks in this game) and most of them were relatable to me because their situations often had them doing mundane tasks
As for the remaster done by Aspyr: most of the texture work is subtle
There’s a minor facelift throughout but in some areas the original textures might be preferred
Thankfully there’s an option to change from remastered textures to original at any given time (via a single button press) which is pretty cool
The QTE buttons that appear on your screen have also been slightly changed in both appearance and size (they’re much larger now)
It's worth noting that Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy, which is the name for this remaster, is also the uncensored version of the game which very few countries ever got
Another plus in my book
The game hasn’t aged really well but apart from some minor screen tearing, which I only noticed on my last playthrough and may not have been the game's fault, it worked just fine on my PC
I wish Aspyr did get to change the models in Fahrenheit but apparently they didn’t have access to much of the original game’s art pipeline
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=594985543Obviously I’m a bit biased when it comes to Fahrenheit but I’d still recommend it to anyone who is in the least bit curious about the title
It’s a quirky, unique game and for the price of $10 you really haven’t got much to lose
I’ll give it a 7
5/10

												Do not expect drastic changes when you see "Remastered" label
Yes they have done quite a lot of works but remember this is a game from 2005 and originally released on PS2
Of course you can switch between HD and SD version by pressing F9
I got a copy of Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy (GOG version, uncut and SD only) a long time ago and I'm so happy that it's been remastered, as well as released on Steam recently
The gameplay is story-oriented
Which means, if you're into fast-paced, high speed action or even sparking RPGs, then this is not what you're looking for
The best word to describe this game is "interactive movie"
Everything you do may affect the storyline, which then leads to different endings
Even if you chose a "wrong" route, the game still refers to a conclusion (and yes you can restart from last checkpoint after all)
Pros:+ Awesome story line, with different endings based on choices made by the player
No, it's not simple to describe the whole story within some paragraphs here
+ Great voice actors
+ Well-done remastered version with controller support, Mac+PC ports
+ Uncut version (yeah, there're sex scenes in game)
+ Cheap (got this when it was 75% off on Nuuvem, about ~$1
89)
Cons:+ Annoying quick-time events
They're based on PS2 control scheme
Beware: ASWD is your left controller analog and mouse is your right controller analog, use them wisely when you're playing guitar
+ Dated graphics
+ Random crashes during gameplay
Overall rating: 8
5/10

Classic shooter nearly ten years oldIt might seem weird to dedicate a review to a game that came out on november 16th, 2004
Still, Half-Life 2 is no "ordinary" game
Even before it's release, it was the most talked about, and surely most anticipated game up till then
Back in 2004, Valve was still primarily a game-developer, Steam had only just been launched in order to streamline the updating-process for the Valve-games (quite an original and ground-breaking idea since back in those day patching one's game could easily turn into a hazardous adventure)
Immediately after its release, Half-Life 2 was loaded with critical praise, and almost instantly rose to the top of all lists defining the best games ever
And even today, after ten years, it still tops a lot of those lists
I played it for the first time only five years ago, messing around with the original Half-Life up till then
Five years ago, the game struck me as still very good-looking and a blast to play, even being five years old
Quite recently I picked it up again, to be honest in the first place to get some of the achievements I had missed during my first play-through (I only got really interested in the Steam achievements this year)
To my surprise, the game immediately got back under my skin, so I decided to give it another play-through, and I enjoyed it immensely, hence this review
Of course the Source Engine shows its age: up-close textures get quite blurry, but the wider vistas are still amazingly "alife", and the colours and general atmosphere are still exciting
The physics engine - a novelty back then - now surely feels outdated, even crappy, but playing around with the famous "gravity gun" makes more than up for this, and surely has its funny moments
But in every other respect, this game is a classic and a masterpiece in the true sense of the word
The story is so convincingly told, that I felt myself beeing "Doctor Freeman" again, already during the first chapter (which introduces the gameworld in a very ingenious way which has not been surpassed ever since)
The level-design is simply awesome
Compared to modern-day shooters, the interface and the amount of information about the surroundings you get as a player, are minimal
There is no minimap, there are no waypoints, there is no compass, there is no large-scale map
And still, I never ever got lost, thanks to the downright genial way the levels are designed
Still, the amount of freedom you get is great: there are tons of hidden places, byways, or larger spaces to explore, besides the more traditional corridors, but they always manage to lead you in a logical way
This game offers the classic examples on how levels can be optimally designed
Sound, too, is amazing: there is not much in-game music, but when it appears (mostly in the action-packed scenes), it really delivers to the full
Sounds from the guns, NPC's and ambient sounds are extremely convincing
But what still shines most of all is the actual gameplay and the way this games is "paced"
Sneaky, almost stealth-like scenes alternate with extremely violent action-moments, in a very, very clever way, only to be alternated with puzzles and other moments where thinking is required
The choice of the right gun at the right time is essential, and very rewarding
There is a lot of interaction with other characters, but never up till the point where this gets tedious
And best of all: there are countless moments of surprise, when the story takes a turn for the unexpected
So, yes, this is still a classic, and yes, it's still up there among the best games ever (although I personally would grant it a top-five place or so, the top-three spots taken by more recent "classics")
For my scorings, I give them as I conceived the game during my actual playthrough, so not taking into account it's a ten year old game
Gameplay: 27/30 (there are some frustrating puzzles and some weird moments with the gravity-gun but everything else is sheer genius)Grahics: 15/20 (the outer vistas are great, the rest is showing its age)Sound: 9/10Longelivety: 8/10 (no multiplayer, but the game has tons of singleplayer gameplay)Steam integration: 10/10 (it comes with trading cards and 33 achievements, most of which really add something to game, if only to explore different ways to achieve things - the way achievements should work imo)Technical: 9/10 (runs very smoothly and I got no crashes, but sometimes hangs for a couple of seconds on loading screens)Personal appreciation: 10/10Overall: 88/100

												This one of the best first person shooter games I've ever played, plain and simple
Half Life 2 begins 20 years after the original Half Life
As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine
You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine
Half Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it
If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now
The game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters
You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles
 Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane
For a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing
Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters
The game for the most part is pretty easy
I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire
Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult
The game took me 10 hours to finish
I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny
Apart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value
The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs
In the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game
It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer
This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life
I experienced zero problems while playing the game
I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing
This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems
Final Rating:9
5/10 -  A Must own and must playIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review

												Half-Life 2 takes a minimilist approach to story development, but delivers a rich, atmospheric, and engaging world that sucks you right in
Combined with novel gameplay elemetns (one of the first mainstream games to make proper use of physics in gameplay), an ensemble of likeable characters—topped off with the much loved Alyx Vance, and well paced combat, this helps to make Half-Life 2 an all-time classic

												Five good reasons to buy West of Loathing: 1) Sophisticated, earnest writing
The game knows when to be funny and when not to be
And while toilet-humor abounds (both literally and figuratively), the jokes are never truly idiotic, nor meanspirited
2) Freedom of choice
Do you want to solve the puzzle or bypass it entirely? Do you want to engage in every subquest or barrel through to the ending? Do you want to kill every enemy you see or attempt a pacifist run? Anything is possible, although certain choices do have meaningful consequences
Different kinds of people will enjoy the game in many different ways and on many different levels
3) Charming music, art and animation
And there's a continual stream of new stuff to see from beginning to end
4) Cheap price
There's at least $20 worth of content in here
5) Trustworthy developers
This is a small indie company with ~15 years of experience that actively engages with their playerbase
They want to generate DLC and make new games
Good sales will directly effect their ability to do so
If you, the consumer, don't actively support them, then no one else will

												There is an amount of fun and depth that the price doesn't represent
This is easily worth $20 USD or more (though $11 is so appropriate, it's not funny) I never write reviews, yet here I am

ProsIt's like a Loathing game, but as a proper game executableThe amazing stick figure art aesthetic remainsA brilliant and appropriately-themed soundtrackJam-packed with a ton of well-written humour (and a ton of puns)Lots of quests to exploreStrongly-designed RPG elementsSupport for multiple save filesConsUnless you're on Hard, combat doesn't feel difficult most of the timeFetch quests necessitate a lot of backtracking, and random encounters prolong said backtrackingThis game is a prime contender for my GOTY of 2017
Like N before it, I originally started playing The Kingdom of Loathing[www
kingdomofloathing
com], waaay back in 2006
As such, the humour and puns of KoL were an integral part of my life growing up (and also explains in part why I'm such a stickler for bad puns)
I eventually quit KoL after losing millions of meat while gambling
Kids, gambling is bad, m'kay?The announcement of West of Loathing really excited me, for multiple reasons - firstly, because it was set in the same universe as KoL; secondly, because it was a proper Steam game; thirdly, because it just looked freaking amazing
It's basically Skyrim but with a lot less real-time travelling, tons to explore, and the return of Meat as currency
There are a lot of locations, and exploring every nook and cranny of them will reveal even more secrets elsewhere
That was part of the magic of KoL, exploring and figuring out secrets and puzzles on your own
Grab a notebook - there's a ton to remember at any one time, you'll likely forget a few things here and there, such is the magnitude of the number of things you can really do
Some achievements are rewarded for finishing some of these secrets, which span basically most of the game, giving incentive to actually chase them
You likely won't get everything on your first playthrough, but the game adequately counters that with the option for multiple save files - plus you can still continue a save file even after you've hit the end on that file
And then, the writing
You're going to lose your sides over and over again
There is a ton of hilarious puns and well-written humour everywhere
One of the best bits about this game are the spittoon exploration moments where the disgusting details of your dank diving into the dark depths of the salty spittoons just for egregious equipment is deftly described in putrid prose
There's a lot of depth in combat, with a choice between 3 classes, and of 1 pardner from a total of 4 (3 have to be unlocked), each with their different traits and abilities, and a lot of skills to discover and learn, giving you freedom to spec your character
You can either casually let the game build up your character by leveling skills in a specific manner, or you can build it up yourself
You'll want this degree of freedom later on when attempting the challenge of Hard Mode in a single in-game day
Last but not least, stupid walking
Need I say more?When to buyIf I'm being honest, $11 (that's ridiculous
It's not even funny
) is a freaking huge steal for what you get
I highly recommend exploring every single nook and cranny
There's so much amazing writing everywhere, and I'm pretty sure there are some bits I've missed, despite 100%ing the game

												Hey
 Yeah, I KoL'd for a long time
 Like, a really long time
 But if you're here reading reviews then you don't give a tinker's damn about that, now, do you!?First thing to look at here is, lemme tell you what kind of people are gonna enjoy this game
 Just do some mental tick-marks in your head, then you can make the call for yourself
 That's why you read reviews, right?  This is what you want, right?  I'm not like, going insane and getting high off the smell of my own farts when I say this?  'Cause the whole point is, you don't care if *I* like the game
 You care if *you* *can* like it
So here we go
- Are you the kind of person who enjoys reading things?  I don't mean learning from reading--I mean the actual engagement with the rhetoric of the thing
 Like, you read it and you think half-seriously about why someone wrote it and what makes it all work, and you get this solid impression of who the writer is, almost like they're your imaginary friend
 In this game, the writer is sort of like your imaginary drinking buddy instead
 Good comic books and their narration boxes would be the best comparison, honestly, since most games are focused on accuracy with their text rather than entertainment
 Which is a bit silly when you think about it, because of this next point:- Would you appreciate the subtle difference between a game that doesn't take itself seriously, and a game that takes itself only as seriously as it needs to?  Now, you can enjoy being the harsh critic and tearing into all the plot holes, pointing out the weaknesses and the shortcomings and where the payoff wasn't worth the investment
 Fine
 That's just being an aware, functional human being who's not liable to getting screwed at every corner
 That's not what I'm talking about
 Can you


I dunno


just let go a little bit without feeling like you're betraying that awareness?  Can you be cool about it in *both* non-temperature senses of the word?- Do you appreciate the kind of language I'm using so far?  I'm not writing this for dummies
 You do have to have some appreciation of the English language
 Sure, I'm a bit drunk right now, but I am perfectly comfortable with talking about, for example, how this game isn't succinct and ventures into full-on loquaciousness at times, but that that serves a purpose beyond either the mechanics or the strict storyline of the game (which are both independently relevant)
 It's because the meta-story matters, too
 Well, it does if you like having fun, at least
- Did you figure out by now that maybe I drink to forget all the invasive thoughts that terrorize a fertile mind embedded in a chaotic world?  No, actually, I hope you didn't, because that would seriously justify this sort of weird and unhealthy half-acknowledged egocentrism I have going on
 That doesn't even belong in this review
 Well, maybe it does, because if you actually read further into this bullet-point anyway then it indicates an ongoing curiosity about things that don't actually matter or apply to you
 You thirst for higher knowledge
 You can't help but ponder the ineffable in search for the transcendental
 There's something out there, and you're gonna find it
 Perfect
 I like that
 That definitely applies, then, and hopefully negates my worthless moping
 Because, well, it's not just engagement with the writing but the passion for discovering GOOD writing that matters here
 And you will discover it in this game, but only if you are looking for it
- Um


do you have a weird thing about clowns?That should be good
 Go play this game, like comment subscribe hit the bell, then go get a life, you poor sumbich
 Your breath is getting in the way of my alcohol
 Get out of here

												I wanted to wait until I beat it to write a review but at 60 hours in, the game is already so good I feel compelled to
This is probably one of the best action JRPGs you will find on PC, and certainly the height of the Tales series (disclaimer: I've played a handful, but not nearly all of them)
Let's dive right into what makes Berseria great, and where it's a bit lacking:- The story is engrossing
Yes, it's JRPG, and it's Tales, so there's bound to be clichés and tropes, but Berseria strikes the perfect balance of not taking itself too seriously while presenting you with relatable characters in genuinely compelling scenarios
You can have fun, but still feel invested, and there's enough sub-plots to keep you interested in ALL of the main cast
- The combat is bleeding edge, joyous, chaotic mayhem
It's super fast paced, and between juggling enemy types to trigger status effects to fill your Soul Gauge to use Break Souls to feed your Mystic Artes (which you'll want to properly time to get grade bonuses, among other things), there is always a strategy to be refined on the battlefield if you are a grinder, min-maxer, or whatever
That isn't to say mastering the mechanics is a necessity
There are plenty of tools and difficulty settings to tweak the combat difficulty to your liking
Me? I crank that **** up to Intense ASAP and get to work melting wave after wave of demons in Dangerous Encounters (and all the better if you get a Dire Foe afterwards - seriously, these are some of the best, most heated moments of the game!)
- The cast is fantastic and the writing is strong
This is hands down the biggest strength for me
Despite being yet another title in a genre as saturated as JRPG (in a series as dense as Tales, no less), the main characters manage to have very distinct personalities and motivations, and are just the right amount of "morally grey" to be likable without being obnoxious
They start off as somewhat standoffish misfits, cooperating only to pursue their personal opportunistic goals, but over time you will see them grow together in a way that is believable
There's also something deeply satisfying about being able to play as a team of blatant criminals, as opposed to the white knights, royalty, and chosen ones we've grown so tired of
And beyond that, even the side cast of characters does a great job of complementing and bouncing off of the main cast
The villains do seem a bit one dimensional, and I fear the "big bad" twist is going to end up being predictable, but it's a small bump on an otherwise fantastic journey
Final note on this - the themes and the tones are appropriately adult
The language feels natural and there is swearing and innuendo in all the right places, never beating you over the head with it
- The pacing is good
The intro/tutorial segment is the perfect length (some Tales games have ones that drag on ENTIRELY too long, not the case here), and you will periodically unlock new mechanics to keep the gameplay fresh
You will actually acquire all the party members pretty early on in the game, although this is preferable due to how the equipment mastery system works
- Great customization options
The arte pools are huge, and the trees are fully customizable
I've used Velvet almost exclusively for the first 60 hours, but I can tell there is still plenty to unlock for her and the rest of the cast seems to have their own fun, unique playstyles as well
Because of how fast paced the combat is, I don't find myself switching primary fighters as much as previous Tales games, but Berseria actually makes it even easier by allowing you to swap mid-battle, mid-combo
Lots of fashion options, lots of equipment flavors, and a mastery system that makes it fairly compelling to keep different sets of equipment around (and tweak until your playstyle is content)
- The world map is expansive, but the areas can be a bit samey, and the puzzles are definitely nothing groundbreaking
Pretty middle of the road for JRPG, so just don't expect anything impressive there
I find myself constantly looking back to Symphonia as the holy grail of Tales world maps, as I've yet to see that one be outdone
- The voice acting is good
I've only listened to the dub, as the English VAs are more than serviceable
The main cast are all great
The NPCs are not as varied as I'd like or as I have seen in previous Tales games, but again a pretty small nitpick
Nearly all cutscenes and skits are fully voiced, though, so there is a truly dense amount of lore and worldbuilding going on, if you are into it (I am)
- The visuals are aesthetically pleasing
Watch some videos
It should be clear that Berseria is not pushing next gen graphic fidelity
Instead it goes for a colorful, eye-popping art style that does the game justice
- The music is good
The tracks set the appropriate moods, and have enough depth to be enjoyable from moment to moment, but I honestly didn't find much in the way of "holy **** I need to go download this right NOW" kind of songs
Still, I would say a bit above average in terms of video game music
In summary, this is a must-buy for Tales fans, but still a heavily encouraged purchase for JRPG fans, action RPG fans, or someone looking to try out the genre
If you haven't tried the series before, don't worry about needing to start at the beginning
You can jump right into this without any issues and you'll find yourself getting giddy with glee as you literally hack through swaths of demons like they were hot butter in no time: I guarantee it

												I think the only bad thing I can say about this game is that a lot of the environments just seem pretty bland and the dungeon layouts can be irritating at times
I also wish that it looked nicer overall
Velvet could also use some better costume options :sThat aside, the game has a wonderful story and the entire group of characters are all lovable
The combat is somewhat deep and also quite fun
You can definitely tell that a lot of care and love was put into this game
This was my first Tales of game and now I'm definitely going to be looking to play more! Easily my favorite game of all time

												Once every few years, a JRPG arrives that blends together good world-building, a story that is both fascinating and thought-provoking, challenging your own worldview, philosophy and beliefs and a combat system that, while simple at first, makes you feel like a glorious badass having fun killing hordes after hordes of enemies
This is Tales of Berseria
Review is spoiler-free, minus the intro stuff
The game puts you in the boots of Velvet - an average village girl that one day gets to see her little brother being murdered right in front of her by her own brother-in-law, she turns into a daemon and then she gets thrown in prison to feast on other daemons for 3 years
As she manages to escape with someone's help, she learns that her brother-in-law now is mankind's greatest hope against daemons, and the whole world praises him as a saviour
Filled with rage for the injustice she and her brother tasted, she embarks on a journey to kill him
Let me start off with the world-building
I was having a discussion with a few friends over how games stopped bothering with giving attention to details due to how gamers nowadays tend not to care much about information that gives you a clue on how X village works, how they survive in Y conditions etc
For that I'm glad that Berseria doesn't do that
Here, in the form of completely optional NPC's, you'll find stuff like a father looking for his lost son, a group of teenagers who become interested in music and decide to start their own band and dogs that are criticizing humanity
For that I praise the creators of the game who decided to not restrict themselves to "what information is useful" but also to "what information makes you immerse"
I found myself returning to a city wondering whether a couple of NPC's got married
I can't criticize the English voice acting because I play the game in Japanese voice acting, and there's some great quality to be found there
One of the characters in the group, for example, is the same voice actor behind Jojo's bizarre adventure part 4 antagonist, Yoshikage Kira, and he's doing a glorious job here, too
Combat system time! People will bash the game for having "button-mashing combat"
And they are right, combat is button mashy, BUT


It would be wrong to stop here
See, this is first and foremost a JRPG that has an "exploit weakness system"
Your typical dungeon/area visit will be  to first identify the enemy population's weaknesses, compile combos that hit every weakness they have then mash that button against them
For example (oversimplified), if an area has worms, knights and bats I end up identifying and crafting 3 different combos so I'll mash Y for bats, X for knights and B for worms (Xbox controller)
This is the equivalent of scrolling through menus in a turn-based JRPG to find the ice spell versus enemies that are weak to ice, the armor penetration move for armored enemies etc
Later in the game the enemy variety becomes large enough that not only you craft combos for each but you make sure you can weave them
So you'll start with X for the first move of the X-combo then Y because the second move of the Y-combo works not only for bats but for armored, etc
Then you get moves called mystic artes that make your characters go full blown crazy killing machines
All in silky smooth 60 frames per second, even for my poverty rig (there's a demo on Steam that you can check out if you're not sure about your PC's performance)
Add to that the amazing A
I
behind your teammates, which is also one of the best, if not the best in a Tales game ever and can easily play better than 70% of the players! I can even put everyone on "auto" and go to the bathroom knowing that we will almost certainly win a fight
Now for the downsides: So far, I find the game quite linear - on rails, so to speak, and the optional areas that I have unlocked so far (I haven't finished the game yet, have mercy) are simple arenas that lack in the difficulty and satisfaction department, compared to the rest of the content
I found myself visiting them once, go "is that it?" then leave in disappointment
Maybe this will change as the game goes on
I heard very good things about the post-game content
There are also the occasional sidequests and mini games that (thankfully) are so many and diverse that you can "play favorites" without losing the rewards (you win coins that let you buy stuff, but its shared across mini-games, thanks Namco)
The difficulty settings are Simple - Normal - Moderate - Hard, with Intense and Chaos being unlocked after you do something in the game
On the other hand, there's a way to make fights so hard you'll almost always get a couple of party members or everyone dead
To give you a clue, my winrate in normal fights is around 90% but for dangerous fights it's at 10%, but that's just me not accepting winning a fight with people being knocked out left and right (the game rewards you with in-game score, called Grade, if you win fights without deaths and without using items, who would say no to that?!?)
Maybe it's also me being used to JRPG's throughout the years
Someone can also play the game with the combat system in full automatic mode - AI doing everything - in case you just want to experience the story without bothering with learning how the combat works (I wouldn't do that but some people could)
NINJA EDIT: Something else that I noticed and I gotta say: Contrary to most JRPG's, on higher difficulties the enemies not only get the usual stat increases but also different attack frequency and in bosses it can be a change of movesets and spells!Overall, this isn't simply one of the top Tales games ever (and easily the best modern Tales game - RIP Zestiria) but a great JRPG
I said it on my Zestiria review and I'll say it again: "Tales of" games are the only JRPG series on Steam that combines fast-paced flashy combat system with immersive storytelling
Does it worth paying full price? For me that's a resounding yes
But I hope that my review was informative enough to draw your own decision
Meanwhile, I'll be finishing my playthrough and prepare for my next one
And if you choose to get into it, I would advise you to take it slow and savor every minute, instead of speed through it
JRPG's like this one deserve to be enjoyed like good wine or chocolate

												Do you like great story telling?Do you like JRPG's?Well, there's a reason you see "Overwhemingly positive" on the reviews

												A JRPG in which your starting party is an angry vengeful demon, a psychopath with a sword, a merciless pirate and a brainwashed child you literally kidnap and take on dangerous adventures with for endgoal to kill King Arthur because he made the world a better place and you just can't accept saving the world was worth one life
Also the battle system is majorly improved over Zestiria and Xillia/Xillia2

												So after about 70 hours i finished the story of Tales of Berseria
I did not download any item packs and played on normal difficulty
I´ll just jump right into the review
GraphicsIt fullfills its purpose
It is not espeacially good or bad
The characters are well designed and the animated scenes are beautiful
But tbh, i don´t really care about the graphic quality in this game
SoundFirst of all the soundtrack is amazing
No other than Motoi Sakuraba composed the soundtrack
It really has a big role in the atmosphere of the game
This is what i call art
Every scene is accompanied by a track, that fits perfectly
Joy, happiness or sadness, even the funny parts feel authentic
Now the dub
Everything in this game is dubbed
The dubbing actors did an amazingly good job
I have no reason to play the Newgame+ with japanese dub
The english dub is by far better than expected and i´ll stick to that
BUT this game has a bug
Many people cannot hear certain sounds when using 5
1 surround sound
In this case you also cannot hear the dub
Using the stereo mode fixes this problem, but can cause other sound issues
I recommend using a fix for that (just google it and you will find it)
GameplayThe battle system is in realtime and pretty good, but not well explained
You have to figure out some stuff on your own
Tbh, i liked figuring stuff out, but i can see people being annoyed, because certain actions/skills don´t work they way they expected it
The items and ability system is easy to understand and the game is beatable without focussing too much on optimization
If you want to master every equipment or make very effective combos in battles it becomes a little bit more complex
Outside from fights in dungeons you have to walk a bit until you unlock certain teleportation points
Outside from dungeons there is a quick travel system that is bound to a consumeable item
Since you should have absolutely no money problems, it is no problem to buy nearly endless of this stuff
At a certain point ingame i nearly stopped caring about anything that has to do with gameplay, because the story gets such a strong peak, you could have given me 2d jump´n´run gameplay and i would have enjoyed this game
AtmosphereNow some of the more important parts
The atmosphere in this game is convincing
I felt like i was part of the world ingame
This is achieved by the amazing soundtrack and also by many other little things
For example small conversations between characters (which are also dubbed) or even some background noises
The characters all have their motivations to do whatever they do and no one feels out of place
There are many scenes where i thought: "Oh god no, why did you say that?" The first time was the point where my mindset changed
These characters HAVE a personality
Each of them
And the game is not afraid of showing this
The characters develop while progressing in game
Everything happens for a reason
To fully understand what happened with some characters i had to rewatch scenes or let whatever happened rewind in my head
I paused the game many times, just being stunned, waiting for my brain to comprehend the situation
StoryWow, what can i say about the story
I don´t know, i am speechless
The story in itself is kind of sinister and gets darker, especially when you understand why certain things happend
While the game starts a bit slow it quickly gets to a point where i stopped thinking this is a game
I stopped "playing" it and started "experiencing" it
My emotional state was decided by the happenings in game
I felt joy, i laughed, i was angry, i even cried a few times
This story hits you hard with emotions
And this is coming from a guy who stopped playing story focused game long ago and thought he was more of a cold, emotionless guy
tl;dr: All i can say is i am absolutely overwhelmed by this masterpiece
Don´t get scared away if you think the beginning is slow or boring
If you are only interested a little bit in JRPGs or just want want to experience a great stroy, because most of the animes released nowadays are boring, i definetly recommend this game
I also recommend watching the trailer "The Calamity and The Blade", which is english dubbed, since steam only has the "The Flame" trailer
This is the best game i have ever played

												Pros-Fast paced intuitive combat
-Solid visuals and animations
Cutscenes are nice
Character models and expressions are great
-Interesting story theme
-A lot of content, very long game even when you're moving through it at a fast pace
-Great HUD for finding points of interest and next plot point
-Tag switch mechanic is fun
Soul Break mechanic is fun
-A good amount of side content with interesting rewards
Unlocking some costumes felt rewarding
Cons-Bloated and repetitive dungeon design as you progress in the game-Arena is beyond average-Weakness/Resistance/Stagger system is really wacky
Combos feel super RNG unless you heavily spec yourself with stats and hitstun modifiers-Lack of good ways to enjoy the combat system post game-Combat is fun, but becomes very mashy at times-decent songs in the soundtrackNeutral-Minigames range from simple and fun to grindy-Game is long and packed
-A lot of the recycling, but that's a tales standard at this point
-Difficulty is average overallNote:this may seem like a backstory for Tales Of Zesteria if you ever finish the game till the end and do every side quest to know the full content of the story
Should You get this game, only if you are Tales Fans and i certainly this game will be worth your time and money and pack full of content than the previous Tales installment beside my Favorite Tales Of Symphonia

												A game I wish I could forget entirely so I can go back and play again for the first time
The world is large, the quests are plentiful, and the story reads like a top teir play
The usual archetypes are introduced but as the game marches on they're abandoned and the depth of each character shines through
Pros:-Story-Combat (Insanity is level to shoot for, if it's too easy, you're on the wrong difficulty)-Playtime-MusicCons:-JRPG Dialogue, prepare for the grunts and cheesy emotions-Weapon system feels abritrary at times, no reason to give up certain gear for a long time			
Posted: 19 February
												Story: 9
5/10Characters: 8/10Combat: 9
5/10FPS : 60/60---------------------Overall: 9
5/10Pros:+ The story is not your average save-the-world heroic stuff, instead it's dark and twisted
+ The combat system is the best among all Tales' games and is easy to understand
+ There are strong enemies if you like a good challenge (such as "Dire" foes)
+ New Game+ is filled with interesting options, so starting another run is worth it
+ 60 FPS
+ New battle camera
+ Quick save option
Cons:- Some characters may be annoying
- Music is not as good as other Tales' games
- Dungeons look better than in Zestiria, but some require a lot of time and running around to finish
Note:You don't need to play Zestiria before this one to understand the story, but doing so will make Berseria much more enjoyable since it will show how Zestiria came to be
Alternatively, you can play Zestiria after Berseria
Whichever you choose will make you experience the story in a slightly different way

												Remember that part in Bambi?Remember that one scene in Lion King?Remember when halfway through The Fox and The Hound

?Multiply by 9000 feels, pour into a bowl of Princess MononokeAdd a dash of Spirited AwayMix until a tidal wave of feels makes you cry like a little girl And thats just the main menuNow I get teary every time I see an apple
The music in this game is phenomenal, think Trine just 10 times more beautiful with added vocals
Controls and physics feel perfect, fluid and interesting
You really do feel like a little cat spirit gliding through the forest, climbing walls and trees
Visually the game is beyond stunning, hands down the prettiest game I've ever seen
Storytelling is amazingly done through game mechanics and not just "passive" cutscenes
Next time someone tells you video games is not art, show them Ori

Truly one of the most gorgeous games ever
DISCLAIMER:- I bought this game on a whim after seeing it in the Steam Store for the first time
I watched the promotional videos and was immediately interested in it
- I love this game, therefore this review is biased
I am not some professional games journalist who makes a living off of reviewing games and tries to provide an objective and totally unbiased point of view on the subject material
If you were expecting such a review from the average Steam user, then your standards might be a bit high
No offense, high standards aren't really a bad thing
My intention with this review is to convince others who might be interested in the game to take the leap and drop $20 on it
That's all
- At the time of this review, I only had about two hours of playtime invested
Overall the game isn't terribly complex, and the gameplay is what you'd expect from the average Metroidvania title (with more focus on platforming than combat)
It's polished, the art is beautiful, and the story is engaging while not getting in the way of playing the game
After two hours, I felt that I could wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who might show interest in it
REVIEW:If I had to briefly describe the game, I would say it's a very artistically-driven 2D platformer with common elements from both the Metroid and Castlevania series
But that merely scratches the surface
I won't go in to excruciating detail regarding the gameplay
It's a branching world with areas you can't access without certain abilities
You progress naturally until you unlock a new ability, then more options open up and you can progressively explore more freely
Naturally, the world is littered with hidden goodies like health and energy powerups (like energy tanks and missiles from Metroid)
Platforming does become rather challenging, and the fact that the movement is very responsive and feels polished makes platforming a blast despite the difficulty
However, a certain ability you are given right from the start can detract from the challenge by essentially removing the consequences of dying
Combat is pretty simplistic (you basically just spam the attack button and it auto-locks to the nearest target), but it is clearly not the focal point of the gameplay
The majority of the abilities you unlock cater towards more efficient and complex platforming maneuvers
There is a simple experience system which rewards you with skill points that allow you to unlock an assortment of abilities that are split off in to three different skill trees
These abilities are either unique passives, or augment the main abilities that you acquire through progression in the game
As far as visuals go, this game is in my humble opinion at the very apex of gorgeous
The art style is surreal and brimming with color and personality
I'm not exaggerating when I say you could take a screenshot anywhere in the game and it would make for a great picture
There are certain areas in the game where you just have to stop and marvel at how downright beautiful the art is
Not many games these days are capable of that (the last one that comes to mind is probably The Vanishing of Ethan Carter)
People might say that gameplay is all that matters, but this game is a prime example of why that's simply just not true anymore
I believe that in regards to modern games, visuals will always play an important role in making the game what it is
Games are a from of art now, not just pure entertainment
Anyone who plays this game and says otherwise is probably insane
The musical score is just as good as the visuals
There's heavy use of woodwind instruments and a touch of harmonic female vocals that really set the mood
There are overaching themes throughout the score that gives the whole soundtrack real cohesion
The best part is that the music doesn't overplay itself during cutscenes to create a sappy, melodramatic mood
During general gameplay, the music is calmer and more relaxed
In turn, it helps to keep the player feeling the same even during the tougher platforming areas
The story, while somewhat simple in nature, does a great job of presenting the game's gorgeous world and giving you a solid sense of pace
It's not a really big RPG story with tons of lore or anything, but you can still easily be enveloped by its provocative and charming nature
The game can even be surprisingly emotional and deep when you least expect it
Think of the art as a painting and the story as a frame
The frame may be simplistic, but it just goes great with the painting
Moon Studios have made a strong debut with this game, and I can't wait to see what else they have in store for us in the future
If you have the money to spare, I highly recommend you pick this up; or wait until the next big sales event and maybe you will find it for cheap
Either way, it's worth every penny

												Everyone should play this game
I've never written a review of a Steam game, so take the existence of this one as a testament to the impact it had on me
The gameplay is fantastic, sort of like Metroid, sort of like Donkey Kong, sort of like so many other classics
And yet Ori stands on its own
Ori is intuitive; it's inventive; it's surprisingly challenging (I died over 200 times in the 10 hours it took me to complete it
) But damn, is it fun
Everything is seamless
And I mean everything
From the minimalist interface, to the controls, to the microsecond load time between dying and respawning - the latter of which you, like me, will come to know well
And equally well the fact that you can save, more or less, wherever you want
Power ups and ability trees keep things fresh, and like a good piece of Zelda equipment, every addition to your platforming repertoire opens up a whole new mechanic to the gameplay
The story is as flawless as the game
(And the opening is as memorable as the ending
Have ready a bucket for your tears
)Few action platformers have a decent story to accompany it
Ori is different
No, the game doesn’t play itself; it isn’t one of those
Rather, like a player to respawn points (see: this game), gameplay and narrative are intimately connected; character actions are justified, and power ups serve the story and the player
The result is that each accomplishment you make is both rewarding and intensely satisfying
I testify to what others have said: the game looks beautiful, sounds beautiful, plays beautifully
Everything about it is stunning
But don't be fooled: it's beautiful *and* hard
If you aren't a skilled platformer now, play Ori and the Blind Forest
You will be
10/10			
Posted: 13 March, 2015
												This game


it's damn near perfect
The art direction and animation are really tight and well executed, the controls are something to be envied and are incredibly well done, the music is captivating and remains in my head well after I've put the controller down


I am completely and utterly head over heels for this game
I look forward to exploring more in this game
The sense of accomplishment you feel from gaining a new ability to reach a part of the map that was previously unavailable is particularly satisfying
I wish I had more time for this amazing experience
I can't recommend this game enough
Anyone considering this game, don't consider
Just buy
Install
Play
You won't be sorry

												TL;DR --> vmdflgnsdjgnvk lkdfj gvbjk 11/10---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------From time to time a game appears that gives a lesson to every developer and company about how to make games properly
Well, Ori is one of those games
Even though perfection will never exist in videogames IMO, I find it really hard to search for cons into this game
Just notice that I was very hyped about Hotline Miami 2 for almost a year and I honestly admit that this hype banished once I purchased Ori
Ori and the Blind Forest brings something new, something fresh, something NEEDED
I can't imagine the amount of work required to build a game like this but trust me people, devs can be hugely proud of it
Visuals are the closest to perfection I've ever seen in a videogame
Just see it for yourselves and get stunned about what a 2D platformer can give you
Seriously, you don't need to go to an art museum anymore
This game is well enough
From beginning to end it'll be impossible for you not to stare at every single detail, every singe hand-made background
The tag "Great Soundtrack" is not one of the most voted without a reason
Such a great visuals strongly need a great soundtrack too, and that's what you'll find
Tracks add so much feeling and emotion into this game that together with the visuals it becomes one of the greatest combinations of the WHOLE industry
Controls are tight and super fair
Mind this words: the game is challenging and every single death will be of your fault
This is the regular metroidvania where you get more movement skills as soon as you progress into the story
I found quite some similarities to the experience I got with Guacamelee (in terms of gameplay)
The story


OMG
Just when I thought I saw everything a 2D platformer could give (mostly soft and simple plots), this game appears
20 minutes were enough for me to start clapping in front of the screen
This game has one of the strongest prologues I've ever played
AND IT'S IN 2D
SO MANY LIMITATIONS, YET SUCH AN INCREDIBLE EXECUTION
The length is also good enough
Not too long, but not too short either
Map is extremely well planned, together with collectibles and secrets
Getting everything can perfectly give you 8-10h, which is more than the average platformer can offer
Finally, achievements are very well written too
This sounds stupid but it's sad to see some nice games where the achievements are completely senseless or wrongly directed
This game has every kind of achievement I like: storyline achievements, collectible achievements, movement achievements, and hardcore achievements
I think that the only con I can find to this game is that sometimes there are so many glowing things together that you can't really distinguish the friendly ones against the enemy bullets
But this mainly applies to one particular enemy and I'm partially colorblind so I can't say it's a con at all
Overall, just stop buying mediocre bundles nor triple A games
Do yourself a favor and pay 20€ for this game
We're in front of one of the best games of the year, and we're still on March
But seriously, this game is something I've never seen before (and I've played more games than I can count) and probably no one will dislike this game (aside from fake haters and people pretending to be funny)
Final Mark: 9
75/10 this is one of the best 2D platformers you'll play in a very long time

												So I was skeptical about this game but I kept hearing good things so I picked it up one steam sale and forgot about it
A year and a half later I see it in my unplayed favorties list and decide what the hey lets give it a shot
OMG from the intro I was hooked it really punches you right in the feels im a grown man and I had tears in my eyes during several parts of this game
The Visuals are amazing
The Game play is fun but can be old NES hudsons adventure island dont mess up once difficulty but remained fun and a challange
Those escape sequiences good lord I was on edge and of course yelled at the monitor a few times



ok more the a few times
The soundtrack well it was so good I bought it which is rare
If this is any indication I have never seriously NEVER reviewed a game before on steam and I felt compelled to write up on this one
Truely one of the best games I have played in years

												I very, very rarely review games, so I'm doing this out of sheer respect and thankfulness for the developer, Moon Studios
Ori is easily  one of the best games  I have bought on a whim (in 8 years of Steam), and had I had any idea of that


well, it wouldn't have been on a whim
The art is probably what stands out the most, but that's only because the controls are so well implemented, they never really took me out of this immersive - and touching - story
Not for a second, honestly
It was sufficiently challenging for me as a seasoned gamer, but I'm more than sure it shouldn't be frustrating for any casual gamer who doesn't possess a really, really short temper
In fact, I cannot think of another game that made me care so little about dying and having to repeat the same difficult scenes
To the opposite: I was so excited by them (in no small part thanks to the amazing soundtrack and artwork that surely accompanied), that I sometimes died on purpose at the end of a tough part to try to play it again more perfectly
I feel like this is a really big deal and I hope you believe me
I can honestly think of only one con: you cannot (as of yet at least) continue playing your save after you finish the game
I wish I had known this before, because I truly wanted to go back and finish it 100% - something I'm not at all used to - but I'm sure I'll play through it again
By the way, I makes me happy that the Ori has TEN different slots for you and your family/friends to start a game on
I don't understand why so many games lack that
In short, I HIGHLY recommend playing Ori, and I can see no contraindications to warn buyers of
Gameplay, art and soundtrack are truly remarkable, and the story is surprising and nothing short of beautiful
This is a game that stands out, and one to remember for a long, long time
Thank you and congratulations to the developers for making such a brilliant game, and selling it for such fair price
Things Ori reminded me of, while playing: Studio Ghibli, Rayman, Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons, Guacamelee, Disney, The Lion King


I'll finish by quoting another reviewer: "Oh how I wish there were more games like this one, especially when they come out of nowhere like this one did
" One of the best things I've played

												I have been waiting for this game since E3 2014 and boy does it deliver
Absolutely breathtaking visuals, wonderful ambient soundtrack, and an emotional story that brought me to tears less than 5 minutes into the game
It's also a pretty challenging platformer with some light RPG elements, so there's plenty to like about it
Do yourself a favor and buy this game
You won't regret it

												I'm playing Tomb Raider 2013 since 2014 and I like this game, specially the multiplayer mode
Bu there is some bad points, they didn't put any anti-cheat, this game is full of cheater, it makes players bored about that and day after day the game dies
Good campaign mode, the story is very nice
Good graphisms for a 2013 game

and I beat it the day I got it
This is probably one of the best games i've ever played, and i've beat a good few

It took about 8 hours to beat, so it was an alright length

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Tomb Raider Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Action; Adventure; Atmospheric; Third-Person; Gorgeous Graphics; Story Rich; Cinematic My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 12-18 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseursREVIEWTomb Raider (2013) is absolutely one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played
 The single player campaign mixes in a myriad of well-crafted elements to create what I personally would define as a 10/10 gaming experience
 There is also a multiplayer mode, which actually has the potential to be fun; unfortunately it has nearly no community, and many of those who do play: cheat (driving away potential new players)
 Nevertheless, the game is a total gem for its single player campaign alone
 I would recommend this to anyone who likes playing great single-player video games, regardless of their usual preference in genres
The graphics and animations are absolutely stunning, and the soundscape is enthralling and AAA quality
 This is the kind of game that makes it worth having an expensive/powerful GPU
 Drawing from the gorgeous graphics and animations, the game is a heavily cinematographic experience
 This takes the form of both longer, elaborate cutscenes; as well as short, little camera cuts that are integrated right into the gameplay as you explore
 This is all reinforced by an interesting narrative that is well told, with excellent voice acting to back it up
 It is the kind of game that definitely feels like an interactive movie
The gameplay mechanics and the gameplay itself are also a delicious blend of tasty ingredients
 There are many interesting and atmospheric areas to explore throughout the game, with various collectibles to find (many of which elaborate on background stories)
 There are “puzzles” to solve (a la classic Tomb Raider games) and there are secrets to discover
 Besides exploring, the combat/action sequences are also quite fun
 Headshots, finishers, explosive barrels—all the necessities are there
 And as the game progresses you get new weapons and weapon upgrades as well, which spice up the combat scenarios
 There are also high adrenaline “escape” scenes, where you are trying to escape a collapsing bridge, or burning building
 Mixed into all of this, and again drawing on the cinematographic experience, there is also just the right amount of quick-time-events littered throughout the game
The game runs on a checkpoint system
 I will always prefer manual saving/quick saving in PC games, but the checkpoint system in this is pretty flawless
 Collectibles save instantly, so if you die you don’t have to recollect them
 Also the checkpoints are extremely common; so if you are learning how to win a fight, you basically always restart right at the part you messed up
 There is also a decent fast-travel network, so you can return to gather collectibles at any time (including after beating the campaign)
Lastly, as I alluded to, there is also a multiplayer mode separate from the campaign
 I have played it a bit and can honestly say it has the potential to be pretty fun
 Unfortunately barely anyone plays it
 Although, like most games, it isn’t completely dead; you will be able to find some people on here-and-there
 There is a high percentage of cheaters, though— which is also common for low-population multiplayer games
 In short, I wouldn’t count on the multiplayer mode adding any value to your overall experience of this game
So, in summary,  Tomb Raider (2013) is an outstanding game, with several great features contributing to the experience
 It is an amazing blend of adventure and action with a strong narrative and beautiful aesthetics— a truly “top-shelf” game
 I recommend it to all gamers who enjoy great single-player experiences
  Even if this style of game isn’t usually in your wheelhouse, this is the kind of game that creates new fans of the genre

Posted: 18 June
 Overview This is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game
For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline
This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do
And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet
Story The storyline is definitely a strong point of this game
Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it
You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past
However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game)
The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story
There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom
Level Design/Graphics Speaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game
One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience
Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive
And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good
The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable
I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience
Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point
Gameplay Last, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience)
The gameplay was fluid and interseting
You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series
This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either
Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die)
However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this
Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm
Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend)
There are so many ways to make your way through the levels
And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder
The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic
However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments
Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death)
But other than that I don't really have any complaints
Conclusion Should you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience

												As my first entry into the Tomb Raider franchise, I found this reboot a very well-crafted game
 It was very apparent to me that a lot of time and care was put into the making of this excellent game
The visual effects were stunning
 Cutscenes were directed very well and provided for a lot of great screen shot moments
 Character animations were realistic and played smoothly
The writing was done pretty well for an Origin story
 The plot mostly takes a survivor story spin with a small amount of adventure thrown in
 The story is linear, though once you get access to fast travel, you can go back and get collectibles you may have missed earlier
 The game took me roughly 20 hours to complete on normal difficulty settings
 Voice acting was also very good
 I really enjoyed seeing Lara starting out so green and inexperienced and then grow into the seasoned adventurer that she eventually becomes
 The game is very tough on the young Lara and I could not help but feel bad for the character as she gets battered and bruised repeatedly throughout the story
Combat takes a cover shooter approach
 The game does provide some small amount of stealth activities to take out enemies silently but few options exist to stealth past encounters entirely
 There is a simple progression system that allows Lara to aquire skills that improves combat and survival
 There is also a system that allows upgrading and improvements to weapons that Lara acquires throughout the game
 I found the progression to be extremely well-paced throughout the linear plotline, much like the Arkham series of games
 In addition to the shooting, there were a good number of well-placed QTE activities that mixed things up a little
 The maps were very nicely done and made full use of all dimensions to provide for lots of platforming opportunities
 The game auto-saved progress regularly and had very generous checkpointing so that you will not have to redo much at all after a death
I only had a couple of issues with the game overall


There were a few crashes as I played through the game
 Especially if I ALT-TAB frequently
 My system is well above the recommended specs but found that reducing settings helped a little with the sudden crashes
 The game still ran very smooth when my settings were maxed-out but those occasional crashes did get annoying
For an action/adventure type game, it was a bit heavy on the action and a little light on the adventure
 Not quite what I would normally expect from a genre that is heavily inspired by Indiana Jones
 Shooters are one of my favorite types of games but this one felt a little too "shooty" for my tastes
 I was not keeping a tally, but Lara would have claimed a body count the size of a small army by the time I completed the game
 Boss encounters were also very lacking
 I would have liked to have seen more tombs that had something to do other than simple physics-based puzzles to complete and ways to complete more sections of the game through stealthy non-lethal means
One other minor complaint are the death animations
 I already had a hard time seeing Lara put through some of the tortures of this adventure, but a few of the death animations were a little over-the-top
 Not sure if getting impaled through the face was really necessary after failing an action event
Overall I was very surprised and pleased by this game
 I am hoping that we will see further adventures for this rebooted series with the same attention to quality

												While I've seen many people who disagree, I think this game is magnificent
 The story, the characters, the gameplay, it all goes together very well
 While I have not played any of the older Tomb Raider games for any extended period of time, I can tell that one difference is that in this, Lara seems more human insofar as she actually has emotions
 There are tons and tons of games where the character you play as just seems to lack emotions in many cases, most often combat situations
 They just go and kill the enemies like it's an everyday thing for everyone
 I've seen people say things along the lines of Lara being 'whiney', but I disagree
 She was just a regular person, and never went through anything outstandingly terrible at the beginning of this game
 What would you do if you were thrown into this situation?  You would probably freak out, and she did, making her character be realistic
 My one complaint is that sometimes it seems like half of her dialogue is some kind of grunt or scream
 Yes, again it is kind of realistic because you and I would likely be grunting and screaming as much as we are talking, but still
 Some of it seems much more high pitched and girly than necessary
I've seen people say that Lara takes too much punishment to be able to walk and run around
 Yes, this is true, but think of it this way
 She is in a survival situation, the adrenaline would help keep her going
 Besides, what fun would a game like this be if it were 100% realistic?  You get shot once and you're dead?  Boring and frustrating
 She got impaled through the abdomen at the beginning, you want her limping around slowly through the whole game?  Again, boring and frustrating
 Although it can be said that they could have skipped the injury entirely, it actually does contribute towards the game, showing that she initially does have at least an above average pain tolerance, still being able to climb around when necessary while still showing obvious signs of more than just a little bit of pain from the injury
Now, the story?  Well, it's hard to go into detail of why I like it so much, so I'll put it simply
 I've played through the whole game twice the first three days I had it, and now I'm going in for a 3rd time just because I love it so much
 Enough said?Also, graphics?  There's a graphics option just for the quality of Lara's hair
  I think that speaks for itself
 It also absolutely KILLS my framerate when I turn it on, too
 My PC is decently powered too, frames are really smooth otherwise

												"But I watched the anime, I don't need to play this, right?"Let-Let me stop you right there
The anime is trash*, plain and simple, but this


this is another matter entirely
Danganronpa answers the age old question of "What happens if you let a mechanical bear with a despair fetish capture a bunch of highschool students with extreme proficiency in one field and force them to kill each other?"The answer, of course, is one of the most incredible visual novel experiences I've ever had
Danganronpa takes everything up to 11, shows you what it would look like if you went to 12, and then skips straight to 15
Everything about it is enthralling and horrifying all at once
I lost a lot of sleep thinking about this game
Do yourself a favor and just sit down and play it straight through
Don't read anything else about it
Don't risk ruining the experience for yourself, because hot damn is it an experience
Everything after like the first 30 minutes is a game changing spoiler
I can come up with about 11037 more reasons why this game is great, but I'll spare you my ramblings
Just


just play it
*This is called comedic hyperbole
Please read my edits
EDIT 1: In response to some of the comments on this review, let me expand my discussion on the anime a bit
The anime is a direct adaption of only the most essential elements of the plot of the original PSP game
The result is next to nothing as far as character development, and the suspense and thrill of solving the crimes is completely eliminated by the investigation/courtroom montages that sort of just


exposit, with little of interest otherwise
I have absolutely nothing against the adaption as its own work or even against anime in general
It's just that when compared to the extremely detailed characterization every single character gets in the game and the satisfaction of actually having to solve all the crimes yourself, the anime falls flat
In short, the anime is definitely not a substitute for actually playing the game
I hope this helps!EDIT 2: Well


yes, if you've watched the anime you'll have the plot spoiled for you
However, like I said, you still only know the gist of how each crime happened
You still have to actually do all the legwork to prove it, which is still a lot of fun in and of itself
At least I think so
Plus, there character events and bonus scenes that can't be seen by just watching the anime
So if you have any attatchment to the characters, then yes, I do think there is value in playing the game
If you just wanted the plot, well


you got it

												SPOILER FREE REVIEW -- [I have beaten this on Vita]Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a deceptive, mystery-driven variety adventure title with visual novel, horror and romance elements
Sounds like a mouthful? But this game manages to split these elements proportionally to make them enjoyable and add fuel to the evolving, amazing, storyline that will haunt you for years to come
Originally a PSP title, with multiple ports for years to come, the PC version is more akin to a straight-up port than a HD remake
Which is fine, and understandable, because it isn't the games' aesthetics which make it one of the best adventure games I've ever played; but its story, characters and setting
Again, spoiler-free, but you play as Makoto Naegi, an average high school boy finding himself trapped in a mysterious building one day with other students; aptly nicknamed given their personality and fashion
Not long in, there's been a murder and you are put in charge with finding out who murdered said person, by learning about the other characters, finding clues and going into a trial with them ala Ace Attorney
Speaking of - I feel Danganronpa is a strong franchise which can be compared to the Ace Attorney series as there are identical gameplay elements and quirky design choices
Moving on though, general gameplay consists of room-to-room movement, talking to characters in visual novel-esque, with their beautifully drawn portraits to keep you distracted from the text
During the trials, there are well-placed, reasonable and sensical QTEs that tie-in with how both the story and gameplay present themselves up until that point
Your quick fingers, your own intuition and feelings for the characters will make you feel confident, or weasel out of wanting to press those button propmpts
Anyway, for me personally, one of the best portions of the game is its atmosphere: its forboding, compelling, repressive and tense building was mostly on my part because of the direction the game goes
It


isn't your typical raincoat detective story, there's nicely used humour, a strange but loveable villain which is introduced early, whacky, bizarre, creative yet at the same time, reverse-stereotypical characters
But what did it for me


was the way the game progresses, what happens when each new day passes


what your consequence is for not finding the murderer quick enough
All the dread, mystery and tension is added as layers of fear, heh
At one point, I felt legitamately frightened to continue, but I did anyway knowing what would happen next was going to blow my mind
I can't say enough good things about this game, BUY IT
BUY IT NOW
It will be one of the best adventure games you'll play, there is something for everybody in this game, big and small
This game is a masterpiece

												On the surface, this game is just a big bunch of stereotypes put together
However, this turns out to be one of its biggest strengths
The game strikes a good balance between rolling with the tropes and subverting them, constantly leading you into an 'obvious' conclusion and then pulling the rug from underneath you
Then, as soon as you start accounting for this, the game once again switches gears to keep you guessing
I encountered quite a few unexpected plot twists during my first playthrough of the PSP fan translation a few years back, which was a pleasant surprise given the predictable nature of most video game stories
While the story is still pretty fun even if you do know what's going to happen, if you are currently unspoiled, I suggest you try and keep it that way
Stay away from forums, don't look online for fan art and for God's sake do not listen to the soundtrack until you finish the game (I managed to spoil myself by reading the tracklist during my first playthrough)
In terms of replayability, I consider the game to be worth at least two playthroughs: there is a lot of clever foreshadowing that you will simply not get on your first playthrough hidden throughout the game and focussing your gift-giving and free time activities on different characters will reward you with additional backstory for them
As such, I'd say the current asking price is very fair, even for a six-year old port
Aside from buying the game based on its merits, if you are at all interested in seeing similar games get ported from Sony's ill-fated handhelds to Steam, buying Dangan Ronpa is a good signal to companies like Spike Chunsoft that there is, in fact, a market for them
It's unfortunate for Sony, but thanks to Spike Chunsoft, I won't have to consider buying a Vita (TV) anymore to play the second installment of this series and I sincerly hope that other hidden gems will eventually make their way to Steam as well

												Think of Ace Attorney, but full of fast paced and action oriented arguments
As a person that finished it on the PSP (through unconventional methods) I am very satisfied that it's on steam so I don't have to feel guilty!Also it's another game that is full of spoilers, so Googling is very, very risky
Wanna search up your favorite character but without spoilers? Good luck
Searching up fanart? Goodbye

												I need Cold Steel II right now!			
Posted: 5 August
 In the early hours of Cold Steel, I was worried


worried that it couldn't live up to the lovely standards set by Trails in the Sky
However, after my first year spent as a student of Class VII, I can confidently say that it has, and knowing that this is just the beginning of a new series fills me with great anticipation
If you've played Trails in the Sky FC, SC and TC you'll know what to expect
A great story, compared with wonderful Soundtrack, depth when it comes to characters and a wonderful Gameplay mechanic
Cold Steel is a game in its own, you dont have to play FC, SC and TC to understand the story
However if you HAVE played those Games, you'll get a better view at some point in the Story
My Specs:i7 7700k @ 4
2ghzGTX 1070 EVGA SC @ 8GB VRAM16GB DDR4 RAMI play on highest available Settings possible and on 1920x1080p and FPS unlocked to "Limitless"
I get 144 FPS constantly without any drops so far and it feels really good on my 144 Hertz Monitor
Performance-wise this is a Gamers Dream
I'm crying just because I'm able to play this on my PC without having to buy a "Console" for it
The Game has so much to offer and if you really wanna play this Game - take some time
You have to invest around 60 Hours (Depends on your playstyle) to finish the Game
*RECOMMENDED*

												I've never posted a game review in my entire life, however, this game made me feel things I haven't felt from a RPG in a very long time
Not since FF7 have I felt a twist in a story this hard
 I'd like to think that I am pretty savy when it comes to RPGs especially JRPGs, but, I geniunely felt surprised if not totally shcoked by what this game has presented me with
 I talked to every character I could (after I got the hang of the social aspect of the game) and not only did the dialogue keep me interested, it made the game so much richer because of it
 *Gives developers and designers a standing ovation with tears in his eyes* BRAVO I SAY, BRAVO!

												How can one game have so many best girls			
Posted: 7 September
												This game singlehandedly sets the standard for all future Japanese PC ports
By recruiting optimization modder Durante to actually provide optimizations and post launch support, Xseed has proven that PC porting isn't as expensive or difficult as major publishers like Square Enix pretends it is
On top of optimizations are PC exclusive features like Turbo Mode, an FOV slider, and autosaves
Xseed and Falcom are proving to be the CD Projekt RED of JRPGs, and their games happen to be of that quality as well
As with every Trails game, this game is just as phenominal as the Trails in the Sky trilogy was
It's one of the only JRPGs I could ever immediately start a NG+ on minutes after the credits roll
The characters are well written and fleshed out, the world is meticulously handcrafted to be unique and interesting, and the major story beats sets up the incredible sequel very well
This is an excellent game to get into the Trails franchise
It was designed with newcomers in mind, yet still retains everything veterans love about the franchise
The amount of quality hours you can put into this game makes the full asking price worth it, and all purchases of this game is directly making a statement about what PC JRPG players want out of their ports
			
Posted: 2 August
												I put many many hours into the PS VITA version of Trails of Cold Steel by XSeed when it originally came out in the UK last year
As a fellow player of the previous two Trails in the Sky games, prior knowledge is not nessicary in order to start this game
Those who have played the previous iterations will find a deeper meaning and some fun references through characters and mentions however, but nothing that will take awaty the experience for a newcomer
This game, while an engine at fault, suffered frame issues on the VITA so being able to play this in a better quality, not only 60 FPS appeased me to get it once again
Falcom themselves, the original developers of the game have something unique in the craft of their games in this series, as once finished, you'll be yearning for more
That being said, first installments to a new adventure are usually slower than most
However, unlike sky, Cold Steel has an argueably more hooking beginning
The battle system is one of the most refined in the Trails series yet
We lose some features like Rush, but we also gain a different way to do battle in the way of Master Quartz, to furter augment the skillsets and stats of your characters and the ability to swap them lets you build your characters in interesting ways
Overall, a highly recommended title
Please tell your friends so we might get Cold Steel 2 next
10/10			
Posted: 20 August
												Trails of Cold Steel is part of the Trails/Kiseki series, of which there is also Trails in the Sky on Steam
Cold Steel is set on the same continent and 1½ years after the events of Trails in the Sky, but in a different country and with a new main cast
Having played Trails in the Sky is not necessary (but highly recommended, they are awesome games after all!), it's fine starting with this one
Port: Ported by Durante (you might know him as the one responsible for DSFix if you played Dark Souls) the game runs on a toaster and offers a wealth of graphical options
There is also a Turbo Mode, which allows you to speed up the game with the press of a button
So, what about the game itself?- GREAT story and writing
It starts slow and steady as you get to know the world and its inhabitants and events slowly and slowly escalate and escalate until it culminates into an explosion of awesomeness that blasts your jaw to the ground while you scream internally (and externally) like a little child and then it's over and GIVE ME THAT SECOND GAME NOW
- Characters are pretty good
Not as good as the Trails in the Sky cast, but still pretty good
Some of them make a terrible first impression (looking at you Machias) but all of them get a ton of growth and character development over the course of the game
- NPCs: If you take the time and talk with them (all of them offer new unique dialog after every little story progression), you learn a lot about the world, their lives, relationships, problems,


Many of them even have  their own little story arcs going on over the course of the game and at the end I knew the students of Thors Military Academy as good as the main cast
- Combat is turn-based with a maximum of 4 active party members
It has elements of positioning and turn-order manipluation and the challenge level is pretty good
- Music: It's a Falcom game, of course it has an awesome soundtrack :P- Length: around 60-80 hours depending on how deliberate you are- Voice Acting: No Japanese voices included, but there is a mod for that if you want
The english dub however is very good and has around 5000 more voiced lines than the japanese one

Posted: 3 August
												Don't be fooled by my play time as I played this game and its sequel on ps3 and bought it again here to support this series on pc
The port is very good in terms of performance and graphical settings and launcher thanks to Durante
I have a GTX 760 and I am playing the game at maximum settings @1080p
I am getting between 50 and 60 fps unlike the 30 fps on consoles
It has a turbo mode to boot to save plenty of your valuable time in battles, saving your game and traversing the fields
The following is my review of the game proper:This game is one of the best jrpg'sI played in recent memory; it's very long though and has huge replayability factor due to its game plus mode and the need to play it more than once to get all achievements for their hunters out there
Despite the above praise, this game presents no real innovations in the jrpg genre, but it excels at what it does
It spends so much time in world building and making you so much attached to and invested in getting to know the characters
The characters are, for the most part, unique, complex and have interesting back stories
Even the countless NPC's are unique and have their own personalities and problems
I was reminded of persona sometimes when I played it, which is a good thing, due to its social-link like mechanic with your fellow classmates and exams
The graphics are a slight letdown but this is more than compensated by its great gameplay, beautiful music, nice English dub, which isn't full but much more is English dubbed than many other Japanese games
The battle system is turn based in the tradition of classic Japanese rpgs like persona and the earlier final fantasies and utilising enemies weaknesses, delaying enemies' (particularly bosses' turns) and performing links with your party members play a crucial role in securing your victory in battles
Also, despite spending a long time grinding for levels and items in this game, I never really got bored or annoyed by the battle system, which is a huge plus in a long game in my book
Despite being long and very detailed that it makes you feel part in its universe, the game ends on a cliffhanger, which prepares you for its sequel as it is part of a trilogy
This is the definitive edition of this game due to the excellent port and its various enhancements, which made me want to replay it despite my huge backlog

												Welcome to "The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel" (ToCS)My review is based on my PS3 experiences (Cleared ToCS I and II twice), early PC insights and my personal opinion about this game
Trails of Cold Steels:-J-RPG -Turn-Based -Flexible skillsystem with a lot of strategy-Not the hardest but really pleasant difficulty [Normal]   (Go hard if you would like more of a challenge) -Story rich (Can drag on a bit at the beginning but it's getting really epic and interesting once you are hooked)-It's quite linear but you have time to discover various places and towns (You have your freedoms) -No prior knowledge needed (Trails in the Sky or the other titles - Just light references) -Great and illustre characters and character development-Motivating to deepen the bonds (Similar to Persona) -Almost every character (NPCs included) has his/her own story -A lot to do (amsuing sidequests, minigames, discovering and collecting various stuff)-Average graphics in general-A lot of love put into details, characters and environment -Graphics are still way better compared to PS3!-A lot of improvements over the PS3 version like higher resolutions, higher frame rates (60 FPS), depth of field, shadows and so forth-Really great OST which is underlining situations and the mood greatly (Still listening to them from time to time)Playtime: Between at least 80 hours and 120+ (Average for my first time was around 110 - PS3)-It's the first game of a trilogy -ToCS II will come later to PCs and ToCS III will release in Japan this year +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ It's pretty difficult to recommend this to everyone depending on what you like


and if you have some experience from games like Trails in the Sky FC/SC/TC and Persona At best I would say it's a mix of the previous Trails in the Sky and "Persona" in general -It's a mix because like in Persona you have your everyday school life and mysterious battles/characters-You are deepening your bonds with the "main characters" and getting to know their personality
This depends on the time you are giving each of them individually (Pretty similar to Persona)The rest of the game is how you know it from Trails in the Sky -A lot of text-based conversations with spoken dialogues (way above average RPGs)-A lot of details put into the story, the chraracters, background information and collectibles-A lot of different things to do (next to the main story) like fishing, playing cards, quests and so forth  The basic story (without spoilers) is best explained in the short wikipedia description I'm quoting here: "The game's plot is centered around the newly formed special class "Class VII" in Thors Military Academy, composed of both aristocrats and normal Erebonian citizens
Class VII is the only class in the entire academy that does not segregate the two different social classes
The game follows Class VII throughout their school year, mainly around the times when Class VII receive special field training that takes them all over Erebonia
Throughout their training across Erebonia, Class VII matures and casts aside their preconceptions of the two social classes and witness first hand the reality of the empire; The power struggle between the aristocracy led by the four noble houses, and the working class reformists led by Iron Blood Chancellor Osborne which threatens to lead to a civil war
" +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So who would I recommend it to?=> People who like Persona and are into spending time to develop bonds with various characters=> People who like to play turn-based games with deep strategy (You can abuse every system


)=> People who are into longer games (Average time = 90-100+ hours)=> People who are seaching for a great story where everything feels connected (Characters, Story, Backgrounds)=> People who don't dislike certain clichés +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++POSSIBLE LIGHT SPOILERS! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Some random notes at the end (Just for me or maybe you even like it => (My Personal opinion)-Rean is a great chracter for me [Realistic - Intersting - Mysterious] -Rean is human/kind and may come across as your "typical" hero [He is not - but he tries]-His schoolmates come from various societies and families-They have all their traits and quirks -They don't get along too well at the beginning and even later-Problems will arise among themselves-They are at odds with themselves-The different reasons for their behaviour/quirks are explained well and make them loveable -The battles are fun and interesting-The characters for battle are changing depending on the school trips and where you are in the story-Even if you are not leveling you don't have to fear to be underleveled and to grind endlessly because you are getting more EXP the lower your average level is compared to the current monsters you are fighting-You are even getting less EXP when you are higher compared to the average level of the monsters you are fighting -It was a pleasure catching all kinds of fish (Fishing), to play Blade (Card Game), to collect certain books and read a novel from time to time and to get to know more about the society and the world around ToCS-A lot of German words mixed into the game (I'm from Germany so it's quite funny how they use different terms)-Fun scenes: School trips, schwimming, awkward/funny situations the characters are getting into, school festival


One of the best J-RPGs in recent years! ;o)

												Let me say something before anything else



This game was honestly amazing and mind blowing
I love playing games like this and this is a great example why
The story is very deep and in a way, you really do care about it
I dont want to write a whole review about the game because you simply need to just play it
If you really want, you could refund the game and get your money back, but in my eyes, this game went above and beyond and it stays in my library so I can play it again

												This is one of those games that is filled with artistic value and an intriguing story
I found myself drawn in quite quickly and even though it was a very short game, it didnt feel that way as I progressed
I believe it was created by people who truly love storytelling and the industry arts
You move through a house full of secrets and memories while enjoying varied gameplay mechanics and pieces of the story behind the Finch family
+ Fully narrated with voice over which I love in a game like this
+ Beautiful art design
+ A story that makes you think deeply
+ I felt the value was present from start to finish
+ Game mechanics are fun and intuitive
There was no hassle or break in immersion
- A little short- A little pricey (I felt it was worth it by the end though)I would highly recommend this to my friends
Well done devs!

												It's hard to find words to describe this game
It's gobsmacking
There are very few games that make me stop just to put a hand to my mouth and ssay "Oh my God"
But this is one of them
The story was incredible, and I found myself playing it all in one sitting
It's quite short, but don't let that put you off
It's the perfect length for what it is, any longer, it would have dragged on, any shorter, it would have seem rushed
It's perfect, and I have nothing negative to say
Just play it

												What the hell is this game, you may ask?Let me try to answer this the following way
It is something special, so it deserves an unusual approach:-	First person exploration, story driven, surreal and weird… -	Brilliant alternative gameplay concept and ideas… (play an interactive comic, control several animals, etc
)-	Breathtakingly beautiful, detailed setting/graphics… (exception: the sky isn’t done well)-	Excellent music, sound, narration and story


-	Duration: 3 hours to get 100% (…couldn’t stop playing till I got 100%


)Impressions: It is so creative, intense, disturbing, touching and wonderful how you experience things in this game
You will be confronted with death, a lot
Each of the deaths are done interestingly, and often take you by surprise, and it's a game about loss, heartache, and happiness
It's a rollercoaster, but well handled
Never experienced something like this before! 10/10 (personal opinion, as this is my favorite genre)

												An interesting game- This game is like a set of stories in a main history , the main character is Edith Finch  
A girl who comes back to her old house in the state of Washington in the US  to try to research the strange histories that happened in the house to her family members 
 - As i said it  is like a set of stories because every bedroom has an interesting history that catches you   about what happened with the the owner of the bedroom as  main character of the small history  
- The gameplay is easy and simple , walk Interact with the environment  and explore 
- The graphics are really beautiful and same is  the soundtrack 
- The only bad is this game is short but it  is worth 
 - I recommend this game

Posted: 1 May
												What Remains of Edith Finch tells the story of Finch family
You play as Edith returning to her old house and finding out what exactly happened to everyone
The game tells the stories in a beautifully fantastic way and I'd say it is a piece of art
Playing this gave me quite a lot of feels, because it is sad and heartbreaking as you slowly learn more of the family
Finishing it doesn't take very long, from 2h+ depending on the player
All you mostly do is walk around and exploring objects, aka one of those "walking simulators"
Those who love story rich experiences I recommend to play this and see what remains of Edith, but for some the price might be too high considering that it's not a very long game and might not have much replay value (again depends on each player)
I think though, that it doesn't matter because WRoEF is such a good game
			
Posted: 24 May
												What Remains Of Edith Finch is a fantastic game
Yes, it's one of those walking simulators
But it is also one of those games, that will keep you thinking afterwards about what you just experienced for quite a while
It is unique, creative, beautiful
I see it easily at the very top of the genre together with games like Firewatch, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and others
At times it is sad, at others it is delightful
Often it's both at the same time
When it is at its peak, it very effectively mixes the strong, melancholic narrative with gameplay in a way, that at its core reminds me of Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons
It's these moments that are the strongest ones
It may just be a linear walking simulator, but the fact that you are in control, that you have to execute the motions of the character right before fate takes its course, shows how effective games can be be in transmitting emotions to the player
Maybe in some cases more so than movies
9/10			
Posted: 16 May
												I'm writing this in tears right now
 The entire game is a slow-motion up and down of emotions
 The writing and the narration delivery are some of the best in a game
 By the end, I was so spent, I cried, and I'm not afraid to admit that
 This is a very beautiful game
 The house is so perfect
I literally felt as if I was in a house well-lived in by many generations
 The amount of interactions with objects was perfect, and mouse motion needed to interact with and move things was intuitive
 The small details of people's lives left in a house were perfectly done
 Every story of a family member was done differently, and they immersed me in each one
 You become invested in this family's history and touching stories which bring a smile, a laugh, or a tear
 This is well worth the money
 You can't judge this one on length, rather evaluate it on content

												I enjoyed this third title quite a lot and right now it’s my favorite from the whole franchise
Maple and Cinnamon are adorable together, and it was cute to see them both pursuing their dream
The VN is cute as always and there’s a lot of adult scenes (which are censored in the Steam version, but you can buy the R18 patch at Denpasoft to unlock the “interesting” stuff lol)
9/10
Even without the patch, it was cute as f*ck, I don’t care

												Portal is a first person action game of logic and strategy developed by Valve in 2007 and released in a package called The Orange Box 
The player wakes up in a glass room , the Aperture Science development center, where he is subjected to a series of experiments until 





well I will not spoil the  game 



Each experiment is guided by Glados voice, the mainframe development center computer
Glados is one of the best virtual characters in recent years
That computer has more personality than many humans from other games
Throughout the game the player acquires a portal gun
This gun allows you to create portals, to enter and exit portals in order to go forward in the game, which requires solving logic puzzles to advance
You will  acquire a good sense of physics, position and movement
The game is a marvel of Valves creativity
Many would prefer to kill zombies in left 4 dead , but personally, I think games like Portal are those who write history
The game lasts a few hours and when it finishes,  with music and lyrics, it makes you want to stand and applaud
No other game in recent years has touched me so much when it ended
It is an ode to creativity
Its sequel , Portal 2, expands the concept of the game and makes it much longer, making it a standalone game
The Portal 2 was named Game of the Year in 2011 for various publications
The game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360 before being ported to MAC OSX
Now that I've finished the review I want my cake ! 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ESPAÑOL----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Portal es un videojuego de lógica y estrategia en primera persona desarrollado por Valve en 2007 y lanzado en un paquete llamado Orange Box
El jugador despierta en una sala de cristal, el centro de desarrollo de Aperture Science, donde es sometido a una serie de experimentos hasta que …… no les voy a arruinar el juego



En cada experimento lo va guiando una voz, que es Glados, la computadora central del centro de desarrollo
Glados es uno de los mejores personajes virtuales de los últimos años
Esta computadora tiene más personalidad que muchos humanos de otros juegos
A lo largo del juego el jugador adquiere una pistola de portales
Esta pistola de portales le permite generar portales para entrar y salir por donde le es posible e ir avanzando en el juego, que requiere resolver acertijos lógicos para seguir adelante
Para ello hay que adquirir un buen sentido de la física, la posición y el movimiento
El juego es una maravilla de la creatividad de Valve
Quizas muchos prefieran matar zombies como en el left 4 dead, pero personalmente creo que juegos como el Portal son los que escriben la historia
Finalmente al terminar en unas pocas horas, con musica y letra, dan ganas de pararse y aplaudir
Ningun juego posterior a portal me emocionó tanto
Es una oda a la creatividad
Su secuela, el Portal 2 amplía el concepto del juego y lo hace mucho más largo, convirtiéndolo en un juego independiente
El Portal 2 fue nombrado Juego del Año en 2011 por diversas publicaciones
El juego se lanzó para PC bajo Windows, PS3 y XBOX 360 para luego ser portado a MAC OSX
Ahora que terminé el review quiero mi torta!

Posted: 4 March, 2015
												I will be brief: I downloaded demo and played for 5 minutes
Then I removed it, went to the store and bought  Portal 1-2  bundle
That same f'n day - 16 of July, 2011
The consequences: 50+ hours, all challenges completed and the place earned in my digital heart for ever
The first Portal is for sure shorter, has less story and features than the sequel
Though it has something


the mistery, the charm, the feel of menace, elegant sci-fi scent and terrific GLaDOS who hasn't gone over the top yet
Valve, put your sorry Dota 2 down and please make games like this just like you don't care
			
Posted: 12 October, 2014
												Excellent, unique, creative, and amusing
It's both challenging enough puzzles to be interesting, and short enough to not be tedious
Just like this review
			
Posted: 6 November, 2015
												Portal, rather than a game, can be considered a metaphor of life
We wake up every morning with a commanding voice that, like it or not, pushes us to face trials increasingly difficult to get a prize
A voice that we find strange and that we don't know if we could trust
A voice that can come from the outside but also from our own unconscious
We never know if the final prize is real but we are armed of portals
But what are the portals if not the ability to be able to see the world from different perspectives? The portal is the human ability to abstract being able to immerse himself in aspects of the world that had been hidden by the limitations of the senses
Ok, if you're already confused, I understand
Just buy the damn game
			
Posted: 16 December, 2014
												If you're a Batman fan, this is a must-buy
If you aren't a Batman fan, this game will quickly correct that for you
			
Posted: 14 June
												Prior to this, we had very few good games based on movie/comics characters (only Chronicles of Riddick and Spudi man 1-2 from the top of my mind), so even with positive previews from press, it was really hard to believe that rather inexperience studio will give us anything decent
But oh boy they delivered
It has very good pace to it, so balanced that the game ends right at the point when you start to get bored
It has very generous difficulty progression, so if you never played any other game with this style kick+counter+dodge combat (in which, for the full credit, Batman AA was rather innovative at the time), you won't feel like the game throws at you a riddle impossible to solve
It has decent story its not as elaborate as yours masses of effects or planescapes torments, but it does the job and keeps at least me invested into throughout 8 hour campaign
Although if you are not into comics stuff, it won't be easy to follow, because most of the game is basically a fan service, including iconic animated batman voice cast
One of the few negatives this game has - its upgrade system
Half of the Batman gear's upgrades are optional, and another half are simply unnecessary, and used only to get all the Riddler's challenges
Overall if you haven't played this game and just want to try Arkham series out, it is a valid option to do so, however I'd suggest to skip it and jump straight into Arkham City, which is the complete Batman Arkham experience
At this point Arkham Asylum in my opinion is worth to buy and play only in case if you've completed AC and AK and want more quality content
			
Posted: 25 November, 2013
												Still the best Batman game in the Arkham series and probably the best Batman game ever made
The story involves Batman catching Joker easily after a recent robbery and, coincidentally, Joker's gang moved to the Asylum because of an issue at the Blackgate Prison - once inside the Asylum, the Joker escapes and taskes control of the Asylum and prepares to unearth something far worse than what you initially suspect
You play as Batman trying to unearth this plot and once again stop the Joker
To this day, this game still has amazing visuals, Batman himself covering around half the screen, looks the part and stands strong and confident as the character should as well as the texture work on his suit are top notch - the rest of the game fairs the same, since the game has been given an outstanding amount of care and work into every area you go through
Not one area in the game feels exactly the same as another even if they look similar
Very stellar work of textures all around overall
          I don't say this is the best Batman game out there for no reason - gameplay is pretty basic "Brawler" style with very minor puzzle solving, but what makes this game different, from, say a game like Assassin's Creed - is the "Free Flow combat system" the game has
The combat is slightly similar to the first Assassin's Creed, except - the flow combat system allows Batman to basically jump from one foe to another in a very fast manner, almost rythmically, to get a combo counter to go as high as you can while still making it challenging by giving the foes still standing a fighting chance and implementing counters
            You can also explore the entirety of the Arkham Asylum as you unlock areas and you can do a variety of things while exploring, you can face groups of enemies scattered around, you can do Riddler Challenges - whom are a bunch of mini puzzles scattered around the Asylum that involves the use of Batman's Detective Mode, these range from finding a specific item found in the area or marks that require the Detective Mode to find and a "Complete the Mark" type of game that involves you scanning the area from specific places to complete a full mark, etc - Riddler trophies, and a bunch of case files to find out more background information on Batman characters and villains (as well as the history behind Arkahm Asylum) that are often very well realized and fun to hear
            The Detective Mode & Gadgets: You'll be using these a LOT on your trudge through Arkham Asylum
Ranging from the standard Batarangs and Grappling hook (used for mundane objectives such as getting to and pulling out vents from hard to reach places, etc), the Explosive Gel (Used a lot to surprise enemies, to find weak walls to find trophies and secrets and to progress in the story as well!) and a bunch more
The Detecive Mode helps you analyze weak walls to use your Explosive Gel on and other gadgets as well as analyze enemy/allies conditions and, more important later on in the game, to find out which enemies carry weapons or are special enemies
)
So in general, if you ever wanted to know and feel what a life in the day of Batman is, this is definately your game, more so than the sequels (imo)
From the excellent assets and sound to follow it up with, and the pitch perfect gameplay to go along with it, this sits as one of my favourite video game experiences and currently my best experience playing as the legendary Dark Knight

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is a solid game
It has everything going for it: a good story, good gameplay, graphics, cutscenes, voice acting, combat, and stealth
If you weren't a Batman fan before, this game will change that for you
			
Posted: 6 September, 2014
TL:DR? See CONCLUSIONNOTE: Since this is the first game in the franchise, I will review it as if the sequels did not exist
INTRODUCTION:Batman Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game and the first title on the critically acclaimed Arkham franchise
The game was released in 2009, developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment
Arkham Asylum currently (as of the writing of this review 2014), holds the Guinness World Record for “Most critically acclaimed superhero videogame” as well as several Game of the Year awards
The Story was written by Paul Dini who's notable work include Batman: Animated Series and Batman Beyond
PLOT (No Spoilers):In this game Batman, after just having apprehended the Joker,  takes him to the now infamous Arkham Asylum
Unfortunately, Batman soon realizes that it was all part of Joker's plan in an elaborate scheme to stage a major prison riot and take over the Asylum
Now trapped, Batman has to stop the Joker and at the same time, discover whatever sinister plot the Joker has started which seems to involve a new drug called Titan
PROS:+ Graphically beautiful with amazing locations, well textured characters and environment+ Excellent Voice acting from the cast, specially on Kevin Conroy (Batman) and Mark Hamill (Joker)+ Combat Mechanic (Free Flow Combat) that goes well with


+ Fluid Animation quality where Batman can chain attacks with absolute grace+ Lots of cool gadgets and upgrades that can aid you in several situations+ Perfect blend of Action and Stealth without sacrificing either one+ Scarecrow Segments and Riddler Challenges+ Great use of the Batman Lore with cameo appearances or references to other characters and locations in the Batman Universe+ Excellent Story that really draws you in+ Re-playability due to unlockable Challenges and a New Game Plus+ Easy to learn controls and game mechanic+ Relatively medium sized map that rewards exploration+ Excessive amount of bone breaking physical violenceCONS:- Detective mode can be abused by perpetually leaving it active since it has no real drawback- Underwhelming Mini bosses who can be defeated in more or less the same manner- VERY disappointing Boss (Super Villain) battles which is perhaps the game's greatest flaw- Combat mechanic can potentially become repetitive- Games For Windows Live- Game does not include a Shark RepellentCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and a GOOD BUY
Arkham Asylum provides you with tons of enjoyable hours playing as the Dark Knight because of its excellent story and game mechanics
WORTH IT?:Highly recommended to Batman, Martial arts or Stealth fans out there
At $20 for its full price this game is worth every penny and it should be a no-brainer when you see it on a sale
FINAL NOTES:The game is a great comicbook / cartoon to video game adaptation of Batman
Easy to learn and use of the freeflow combat mechanic coupled with a well implemented stealth system makes the gameplay fun
The story is true to the formula that made most Batman cartoons and animated movies great with some added violence and mature content
Engaging and lovely atmosphere that is amplified by the excellent voice acting quality from the cast
Although the bosses in this game does not live up to the build up of the story, it still nonetheless wraps up each story arc pretty neatly

												This game is one of the best superhero games of this generations
What makes it is so is the fact that that it makes you feel like the protagonist
The fighting the style, the gadgets, detective mode and the way you use them make an unforgettable gameplay experience
The story is dark and the conflict between Batman and his nemesis makes it brilliant
The challanges add to the game, making you play it after you finish the campaign(there is a cool skin available)
This game doesn't age, since there is none like it(except for it's sequel)
It is a high-class experience and a fun 100% completion
The score it deserves in todays day is 9
6
			
Posted: 24 November, 2013
												In 2009, Rocksteady Studios, a video game studio with virtually no history restored gamers' hopes all around world with Batman Arkham Asylum
The UK based studio revived a genre long forgotten and delivered a superhero action game which is worth every cent you spend on it
Yes, yes, there hasn't been a shortage of superhero games in the 21st century, but none of them really delivered on its potential
And there is a bunch like the Iromnan or Superman games that aren't even worth talking about
Batman always had the better track record when it comes to games, but Arkham Asylum fires on all cylinders
Great graphics, incredible sound effects, a mad story and the little details will engage gamers and not only Batman and superhero fans
The game takes place on the famous Arkham Island where an Asylum has been build many-many years ago for the worst criminals Gotham can offer
It happens that The Joker has been captured by the Bats and taken in, but the Dark Knight suspects there is something going on in the background and takes his nemesis in himself
Shortly after a riot is started and The Joker gets loose
Now it's clear that the clown has something on his mind and Batman has to stop him
The story is intense and interesting as Bruce Wayne slowly puts together the pieces of Joker's grand plan
As you progress several of Batman's greatest foes will try to stop you, most notably Killer Croc, Poison Ivy or Bane, but others are introduced too
Some of them get bigger space others are bit players, but the point is that they are in the game and by their presence they make it richer
The graphics are decent, but there are flaws here and there
Batman and The Joker look superb, but detail of minor characters aren't on that level and some even look ugly
Other than that, the island is looks beautiful and from the distance you can see Gotham, the city of sins
The game is very well optimized on the PC so gamers with older rigs won't have problem running it
Even tough the island isn't overwhelmingly large, there is a lot to do
The main campaign will take around 8 hours to finish plus you can solve the puzzles and collect the question marks The Riddler left for you
By doing those you unlock character profiles, concept arts and more, so it's far from time wasting
Also by specific scanning stone tables on the island you can unlock recordings that tell you about the story of Arkham Asylum narrated by Amadeus Arkham himself
Probably the most interesting collectibles are the patient interview tapes that are scattered around the island
Some of the villains were interviewed in the facility and you can listen to these well composed dialogues
If you want to complete the main story with all the collectibles you will spend around 14+ hours on the island
When this is done you can try challenge missions where you have to beat scores by beating thugs
Sounds interesting and it adds to the game
This is the place where you can perfect you combat skills as the challenges get more and more difficult
The other half of them puts you in rooms where you have to complete 3, mostly skill-based tasks
With the near perfect free flow combat Arkham City is a near perfect game that finally delivers not only to fans of the genre but also to Batman and superhero fans
In fact, those who are not really in comic books should consider this game for first
It's a joy to play every second of this game
Arkham Asylum set the bar for every single superhero game that comes after 2009
It's a benchmark and an example to follow for every publisher and developer
Rating: 90/100; Replay Value: 3/5; To Beat: 8 hours (main campaign), 14 hours (campaign with collectibles); Played on: normal

												Amazing game!!! i would say the game is worth around 10-15€The gameplay and the atmosphere, graphics, soundtrack everything were astounding
There is a lot to this game when it comes to artistic meeting, it says quite a a few things without saying anything at all, leaving everything up to visual story telling and making connections,  it's a dark, twisted, wierd and wonderfull bit of indie game art and storytelling

An amazing game that builds on what made LIMBO greatSummary at the end - for the easily persuadedOverall Impression:INSIDE is another great game from Playdead[playdead
com]
While it has no direct connection to LIMBO except that it comes from the same studio, you immediately get the sense that this game is based on LIMBO
The fluidity of your character´s movement, the subte yet beautiful background and the sounds that match the action perfectly - all these staples of LIMBO are artistically reinvigorated in INSIDE
Without spoiling anything, INSIDE has a creepy atmosphere that is complemented by simplistic, yet stunning visuals and sounds that give an eerie feeling
Storywise, it leaves almost everything up to interpretation, which I percieve to be a good thing because it doesn´t spoon feed you
There is no notable dialogue
No tutorial
No help
You´re thrown into the game without even so much as a main menu
And that´s great because it´s unique
However, this game does have some cons, as any indie game does (otherwise it would be mainstream)
It is fairly short - at a relaxed pace, I played it through in four hours
For the price of €11
99 (-40% on sale), thats more money per hour than most other games
Especially when we consider that there is a lack of replayability in this game - once you´ve played it you know the solutions to the puzzles and can (maybe) come back to it a few months, if not years, later
But if, like me, you don´t measure games by cost per hour but rather by entertainment value, you´ll be impressed
That said, I do recommend getting INSIDE on sale rather than full price, or waiting for the price to drop over time, because €20 is pretty steep
Another negative is the ending
MINOR SPOILER AHEAD In my opinion, the ending is pretty unsatisfying and leaves a lot of questions unanswered
It leaves much up to imagination, which could be considered a good thing as I said before, but in the case of the ending it lacks clarity
Pros:Simplistic yet stunning visualsFiiting, creepy soundsAtmosphere of uncertainty that inspires player´s imaginationAppeals wonderfully to LIMBO fansYou aren´t spoon-fedCons:High price per hour (if purchased at €20 and not on sale)Lack of replayabilityEnding - see minor spoiler aboveSummaryINSIDE is an indie game with beauty and is artistically executed
While it lacks replay incentification or price value (at the current €20), it doesn´t spoon-feed you and instead inspires your imagination
If you liked LIMBO, you´ll love this
Final verdict: 8
5/10 - Buy on sale or after price drops

4/10* First of all, I strongly recommend INSIDE for people who would like to experience a very atmospheric and meaningful designed game
INSIDE is all about paying attention to all kind of details and events that you will encounter during the journey in the game
- The sound effects and well designed graphics perfectly fit the general dark atmosphere of INSIDE
- There are no instructions, no explanations, no story telling, no dialogues and absolutly lots of meanings in this game
It's not just about puzzles and getting yourself to the next step, if you pay attention to whatever happens around you; the sounds, voices, movements, light affects and the ideas, you will actually know that INSIDE has a very deep meanings
* I enjoyed INSIDE although it's a short game that took me nearly 5 hours to 100% finish the game along with its achivements, taking into concediration that I normally had to repeat some parts where I died few times before solving the puzzle and moving on
* For me I got INSIDE on the Summer Sale 2017, and I recommend buying the game on sale
PLEASE NOTE: The coming parts, along with my screenshots includes spoilers !! SPOILER ALLERT	 After completing the game, you might start wondering about what does all of this mess means
Well it differs from one player to another but for me I think that INSIDE is all about mind manipulating and enslaving poor and weak people
That can go as a general idea, but for the idea that is a little bit more obvious, the main character of INSIDE is this little boy who came from the poor or similarly, the low class of people
somehow this little boy managed to escape and not being captured by the scouters who appears at the beginning of the game
these scouters work for a huge orgnization that targets the low class people of the society as they are considered as worthless creatures regardless their role in the society, capturing them and using them as lab rats under the supervision of the company's or orgnization's scientists
Performing new tests and experiments directly on these enslaved people which will lead into so many mutations and transformations
One experiment after another (The Company) have reached to a point in where they can control the minds of the enslaved ones which will result in controlling their actions
This is the new trade that gains the capitalists huge profits by offering this mind control to the high class people of the world so they can use the enslaved mind controlled people as machines at their service
	 Back to the little boy, as I mentioned he managed to escape from being captured by the scouters, and then he tries to find his way out of all of this
But, on the way his concepts changed as he experienced the role of the mind controller
Now, he aims to free out all of the other people who have been captured and been put and used in the experiements of The Company
During this journey some concepts can be noticed as they describe the little boy's thoughts changing such as: the little tiny chicks at the beginning of the game, if you pay attention, after blowing them towards the box none of them dies yet one of them starts to walk slower than others and apperantly seems weaker
The mind whipped bodies that the little boy controls using the mind controling helmet are another example; in the part of the game where you need to gather 19 of them to open the huge metal door, you can realize that the last one of them is a dead body
And the other group of the mind whipped or controlled people who provides help in the elevator, you can actually realize that this group includes individuals that lost an arm, a leg or even a head
All of these details are pointing to one direction: the change of heart and mind of the little boy
 How? the little boy now knows that working in a group and for the benefit of the majority, a sacrifice is a must
The little chick, the dead one and the lost organs ! as he reaches the big dome that he knows later on that it is actually a big tank, he manages to dive in and be close to a big, sticky, organic blob that is made of organs and people, body parts, legs, arms and even heads ! all in one big strange manipulated formation ! these are the people of his class in this society, could be his friends, or even family ! so he now believes that he must sacrifice him self for the benefit of the majority as he tries to unplug the mind controlling healmets he gets sucked into the blob and then try to lead it to its freedom and its way out of this place
The blob causes chaeos and huge losses inside The Company while on its way out and finally rests on a shore with some sun light away from The Company


The little boy managed to save the currently captured people, but who knows what rich and powerful people can do again !	At the end thats my opinion, and as I said other people may have different thoughts about all of this
The game is amazing and worth buying it

Posted: 6 March
Disturbed
Speechless
Wholeheartedly in awe
That's how I'm feeling after full playtrough
It was few years back, when I began depressing journey with Limbo
Back then it was for me much more discouraging because of the puzzles, that my brain just couldn't handle; but I was in Love with the tone, visualisation, and playing it - until I reached the end - and to this day, Limbo is game that I will, with pleasure, recommend till the end of time
After five long years Playdead[playdead
com] came up with their second tittle - INSIDE
Let me tell you right away - waiting this long was worth it!INSIDE is showcase what someones devotion to games, great artistic vision, trust in player base and brilliant mind can come up with, in this crowded gaming world
From start it wasn't for me possible to look at this game, and be bored, or be disinterested; because with every frame comes new thing to discover
I was trying to keep away from spoilers, as much as I could
I succeeded
You playing as little kid; running from people, beasts; timing your jumps so you wouldn't end as splatter in dark alley, and being careful while swimming in the dark; trying to grasp control over you life, and life of others
You run forward where mystery of this world is hiding, and along the way figure out your purpose in this dark and twisted story
What is happening here is disturbing, weird, confusing, and if the ending won't leave you with sense of "What the F*, just happened!", I seriously don't know what will
This story works perfectly, and when credits starts to roll, that is the point where your interest will spike even higher, cause you want to know more 


also there is alternative ending, which digs even deeper
Story (despite how much I enjoyed it) is sidetracked by astonishing visuals and overall aesthetics
INSIDE looks spectacular
Foreground and background seamlessly coming together at the center where the action lies
Work with lighting and shadow in just incredible, and the level of detail that is made because of this, is just top level
Everything on screen is set as indented, just to give us this eerie feeling, sense of hopelessness and misfortune behind every corner
When you add to this mix great ambience sound, with on point sound design - result should leave you entirely at awe
Controls are smooth, and on point
I didn't experience any issues whatsoever while playing with controller
My biggest fear were puzzles
After Limbo, I was really cautious
Why? Let's just say, there were moments I rage quit a lot
Not with INSIDE
Yes, I admit, there were few instances of me getting annoyed and discouraged, but if it was up to five times I'm already exaggerating
So on this front, I was satisfied with myself that I could get thru, with only smallest possible help of guides (just a couple - I swear to God, I don't believe in)
Also it was so satisfying for me, to pat my own back for job well done, when I figured something out (yes, I'm one of those people - dumb)
I won't shy away from statement, that INSIDE could easily be pinnacle of gaming in my personal experience
This is art that should be celebrated by playing it, and afterwards recommended it to others, so they can too experience this game
I agree; story might not suit everyone (ending is probably even worse in this manner), but from technical stand point and playability this comes to very top
Thank you Playdead for this game, and whoever you are reading this, and still didn't play INSIDE just do it!Grade: A+

												Inside is a really great game and I don't really want to give anything away with a review, so I will just summarize;-The graphics and sound are just stunningly well done-The gameplay is smooth, fun and controls great-It builds an excellent atmosphere with uniquely eery storytelling-Has puzzles and mechanics that are clever while not becoming tiresomeThere are some totally unique things about this game that you will want to have experienced yourself, It's really something amazing
I highly recommend
Easily one of my favorite gaming experiences of all time
Great job developers

												I see people complaining how short this game is
Personally, I'd rather play 3-5 hours of perfection than 50+ of repetitive, unoriginal crap
The atmosphere and design are like nothing I've ever seen in a platform styled game
To be honest, you're doing INSIDE a disservice by considering it a platformer
The puzzles are challenging, yet not frustrating, and the ending leaves you with chills
TIP: (minor spoiler) Make sure you collect all of the orbs for the secret ending
This game is a genuine masterpiece

Well, its obvious where the Limbo developer's have been putting in their time
INSIDE is brimming with atmosphere, feelings, and attention to detail
I mean it doesn't take more than 10 minute to see how meticulously hand-crafted and polished this title is
The only question in my mind, really, is if its worth the debatably steep asking price
For me? Oh sure, you bet
You aren't going to get 20 hours (likely closer to 3-5), but damn, you will get an experience
While I enjoyed Limbo, I thought INSIDE was overall much better
Essentially, this is a walking/experience simulator with medium-level puzzles
And I don't mean 'walking simulator' in a derogatory way - its great fun
I should note that this game is rather dark, triggering some moderate level anxiety at moments
Definately scary at times, too
Pros:+Definately some of the most attention-to-details I've seen in a game
What points it loses for overall length, it definately gains in being one of the highest of quality experiences
+Sounds and music are outstanding
+The feelings are real, with this one
You will definatley go through a range of emotions
+'Storyline' is quite original, albeit abstract
Don't expect to walk away understanding everything
+Thankfully, the puzzles aren't super difficult
This is more focused on the experience, which I appreciated
+The scope of the rooms and areas were just magnificient
+Controller support is great
Cons:-Definately expensive, although they arguably earned their money
The devil is in the details
Those animations are obviously all custom
-Some moments verged on being too anxiety ridden/scary for me
Thankfully I pushed through and it worked out well, though
-While there was a range of environments, I would have liked to see less 'Portal factory' and more perhaps outside
Its fine, and I'm being slightly picky, but there it is
For any indie game enthusiast, this is a must have
Now with that being said, I'm sure if you wait, it will be on a half-price sale sooner than later
Either way, make sure you play through this game some time in 2016

												After watching the Steins;Gate anime, and becoming a little bit obsessed with it, I thought that I would purchase the original game
I am glad I did! It adds a lot of depth to the story and the characters, and helps to explain several parts of the anime that I thought were a little odd and inexplicable
If you have seen the extremely popular anime, I would not say this purchase is essential by any means
But for those like me who want to experience the story again with a little more depth and expansion, I highly recommend it!For those who have not seen the Steins;Gate anime, watch it! It is currently streaming on Funimation (in the US) and can be watched for free is you sign up for the 14-day free trial
It is really fantastic! For those interested in the story but wary of reading a visual novel, it is a good option
Although, be forewarned, the first half of the anime is kind of slow
Anyway, for those who are not aware of Steins;Gate at all, I would purchase this game if you enjoy a cast of quircky characters, well-researched science fiction, and an awesome, complicated plot that somehow manages to avoid the plot holes that plague most time travel stories
Higly recommended
Update (6/28/17):My computer locked up a few days ago and I had to reset it to factory settings
After a day of updating Windows and all of my drivers, I tried to play Steins;Gate today
And


it gave me an error message in Japanese and did not start
So, just FYI, the game is not packaged with all of the software dependencies required to play it
If it fails to start, try installing another recent game or two and then try again

												I love Steins;Gate
It's unique visual style is something that's always a breath of fresh air
Every character that you come across feels very human
Each of the routes are finely crafted
The soundtrack is beautiful
The mood of the story is captured perfectly through it, and I can't be more happy with it
Enough gushing, though, I have to say that I should bring up that I have 2 issues with this game, neither of which are a very big deal
The first issue is how long it takes to kick off the ground
This can be a turn off for newcomers, as the first few chapters are paced fairly slow, however, I feel that the slow pacing is necessary to build on the impact that the tone shift has on the player
The second issue that I have with the VN is the requirements for the true ending
You aren't going to get the true ending on your first blind playthrough of Steins;Gate unless your looking it up
That isn't an issue, and I don't think it should be seen as one, but the problem comes that the flags required to achieve the true ending can be seen as a little convoluted
Aside from those two things, which may or may not even be an issue for some people, I loved this visual novel
Totally worth the price
I'm really glad to see it finally made its way onto Steam for others to enjoy the same way that I have

												This is amazing
Mindblowing
 I was a Steins;Gate maniac since i saw the the first anime episode and i really enjoyed it
It is actually in my personal top-3 list of the best anime of all time
I have re-watched it a number of times, so i practically know everything that happens there, like the in's and out's of the infinite time loop
So when i started to play this VN i was qute sure that it cant really surprise me, since i know the anime version of the story so well
Oh boy


i was soo naive
Let me start with the obvious fact that compared to the anime - here we have a lot more details even on the events that has been shown in the anime
Time travel theories explaind deeper, we have some additional lines, scenes, etc
 But the main attraction point is definetly the ability to reach scenes and endings that were never shown in the anime
And  the way the choices needed to reach the different world lines are made is so smart that it actually got me very confused
I was even going to comply that this game is not a visual novel at all, but just an interactive book
Because in the course of the game there were no standart "choose 1 of 3 actions" popups
The thing is that there ARE choices
But they are camouflaged and the game itself never teaches you about that - you have to figure is out for yourself
Now since i dont consider that as real spoiler i am going to say that aloud:  you make choices when you interact (or dont!) with your phone
Emails, calls, replys(or not!) - this all matters!   Honestly i didnt get it until i have finished up my first playthrough
I just interacted with the phone as i felt natural and in the end i have reached the Amane Suzuha ending
When the actual scenes started to divergence from the original canon anime i was really, really surprised, since i wasnt expecting that at all
 The feels hit like a truck
VERY COOL, SUNUVABICH! Now since i have figured it out i will go for the new playthrough, paying much more attention to what i do to the phone
Currently i am very excited to see what else the game has in store and which outcome will become the new choice of the Stains Gate
I am sorry if this review feels a bit scrambled, but i just had an urge to immidiately inform every original anime fan that this VN is a must buy thing, since it adds so much to the Gate world
 Also i strongly advice you to not read any guides on your first playthrough, and just see for yourself where you will end up
Let us meet again in the world of the Gates, comrades! EL PSY CONGROO!100 out of 10

												If you read this review you are probably like me and watched the Steins;Gate anime before for whatever reason stumbling across the visual novel on steam and are asking yourself now "Is this game still worth buying even though i know all the major plottwists and the true-route?"The short answer is in my opinion: yes it is
If you enjoyed the anime as a whole and not just the first or the second half, it's definetly worth buying for multiple reasons
First of all the game gives you a lot more information on the time-travel stuff that's going on and even discusses some theories that are actual theories in real-life and it's pretty well researched by the devs
However it never goes that deep into science that you, as a normal person, cannot understand what the characters are talking about
So it's really well blalanced and gives you something to think about while reading
Second the characters get a lot more depth
I guess that shouldn't come as a surprise, that a visual novel with around 50 hour length develops the characters much more than the anime with around 8 hours
However not just that the side characters like Faris, Lukako, etc
get more depth they also get their very own ending route, that, even though it's non-canonical, is worth experiencing
Third the art and the soundtrack in this game are awesome
But if you've watched the anime and checked the screenshots above the review section you should know that already
Fourth the inner thoughts of Okabe gives you a lot more insight on how he goes through this whole journey
Even though the anime does a good job in portraying how he kinde descends into madness because of the constant time-looping, reading about his inner thoughts gives you a much better picture about the whole situation
Also having his phone accessable and reading his e-mail exchange with the fellow characters is pretty well done
Fifth you support the devs
I mean even if nothing from the above convinced you to buy the game because the price is too high or you are still not sure, just wait for winter-sale or something and buy it then, even if it's just to support the devs
They just recently released the Steins;Gate 0 visual novel and it might get a steam release as well, if the support is big enough here
Who knows


All in all it was a really nice experience to read through the novel, even with prior knowlege of the anime
Sure it does spoiler the major plottwists for you, however it shouldn't hinder the enjoyment you get out of the game
Also sorry for possible grammar-typo mistakes, english is not my first language

												Anime was 10/10, perfect in every way
This VN is 11/10
You get to experience the anime from Okabe's perspective, get ready for some feels

"*puts cellphone down*------Oh, hi
Steins;Gate is an excellent visual novel about time travel, consequence, fate, and a crazy protagonist who spews fantasy conspiracy babble that you can't help but be entertained by
Seriously, I'm not much for the "mad scientist" trope, but the protagonist (Okabe Rintaro, or "Hououin Kyouma" as he goes by) won me over with his crazy dramatic nonsense and wonderful voice acting (for those wondering, he's not actually a mad scientist, that's just his alter ego fantasy)
Along with its humor, Steins;Gate is also a very heartfelt and complex story that explores themes that are often barely touched by time travel stories and visual novels in general
It's well worth your time, trust me
			
Posted: 18 May
												I thought that time travel could only be a cheesy plot device that inevitably led to unsatisfying contradictions and unresolved questions
 I was wrong
 I thought that I wasn't really the sort of person to stay up until early in the morning playing a visual novel game
 I was wrong
I thought games with multiple endings were generally just trying to recycle limited content and couldn't deliver a meaningful experience
 I was wrong
Any game that shatters that many preconceptions is a great game in my book
			
Posted: 7 June
[Introduction]As someone who doesn't normally enjoy visual novels, I was hesitant at first
Sure, the setting and the anime aesthetic appealed to me, but there was a big chance that this game would be just another VN hyped up by its fanatic anime fans
But damn… was I surprised by what I found! The game managed to change my mind pretty much instantly, not because of its art style or its soundtrack (though they are huge contributors towards that), but because of the overall feel and well presented atmosphere
As always, these are my own opinions and experiences, please consider reading other reviews too! [Negatives]Just some minor things that i still want to mention just to spice things up
While this game features a form of gameplay, and I’m very glad that it does; the mixing of drinks can be a bit repetitive at times
No wonder some people say that you should play it in sessions and take breaks, just like the protagonist
The problem is the fixed number of recipes at your disposal and the way the system works, you have the initial 24 drinks but that’s it really, no new ones will be introduced during your playthrough which is a missed opportunity
A double-click option would’ve been nice to add the ingredients directly instead of dragging every single one of them
Checkpoints are often very far apart from each other which can result in frustration since you have to possibly play huge chunks of the game again, if you fu-ck up or want to do something differently
[Gameplay]I’m truly glad to have the bartending as a way of interacting with the characters in the game, without this feature, the game wouldn’t be half as engaging as it is right now
Mixing drinks together is fun and thankfully doesn’t require a crazy tutorial or anything like that
Simply mix together the ingredients based on the recipes and you're done with the exceptions of big drinks and a few others
Manage Jill’s home between days to spent your hard-earned cash for silly stuff or save up to pay the rent
You even get tiny bits of lore in her smartphone and the ability to save/load, which can also be done during work-breaks
What I think is the most important part is the need to satisfy the customers taste through mixing alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks together from scratch
You are often asked to guess the right drink for the right customer, luckily the game has a built-in list of 24 available recipes to help you with that
Some clients require you to be quick, remember their favourite drinks or even guess the right one that could trigger new events and story bits
This is the main way to influence the game's progression and the ending that you will get, so be sure to try something different then the game is telling you
Just pay attention to your customer and what they order, it might not always be what they really want or need! A character is depressed and orders something sweet? Add some alcohol to let him forget about their troubles thanks to optional recipes where you can add as much of it as you want
[Story]VA-11 Hall-A’s story revolves around the everyday life of bartender Jill and her customers as well as her boss and co-worker Gillian and many others
A diverse cast of characters who are relatable, believable and interesting in one way or another and have their own problems and worries in life that you can be a part of
Even though you don't have any choices during the conversations itself, the discussions are still pretty engaging and well presented making you crave for more
[Graphics]The visuals are reminiscent of old Japanese adventure games for the PC-98, the first visual novels one could say
Everything is more detailed though and gives this a very modern look and feel
Good looking characters also make sure that you are interested in finding out more about them and exactly why they chose your bar of all places
[Music]Fitting, satisfying style of music fitting a cyberpunk city so incredibly well and don’t ask me why but some songs even reminded me of games of my childhood like Zone of the Enders, Final Fantasy VII, Breath of Fire III and countless others
The soundtrack is certainly one of the bigger contributors to VA-11 Hall-A’s success
https://garoad
bandcamp
com/album/va-11-hall-a-second-round [Conclusion]VA-11 Hall-A is an incredible 10-20 hour adventure that is without a doubt one of the best Visual Novels currently available on Steam
This game is an amazing and mature experience and I’m glad that I finally got around to playing it, and do hope a sequel is in the works! I recommend it to anyone who is interested in Visual Novels with lots of text
Fans of the cyberpunk will also find great value in this beautiful game

												This is a game I will likely never play again
I binged through it in 2-3 days, unlocked all the endings and did everything but beat the damn minigame
BUT MY GOD HAVE I ENJOYED IT! This little visual novel is a treasure and I have loved every moment of it as it told it's story
You've got a large cast of diverse and interesting characters, not so huge in scope that anyone who matters loses screen time and not so small that you feel like you've got just one or two regulars who just show up all the damn time
You play as Jill, you have no control over what she says or does outside of what drinks she serves and what she spends her money on
There's no fanservice (unless the boob jokes and occassional mature conversations count), you only see a character's top half and there's only a few CGs reserved for the intro and epilogue
But believe me when I say that doesn't matter
That level of interaction is enough and the life and personality present in each and every single character means you're just drawn in
You'll have your favourite character or three that you grin every time they show up, knowing you're going to delight in seeing more of their world
You'll have some characters you'll enjoy despite their flaws (or because of it) and you've got a bunch of new world building lore available on your phone every day to help flesh out the world should you choose to indulge
The music was varied enough, the artwork was a treat and the story so engaging and enjoyable I had to burn through this thing in 18 hours stretched over 2-3 days
A word of advice to those who don't want to tread the same ground too many times
There are a few guides that will help with the choices to make for drinks
Aside from the bad ending you can net every extra ending alongside the good one in one run
Of course if you prefer to bludgeon your way through the story time and time again trying to find how to do those endings for yourself, more power to you
$15 is a bit more than you'd spend on a meal
One meal


That fills you up for a few hours
You're getting at least an hours worth of enjoyment per dollar
If you're looking for a good little story to read over a week or two this is a great pick up
Pleasant art, nice music, wonderful story with charismatic characters
Money well spent

												There are a fair number of horror games out there
Many of them, to be candid, are fairly bad if not downright awful
The issue being that a lot of the time games in this genre seem to want to follow a set list
There is somewhat a rigid rulebook on how horror games are meant to be, but these rules aren’t supposed to be one hundred percent abided by
Developers can and should, for the most part, make up the rules and experiment as much as they want
At the end of the day I find that it’s the somewhat unique games that capture people’s attention
Now I’m not saying Detention is unique, I mean let’s face it what is unique nowadays? However it does like to throw in its own little rulebook
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The summary of the plot is; you start off the game as a male student named Wei who falls asleep in class
Hours later he wakes up alone in a dark and obviously quite spooky school
After sometime  exploring he comes across a girl sitting asleep on the school stage
He wakes her up and things start really kicking off
A lot of weird stuff starts happening around the school and creatures called Lingered start appearing
These seem to be undead students and teachers and are the first enemies you come across
They’re slow creatures which, like the rest of the enemies in the game, seem to have a hunger for anything that breathes
Luckily there’s a useful mechanic that can help with that
By clicking the right mouse button, or whichever button it’s been mapped to, Wei or Ray will hold their breath
This allows for you to scamper on past the Lingered without them attacking, however you will have to catch your breath if you hold for too long
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Detention plays out as a point and click horror game where you will need to solve puzzles in order to progress
Some of the puzzles can be fairly straight forward, for example using an umbrella to fetch a key from a ventilation shaft
But others require a bit of thought to them
One example was where I had to look at three clock faces
Two had hands and the one in the middle didn’t
There was then three pictures, each with a bloody symbol on them
These symbols represented the clock hands and once I’d adjusted the clocks to the correct times the door that was previously locked opened
Some puzzles do require certain items to complete them
These items aren’t too difficult to come across, you just need to be a little bit observant
The puzzles themselves don’t feel too tedious or pointless
There’s always a valid reason to complete them and most of the time it’s to move the story forward
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Graphics wise I’d say detention has an unusual but very well done art style
It’s clear the artist took a lot of time to add in as much detail as possible to give the game a sense of reality
Each area is well drawn, with clear distinctions from the odd dark world, with it’s grainy overly, to the creepy school at night
The characters and enemies are defined too
With Wei and Ray wearing very white school uniforms and the enemies seemingly very dark and shadowy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In conclusion I think Detention is horror game that tries to break the mould of the genres standards
But does it? Yes and no
There are a few things that really shine for me in Detention
The story is pretty complex but welcome, as I know of many horror games that have little to no story at all
Also I like the various stealth mechanics that are introduced for the number of enemies you have to face
It does throw in the odd jumpscare here and there, but I mean what horror games doesn’t
It’s got puzzles of varying difficulties and an eerie soundtrack that fits the game’s quite chilling atmosphere
All in all if you love horror games and want something a little different than the norm then I’d suggest giving Detention a go
And even if you don’t want it for the horror aspect, it’s full of puzzles to test your wits too
Good Day!

												Holy heck this is a good one
Good enough for me to post a review even!From start to end, I was left in awe
The characters are interesting, the story is told beautifully, the art is unique (in a good way), and the music/sounds were done masterfully
The only real complaints I had were that a majority of the signs posted throughout the world weren't translated (however, ALL notes and signs essential to the story are translated)
It doesn't rely on jump-scares but pure atmospheric horror (granted there is like maybe two jump-scares but they're done so well I can't even be mad)
What I also adored about this game is it's "puzzles
" They weren't complicated but they were done in such a way that makes this game unique
I highly recommend this game

												I just bought this game to play with my girlfriend at the moment
She likes horror
But I really don't
The whole story and the puzzles of the stages were so good, The background music and sound effects fit nicely with the vibes of the game
But it scared me as f
I recommend it to the gamers that love horror

												Disclaimer: I am a supporter since this game's beta phase but only playtested its Traditional Chinese version
I bought the game from Steam again and tried it out in English setting so as to write this review in English
I think Detention nailed it with interweaving its background setting and the foreground story that's being played out
In a seemingly simple and short (2-hour play time) 2D horror format, it presents a whole lot unique Taiwanese cultural elements to the player, while unraveling what's this not-so-horror horror story is about
Writing is really good, and fortunately the English translation is also good enough
There are soooo many things in game you just can't find a direct translation into English or other languages, but they somehow pulled it through, which is pretty impressive
What's really a shame to me IMHO is that there are also many detailed environmental clues in the visuals that just couldn't be totally translated
These won't hinder your understanding to the plot itself, or to feel the emotions that the game wants you to feel, but surely there's going to be something missing if you don't read Traditional Chinese
Gameplay wise, the game does have some survival elements in the former half of the game, and puzzles throughout the game, but difficulty should not be a problem
If you are into short narrative games that give you a movie-like experience this is definitely for you too
Visually the game may not be "stunning" in a high production value sense, but all the props and closeup interaction views are all designed meticulously
I would praise the team that they put their resources into where it mattered the most and it paid off well
Audio on the other hand, is sooooo good
I doubt you can find other 2D narrative games that really rivals with Detention's audio design and music composing
Finally, my friendly warning would be don't come to the game to expect truly gory or extremely scary stuff -- if you watched the game's release trailer just once I don't think you can somehow miss the point
But of course I won't go into what the story really is about, but prepare your tissue ready
It's probably one of the few horror games that's going to make you cry of sorrow but not horror
Definitely recommended

												Detention follows a unique arc in horror that not many other titles manage to trace
It starts in a perfectly grounded place, with familiar characters and real-world concerns
From there it spirals off into a fantastic journey of bizarre horrors and vivid, dreamlike imagery
At the tail end of this, it comes right back to a grounded conclusion somehow enhanced by the weirdness endured on the way there
It’s a deeply-affecting game because of this, one that wields its symbolism and purpose with a confident hand
The game opens in the shoes of Wei, a high school student in 1960s Taiwan
After falling asleep in class he awakens to find himself trapped in the school during a typhoon, his only companion being an upper-classman named Ray
Mysterious events are set in motion that put them in peril, including the road into town washing away and a strange presence stalking the halls
As the story turns darker their relevance to the lives of these two students is laid bare, along with the reason for their isolation and the effect it has on their lives
There are some VERY heavy overtones here, ones that resonate powerfully in the real world
Citizens of Taiwan in the 1960s lived under martial law, a brutal regime that allowed only limted speech and political ideology
Anyone who resisted was not long for this world, a threat that extended even to students
A cornerstone of Detention’s horror is set in this terrifying reality, where instructors and authorities are constantly watching for dissident thought to excise
Simply reading the wrong book could mean vanishing into the night with a bag over your head, and to me there are few ideas in horror more horrifying than that
Detention brings this world to the player as a stark reality, where students and teachers alike are fearful and suspicious of each other with threat of death hanging over them all
It takes a terrible toll on them, and the psychological damage is a major focus of this title
It’s expressed through a great deal of striking imagery, much of it steeped in Chinese folklore
You’ll encounter religion in the shrines and talismans set about, mythology in the strange creatures you encounter and how you escape them, and culture in solving puzzles containing unique concepts like spirit money
For those of us unfamiliar with the culture it provides a unique sort of immersion, since we can’t be sure how some of the more esoteric elements fit with reality
I wish I could explain the story more directly but it would be a crime to spoil any part of it, considering how gripping it is
The tale is told through a lot of shifting environments akin to Silent Hill, where familiar locations like classrooms and auditoriums become bastions of symbolic horrors
The further into the game you get the less grounded in reality these places become, yet this happens because they symbolize events in the real world more closely
You’ll learn plenty about one character’s broken home from a network of nightmare rooms filled with ghosts and needles and connected by a cursed radio
The intensity of the experience builds as you creep closer to the truth, and the closing revelations hit hard enough on a purely human level to make a major payoff
The gameplay that gets you there is some basic pointing and clicking from a purely side-scrolling perspective
Items and points of interest are highlighted with a question mark when you draw near, so wandering the full extent of a room is sure to reveal everything of note
Puzzles here are plenty unique owing to the cultural influence, but are never confusing and have logical solutions
There’s not much challenge to the game aside from learning how the enemies work, since there’s a very different way of dealing with them than what you’re used to
There’s a curve to it but dying helpfully sends you to a special place with a strange NPC who advises you on what you did wrong
Topping this package off with vivid, finely-animated graphics and some wonderfully horrifying sound design makes it a near-perfect entry in the genre
The only complaint I can level against it is a common one for quality titles, that being a lack of content to enjoy
Detention shouldn’t take you much more than two hours to complete, with no branching paths and only two endings which depend on answers given in the final area
There’s also an issue of consistency, as the game is split into four parts but the content of each varies pretty wildly in terms of threats and tone
This isn’t really a complaint but more of a warning that if you like something about an early part, it may not return later
Detention did almost everything I could ask of a psychological horror game
It gave me interesting characters, it gave them depth, it threatened them with a horrifying concept, and it explored all aspects of that horror
If it were longer it might be my new pinnacle of the genre, but for what it is it’s still an impressive piece with the power to rattle anyone
The strange and intense symbolism gives way to fears that anyone, anywhere could have, reflected through events that really took place in the past
It’s a brilliant, terrifying, heartbreaking game that succeeds at everything it sets out to do, and deserves major recognition for it

												This is one of the best narrative experiences I've ever seen in a video game, and possibly in any medium
It seems like a standard point-and-click horror game, but behind its gameplay lies a brilliantly subtle twisted form of storytelling comparable to Silent Hill 2
It's fairly short and isn't groundbreaking, but the hours I spent playing this game were absolutely unforgettable
If you like when horror doesn't spook or startle you, but slowly digs at your emotions and leaves you with nothing left to say, I cannot recommend this game enough

												TLDR: If you look only for an horror game, look elsewhere, if you are in for an experience and like to reflect on things, this gem is for you
First of all, there are a couple of things that have to be said:1
-The game is labeled and marketed as an horror game, but this is only done on the first part of the game, if horror is all that you're looking for, it migh dissapoint you, if you're interested in other generes you genuilly have to go  for it
2
-This is sort of point and click combined to a side scroller to some degree, you can't play it with a controller, and don't need a keyboard, the game is played entirely with the mouse
Now that that has been cleared, this is genuinely a gem of a game, it goes from horror, to traumatic, to surreal, to introspective, to reflective, but to really get the grasp of what the game has to offer is best if you actually reflect on everything that you read and see, and try to get the meaning of everything that you see, even on what's on the background, literally everything  has a meaning, yes, you can still just rush through the game, but you'll loose on the experience
You might notice that all the reviews a have short play time, that's because the game is relatively short, it took me 3
4 hours and I took my time, but still is long enough to give you an experience and not become tedious, and actually gives you a sense of closure at the end

												I picked this game up without any prior knowledge of it
The visuals looked interested, like a cross of old Silent Hill games and The Cat Lady, also it was cheap so I bought it
I have to say it didn't turn out to be what I expected, but I still liked the game
Looking at the screenshots, you'd be under the impression that the game is a point and click horror game about some kids stuck in a haunted school, but that's just the first quarter of the game
The later chapters dwell much more deeper than such a simplistic plot
I want to say more about the game but I'm afraid I'll be giving out spoilers and I really request you to experience the story first hand
It might be a little convoluting to get so pay attention to every little detail in the game
Regarding the game's length, I clocked in 4
4 hours and I believe I experienced the game in it's entierity
I wouldn't call it short though, any longer would have made the story feel stretched out
Overall, a great game
I wish there were more games like these which dealt in old asian folklore and history

												I remember watching gameplay during E3 2013 and thinking it looked like just another "generic FPS with the Wolfenstein brand slapped on"
Here I am a year later eating those words, as Wolfenstein: The New Order is most probably my game of the year for 2014
Serious Sam style over-the-top one-man-army gameplay that feels amazing, with a meaty arsenal of weapons (all of which can be dual-wielded) and a heavy reliance on health and armour pickups as opposed to health regeneration
The alternate post-WW2 setting is also incredibly well realised, with varied and interesting locales that stay interesting over the course of the games 8-10 hour length
 Not to mention the game's soundtrack featuring Nazi-fied versions of famous real world songs is worth a look on its own
Combined with a surprisingly well told story featuring characters that you'll actually care about (with special mention going to Brian Bloom's performance as BJ Blazkowicz) makes this the freshest single player FPS I've played this generation
Hands down
If you're even remotely interested in this game, pick it up
I hope you'll be as blown away as I was

												If you played the first level - you will get that old Wolfenstein feeling back
And to be fair - no, its NOT that fun, It can be overwhelming to be thrown into the action from the start, and a bit exhausting cause "here we are again", killing Nazis and blowing up everything in our way
We've been there already
Its not a bad chapter, but it is slightly different than the rest of the game
ON PURPOSE
The real New Order actually starts after that level
Everything will change, the story, the characters, the tempo, Blasko himself, the timeline (14 years between 1st and 2nd level) and suddenly game will develop depth in every aspect
And that depth hasn't been seen in old Wolfie games at all
You will start to care for the story (it still is about Nazis dominating the world but hey you cant change that premise), you will develop the interest for the people around you, you will start to notice all the little pieces of information thrown around the levels, and you will see the narrative of the game going only upwards
Right until the end
And what an ending it is
The New Order tried and succeded  to tell us a story
It still is crazy fun to shoot and kill, but this time - it seems like there really is a bigger purpose
Shooting is great, stealth has its ups and downs, but overall - the flow is just right
One of the most overlooked games
Big recommendation

If that alone doesn't convince you to buy this game, Wolfenstein: The New Order has a great story, realistic graphics, and rewarding cutscenes

												Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is six hours of a prank getting out of hand
You play as B
J
, a man who's last name I can never spell right without looking it up
B
J
and his partner Wesley must sneak into Castle Wolfenstein and steal the documents that contain the location of Deathhead's compound
Unfortunately they didn't bring their lederhosen and steins so their cover was blown right away
B
J
and Wesley are imprisoned by the infamous Rudi Jager, the second in command to Helga Von Schabbs who is the leader of the SS paranormal division
But B
J
escapes with the help of a lead pipe and then once again goes on a rampage while reciting poetry because live journal hasn't been invented yet
Old Blood is a prequel to 'The New Order
' taking place in 1946, so you get to see more of that neat WW2 stuff that you only got a glimpse of during the prologue to the New Order
But because of that it feels kind of limited in what you can see save for a new enemy later on, but basically everything you saw in the prologue of The New Order is what you're going to be running into during Old Blood
Combat has always been Wolfenstein's strong point, for obvious reasons
Although there's an emphasis on stealth with basic but useful sneaking mechanics as well as the return of commanders that can bring in reinforcements with alerted
It sort of gets in the way of the gunplay in Old Fart
There's this weight of aggression and viciousness when fighting the angry men with stylish uniforms, where you have to think cautiously if you want to go on the offensive or stay on defense
But there are so many sequences where they encourage stealth, I just kind of started ignoring stealth just to get in some of that sweet sweet gun play
I suggest playing the game on Uber to get the full experience
It's not really all that hard, but it just forces you to play smarter, going out of your way to ambush and outmaneuver your enemy, it's obvious  that you'll get shot more the closer you get, mix that with the damage increase for Uber and you're basically risking getting punched in the face by a very upset Mike Tyson, except his fists are bullets and you are a baby
The game is shorter than the first, I got six hours out of it on the hardest difficulty, but it usually goes on sale
I mean I  Stole it from a sleeping man
 got it on sale
But if you're going to ask me
“Dirk, you handsome man with no flaws
Which one do I pick between New Order and Old Blood?” I would tell you to get New Order and also thank you for the compliment
It's not a bad game, but you'll get more bang for your buck if you get New Order instead, considering it's basically twice as long as Old Blood is
Hufflepuff: The Old Wizard, gets 7 large Aryan men speaking in poetry out of, I dunno, 8? Lincoln Logs were invented by Frank Lloyd Wright's son

												There's really not much to say here, but there's enough to bother writing a review
Ultimately, if you liked The New Order, you'll probably like this too, because it's basically the same formula, hence being a standalone expansion
If you didn't like The New Order, there's not a lot here to change your mind
If you don't know what Wolfenstein is at all (what are you, some kind of commie?), here's the scoop: You kill Nazis
Lots of Nazis
So many Nazis that there's a point in the game where Winston Churchill himself rises from his wheelchair, clad with sciencey robot legs, and goes "Damn, son, that's a lot of Nazis"
That doesn't actually happen (or at least I'm assuming it doesn't; if it does then screw Machine Games for stealing my idea before I thought of it, and I'm sorry for the spoilers), I'm just giving Machine Games ideas for the next Wolfenstein
The Churchill part, not the Nazis part
You really do kill a lot of Nazis
You can sneak past them, you can gun them all down, nobody really cares as long as you kill them all, and pick up some gold along the way because Nazis are well known for hiding their gold in sewer grates in their prison facilities
So what's the problem, then? That sounds great - how could any red blooded freedom fighter not like it? Well, the big issue is ID Tech 5
The thing about ID Tech 5 is that it was a fantastic concept for its time, allowing the underpowered PS3 and 360 to have decent looking textures by streaming them from massive single texture files with the idea that they could have unique textures for everything using that, instead of just repeating textures
For console owners, this meant RAGE was one of the better looking games on those platforms
The problem is, PC owners never had an issue with that, and even at the time of release of RAGE most games had generally better texture quality, because the megatexture approach ultimately means a sacrifice of quantity over quality for the sake of keeping file sizes down (not that it does much, since even this game is a whopping 30+ GB)
What this means for The Old Blood is that while the game is perfectly capable of producing beautiful graphics when it's in control of the situation, the moment you start looking around and admiring the scenery you start running into things like this, even on the highest possible settings
http://imgur
com/a/TqWFA Now, these aren't necessarily "bad" textures, they're just underwhelming, and they ultimately completely undermine the purpose of megatextures
The idea is presumably that since everything looks "unique", there's more incentive to look around and admire the scenery due to the added realism
But what's the point if everything you see when you go off the beaten path just looks like it's still using textures that were taken from Doom 3? Nevermind the fact that if you play this game in the stealthy way you inevitably end up spending a lot of time hiding behind walls, giving you plenty of time to notice just how crummy they look (and in the third screenshot with the switchbox, you're frequently forced to stand there in a fixed viewpoint holding the Use key until the door activates, forcing you to look at those textures no matter how you choose to play the game)
And despite the fact that the textures are so underwhelming, the game still has pretty bad performance issues, with people with GTX 970s and high-power processors struggling to meet 60 FPS (which the game is capped at, due to engine limits, from what I'm aware of - which is still rather silly since there are plenty of other engines that go well past made both before and after ID Tech 5)
I personally manage around 40-60 FPS most of the time on a GTX 970 and an i5 3570k OC'd to 4
4 GHz with the game running at the highest settings (pushed a little further, since for some reason even setting the game to Ultra doesn't fully activate some of the graphical functions), which is passable, but doesn't really seem necessary
Ultimately, the graphics in this game aren't anything that couldn't be done more or less in an engine like Unreal 3 or 4 with double the performance, and ID Tech 5 just seems like a total waste that's only still being used because they don't want to admit what a failure it is
Now that we've entered the PS4 and the Xbone generation, these textures aren't even that spectacular by console standards
I don't know what engine I would recommend instead, but anything but ID Tech 5 would be fine by me
In the end, this isn't a negative review, it's more of a rant
The game is still just as fun as it was in The New Order, and if you have the PC to handle it I would absolutely recommend it
But I really, really hate ID Tech 5 and I want it to die
It was awful in RAGE, it was awful in The Evil Within, it was awful in The New Order, and now it's still awful in The Old Blood

												Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is an adventure FPS game, developed by MachineGames, and then published by Bethesda
This game was released in early 2015 for PC, PS4 and Xbox One
It was released as a standalone expansion pack for Wolfenstein: The New Order, which was released in 2014
You play the role of a war veteran by the name of Blazkowicz, also known as B
J
 The game play has almost no changes from the New Order
You play through the game in the first person perspective, as you navigate through levels of Nazi bases, compounds and castles
As with The New Order, you have a health monitor, and armour monitors
You are able to increase these beyond their "Maximum" capacity by going into "Overload" mode, by collecting armour scraps and health packs which are scattered around all of the levels
The Old Blood includes all of the weapons found in the first game, and the return of your trusty pipe
I really enjoyed that this game allows you to take a stealthy approach to a few of the levels if you so desired to; although that's not usually the Wolfenstein way
The badass mechanic of being able to dual wield certain weapons makes a return too, I just love carrying around two assault rifles, there is literally nothing more daunting than that for an enemy I can imagine
 Also as with the New Order, as you progress through the game you will unlock perks as rewards for completing certain challenges, for instance one of the challenges requires you to kill a specific amount of enemies with your assault rifle, once you do, you are rewarded with being able to carry more ammunition for the weapon, I find this to be a really interesting way of being able to upgrade your character without leaving the player to have to do it themselves - and also encourages the player to maybe change their play style a little bit too
The graphics in The Old Blood are identical to The New Order, it's made in the same engine, and the realistic graphics are stunning, sadly though, we still have the same problems with texture poppins
All of the enemy soldiers are really nicely designed; the lighting is perfect throughout the whole game
 The story is a prequel to The New Order, you are sent on a mission to infiltrate Castle Wolfenstein to obtain a document which has the location of General Wilhelm in it
You meet some intriguing characters along the way; one of my favorites would have to be the German brute, Rudi
This game sets up The New Order if you want to play them chronologically, but really I still felt the full effect of the story playing them in the order that they were released
 There is also an element of decision making in some of the scenes too; the games gives you choices as to who lives and who survives as you progress further - something which a lot of FPS games miss
The Old Blood is fully voice acted with the same actors as the original game; you cannot fault any of it, it's just very well done
It was a little bit of a shame when doing a stealth mission that enemy guards don't really pay any attention to any noise you make when moving around though
I found the game to be pretty easy when playing on the medium settings; the hardest level I found to get past, would have to be level one, there is a huge amount of stealth involved, and you have to time everything perfectly or else you just get wrecked
I was quite surprised that they started out on such a high difficulty, but once you get past that level, there isn't any real tough parts to the game, the gun play is simple to get a hang of, and you'll be slaughtering Nazi’s with ease by the last levels
 However, there are options to ramp up the difficulty to absurd amounts, something which people may want to try out if they are FPS veterans
All of the levels in The Old Blood have various ways of traversing and progressing throughout
There are also a large amount of collectibles to find, and plenty of documents, letters, and other little bits of interactive items to discover which adds another level of story and lore to the game
I was also happy to see a couple of Easter eggs included in the game too
You are able to explore pretty much everywhere on most levels, and there is reason to, whether it be for the above mentioned collectables, extra ammo or health packs (because you WILL need them)
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood only took me just under four hours to complete; granted this is a standalone expansion; and isn't actually priced as a full release title, I was still a little unhappy that it was only four hours long
However, there is a lot of replay ability in the fact that you can ramp up the difficulty; and you may even just want to start the game on a higher difficulty since you can always drop it down should you start hitting a brick wall - that may well get you another few hours out of it; and also if you start hunting for the achievements and collectables, you may be able to get around ten hours of content from this game
I had no major technical problems, but even my rig was not able to churn out this game on full settings on a 4k resolution
I dropped it down to 1080 and stuck the settings on full and was able to get a steady 60 FPS most of the time
There were moments where it dropped to around 50 fps in some scenes, however this is to be expected with the quality of graphics and how much it had to render such as water/underwater scenes
 There are a few guides online as to how configure the settings to get the best graphical display in comparison with performance which you should check out, since this game is a demanding one on your rigs
To sum up, I had a lot of fun whilst playing The Old Blood; it does a lot of things right, much like The New Order and I really cannot wait to see what this series has next
The only downside I feel was the length of the story, so if you can pick this game up on sale, you have a real must buy, however I am still going to recommend it because it is just more of the same good stuff from the previous game
FPS fans should not miss out on this series reboot
Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up

												Well Had to beat the whole game in one sitting because when i tried to exit, the game called me a weenie


 in general such an awesome game
10/10

												The Old Blood is a standalone title that is a prequel to the 2014's Wolfenstein: The New Order
It can be considered by some an "expansion pack", but the DL size alone (almost 40 GB)  and fair length for its price point makes it a worthwhile purchase, especially if you enjoyed The New Order
If you're reading this and haven't played TNO, it's perfectly fine to play this first
There are no repeat levels from New Order and its an entirely new experience
On the 3rd highest difficulty (out of 5), it took me 7 hours to complete the main campaign
I did not find all the collectibles, have not touched a challenge mode, and did not complete all Nightmare levels
I reckon I can get 10-20 hours out of this game and even longer if I decide to play on "Uber"
Pros:+ More New Order style gameplay
+ Challenge mode adds replayability
+ Technologically  and artistically sound
Graphics, sound, voice acting, music, are all well done
+ Nightmare levels are a great homage to the roots of the series
+ Level design is smart and encourages exploration
+ Stealth mechanics allow more options than just guns blazing
+ A fair challenge
Excellent FPS mechanics
+ Memorable characters
Cons:- Enemies are samey
- While the stealth approach options are welcome, it lacks some fine tuning
- End boss is kind of cliche and an annoying fight, not b/c of challenge, stylistically speaking
If you have not played/do not own The New Order, I would recommend picking this up in a package deal along with it
TNO is in my top 3 games of 2014 and while I can't see myself ranking this that high for 2015, its a great additional chapter to that story

												Anyone who enjoyed The New Order will absolutely find this worth the US$20 (at launch)
One of the best expandalones I've played
Machine Games definitely understands what makes Wolfenstein great and I have proven the franchise is good hands
			
Posted: 6 May, 2015
												The best standalone expansion I've played since BLOOD DRAGON
An awesome prequel to The New Order that I beat in 7 hours
Some new weapons + the same great gameplay, visuals and awesome characters
THIS is how you do DLC
$20 well spent
9/10 would kill a Nazi robo-dog with a pipe again

 NO: You obviously weren't trying hard enough
Play The New Order again

												The Walking Dead is a story-driven adventure game
Though it feels more like an interactive story, than an actual game, it still got me from the first minute
There is not much gameplay in it, you walk here and there and talk to other people and every now and then you need to make choices (for most of them there is a short time limit)
There are a lot likable (and not so likable) characters
Together with the choices you have to make, it is a thrilling and emotional experience
Highly recommended if you like story-driven games and/or adventures

Posted: 29 November, 2013
												I really have to say this game is almost perfection
I was worried about it going in that it would focus too much on random zombie action and take away from WHY we love the Walking Dead
We like it because it actually has story and character development
Not just random gore
The game is a point and click adventure
If that's not your type of game wait for the crappy FPS coming out soon
(That I'll still probably play
) The timed decisions mechanic is a great move from the developers
Only have seconds to make a split choice really ripens the tension and panic of your situations
On top of that the game has a lot of content
5 full episodes that can be a couple hours each to finish, with different paths and outcomes depending on how your handle things
Every choice you make can affect you way later down the road to similar to the style Mass Effect recently took
If your a fan of the show, comics, zombies in general and like a good game that will challenge your wit and morals, get it
			
Posted: 3 June
												96/100-3 The choices you make doesn't change the ending
This lowers the replay value
It's still a great and unpredictable story
-1 A few too many bugs where people are either levitating or the game freezes for a second
			
Posted: 13 June
10/10Pros  You really fall in love with the art style and dark, industrial setting
Also the lighting is absolutely gorgeous
(seriously, look at those sunsets at The Hound Pits pub)  The map design is brilliant with dozens of optional routes to take and ways to complete objectives
(After playing some missions for the 4th time I was still finding pathways I hadn't taken before)  You're completely free to play how you would like to - never be detected, set off every alarm there is, kill everyone with crazy rat swarms and traumatise a child or keep your hands super clean
Or just completely wing it
 As there are not endless cutscenes and the game is split into missions, it's really replayable
It's fun to try a new playthrough of the game completely different to your last one and I do feel this game should be replayed to fully appreciate the different mechanics and everything the game has to offer
Cons  "SHOULD WE GATHER FOR WHISKEY AND CIGARS TONIGHT?" will drive you insane after the 20th time
 If you don't save often and are going for a stealth, no-kills run, YOU'RE SCREWED
The game can be buggy and the controls can mess up especially when going for non-lethal takedowns
So just save a LOT if you care about the acheivements
 Yeah, the storyline is pretty short but is thankfully made up for in gameplay
Also do me a favour; read notes, listen to audiologs, use the heart on everyone, look through keyholes to overhear conversations
It adds a lot more to the game!

												The bold artistic design, the memorable steampunk world, the awesome open-ended gameplay, the compelling abilities, the colorful characters, and above all, the freedom of choice -- these are the things that mark Dishonored as one of the best remarkable games of recent years
			
Posted: 15 November, 2015
AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Dishonored Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Stealth; Atmospheric; First-Person; Dark; RPG; Action My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-40 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates REVIEWDishonored is a riveting, immersive, and downright pleasurable experience
 Decent graphics with superb artistic direction and a fitting soundtrack set the ambiance
 There is a captivating world to explore, rife with a subtle-but-present wealth of lore and history
 The gameplay can range from stealthy-pacifist style to murderous-warrior style, or somewhere in between; it is easy to find a playstyle that suits your preferences
 There is much to like
The atmosphere of the game is really its heart and soul
 The gameworld is masterfully crafted to be immersive and intriguing as you explore your way through the campaign
 Wandering through side passages and windows, you not only find collectibles and items but also notes and books which provide lore and background information
 This supplements the primary storyline and few sidequests that compose the main narrative
 That narrative being enticing and well-told, although not without a few clichés
The gameplay is structured to offer varying, branching options to choose from as you progress toward your goal
 In each level, there are various paths to take and various ways to take them
You could blow open the front door and slaughter everyone or you can slip through an attic window and never allow your presence to be known
 A lot of games try to offer this, but Dishonored is exceptional in how balanced the gameplay is to truly allow for both stealth and loud options
 It does lean slightly toward stealth, undoubtedly, but you really have a lot of freedom to get creative in how you want to go about each mission
Another premiere aspect of the game, tying together the atmosphere and gameplay, is the evolving gameworld
 Depending on your methods of completing earlier missions, as you get deeper into the campaign the gameworld changes to reflect how your actions have impacted society
 The effects are ultimately rather subtle, but contribute to further highlight the outstanding atmosphere of the game
The various styles of play and mission paths combined with achievements and collectibles make for some good replay value and decent playtime
 If you explore and immerse yourself in the lore, the game can be quite substantial; if you bulldoze through the main campaign, the game can be quite short
 Also the DLC can add a decent amount of content, so the GOTY edition is probably a good bet if you are looking to maximize gameplay hours

												Dishonored is a true memorable game
It does everything right
You have a diverse arsenal of weapons and powers at your disposal in your story of revenge
As Corvo Attano, you put the mask of an assassin in a city tormented by chaos
Your way of dealing with problems will influence the city, since killing will take chaos to new levels or being a pacifist will get you a happy ending
Level design is well thought, so being the good guy is not impossible but rewarding, while being the bad guy is really fun
The chaotic play style is the one where you'll fully enjoy your ablities and their upgrades, but as you progress that way, things get harder, as the game adapts to you to be challenging
Assassinating your targets is fun, but handlling things peacefully is actually more attractive, as you'll deal with fascinating NPC's 
If you'll take your time to explore, you'll get to know an engorssing world
Overall, this game is a gem that deserves everyones attention and while it is kind of short(I didn't wanted it to end) the score of 9
4 does it justice

Posted: 17 March, 2015
												The world of Dishonored is fantastic; it is so rich and well-established by way of in-game books, notes, overheard dialogue and even just little scenes upon which you can stumble
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=303411450 Some people call Corvo, the protagonist, boring and characterless, but what's facinating is the effect that your actions - and by extension, Corvo - has on those around him
People treat you differently by way of subtle changes in speech or tone and the lasting effect on one particular character is nothing short of brilliant
As far as gameplay goes, Dishonored isn't perfect
The stealth mechanics are pretty close to perfect, with leaning around corners, clearly visible alert warnings and a multitude of clever ways to get around without being seen, http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=304088002but it falls apart a bit in the combat
Corvo is heralded as a master of arms, able to 'beat three men at once', as a guard can be heard saying
Ironically, fighting more than one person at a time can be infuriatingly difficult
And that's on moderate settings
Because almost all NPCs use a combination of sword and pistol, you can cross swords only to be shot at point blank range by someone you can't stop, they can kick you; an unblockable attack that deals as much damage as a bullet, or they can just swing their sword as you jump backwards out of range and hit you anyway
Their sword range is about three times the length of their sword and you must block every single hit
The killy death tools are nicely varied, allowing for very stylish kills with grenades, crossbow bolts and shrapnel mines, and that's not even touching on the supernatural powers
Adding them, the game becomes a flowing action of combat adding a clever third dimension to swordplay (at least the way I fight)
Aside from just jumping and teleporting high, time manipulation, rat control and blasts of wind are just some of the tricks you can use
Admittedly, you'll probably find one or two powers that you use more than the others, but the options are there to experiment
While the story can be a bit predictable, it serves as a good framing device to take you across the breadth of Dunwall, killing and stalking people of all kinds
Also all of the cutscenes are skippable for those who want to try speedruns
The DLC is an interesting topic, allowing a new perspective on the story as well as some different powers and amazing sprawling levels
The downside of these slow, stealth-based games is they can be lacking in F**k Yeah moments, but Dishonored makes up for that in lasting enjoyment, http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=304087909replayability and a world that you can be lost in for days

												Dropped 200 feet, stabbed a dude in the neck, survived the fall, slowed time and then blew up other dudes with tanks filled with Whale oil and then summoned a swarm of rats to eat them

												Murders everyone in Dunwall to prove that he didn't murder someone in Dunwall

												Dishonored is a first person stealth action game were you play as Corvo Attano
He is the bodyguard of the Empress of the Isles but you are framed for her murder and now have to become an assassin to seek revenge and save her daughter who was kidnapped in the process
You are freed from prison by the Loyalists who are a resistance group that seek to take the city of Dunwall back
Your first night out you are visited by a mysterious character called The Outsider while you sleep
He burns his mark on your hand and imbues you with special powers to help you through your missions
These missions can be completed in a variety of ways
You can sneak through all the levels without killing anyone or go ahead and kill them all
Why not try a little of both if you feel like it
The only thing is the more you kill the more chaos will ensue
With more chaos you’ll see more rats and more plagued citizens
There are also small side missions you can complete to earn other goodies to help you out
Your weapons consist of a small sword, a crossbow, or your bare hands which can silently take out your enemies or help you in moments of confrontation
Another thing you can do is peek through keyholes to see what may be on the other side which can help you choose how you will accomplish things
You are also given a choice of ten supernatural powers which five are active and five are passive
You will need to find runes to unlock more powers or upgrade them
There are also 40 different bone charms to help enhance your powers or abilities
The supporting cast were well voiced and had many likable and unlikable characters
Everyone was well voiced which always helps add to the immersion
The story was pretty good but I just never really understood what the whole purpose of the Outsider was
I’m not sure if I missed something in the end but I felt all he really did was give you some powers and then never explain why
I also felt a there really wasn’t much to see since most of the game was basically in one area
Overall Dishonored was a great game to play and would love to see a sequel perhaps that may explain more about the Outsider
Maybe even add more missions to flesh the game out some more just not ones that make it feel like it’s just filler
If you haven’t played Dishonored yet then now is the time since the game can be picked up for cheap and it’s worth the money
Bear Rating: 9/10

												Not the most difficult stealth game but perhaps one of coolest


Dishonored is set in a world that resembles Victorian London, but with an odd asortment of technology that looks like it came straight out of a HG Well sci-fi novel: It is somehow familiar and alien at the same time
The visuals are pretty good as is the story, and the game mechanics are easy to pick up
The AI is generally quite good, except for a minor issue with leaning 



basically the AI will not spot you unless you could be seen when not leaning
This means occassionally you can lean around a corner and look someone right in the eyes and they wont see you
Not that this is a big issue because you soon unlock special powers that make 'leaning' seem prosaic
With the addition of magical talismans and very cool gadgets the game does become somewhat easy even on the hardest difficulty, but it somehow manages to remain a lot of fun
The missions are very well done, often allowing many different ways to succeed
You can be the cat burglar or the ghost killer, or maybe you want to possess the minds of men and beast to help gain access to somewhere new? It is up to you
Add to this many different routes in and out of every place and you have the feeling of really being free to do things your way rather than being herded by the gameIn the end, whilst I would not classify it as the greatest stealth game ever made, it is certainly one I recommend to stealth game lovers without any hesitation

												So, it's been a while now, huh? I was a kid when Half-life was released, and of course, I've played it all through, maybe dozen of times
But only now, when I'm at the half-life age myself, with wife, two kids, a job where I need to speak to people ten hours per day


I finally got it
Every day when I don't need to speak seems as a blessing
So, people, cut your jokes about mouthless Gordon
He just choose the right job
But, there is always a price

-I've become deathly paranoid about laboratories
Any time I'm in one, I start checking under the tables for headcrabs

												Half Life is a game that shocked the gaming industry back in 1998
It might've not been the first of its kind, but it was certainly one of the best
The graphics, inferior compared to today's photorealistic games, were still amazing when it came out
You play as Doctor Gordon Freeman, a scientist working for the mysterious Black Mesa corporation
After discovering an alien planet known as Xen, several experiments are conducted to bring back specimens from this new world
As you come to work one day, everything is normal- except for a test involving a teleportation to Xen, and a suspicious man in a suit warning about unforseen consequences
The team ignores this, and it would cost them nearly everything
The experiment fails, and all hell breaks loose as Xen creatures teleport into the Black Mesa facility, killing anyone and anything
You wake up, during the aftermath of this event
Determined to escape, you fight your way through the facility, all the way to Xen
To find out the rest, you have to play the game
And believe me, every single second of this game is worth it

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE 1: Related ContentAlso see my:Half-Life 2 ReviewHalf-Life: Opposing Force ReviewHalf-Life: Blue Shift ReviewBlack Mesa ReviewNOTE 2:I review games to help fellow gamers decide whether they should purchase a game or not
 With that said, although I consider Half-Life as a classical MASTERPIECE and possibly one of the greatest games of all time, I will still list down game mechanics from the past that some people may not enjoy today
Think of it like this: everyone enjoys flying modern-day commercial jets like the 747, but it doesn't mean however that everyone would like to fly in a DC-3 built in the 1940s despite it being labeled as the 'most significant transport aircraft' in history
INTRODUCTION:Half-Life is a narrative-driven linear first-person shooter (FPS) action game and is the debut (and signature) title of Valve
 Hailed as one of the greatest games of all time winning dozens of awards on release, Half-Life revolutionized the FPS genre in a way that no other title has done since Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake
This game has since been the industry standard on how to make a perfect FPS game which combines realistic gameplay, fun puzzles mechanics, a narrative-driven single-player experience with fast-paced multiplayer action
The game follows the story of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist working for the Black Mesa Research Facility that is involved in Weapons Development, Research on Teleportation Technology and occasional cloning of a Security Guard named Barney Calhoun
 When an experiment with an unknown alien crystal results in a catastrophic accident that opened a portal to an alien dimension named 'Xen', Gordon Freeman, wearing the H
E
V
Suit, must now travel across the entire Black Mesa facility to reach the Lambda Complex where he must enter a portal to Xen and kill the creature that is keeping the portal open for the alien invaders
Fight against Invading alien monsters and, at the same time, US Military operatives who are attempting to stop the invasion but is also trying to silence any surviving 'witnesses' of the Black Mesa incident
LEGACY OF HALF-LIFE (PROS):+ First FPS game to fully incorporate a Narrative-Driven story (as opposed to the industry standard of maze gallery shooters which was the Wolfenstein 3D / Doom mechanic)+ Excellent level designs+ Realistic combat mechanics (may be not as realistic now in 2015, but 17 years ago it was)+ Fun puzzles+ Great sound effects+ First FPS game to incorporate scripted sequences for its level transitions rather than cut-scenes+ Relatively advanced AI (back in 1998), with enemies actively dodging, tactically retreating and often times baiting you into an ambush
+ Fun fast-paced multiplayer action that set the foundations for Counter-Strike which started as a mere mod of Half-Life+ Mods; although Half-Life is not the first video game to be modded, it is the first to have several such mods become their own full games that still retain their Half-Life heritage+ Challenging difficulty modes (but this is a given since most old-school shooters were challenging)OLD GAME MECHANICS THAT NEW GENERATION OF GAMERS MAY NOT LIKE (CONS):- Perpetual sprint with optional walking by pressing “Shift” (as opposed to today's standard which is the reverse)- No objective tracker (players may forget what they were doing especially if they haven't played in a while)- Melee weapon needs to be equipped rather than bound to a hotkey (though CS:GO players won't have a problem with this)CONCLUSION:MASTERPIECE is the only word that best describes Half-Life in my opinion
 Although some of its mechanics may not necessarily be applicable in today's (2015) standard, the same can still be considered as part of its charm, much like how most of us still enjoy watching old-school movies and TV shows
WORTH IT?:MUST BUY AND MUST HAVE
I, however, do recommend you purchase the Half-Life Anthology if you already have Half-Life 2 but if you don't have it, get Half-Life Complete
ADDITIONAL INFO (Not necessary for the review):The advent of Half-Life was a turning point in gaming history, most notably, the First-person shooter genre
 Before this game, the only FPS standard to be followed was Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake, with the first two being plotless maze shooters and Quake being the first to implement a backstory but still retained the maze-like levels
With Half-Life, developers saw a potential for FPS games to combine intense action and gunplay with effective narrative story-telling through leniar levels (which is heavily abused by some FPS games today) and realistic game mechanics (a title, which most people agree, was held by the Metal Gear Solid franchise, a third-person action game)Let’s put this in an analogy: Wolfenstein 3D is the Wheel (basically invented the mainstream FPS genre), Doom is the Horse-Drawn Carriage (Doom made FPS games extremely popular, accessible and widespread), Quake is the Steam Engine (Quake bridge the gap between plotless maze shooters and  plot driven FPS games Credit: Steam User RGX12 for pointing this out) and Half-Life is the Ford Model T Car (Half-Life set the standard for modern day FPS games who's basic and essential features still survives today

												An extremely amazing game truly unlike anything I've ever played before
 Valiant Hearts adds a human element to the game that is missing from a lot of these war games that we see and is a fresh break from the whole "Kill kill kill" mindset you need for those games
 The majority of Valiant Hearts is done through puzzles
 The player needs to find ways to navigate around in the game, and do it by using their smarts rather than their trigger fingers
 There are indeed parts where you do attack the enemies (you have to so they don't detect you and end the game), so it isn't just puzzles
 Each of the characters are very likable and have their own unique stories, motivations, and reasons for getting involved in "The Great War" - and the best part is that those reasons, like these characters, are all believable
 Valiant Hearts also does well in capturing the nightmare that was World War I, and does it without graphic depictions of blood, gore and violence that is prevalent in games set in war
 In the final chapter of this game the full scope of exactly how brutal and bloody this whole sordid affair was becomes obvious (there is a part where you have to take cover from machine gun fire by hiding behind solid cover- a few piles of dead soldiers are used this way at one point)
 There are also many very interesting facts this game presents about WWI that most players may not have known, so history buffs and fact lovers are going to be in for some good info
 In my opinion, it is not only good to see a game that is set in WWI when most game studios seem to prefer WWII (perhaps it is because of the "noble cause" of the allies in that conflict), but Valliant Hearts takes both an unflinching and unapologetic look at the first World War and presents something as vile as trench warfare in a manner that is much more palatable than a shoot 'em up sort of game would have been
Just a heads up, though: Valiant Hearts FORCES you to download and install UPlay
 This is a fact that is not READILY visible on the store page unless you have enhanced Steam (which I do not)
 While that fact may not have prevented me from getting this game, I just don't want to HAVE to download a new DRM console every time I get a new game from a different publisher
