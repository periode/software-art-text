The bad.
The aware.
The sleep.
The self-hatred.
The self-esteem can fuck away.
Emptiness creates boundaries.
The only winter tells the worst-case love.

Life.
Night.
Anxiety can get the right death.
The good can tell the emptiness.
The guilty can end the existential.
The alive can hear the world sadness.
The genuine can see the future.
