but probably biased and most importantly very unprofessional review as a friendly advice", "Performance", "- The developers promised that the PC version was being developed in parallel with the other versions and their words seem to hold ground, I am seeing almost limitless settings to choose from and the game performs very good on my rig (i7 4790 + GTX 970) on High-Very High mixed settings", " Surprisingly the Anti-Aliasing can only be set from Off to High, it doesn't specify what you are choosing (FXAA,SMAA), same thing goes for Shadows which can only be set from Very Low to Ultra High, I am not seeing TXAA or PCSS GameWorks and honestly I am glad about it", "You can also customize the HUD Presets where you can turn off the damage numbers for example and generally reduce the amount of feedback you are getting on your screen", "There is love displayed for the PC version and I am very thankful about that :) Controls", "- I am playing as usual using Mouse and Keyboard and the controls seem responsive..", "at least for me, as for controller support I don't know much (since I play almost all my games using M+K) other than there seems to be Xbox controller support...", "as expected I guess", " Gameplay", "- It is the first time Assassin's Creed goes RPG and loot-based (I don't count Unity and Syndicate despite them apprehending some watered down RPG elements) and I can't say if this is good or bad for the series since taste is subjective so you be the judge, however the game hasn't fully departed from its stealth and action-adventure roots", "The previous Ubisoft mechanics are still present, some of them implemented in their own interesting and different but yet familiar way", " For example the horse carriage riding from Assassin's Creed Syndicate is present as a chariot racing minigame, or the drone/owl as your pet eagle etc", " There are some minor bugs and glitches here and there (at least what I have encountered so far) but in my book they are acceptable for a game of this scale and they don't really bother me that much", " However the AI needs some improvement because it can be really dumb sometimes and ruin the immersion for me, also some of the animations are weird and stiff, nothing game breaking but it would be nice if these issues get sorted out with a future patch", " Combat", "- Now this is the biggest change in Origins, the combat has shifted from animation-based system (or unscripted QTE if you will) to a hitbox-based system and I repeat, taste is subjective so whether you will enjoy or hate the new combat system is up to you, but I can tell you this much, it plays and feels better than it looks", " Story", "- Ubisoft over the last few years have been submissive (unfortunately) to a certain demographic and have been delivering some really lame story writing and shoving completely unneccessary modern political beliefs down our throats", " As a result of this, the ''charming and intriguing mystery'' as I like to call it that the previous Assassin's Creed stories built is gone", " I don't use this term often but I cringed through my entire playthrough of Assassin's Creed Syndicate and Watch_Dogs 2, both having the weakest writings in Ubisoft's catalog and their Disney bubbly characters with their over the top forced positivity made me sick, but hey Ubisoft, it's fine...", "you do you", " I brought all that up because in this game they have ditched the Disney part at least, with Bayek being more mature, reliable and interesting than the previous sitcom toddlers Jacob and Marcus, however the rest...", "well I won't go deeper than what you already know and have seen so far on YouTube due to spoiler issues so I will leave that experience and judgement to you", " Graphics", "- Amazing graphics as expected with no downgrades whatsoever, what was shown on E3 is delivered here", " A joy to look at that beautifully rendered draw distance, and the beautiful color palette choice makes this game look absolutely stunning", " Ashraf Ismail and his team have really created the best looking Egypt themed game on the market currently", " Soundtrack", "- I don't think the Assassin's Creed franchise has ever disappointed me in this regard, from trailers to ingame, the music has always been beautiful, eargasmic and most importantly fitting, and Ubisoft has delivered the all said points with this one as well", "Thanks for taking the time to read this review but I would strongly recommend you read more detailed and professional reviews regarding the PC port (benchmarks), check gameplay footage on YouTube to see if the game appeals to your taste and make up your own mind instead of having your opinion swayed by ''game journalism-ing''"], ["Posted: 31 October", "I thought the other reviews were

" XP from kills, loot, ability points for new skills", " Again, nothing too complex but it fits the game well", "Cons- Overall it feels like they played it safe and went for accessibility over complexity", " Like I said before, there's not much new here that we haven't seen", " - Melee combat can be clumsy", " I appreciate that they went away from the Batman style to a more dodge and position based combat system, but it doesn't feel entirely..", " finished", "- Occasional graphics glitches", " I had to restart the game once, and it went away", "- Uplay", " If you've enjoyed other

like the previous one that is available on steam, is not like an hack'n'slash only, but they try to make like some kind of a MMO game", " - The feel of being like playing with real players", " Since they try to create something that ressemble like a real MMO, is pretty impressive that you feel like you're in one even thought you're just playing the singleplayer for the story", " If you get into the game+story like I do, you can threat other npc players as if they were real players", " You'll see many in town, and also in area, you'll see them fight in group", " Of course is not perfect, you can't really choose a topic you want to talk to since they are just AI", " But you can interact with them, and while interacting with them more and more, you can create some kind of bond like a real MMO, that's how you make friend", "- Big and interesting story, like many of bandai namco games such as the tales series, god eater, and even other SAO, you can guarantee that you'll have tons of hours before completing the story (unless you skip the dialogue)- Good amount of customization for your character, some people will say there isn't enough, but I find it pretty cool", " Plus, your clothes change depending on the armor you put", " Sadly sometimes you will feel that the armor name just don't fit on how it look xD", "- Japanese voice, I know there is a huge debate in the anime about dub vs sub, both have their advantage, and everyone can have their own preference", " In my case, I love the japanese voicing more, which you have here", " Is not like many JRPG that you just read...read....read...", "with some few sound like : \"ah\", \"eh\", \"oh\"", " But you actually hear the character speak, which is something I really enjoy from the tales and god eater games", " Since I'm not a big reader, just listening to the voice/reaction and reading the translate, it feel like watching an anime in subs, way more enjoyable then just reading", "- Amazing map, as expected

for a JRPG, I'd say is pretty amazing", " The details on a rock or jumping between branch, you don't feel like much invisible wall", " Of course there will be some invisble wall, like an island surrounded by water, they won't let you start walking on water or swimming for 1 hours non stop", " If you play AW vs SAO, you'll see that the map is gigantic, amazing flight range, you can fly anywhere in one area, the only invisible wall are like the edge of an area", " While in many other game even in some online MMO, you'll feel invisible wall while trying to jump on a rock where your

average killing mobs and visiting place where you can do in many other MMO or other games", "- Not being use to control (since I suppose most people will be using a controller to play this game), the control can be pretty weird at first due to it not being your average hack'n'slash jrpg, but they try to make some kind of MMO", " I use a controller to play this game, and usually MMO are being play with a keyboard and mouse on keyboard", " Some that play MMO with a controller might be more at ease when they first start this game", " On keyboard you have a lots of button which you can set all kind of skills, while on a controller you have to hold button (which is not new) to do some kind of skill, but mostly the select button open you a bar of hotkey", " Now this is where it get a bit rough", " In some JRPG game, we use select a lots in the middle of a battle of course, like god eater where you need to use select to use healing or bullet change", " But in this game, since an MMO usually have a lots of skill, mostly when you advance on class, in here you can have all kind of skill, and there isn't enough button on a controller, so you might be force to press select for other skill + buff + potion", "- Create your kirito", " The cool thing about most of bandai namco JRPG, is that there is voice with the character instead of just reading and hearing some few sound from your character", " The problem here is that, unlike AW vs SAO where you actually see the story of Kirito and his friends, and you can control any premade character, in this game you will be able to custom your character (which should be a pro)", " The thing is you will be kirito, that mean you will be the hero of the story of course", " I'm a girl, so I created a girl character, but in the story, your character will be speaking as kirito, so you'll have a man voice which can be kinda weird xD", " - Bad translate, if you understand at least a few decent word in japanese, you'll notice there is many

see more of their game being imported in the western", " It really depend on you if you want to buy it in full price or on sales, afterall steam sale happen pretty often", " I buy it full price to support the compagny, and because how big the game is compare to many other games, you can see that they put tons of work into it", "Q : Would you recommend this game for someone that never try a JRPG", "A : Probably not SAO : HR to start with due to the fight mechanism being really different then many JRPG, I'll probably suggest to start with the tales one, or AW vs SAO, due to the flight system being really smooth and easy to control even while fighting", "Q : If we don't like the anime, will we enjoy the game", "A : To be fair, is kinda a hard question, I wouldn't say : because you don't like SAO you won't like any other thing related to SAO", " Just like god eater, I started from the game, I was a huge huge huge, a REALLY big fan of god eater, I'm also greatfull I got the chance to meet the creator of god eater as well (THANK YOU BANDAI), but the anime..", "The anime wasn't as enjoyable as I expected", " I loved the character in the game, and I loved the small anime special \"God eater prologue\" that came before God eater the anime", " For SAO, it might be the same thing, just like people loving the VN but hating the anime (but that mostly due to poor adaptation)", " If you love JRPG game, but dislike the anime, you can always try the SAO games, there no harm, except only harming your wallet depending when you buy it", " But I find the game more enjoyable due to me liking the anime + movie + character", " But SAO game are mostly story focus, unlike naruto fighting game, you don't need to watch naruto to enjoy playing a naruto fighting game",

"Although visually and audibly an enjoyable game to play, Last Day of June has a few issues that caused me to not be able to recommend it overall", " The first has to do with the story itself", " The story portrays a tragic car accident very early on in the game (which can be seen in the trailer that was released,) and involves the protagonist survivor Carl going back in time to try to prevent June from dying", " During the game, glimpses of their past is shown that reveal how their relationship was in the years prior to the accident", " Memories of several of the other characters can also be collected as an optional part of gameplay that give additional background on them as well as for Carl and June", " The problem is the lack of most of this background before the accident occurs, apart from a short flashback that briefly introduces the characters and explains why Carl and June decided to go to the dock", " The player knows almost nothing about these characters when June dies, and it's difficult (in my opinion, though some may disagree) to have an emotional response about her death", " Later on in the game, after discovering how their relationship had been before she passed, it's much easier to sympathize with Carl's loss", " However, in my opinion, this occurs too late", " Had the player been able to either see sequences of them interacting in the past in the prologue of the game, or better yet to actually play through scenes that highlight the love that they had for each other, the car accident would have been far more impactful, and the urgency of trying to save her would make the story much more enjoyable to experience", " As it stands, however, the story felt a bit mediocre", "The second was game design decisions that can cause the game to feel a bit irritating", " The biggest offender was the lack of a method to skip cutscenes", " While most of the cutscenes were integral to the story, some of them are inevitably shown multiple times as the player figures out how to progress", " This is essentially the same as an extended loading screen, and can be very frustrating to wait for", " Another design flaw comes from the memory collection system", " This optional part of the game was a plus, as it promoted exploration of the village as well as revealing background information for the involved characters", " The issue was that although backtracking was enabled in the first three chapters, it is suddenly removed without warning once the story proceeds to the fourth chapter", " This causes any player that missed one of the memories for the kid, best friend, or hunter to have to wipe their save and start the game all over in order to be able to collect them", " This could have been prevented by either separating the sections for the memories of the old man from the others, or by giving a warning when the player has found the correct solution for all characters in chapter 3 that they won't be able to go back if they continue on with that choice", " Another decision that the designers made was to limit the sections that the game would be saved", " While the game can certainly be completed in a few short sessions, players that are forced to replay large sections of the game because they had to turn it off just before reaching a checkpoint can find the game a bit annoying", " Finally, the lack of multiple save files to choose from means that players have to wipe their main save every time they want to show a friend how the game looks or to let them play it from the beginning", "Some may argue that the linearity of the game is another problem that this game suffers from", " I disagree, however, as although it is certainly linear, it is not very noticeable unless one plays through the game a second time to collect any missed achievements/trophies, and honestly is fairly typical of games that put a much higher focus on storytelling than on gameplay", " Additionally, some may say that the length of the game is far too short since it can be completed in just a few hours", " Although I do wish it were a bit longer in the case of this story, I have played other games that did not take very long to finish either and enjoyed them quite a bit, so having a short completion time is not necessarily a problem in and of itself", " Finally, some may complain about the artistic style that was used to create the character models", " This shouldn't be a major concern, however, because the trailer and screenshots for the game clearly show this design and does not come as a surprise to anyone that decides to get the game", " Furthermore, they make sense in light of the game being based off of Steven Wilson's song Drive Home, whose music video on YouTube shows a character that looks very similar to Carl", " This last part is not specifically a spoiler and is kept somewhat vague intentionally, but is placed inside spoiler tags in case it is viewed as such", " It is intended to be better understood by those that have already completed the game, and expands a little more on the first paragraph above", "One part of the story that doesn't make much sense is the fact that Carl is alone when he wakes up after the accident", " He's been alone for quite some time as evident by the state of the house", " Why is no one helping him or staying with him", " One could argue that the best friend left, but that is illogical considering her background story as well as the fact that she witnessed the car crash", " The old man obviously cared about him, and even the hunter had a sympathetic side as evident by the last cutscene involving him", " If Carl simply shut them out of his life in his grief, why not clarify that", " It seems like a missed opportunity to not mention it all, and could have even made the ending more moving if it had shown him considering how his final idea would affect the other people in the village, assuming that the story had shown them caring for him rather than just being nonexistent", "In conclusion, I do wish I could rate this as a recommended game, as it is very well done in regards to the beauty of the environment, and the music is enjoyable to listen to as well", " Unfortunately, though, the problems presented in the first 2 paragraphs above are enough of a concern to cause me to not have much desire to share it with friends,

however, surpised me", " Perhaps it has something to do with the well-designed classes that aren't quite as derivative as many Diablo-clones, or the deep levelling system that allows so much variation

The champions and bosses are similarly frequent in appearance, a factor which helps to eliminate that feeling that you're just grinding a way, wasting time until you fight a boss battle", " In saying that, playing this game on single player, I did feel like I was taking part in the occasional grind through enemies and loot and levels, which bordered on tedious at time, but playing with a friend and sharing that burden eliminated that feeling entirely", " On the topic of multiplayer, I felt that it could have been slightly better implimented, in that, for one, it took forever for my friend and I to find each other in the server screen, and there was a bug that occasionally stopped us from adding one another without a full game restart", " Also, unlike the Borderlands games (the pinnacle of intuitive multiplayer connectivity in my opinion), you cannot see what missions your partner has to do, so you're contantly relying on them telling you what they're up to (via text chat, if you don't have steam chat), and if you're more advanced than your partner, then any enemies that you've killed won't reappear for your partner, regardless of who is hosting the server", " Although I'm sure there's a reason for these issues, they seem like really bizarre features to omit from the game", " I mean, sure, you may get a tad overpowered if you're allowed to kill creatures a second time round, but is that really worse than your partner being forced to wade through a sea of emptiness, constantly underpowered due to lack of combat", " In any case, all I can recommend is that you start

the perfect balance of not taking itself too seriously while presenting you with relatable characters in genuinely compelling scenarios", " You can have fun, but still feel invested, and there's

yet another title in a genre as saturated as JRPG (in a series as dense as Tales, no less), the main characters manage to have very distinct personalities and motivations, and are just the right amount of \"morally grey\" to be likable without being obnoxious", " They start off as somewhat standoffish misfits, cooperating only to pursue their personal opportunistic goals, but over time you will see them grow together in a way that is believable", " There's also something deeply satisfying about being able to play as a team of blatant criminals, as opposed to the white knights, royalty, and chosen ones we've grown so tired of", " And beyond that, even the side cast of characters does a great job of complementing and bouncing off of the main cast", " The villains do seem a bit one dimensional, and I fear the \"big bad\" twist is going to end up being predictable, but it's a small bump on an otherwise fantastic journey", " Final note on this - the themes and the tones are

segment is the perfect length (some Tales games have ones that drag on ENTIRELY too long, not the case here), and you will periodically unlock new mechanics to keep the gameplay fresh", " You will actually acquire all the party members pretty early on in the game, although this is preferable due to how the equipment mastery system works", "- Great customization options", " The arte pools are huge, and the trees are fully customizable", " I've used Velvet almost exclusively for the first 60 hours, but I can tell there is still plenty to unlock for her and the rest of the cast seems to have their own fun, unique playstyles as well", " Because of how fast paced the combat is, I don't find myself switching primary fighters as much as previous Tales games, but Berseria actually makes it even easier by allowing you to swap mid-battle, mid-combo", " Lots of fashion options, lots of equipment flavors, and a mastery system that makes it fairly compelling to keep different sets of equipment around (and tweak until your playstyle is content)", "- The world map is expansive, but the areas can be a bit samey, and the puzzles are definitely nothing groundbreaking", " Pretty middle of the road for JRPG, so just don't expect anything impressive there", " I find myself constantly looking back to Symphonia as the holy grail of Tales world maps, as I've yet to see that one be

difficulty [Normal]", "(Go hard if you would like more of a challenge) -Story rich (Can drag on a bit at the beginning but it's getting really epic and interesting once you are hooked)-It's quite linear but you have time to discover various places and towns (You have your freedoms) -No prior knowledge needed (Trails in the Sky or the other titles - Just light references) -Great and illustre characters and character development-Motivating to deepen the bonds (Similar to Persona) -Almost every character (NPCs included) has his/her own story -A lot to do (amsuing sidequests, minigames, discovering and collecting various stuff)-Average graphics in general-A lot of love put into details, characters and environment -Graphics are still way better compared to PS3", "-A lot of improvements over the PS3 version like higher resolutions, higher frame rates (60 FPS), depth of field, shadows and so forth-Really great OST which is underlining situations and the mood greatly (Still listening to them from time to time)Playtime: Between at least 80 hours and 120+ (Average for my first time was around 110 - PS3)-It's the first game of a trilogy -ToCS II will come later to

from games like Trails in the Sky FC/SC/TC and Persona At best I would say it's a mix of the previous Trails in the Sky and \"Persona\" in general -It's a mix because like in Persona you have your

of them individually (Pretty similar to Persona)The rest of the game is how you know it from Trails in the Sky -A lot of text-based conversations with spoken dialogues (way above average RPGs)-A lot of details put into the story, the chraracters, background information and collectibles-A lot of different things to do (next to the main story) like fishing, playing cards, quests and so forth", "The

girl who has inherited her father's item shop which serves the local townsfolk with equipment for their day-to-day use and more importantly, stuff to go a-dungeon-crawling with", " You also have a guardian of sorts (who also turns out to be a debt collector too) who's a fairy", " Well, this is a Japanese game - 'nuff said", " The relevance of this is that Recette (you) have also inherted some burden of debt too, who naturally you owe to your ward", " So, the crux of the game is to run the shop, and earn enough each day to enable you to pay off your monthly debt payment", "I know, that might sound a little boring, but it isn't", " It's actually where the game really shines", " Your day is divided up into a maximum of 4 sections, which you can \"spend\" by either visiting town for certain things, visit the adventurer's guild (more on that later), or open the shop", " Your shop has certain shelf spaces laid out, and arranging the stock so your best stuff is visible from the window is an essential trick", " Put the boring, common and cheap items in the window and you'll attract less passers-by", " Put the really expensive stuff in the window and you'll also attract less passers-by", " It's a balancing act", "Once customers come in, they'll flit around looking, and approach you with items they want to buy from the shelves", " As with any real-world store, the trick is to maximize profit, while retaining custom", " So, sell higher than you bought it, but low enough so they don't get annoyed and never return - another balancing act", " Some customers will ask for certain special orders in advance, which you almost always never have the stock at the time to fulfil, so you make a gamble on whether you can acquire the stock they're asking for - accept and fail, and they'll get annoyed, but refuse and they'll get annoyed too", " You can't please everyone..", "So where does the stock come from", " This is where the adventurer's guild and the dungeon crawling comes in", " Instead of opening the store, you can toddle off to the adventurer's guild where all the adventurers hang out", " You can recruit them, for a fee to go and dungeon crawl with you", "There's a great element of risk/reward here, as at the end of each level, you can choose to duck out with the loot, or proceed onwards with the chance of more and better loot, but with the added risk of costly failure", " As Recette, doesn't fight (well, she's only a girl), you take the role of the adventurer here", " Her role is to tag along and store your part of the loot", "So, you fight, you level up your adventurers, you gain better loot to sell for better prices, you get money to pay off your increasing debt, and so on", "There's also some added little nuances such as it being wise to look after the adventurers you are hiring by selling them stuff cheap when they visit your store, as they'll use that stuff when crawling the not-so-murky depths", " As the game progresses, you'll need to get a bit inventive in how you manage your stock and customers, but I won't elaborate on that as that would be spoiling things", "It's not an easy game to describe, and it probably sounds a bit dry on the face of it, but if you like the straight up old-school action-RPG dungeon crawler, I wouldn't hesitate to grab this - it does that part of it very well, but the light startegy side of shop management and how it dovetails so very, very nicely is what makes this game utterly unique", " I can't recommend it highly enough", "So I have no hesitation in saying this is easily worth \u00a315 on my value-for-money scale"], ["Posted: 25 November, 2013", "You think this is a cute little game about running an item shop and having fun, but it's not", " It's a game about crippling debt and trying your hardest to claw your way out of it", " The bank comes to your house and tells you that your dumb deadbeat dad is probably dead, and that they're going to repo your house", " Instead of making you homeless, the bank fairy just turns you into a slave and turns your house into an item shop (because zoning regulations and child labor laws don't exist here) and you spend the rest of the game trying to make payments to buy your freedom", " Fun game, but god help you if your hustle isn't strong enough", " Would not recommend to the capitalistically weak"], ["Posted: 20 October, 2014", "Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is, without exaggeration, my favorite game of all time", " The art and characters are absolutely adorable, the protagonist is even more so, and the gameplay is incredibly addictive", " You not only get to spend plenty of time squeezing every last possible cent out of your customers, you get enormous dungeons to go adventuring through and plenty of amazing spoils to bring back to the surface, craft into amazing items, and sell right back to the adventurer who helped you acquire them", " And once you pay off your loan, you unlock Endless Mode and get to finish exploring those dungeons and becoming a billionaire", " I have 225 hours of this game under my belt, and I STILL haven't finished finding every item in the game", " The plot(that is, the plot that isn't related to your loan - yes, there's more", ") is definitely fun, although you won't be able to see the whole thing during your first story mode, but since Endless Mode allows you to pick up right where you left off, it's not a problem", "Basically, what I'm getting at is that Recettear is an amazing game, I love it, and you probably will too", " Base price for hours of entertainment", " It's a bargain", " Capitalism, ho"], ["Posted: 4 January, 2015", "My good friend Louie found an interesting taiyaki and sold it to me for 500 pix", " At the end of the day he was hungry and bought the same taiyaki for 2000 pix", " I think I understand how life works now"], ["Posted: 24 October, 2014", "Oh god I'm such a scumbag I just sold a candy to a little girl for several hundred dollars"], ["Posted: 25 November, 2013", "A mix of Shop Economic simulator, old-school hack'n'slash JRPG and a Visual Novel", " Pretty awesome if you like these kind of things"], ["Posted: 1 January, 2014", "Download the demo before you buy it", " You will learn everything you need to know about the game from it"], ["Posted: 24 December, 2013", "God damn I don't even know what I'm doing, but I like it"]]}]}
