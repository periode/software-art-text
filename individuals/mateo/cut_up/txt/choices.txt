This game is simply amazing
 I'm a long time fan of Steven Wilson (of Porcupine Tree fame but actually better as a solo musician in my opinion) so a video game based on one of his best songs and videos was a dream come true and it didn't disappoint
 "Drive Home" was touching and the video was visually stunning and this is also true to this game
 The watercolor-like visuals are smooth and manage to be soothing and melancholic at the sime time
 Steven Wilson's music here is mainly instrumental versions from his solo albums and it works effortlessly as a soundtrack
 The story of the game is mainly stripped down to pure emotions and although simplistic, the raw emotions of the experience are more than enough to keep you intrigued
 So, a basic summary of all the good things here: - Simple and touching story- Great and emotive music sells the feelings- Stunning visuals will suck you in

This game is incredible
 The sheer aesthetic and emotional beauty of the story is breathtaking
 Its simplicity is just one of the things that makes it so enjoyable
 There are options, but not too many
 You'll find yourself going back and forth between characters as you try to lay the foundations in an attempt to achieve a more favorable outcome, but not so much that it gets irritating
 The story will keep you going, pushing toward an ending you wish for - whether you get that or not, I won't reveal, because the beauty of this is the unsurity of what, if anything, you can change
 The music throughout sets the mood wonderfully, and the soundtrack is something I would buy in its own right
 It took me 4
6 hours to complete the game - granted some of that time was chasing my unruly pup away from my mouse lead - but I feel the game is worth the money
 I highly reccommend it
 It really is a thing of beauty

The first time I heard about "Last Day Of June" was a few months ago while reading about and waiting for the newest Steven Wilson's album; at that point I couldn't but wander about: what could offer as a whole a videogame where Steven Wilson is involved
He once told not being the kind of videogames-interested person and almost neglected the idea of ever participating into them
But, content-wise, aren't his songs the kind of emotional stories with all of the necessary elements to develop a proper history and turn them into something else, besides the music and lyrics themselves
 That's what they did with the song "Drive Home" (from the 2013 album "The Raven That Refused To Sing - And Other Stories") in order to bring "Last Day Of June" to life
If you're the kind of person who's really into music, if you're someone who would take its time appart with the sole purpose of enjoying a new album, and, literaly listening to it, you'll easily catch what this game is about
PROS:- Catchy
- Emotional
- Atmospheric
- Trippy
- Really colourful
- Music by Steven Wilson
CONS:- Kleenex tissues not included
- A little bit repetitive in some parts

Short and sweet
 It's a bit repetitive - because of how the story is told, granted - but since you can't skip cutscenes it can get a bit tedious when you have to see some of them over and over again
 The game is really short either way though, so it's no big deal
 I liked it
 It's very easy, you will have no hurdles to overcome, but it's just an interactive story after all
 Well-told, without any dialogue; only by gestures and mumbled voices
 The visuals are simple but beautiful, and the music is fantastic - which comes to no surprise if you enjoy Steven Wilson's work, of which this game is based upon
 I recommend it if you're looking for a short, but good, story-driven experience
 The value comes down to how much you're willing to spend for a few hours of story

This game is immensely emotional
 Don't expect to play it without crying
The artwork is gorgeous and nothing needs to be said about Steven Wilson's music - as a huge fan I already knew what I was getting myself into
 even his music videos can make me cry
I think it's fantastic how the faces are drawn - every character is uniquely identifiable by a particular trait but because all of them are "faceless" it's easy to empathise with them; put yourself in their shoes if you will
 Each character has their own (sad) backstory so there's something for everyone who's been down and out in life
 This makes the game so much more relatable and emotional, especially if one has been through emotional trauma
A game about experiencing life, loving and letting go
 sometimes this is just what we need given the stresses of modern life
 It's absolutely worth the money
One gripe though: if you don't get all the achievements in one playthrough it seems like the game forces you to restart at the end which can make it tedious

Highly recommendedGood Story, love the artI cried even more on the neighbor (the girl) than the main character (you will know when you play it)The only problem is the game mechanic that sometime frustrated as you have to watch all the cutscenes all over again if you fail the combination (no skip button)
 Plus the game starts to crash every 10 minutes when approaching the last chapter (the old man)
 Crash 5 times before I get into the ending
 Other than that, no problems
Please watch until the credit roll (Hence, the achievement said 'wait for it')7
5/10Recommended
P/S It is coincidence that the game release when Muslim celebrating Eid al-Adha which is emphasize more on sacrifice for the love one
 Perfect time to release the game

Last Day of June is a good game
So why I don't recommend it 
 First : it's short
 You'll end the story in two hours, maybe less, a bit longer if you want to complete it 100%
 I usually don't mind shorts games, but this one is
 Well
 It's a bit of a puzzle game, where you switch character to solve a problem
 But it's too easy, too quick
 When you start thinking it can give some nice puzzle, it's already over
 I was expecting at least four hours of actual game, and it's not even it
Second : It's not challenging
 I understand the game is supposed to be mostly a story you're being tell, but
 There's no real puzzle
 Everything is too obvious, you almost get the answer before the problem is even there
 I think it's a problem
 I could talk about the price and the actual content, but hey
 It's a good game, the story is nice (but kind of obvious too), but it's really little
 I think the main problem is a lack of ambition
 This game has a nice artistic view, it has nice details, but they're not used
 And I even feel one of the character is underused
 That shouldn't happen in such a short game
 TL;DR : Game is cool, but underexploited
Posted: 6 September
I've played video games for the majority of my 30 years of existence
 Occasionally you'll find that game that is so far exceeds your expectations
 That leaves you mouth gaping and unable to stop thinking about it, even hours after you're done
Last Day of June is one of those games
 The one that spoke to me
 The one that's mechanics intrigued me, that challenged me, that made me slowlly take my time and try to savor each scene
Although it may have it's own flaws, when it stands strong and proud it outshines any gripe I may have had
 The story takes twists that I didn't see coming, made me care and connect with clay people with no eyes -- the same ones who display some of the best traits and signs of emotion
If you are even remotely interested in this game, turn away from this review now
 Don't read anything else
 Put on some headphones, turn down the lights and just let this short (~4
5 hour game) make you run the gamut of emotions
Last Day of June tells a complex story but one that doesn't leave pointless ends loose or show any sign of being pretentious or "heady"
 I can honestly say, from the bottom of my heart, this game is a top 3 and candidate for GOTY
 To say that in 2017 should speak words for itself
Last Day of June is a masterpiece and one that should be played by all
Posted: 12 October
Although visually and audibly an enjoyable game to play, Last Day of June has a few issues that caused me to not be able to recommend it overall
 The first has to do with the story itself
 The story portrays a tragic car accident very early on in the game (which can be seen in the trailer that was released,) and involves the protagonist survivor Carl going back in time to try to prevent June from dying
 During the game, glimpses of their past is shown that reveal how their relationship was in the years prior to the accident
 Memories of several of the other characters can also be collected as an optional part of gameplay that give additional background on them as well as for Carl and June
 The problem is the lack of most of this background before the accident occurs, apart from a short flashback that briefly introduces the characters and explains why Carl and June decided to go to the dock
 The player knows almost nothing about these characters when June dies, and it's difficult (in my opinion, though some may disagree) to have an emotional response about her death
 Later on in the game, after discovering how their relationship had been before she passed, it's much easier to sympathize with Carl's loss
 However, in my opinion, this occurs too late
 Had the player been able to either see sequences of them interacting in the past in the prologue of the game, or better yet to actually play through scenes that highlight the love that they had for each other, the car accident would have been far more impactful, and the urgency of trying to save her would make the story much more enjoyable to experience
 As it stands, however, the story felt a bit mediocre
The second was game design decisions that can cause the game to feel a bit irritating
 The biggest offender was the lack of a method to skip cutscenes
 While most of the cutscenes were integral to the story, some of them are inevitably shown multiple times as the player figures out how to progress
 This is essentially the same as an extended loading screen, and can be very frustrating to wait for
 Another design flaw comes from the memory collection system
 This optional part of the game was a plus, as it promoted exploration of the village as well as revealing background information for the involved characters
 The issue was that although backtracking was enabled in the first three chapters, it is suddenly removed without warning once the story proceeds to the fourth chapter
 This causes any player that missed one of the memories for the kid, best friend, or hunter to have to wipe their save and start the game all over in order to be able to collect them
 This could have been prevented by either separating the sections for the memories of the old man from the others, or by giving a warning when the player has found the correct solution for all characters in chapter 3 that they won't be able to go back if they continue on with that choice
 Another decision that the designers made was to limit the sections that the game would be saved
 While the game can certainly be completed in a few short sessions, players that are forced to replay large sections of the game because they had to turn it off just before reaching a checkpoint can find the game a bit annoying
 Finally, the lack of multiple save files to choose from means that players have to wipe their main save every time they want to show a friend how the game looks or to let them play it from the beginning
Some may argue that the linearity of the game is another problem that this game suffers from
 I disagree, however, as although it is certainly linear, it is not very noticeable unless one plays through the game a second time to collect any missed achievements/trophies, and honestly is fairly typical of games that put a much higher focus on storytelling than on gameplay
 Additionally, some may say that the length of the game is far too short since it can be completed in just a few hours
 Although I do wish it were a bit longer in the case of this story, I have played other games that did not take very long to finish either and enjoyed them quite a bit, so having a short completion time is not necessarily a problem in and of itself
 Finally, some may complain about the artistic style that was used to create the character models
 This shouldn't be a major concern, however, because the trailer and screenshots for the game clearly show this design and does not come as a surprise to anyone that decides to get the game
 Furthermore, they make sense in light of the game being based off of Steven Wilson's song Drive Home, whose music video on YouTube shows a character that looks very similar to Carl
 This last part is not specifically a spoiler and is kept somewhat vague intentionally, but is placed inside spoiler tags in case it is viewed as such
 It is intended to be better understood by those that have already completed the game, and expands a little more on the first paragraph above
One part of the story that doesn't make much sense is the fact that Carl is alone when he wakes up after the accident
 He's been alone for quite some time as evident by the state of the house
 Why is no one helping him or staying with him
 One could argue that the best friend left, but that is illogical considering her background story as well as the fact that she witnessed the car crash
 The old man obviously cared about him, and even the hunter had a sympathetic side as evident by the last cutscene involving him
 If Carl simply shut them out of his life in his grief, why not clarify that
 It seems like a missed opportunity to not mention it all, and could have even made the ending more moving if it had shown him considering how his final idea would affect the other people in the village, assuming that the story had shown them caring for him rather than just being nonexistent
In conclusion, I do wish I could rate this as a recommended game, as it is very well done in regards to the beauty of the environment, and the music is enjoyable to listen to as well
 Unfortunately, though, the problems presented in the first 2 paragraphs above are enough of a concern to cause me to not have much desire to share it with friends, and should be kept in mind in contrast to those that reviewed the game positively here when considering whether to acquire this game or not

For three or four days now, I have played nothing but "This War of Mine"
 I am a veteran of Iraq and I remember all too well the hardships it brought upon the civilians, especially in the beginning of the war
 I remember being heartbroken at the sight of children crying and begging for food on the side of the road
This "game" puts you square in the middle of the experiences of those civilians
 It is a brutal, kill or be killed world - where an act of unimaginable violence may let you live another day, but it can also break your heart and soul
 Some days, you are offered a chance at compassion - and if you take that chance, risking your own safety and resources for others, you may find you feel a bit better about yourself
Then there are the times where you are stuck between a rock and a hard place
 You are unarmed, scavenging for anything to save your friends, and you peep through a keyhole and see a soldier brutally beating - and possible worse - a woman
 He has an AK-47, you have a lockpick and a rumbling stomach
 So you sit there and watch - afraid that any noise may turn his violent attention upon you
 When it is all done, you hide until he leaves and then, shamefully, pick over the bloodied body of the woman for anything she may have scavenged before the soldier got to her
This is "This War of Mine" - a dark, beautiful, haunting, exhilerating, and horrible tale
What's that tagline, "The first casualty of war is innocence"
 It applies here - in a way you would have never imagined coming from a computer game

Entered a building with other people
The building's description
had said "Danger" which ment hostiles
 Bandits
I grabbed my knife and was ready for those bandits
I saw one bandit and after breaking in through a window, she ran calling for backup
One guy showed up with a shotgun and chased me off but I waited
He searched, and couldn't find me and then I got the drop on him
We fought, he couldn't shoot, and three stabs later he fell
I grabbed the shotgun and went inside
 My friends needed food, and these bandits were killers
 They deserved what they got
I grabbed food, supplies, and another bandit showed up
I fired at them with the shotgun, and they dropped with a gurgling scream
One bandit ran after me
 Surely they had a knife
No
 she ran past me to the man's corpse
She was crying
 She called me a murderer
I fired again and she dropped
There was silence then, and I had to hurry up and grab the rest of the supplies before more bandits showed up
I opened a closet, and snagged the food
But, the inventory of the closet said "Private"Someone owned this wardrobe
 I looked outside toward the other building, and between the two
 a garden someone built
One guy had mentioned they were running low on meds
This
 no
 it couldn't be
 It just couldn't be
This wasn't
 this wasn't an abandoned building being picked clean
This was another group's safehouse
These people are
 were
 survivors
and "I" was the bandit

This is an INCREDIBLE game
 It was recommended to me by a close friend because, me being a former war refugee from the Balkans, he thought I might find the content "a bit familiar
" It went a bit further than that, in fact it kind turned out to be some uncanny early-childhood simulator for me
 I still remember the visceral terror of being a child in that war; I will never forget howling and begging my mother not to go outside to buy bread, out of fear that she would be shot dead by a sniper
 Asking why my grandmother couldn't go instead
This game captures moments like that with a masterful hand
 It is never heavy or hamfisted
 I can't explain how well the developers have encapsulated the hoplessness and the mundane brutality of the Balkan civil war, and it leads me to think that at least one key person involved in the development of this game had to have lived through it, too
 The tone is just perfect, striking that difficult balance between terror and absurdity, and reminds me of all the films I love that came out of Former Yugoslavia after the war
 This is not Angelina Jolie painting Balkan politics with a broad brush dipped in ignorance and a skewed western perspective insensitive of nuance--this is an authentic work of art that is sensitive to the complexities of its subject matter and the individual stories of the thousands of people whose lives were shaped and altered forever by this horrible, unnecessary war
 It's an emotional playthrough, even for people who haven't had any experience with the historical event
 It is a "war game" like no other and I can't recommend it enough
 Take it from someone who was there

This game shows a bad side of war, the dark one
 It shows war from the citizen perspective
 We start surviving with 3 or 4 chosen characters (first we have only one group and we unlock next people by surviving next days)
 The group lives in an emptied house
 The supplies we find in the hideout run out very quickly
 So what to do
Stealing means surviving the next day or two
 We start hiding in shadows and sneaking
 And now comes a very hard choice: what about killing
 I played two times
 First time, i got into pensioners house
 They potted me and ran up to the door
 My friends were starving
 I had no choice
 I attacked the man with fists
 He died after two hits in the head
 Woman ran into the toilet and locked the door
 I took away their food and left the house
 I remember this particular moment all the time
 In "This War of Mine" there i as lot of choices
 Is killing and stealing in order to get some food morally better then starving
 Who
are we decide upon other people's lives
 Is there anything cheerful about the war we see in first person shooters

"War is hell"This game is not about a soldier who destroyes the whole army
This game is not about a massive cool looking war
This game is about people like you and me,surviving in hell named war

Send Katia to scavenge the ‘Quite House’
The preview says it has food and meds and isn’t dangerous
Sounds like a good shout
Turns out it was just an old couple living there, doing their thing
Walk into house
Old man begs me not to take their stuff coz his wife is sick
Feel bad
Take their stuff anyway
Go home
 Now Katia is depressed coz she robbed the old couple
Try to get Emilia to comfort her
Emilia is s*** at comforting
Katia is suicidal
I feel really bad
Decide to go back and try to return their stuff
Maybe I can give them this diamond I found
Go back to the Quite House
Can’t find old couple
Go upstairs
Old couple is dead
Quit game
Sit in corner contemplating what I’ve done

I'm 5 hours in, and that's a straight 5 hours
 Most survival games I've played are either pretty forgiving, or shallow in character
This one is neither
 In the beginning of my hours I was hopeful and treated others I met with the same kidness I normally would, as the going was good
 I shared my supplies, and took in others that needed shelter
 Food was used daily and luxuries were built
36 days later (and still going) the survivors that are left are battered men; hungry, sick and tired
 We've had to kill to survive, even innocent people, because the only other option was our own death
 We have stolen and traded our way through the cold-snap, and the outlook is grim
All that matters now is lasting the few days until outside aid arrives
 But in the end, will that really matter
 We're not the same people we started as, and the atrocities we've commited are ones we have to live with forever
I highly reccomend this game, but be warned: Your decisions WILL have severe consequences, you WILL hate yourself for the evils you have done, necissary as they may feel
 You will learn to know the survivors, what things they find acceptable, who can talk to whom best
 Most of all you will think "Maybe next run, I can do things differently
"
 I know I am at this point, as it looks like my first run will end in failure and misery
10/10, am now broken, tired and hungry IRL
 Soundtrack matches the atmosphere, graphics are a little jarring at first but become normal after a little bit
 Gameplay is solid and needs very little introduction, and you will want to think your decisions through a few times
 It all matters in the end

Day 21: It's been three weeks since we moved into this bombed-out house we've come to call home
 Three weeks since I last saw any members of my family; two since my last hot meal; one since Katia was gunned down scavenging for food and medicine
 Bruno hasn't fared well
 The illness is no longer confined to his body – now his soul is sick, broken
 The snows have come, and we're feeding the heater every day now
 I wept when we burned our only two books
 Bruno scoffed
 “They're children's books,” he muttered from his sick bed
 “It's not as if we read them
” He didn't bother asking whose books they had been
Day 25: I scavenged last night
 We're both starving
 I remembered a house, untouched by the violence
 I had come weeks earlier in the hopes of getting supplies only to find it occupied by an old couple
 living as they had before war came
 They reminded me of my grandparents, and I left
 Katia and Bruno had not been happy, and we did not eat that night
 I returned this evening in the hopes that they had fled
 or worse, shamefully
 But they had not
 The old man struggled, wouldn't let me steal his wife's medicine

10 hours in review: I hate this game
I am a completionist
 I mostly play RPGs and strategy games
 I like to win, so my gaming style primarily involves achieving goals, expanding my powerbase, meeting my targets, improving my strength, all of which to end in a smashing victory
This War of Mine offers very little and frequently none of these things
 The gameplay is inherently simple
 You have a few survivors in a badly damaged house
 During the day they can do simple tasks, like building furniture, patching a hole in the wall or something else to help you survive, cooking meals, distilling hooch, or resting from nightly activities
 During the night one person can go out to scavenge for badly needed supplies, while the rest sleeps (hopefully in a bed) or stands guard, hoping you won't get raided during the night
Rather than adding and expanding, the game constantly offers straightforward but difficult choices
 Does the scavenger bring home raw materials today so somebody can patch a hole in the wall, or does he bring medication in case somebody gets sick or wounded
 Do I risk life and limb to steal from armed bandits or inflict myself with moral guilt stealing from the defenseless elderly
 Do I give my last piece of food to the wounded guy who has to stand guard tonight or to the sick man on the bed
 Do I trade away my last bandages while nobody's wounded so we can all eat tomorrow
 There's no do-overs either so I am stuck with my choices
 Beyond just restarting the entire story of course
This is what makes This War of Mine so damn good
Every day in the game, it's one bad choice or another, all for the sake of staving off immediate disaster
 For one more day
 For the sake of survival
 For the hope that things will be a little bit better tomorrow, if only you can get through the problems right now
 Can you survive without resorting to theft
 If you can't, who do you steal from, how much do you risk in the process
 What about murder, when does that get justified by survival
If as a player you do not get upset by stealing or murdering for the sake of your group of survivors, then your survivors will
 They get sad and depressed, even suicidal, from committing atrocities
 Morale is an important part of the game, and the horrorific actions you commit to in the name of surviving are as relevant as the ones that are inflicted upon you
 Maybe even moreso
Because war is horrible and this glimpse of what living in a warzone is like, just so
 It is atrocious
 It is insecure
 It comes with the realization that while this game has plenty abstractions, these stories are real
 There are people who have lived through this
 Who are trying to live through it in the world today
 Who probably will be trying to live through it in the future
Who only want to survive
 Just one more day
 Maybe tomorrow will be better
I have to stop writing now
 Marko is sick, but he's the only one who is uninjured after last night when bandits tried to raid our shelter again
 We have some rat meat left over so I'd best cook him a meal
 Maybe he'll finally find some medicine tonight
 Hopefully the trader will come by today, we have a few bottles of moonshine ready
 If not, I might drink it
 All of it
 Who am I kidding
 Tomorrow won't be better
 Things will only get worse

The Witcher 3: Honest ReviewMonsters
Posted: 25 June
I am 75 years old and really enjoyed this game
 In this game I could do all the things I was once able to do but in my twilight years can no longer do
 There should be more games like this for us seniors
 The graphics were exellent
 I very much dislike and dismiss the cartoon type graphics in most other games
 The visual aspects of the game were superb, realistic and sometimes even breathtaking
 The attention given to detail needs to be congratulated
 The storyline was only just satisfactory but this was complemented by all the interesting charecters involved
 Please continue to amaze us gamers with your excellent work
Posted: 6 June, 2015
The best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and second part of The Witcher
 You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better
- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,- Story, which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something what makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which makes from every single battle - an unforgettable memory,- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally something dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his misery
The Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions)
 Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them
All in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade)
Posted: 8 June
Ignore me having 8 hours on this account, I finished the game twice and have 100+ hours on this game
QualityRatingReasonPerformance8
5/10You need a great PC to be able to run this game at maxed graphics, I got a steady 60 FPS on all ultra settings, with the occasional drop in the capital
Controls9/10Controls using a keyboard and mouse is weird, I had to get used to it
 Once you've learned the controls it feels natural though, it's not like there's any inconvenient keymapping
 I still recommend using a controller since it's a hell of a lot easier
 (I didn't use a controller since I'm not comfortable with it, it was still fine for me)
Ultility7/10Playable only on Windows
GameplayRatingReasonChallenge9
5/10If you play this game on easy, it's a walk in the park, you destroy everything you see, and Geralt is some sort of God who almost can't be killed
 On Death March however, everything else is a god and it's so hard to get further in the game
 I found this the most fun experience, for a reference; On Death March enemies have 80% more health and do 230% more damage, also you only gain 80% experience from everything whilst on this difficulty
Content10/10A big open world, with a lot of things to do, hours upon hours of content after you've finished the main story
 Side quests, collectibles, bounties, amazing DLC (some free some paid for)
 One of the few developers that give free DLC that aren't just reskins or anything, but actual quests
 Big + on CD PROJEKT RED for this Story10/10I compare stories like this with other amazing storylines like The Last Of Us, it doesn't even get close to how good the story of The Witcher is
 Such an indept story, amazing eye for detail, and I really got involved in the characters
Diversity10/10The main story gives you a whole lot to do, exploring the entire world, even going back to Kaer Morhen
 Whilst all the side activities give you even more to do (as I've said with content) all the bounties, collectibles, quests for armour, quests to help strangers, ''random'' events and DLC, you'll be busy for quite some time
DesignRatingReasonGraphics10/10The graphics are insane, I can't describe how good like they are, I suggest you search for some video's just reviewing the graphics if you really want to get an indept view of it, all I can say is that this game will be pleasant to watch / play
Sound10/10Amazing voice acting, amazing music, amazing ambient sounds
 Everything is just amazing really
 Great music whilst in combat as well, makes me want to keep dodging the enemy so the music doesn't stop, it really puts you in the right mood for this game
Mapping9
9/10I wish I could give this a 10, but it's really hard to call something perfect, but there's always little flaws with something like mapping, if I really wanted to start nit picking on them
 But the world of Witcher is amazing, it feels alive and even though it's a really big world, there's little details everywhere
Interface10/10The interface is solid, it looks great, and does what it's suppose to
 Not really anything else to add there
Final Score: 10/10Don't let the score fool you, it's not perfect, nothing is
 Yet this game is at the same time
 I love it, 99% of the people who played it love it

Take note game developers and publishers, this is how you make a great game make tons of money and have a positive relationship with your customer base at the same time
- No microtransactions- No virtual currencies- No lootboxes10/10 CD projekt red will have my business for some time to come =-)

So we got a game in 2015, the complaint of which for many people was overwhelming contentWe got a DLC for the game in 2015 which was better than all the games in the yearWe got a DLC for the game in 2016 which was better and had more content than most games in the yearThe base game and DLC together costed less than most AAA games of the yearA game that had an artistic vision, a game that wanted to push boundaries in terms of narrative and choice/consequence based decision making in a living and breathing open world, with characters that are memorable and relatable
 A game whose developers knew what gamers wanted
 WItcher 3 has launched CDPR into the league of great developers like Looking Glass, Rockstar, Valve, old-Bioware etc
 My only complain with this game is that it made other modern games feel obsolete
This is the game of the generation by such a huge margin, it's not even funny

'There's nothing behind me
 I'm a Witcher, I'd have heard it
 Just like I can hear your heart
 Which is pounding
 like a liar's
'Geralt of Rivia__________________________________________Introduction'The Witcher III: Wild Hunt‘ has won so many awards and has been praised by so many people that it’s kind of impossible to miss or ignore this game
 It’s the third part in the videogame series based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski and represents the end of the famous videogame trilogy of Geralt of Rivia, a
k
a the White Wolf or the Butcher of Blaviken
 To cut a long story short: The game lived up to every expectation I had and exceeded them with ease
 Even the games‘ minigames are better than many full-price titles – yeah exactly, I’m talking about you Gwent, you awful little drug that I can’t get enough of…The main story connects to the events of the second Witcher game 'Assassins of Kings‘ and brings the overall story started in the first part to an end
 Witchers are infamous monster hunters, magically improved mutants that are simultanesously feared and needed in a world threatened by dark creatures, evil spirits and living nightmares
 Geralt of Rivia is a famous specimen of this kind and thought for a long time that his former friend and love, the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg, was already dead
 However during the recent events in Loc Muinne he learned that this was not the entire truth and so he decides to start a new journey to finally find answers to his questions
 A huge world with fascinating lore and characters awaits the White Wolf - the sheer quantity of places you can visit, persons you can talk to and monsters that have to be slain would be enough to
fit in several other games
 This world is not only packed with interesting stories, dialogues, quests, fearsome monsters and an insane amount of details behind every corner, moreover it is convincing and far away from all the happy fantasy clichés you've already seen a hundred times
 There is neither black nor white, just many shades of grey
 Elves are neither the glorious archers nor the kind tree people, humans not the friendly guys that accept every race the same and dwarfes are no gentle stone-loving miners
 In this world you have to make choices that you won’t like and to live with the consequences
 Morally ambiguous is the description you’re looking for
__________________________________________Graphics and AudioRegarding the technical aspects this game conquers Mount Olympus easily (despite the much complained 'technical downgrade‘) as it is one of the most beautiful RPGs I’ve ever seen, with amazing sunsets/sunrises, spooky nights and gorgeous views over detailled landscapes full of nature and terror - this game is definitely gorgeous
 You want to see some examples
 Let me show you some screenshots taken from the game using only the additional E3FX and the free camera from the console:http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=639380403http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=657195325http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=626638385In addition to the stunning visuals there is also brilliant music and fantastic voice acting that will catch you during dialogues or pumps you up during the fights
 Together with the exquisite characters, the superb dialogues and all the deep little stories the game suceeds even more in creating a credible fantasy world
__________________________________________ConsSo now there's the question: Are there negative points at all
 Yeah some minor flaws: Talking to every person and looting every stash is kind of unsatisfying as there is no wide variety of things that you may accomplish or find this way, so after some time you will visit mostly the important places and persons while ignoring the rest
 Furthermore if everything else may be a 10/10 for me, the fighting mechanic is not as fantastic as the rest
 It has definitely improved since the second part but it’s still somewhat 'special' as it lacks unique aspects, a good feedback for the hits and suffers every now and then from targeting problems, camera angles, weird controls or some questionable hitboxes
 That now may sound worse than it actually is - from my point of view it's 'still' an 8 out of 10
 In addition I encountered some small visual glitches and sound errors during cutscenes but they were so small and disappeared after reloading, so I don’t even care about this at all
 Compared to the games‘ size and content there are nearly no problems at all and everything runs more than just smoothly for me
 To be honest there is only only real downside that I have with the game: My journey with Geralt will end some day and it set new standards regarding characters, lore and dialogues that future RPGs have to be compared with - and this will be a tough struggle for many of them
__________________________________________ConclusionSo in the end, would I recommend the game
 Yes – and no
 It’s a fantastic RPG with an amazing amount of content, exquisite characters, dialogues and interesting stories, so I’d recommend it for everyone who has even the slightest positive attitude towards RPGs or the fantasy genre in general
 However at the same time I wouldn’t recommend the game for anyone who has only little time to spare, doesn’t want to be immersed in a massive world full of lore or just wants to rush the story - this game needs time
 A lot of time
 However it pays off by providing a brilliant experience that will take you on a journey that you’ll never regret or forget
…or to be more precise let's call it 'a journey you’d like to forget'
 Just to experience this masterpiece again from the start and to get these great feelings again (damn I even ignored the fast-travel option and turned off the minimap and the quest hints willingly for many hours (I’ve been lost so many times) to enjoy the world and the quests even longer)
 I rate it gladly 9
5 out of 10 points
__________________________________________Let's end this review with another badass quote of the White Wolf:'I'm a Witcher
 Heard you wondering about my swords
 Well, one's for monsters, the other for humans
'
Posted: 2 June, 2016
This is the greatest game ive ever played in my life (ive been gaming since Pong/2600)
 My time played is bordering on embarassing, and its going to get worse with BaW just released
 This is my comfort game, whenever I am bored of another game, I can always come back to this one
 I also played through W1 and W2 multiple times (not on Steam) so I was foaming at the mouth for years, waiting for this game
I'm the kind of gamer where I need more than just a story, I want a great story, great loot/crafting/item management, great combat, and great character RPG skill building
 This game has it all, and its completely adjustable
 Only want the story and swinging your sword at monsters but dont want to get into crafting/alchemy/skills
 Just play it on the easiest and you can skip all of that, and just watch the story (Naughty dog/telltale style)
 You want to get hardcore and make all the crafting/oils/bombs/potions/thought into char build usefull
 Turn it on Death march and make all your desisions count and make all the battles extremely fun and tacticle
 4 of my 5 playthroughs are on DM and it is the true Witcher 3 experience
Games with great stories alone just dont cut it for me anymore
 A good example of this recently was Uncharted 4, dont get me wrong it had a great story, but after the Witcher I was bored to tears and still havent finished it
 In that game you do nothing but shoot at stuff and watch the story, which is fine for some people but not me
 In Witcher 3 you get a GOT quality of a story, including voice acting, animation, ect
 However when you want to take a break from that, visit one of the equally engaging side stories and monster hunts, go on scavenger hunts for treasure and 6 different sets specialized witcher gear, 4 of which have 5 tiers of upgrades
 Go visit question marks on the map for more side stories and treasures, hunt down rare ingredients for your potions/bombs/oils
 Theres all of that and I havent even talked about Gwent yet
You will also be collecting cards rare and common through out the game world for an entire card game built from the ground up as a mini game within this game
Posted: 3 October, 2015
Have you ever noticed how, in a typical RPG (and, now that I think about it, most games in general) battles don’t really mean anything
 How many times have you defeated a miniboss, only to have it stand back up and laugh at you, saying “I have underestimated you
 You are a worthy opponent
 This is not the end
 We shall meet again
” and make a getaway
 Think about it
 How many times do you beat up Balrog in Cave Story only to have him fly away without a scratch
 How is Black Knight able to keep running away after Shovel Knight stabs the hell out of him
 How come you black out if you lose a Pokémon battle, but none of the other trainers do
 And how does the big bad villain always seem to get away, even if their HP hits zero, so they can reappear in the sequel
Undertale asks the question, “What if defeating an enemy in battle always means that they die
”This might seem quite inconsequential in random encounters, but Undertale will also pit you against several main characters
 If you defeat a main character in battle, they’re dead for good, and the whole story changes to reflect it
 Heavy stuff
But thankfully, as the game advertises, you don’t actually have to kill anyone
 The game offers a second option to get out of battles: talking the enemy out of fighting
 This involves solving a simple puzzle, almost always involving the “Act” menu in battle
 The puzzle changes depending on what kind of enemy you’re fighting; sometimes you’ll just need to give them a compliment, other times you’ll need to survive several of their attacks, and so on
 Once they’re not emotionally invested in the battle anymore, you can “spare” them, and the battle ends
 You won’t get any EXP for it, but you’ll still get gold
 It’s a very unique fighting mechanic
I admit, after my first playthrough of the game, I was disappointed in the story’s presentation
 I thought that both the very beginning and the final area of the game were fantastic, dripping with shocking emotional dilemmas, but the middle 80% of the game’s content seemed like it relied too much on oddball humor and not much else
 The game hilariously plays with expectations and has no shortage of genuinely witty satire of its genre, and I found myself amused by nearly all of it, but after the first two hours as I was walking across long linear worlds and listening to dozens of characters try to tell me jokes, I started to wonder where the emotional gravity had gone
 “Why is this game making me laugh, when I thought it was supposed to make me cry
” I asked myself
 “Where are the feelings
 After such an excellent and powerful prologue, why is the game taking so long to show me more
”Later that night, as I was lying awake in bed, the answer hit me: the game was quirky and lighthearted because I was sparing everyone’s life
 I wasn’t playing as a murderer
 If you want this game to have drama, you have to cause it
 And I think that’s where all the hype is coming from, all the talk about player choice
 This is a game about being a tree-hugging pacifist, or a murderous psychopath who kills anyone who gets in the way, or anything in between
 You only need to live with whomever you decide to be, because the game won’t let you ignore what you have done
Though it isn’t the most visually impressive game, and the stage design isn’t always the best, Undertale has left me feeling that I have just witnessed a work of art
 It tried some new and ambitious things and isn’t ashamed of what it wanted to be
 It's about 6 hours long; I’d recommend anyone to play it at least twice, just to be able to say that they've made their own choices and seen what the game has to offer
 It’s hard to imagine that anyone would regret the experience
Posted: 10 November, 2015
Ten dollars
 Only a few hours of gameplay
 16-bit graphics compared to the flashy 1080p stuff in standard games
But
 wow
 Undertale blew me away
 It doesn't need flashy graphics or even fanservice to falsify its enjoyment
 It just does things right, and boy that was one immensely enjoyable experience
I think most of the magic of this game comes from knowing absolutely nothing about it
 I got this game from a friend and just decided to play it since it looked very interesting and it was getting good responses
 So I went in completely blind, knowing nothing but the game's name
 And I'm glad I did, because everything the game presented to me was unexpected, notably dark in places, and very emotional, which would have been lost entirely if i watched someone else play it
 So, if you happened to have been flooded by everything Undertale on tumblr (god help us) and the entire story's already laid out for you, the magic has been lost and the game won't be as incredible of an experience
 I'm sorry
Of course, I call Undertale an "experience", not a game, only because it does such a fantastic job at it
 Following the motto on the store page, "the game where you don't have to destroy anyone", the game always tries to nudge you in that direction, taking a back seat in your mind and reminding you to "Spare them
"
 And of course, you answer with "Why
 Why should I do that when it offers me the option to kill anyone I want right in front of me
 What's in it for me
" And that's where the game literally turns into a personal experience, as everyone has a different response for the game's selling point
 And boy, does it turn to black or white pretty fast from here
Undertale's ability to completely turn the tables of its story depending on your actions is massive
 Upon your game's startup, every little thing you do will be set in stone in the game's story pathing
 If you're the type who immerses yourself into the game's charming music, laughs at the childish but hiliarious anctics, and is willing to hork down healing items just to prevent yourself from killing a monster just because a fight is difficult, the game rewards you
 It opens up a very character-developing and world-unfolding story, along with some of the most emotionally invested boss battles I have ever experienced
 You know a game is good when it breaks the fourth wall so well that you're shaking in your seat in true fear and can't stop the shivers, all while having to fight a hopelessly overpowered god of a boss
 The amazing writing only starts once you beat the final few bosses, and the story doesn't stop being good from there onwards
On the other hand, what makes this game different is that it keeps its dark side from you, and its entirely your choice to experience it
 If you scoff at the game's sparing choice since you're too cool or grown up to possibly be nice to people, you can go around and intentionally sink your weapon into a monster who just wants to be a friend
 And unlike many other games, this isn't just a simple moment of "Oops, I killed another unnamed enemy, let's reset the game and nothing changes"
 the weight of a dark choice is huge
 Nothing can be taken back, and it forever changes your playthrough
 Reset the game, and the characters know
 Events change
 And with each curious kill, you, in turn, turn from the only human in a land of monsters into the biggest monster in a land of innocents
 In the end, ignoring what Undertale sets out to do, which is to let you experience childlike innocence and fun, only makes it delibrately change the game into a quieter, more grim story
 Very little character development, and the world isn't explained to you, nothing
 There's very little reward for going through this route
 Yet it is a choice you can do
 Granted, you get two of the hardest boss battles by becoming the murderer and will be forced into Game Overs repeatedly from them, but even that is a message from the game
 It's trying to stop you from getting to the end of this route
 Before its too late
It's as if you're doing deeds in an actual living, breathing world
 And that's what makes it even more terrifying when you decide to become a murderer instead of a savior, because only you know that you're willingly going forward to obliterate every weakling in front of you
 It's a test of your willpower, and it's your choice
 The worst thing
 The damage cannot be repaired
 Go clean, or go home tainted
 The game even gives you the choice to completely delete everyone's happiness after the most satisfying happy ending
 The happiness you worked so hard to earn
 And you can even become the murderer after saving the world, which will only permanently taint your game and never let you have a satisfying ending again
 That's absolutely brutal, and yet that's still a choice
 Amazing
Yes, this game might not be for everyone
 The humour may become dry after a while for some people, and tons of gamers nowadays like to bash at popular games instead of trying it out, just because they feel accomplished by doing it
 But, if like me, you are willing to experience why everyone's been talking about this game, give it a shot
 Hell, even if you hate the game to bits and want to kill everyone, buy the game, do so, and at least have your own personal experience before refunding it
 This game does the morality concept so well that other games can only dream of doing the same, and it is one not to be forgotten
It is a sin to call Undertale a game
 Doing that would categorize Undertale into the bland and consequence-free "kill-em-all" genres that a lot of games are falling into now
Undertale is a story-driven, emotional experience
Posted: 22 October, 2015
This is one of those few games that come along when times are bleak, and games have become regularly bland and heartless
 Where you feel disenfranchised with the whole idea of video games
 And you begin to start ask "Why
"
 Like "Why should we play games
", "Why are games different from other media
", "Why should you use games as a form of expression
" and even "Why even play games at all
" Undertale come along and says, "This is why
"

Posted: 7 October, 2015
(Mostly spoiler-free review)I hate turn-based RPGs
 This is my Game of the Year
 What
After becoming ULTRA-JADED about gaming with the cancellation of Silent Hills, this game re-established that games can be really, really frickin good
This thing was made with an incredible amount of love, and it shows in every nook and cranny, every joke, every secret conversation you never thought a game dev would have thought to include
 Tobyfox is the most thorough dev ever
 I'm continuously impressed with how many things he thought to include in this game, and how he managed to make it all extremely fun the entire way through
 You'd think you've seen everything in this game, but you haven't
 There's always another amazing thing, another way to turn the genre on its head, another great joke you didn't see coming
 And it stays engaging the entire time, supported by a cast of fantastic, endearing, hilarious characters
 Great puzzles too, imo
 It avoids all the things about (turn-based and non) RPGs that I despise: -There's no grinding (unless you want to)-Battles are a great length and never overstayed their welcome for me-There's no boring menu-navigation-only-based combat (bullet dodging/timing-based stuff really spices it up, as well as bossfights always having a new, really fun gameplay twist on them
)-There's no unlikable/unrelatable characters that go on and on about you being the "Chosen One" or whatever-No plot where you gotta go to the 7 temples and find the 7 sacred whatevers and then oh wait now that you've gotten those 7 sacred whatevers, you gotta go to 4 extra places and get 4 SUPER sacred whatevers
 -No backtracking (unless you want to
 Backtracking is actually usually rewarded with more fun conversations and such
)-No constant equipping and unequipping items because, oh, this one is +2 Def but -3 Speed but THIS one is +3 Speed and -2 Def but THIS one is immune to fire and this one is
-It actually has a way more complex, useful moral than "Evil is Bad, Good is Good
" Everyone has relateable motivations
-The writing doesn't suck like 90% of RPGs
 It has a wonderful sense of humor and a simple plot that is underlaid with complex emotions
-Has jokes about anime, doesn't take itself seriously
I could gush about it forever
 Undertale's not only made me less jaded about gaming, but also less jaded about real life
 It has a strong message about empathy that stays everpresent, while somehow not being cloying about it, or shoving the message down your throat
 It's simply a wonderful experience, please play this thing

Reviewing Tyranny is a little bit weird for me because it's a game that personally I really loved playing (and still am playing), but at the same time I realise it's not for everyone
 There's definitely room for improvement but the things Tyranny does well it does really well and I feel like it's one of those games that will be more successful as a cult classic than it was at the time of release
Posted: 24 May
So, I often think of CRPGs as different GMs
 Balder's Gate 1 is kind of a crappy GM - they don't know how to really roleplay and their plot is kind of rote
 But they did a TON of homework, so you can go anywhere and find something there
 It may be kinda stupid, but it is there
 Balder's Gate 2 is that GM, but they got better at writing and roleplaying
 Now, characters are better written and the plot is more interesting
Planescape Torment is the dude who may railroad you, but they've got such a great plot and setting that you don't really care
Tyranny
 Tryanny is the GM who watches as you walk into their carefully pre-written campagin of evil and chaos, with deep lore and politics in mind, and blink as you say: "So, I stab my ally in the back
 All of them
 At the same time
" Tyranny blinks again
 Then Tyranny smiles and says: "Okay, so, now, you find yourself working for
" Tyranny has some of the best choice based gameplay I've ever seen
 Work for one side
 Work for another
 Work for a third
 Work for yourself
 Play people off one another
 An amazing number of different choices lead to different outcomes
 I've played the game three times and still haven't seen everything it has to offer
 Add to that a fun, fast paced combat (which you can set to the easiest mode if you just want to enjoy the narrative) and my presonal favorite companion NPCs, and you've got one of the finest RPGs out there
Plus, you can do drugs with grandpa Lantry and have fun for the whole family

4 hours in and I can already say it's gonna be quite the adventure
 Very unique setting for the genre - bronze age works for me, I felt immersed within the first minutes, and I can't say the same about Pillars
I'd say it's more streamlined, even more than Pillars, but I don't really mind
 I feel like a kid running Arcanum or Baldur's Gate for the first time, immersed in a beautiful world full of interesting stories
 Shame I have to sleep (and go to work tomorrow) because I can't wait to play some more
If You, like me, had trouble being immersed in Pillars, consider picking this game up
Posted: 11 March
I rate 7/10
 A solid isometric RPG with unusual story and engaging combat
 Definitely worth a try for any fan of old-school western RPGs
Story+ Unique and refreshing: forget your usual boring saving the world from The Evil Overlord - you will conquer it in their name instead
+ Your choices actually matter
+ High replay value thanks to the amount of choices
+ Very detailed character creation system
~ Solid, but straightforward
 Don't expect plot twists or deep philosophical themes
- The last act feels rushed, some plot lines remain unexplained and unfinished
 Let's hope that's a set up for a sequel
Combat system+ Fun and complex, with a large and diverse set of abilities and status effects
+ Active pause and fast/slow modes allow you to tune the speed of combat to your liking
+ One of the most detailed magic spell customization systems I've ever seen
+ A neat combat log with all the rolls and effects explained in detail
~ Some spells/abilities combinations are really overpowered
 I am looking at you, volcanic weapon accent
 This + any weapon buff + Verse's Fury's Embrace = Fire Minigun of Instagib
- Balance is pretty skewed
 The game feels challenging in the beginning, but gets too easy in the end (mostly due to the previous point)
 Don't play on anything lower than "Hard" if you want at least some challenge
Companions+ Memorable and likeable
+ Detailed backstories and dialogues
+ A loyalty/fear system based on your actions
~ No waifus
 This is no Bioware date-sim, if you were expecting one
Appearance+ Good graphics for an isometric RPG
+ Animations are smooth, magic/ability visuals are nice and not overly flashy
+ You can change the freaking font size
~ Music is whatever
Posted: 11 June
I liked this game a lot until I started paying attention
 I like the combat, I like my companions, the story itself is nifty, and the setting, "Evil has won" is really cool
 The execution of the character creation (with the conquest system) was also excellent and a nice touch
But you don't actually have any choices, and your hard won reputation with a faction gets easily wiped out by things
 For instance, early in the game you have to pick a side between two technically *allied* armies
 You can't do any compromise, you can't stay out of it, you have to pick, and no matter how much either side liked you beforehand, the one you don't pick now hates you for the entire rest of the game, and all of your previous positive actions that built up a positive reputation get wiped

One of the best games of 2016
Tyranny is definitely a very good RPG
 Every choice affects the lives of the people and the overall story
The maps are small, side-quest scarce and the story is short
 However it does have one of the best choice makings I've seen in RPGs and the story itself is very engaging
There isn't much to explore and the story might seem rather linear but what's in the game is done well
StoryYou are in middle of a civil war
The Overlord Kyros has won and rules over the realm
 The last conquered land, the region of the Tiers, has a rebel uprising and two of Kyros' armies struggle to bring order as they are fighting each other almost as much as the rebels
Insert The Fatebinder
 You bear a powerful Edict: If order is not re-established within a certain amount of time all life in the valley will perish
 You have to bring justice, peace and order to a wartorn country full of madmen
GameplayTyranny is an isometric RPG
 It's similar to Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale but the best comparison would be Pillars of Eternity
You can control a small squad of up to four people
 Each party member can be customised to an extent
 You can switch out their gear and colour their armor
 Each party member also comes with a unique set of skills and spells
 You can either turn on auto leveling or meddle with their skilltrees and attributes yourself
You spend half of the game reading through A LOT of text
 As any other RPG Tyranny isn't just about combat
 Half of the game is interacting with NPCs and making tough decisions
ConclusionI'd say that Tyranny is the most linear RPG I've ever played
 The maps are few and seriously tiny
 There is only a handful of sidequests and party members
 The exploration is almost none existent and you're almost always on the main quest as there's nothing else to do
 HOWEVER it does have quite a bit of replay value and it has one of the best choice making I've seen in RPGs and a very strong story making this one of the most memorable games of the year
 
Posted: 10 November, 2016
Tyranny is another masterwork created by Obsidian, but a real surprise seeing how little coverage and hype it got
Funny enough this game surpassed even Pillars of Eternity in many aspects
What you get is a real crpg in the veins of Baldurs Gate/ Ice Wind Dale or Pillars of Eternity, but by no means a simple Pillars of Eternity 2
Many mechanics have changed, grown and been improved upon by a mile and then some
 The whole character-system is now even more refined and works alot better than it did in Pillars:Endurance is gone, the leveling and building of your char/party is alot more complex and interesting
You still gain levels, but this is by far not the only way to progress your character
 Level-ups let you increase a singel attribute and allocate one talent point (which can be spend in various skill-trees, featuring active and passive talents); but now also many skills work similiar to the Eldar Scrolls games and level/increase by use
 This goes for combat skills (like 1-handed weapons) to conversation/enviroment skills like athletics
 Also the combat has a way more polished feel to it than in Pillars; micro-managing your party, all the options you got in combat feels now much more fluid and meaningfull while still beeing quite complex
Furthermore everything else flows into the character-system: standing with factions/npcs and all the choices you make in the story/sidequests grant you whole new abilities, talents, actives and passivs
Last but not least there's even spellcreation now included, which means you can sorta creat your own spells, modify em and adapt em to your liking
The even more impressive part is the game itself
sounds stupid, but the game is a piece of art
 Music (one of the best soundtracks i've yet heard in a game), the amazing voice-work, the art-style/design of the U
I
 and every little window (character-menu, inventory) or even more so the actual game-world is just incredible and polished to the rim
 Many backdrops are jaw-droppers, many scenes play out as they would in a play
 Ontop of all that the story and even more important the writing is topnotch
 When Pillars was nod to Baldur's Gate, Tyranny is a wink to Planescape Torment
 Leaving out spoilers (which you should avoid at all costs): the game-world is very unique (demons, greek/roman inspired art, etc
) and the story-line feels very fresh and not just like another iteration of "antihero becomes hero, saves world, end"
 Every little sidequest i encountered was interesting, every conversation filled with lore and just the feeling of exploring this intruging new world
Tyranny does one thing no other crpg did for me this good: game-mechanics and story, combat and quests, standing with factions/npcs, everything works together
it's hard to describe, but very enjoyable if you are into the immersion crpgs can offer
 On a last note: finaly a game doesn't just give you a forced good/evil deeds/reputation-system
no your actions here are never this clear defined, your actions may instill fear or favor and give benefits (combat/character-stat-wise) and story consequences which never feel like a choice between "right" or "wrong"
 In my opinion the best way of implementing a standig/reputation-system i've ever seen in a game
All in this game came kinda out of nowhere and surprised me alot; one of the best games i've yet played
If you are into cprgs and still look rather for immersion and a complex game-system instead of the shooter/hack'n slay mechanics other proclaimed cprgs offer, go buy this game and take s a vacation, you won't regret it
what i would like to ad as final note is the impressive love for detail this game shows and thus the developer
 the old static portaits for example are still here, but conversation show the actual characters talking and their physical reactions, missives between you and the different enteties who live in this world ad not just lore but life, backrounds are filled with enviromental effects, arcane spells are not just lore-wise cast by invocing sigils->the characters actualy draw them when casting, the same goes for all the animations
most of it is just stunning once you take a moment and look at it
 All in all this is the next-gen-leap from old Infinity-Engine games to a newer age of indepth, immersion heavy crpgs, Pillars layed the groundwork, Tyranny is the next step

Product received for free
It's too bad there's no neutral option for Steam reviews because I recommend it to cRPG fans, but don't recommend it to everyone else
 Tyranny is Obsidian's latest cRPG with a twist
 Instead of trying to save the world and beat the bad guys you're working for them
 I received Tyranny for free for review purposes
 My thoughts of Tyranny are not biased, or brought in any way
 I always give my honest opinion on games and just because I didn't pay for this one doesn't change that fact
 The Great:Graphics:Tyranny is a really good looking game
 The environments, spells, particle effects, and even character models looked great
 Usually cRPGs would do one thing really good while lack in other areas
 Tyranny does everything good
 I was really surprised by how good the character models looked and it made me want to spend some extra time creating my first protagonist
 Character Creator:I didn't care much for the character creator until I got to the end of it
 After I finished creating my first character I was able to choose my past exploits and how I helped Kyros take over the world
 It was really awesome because my choices actually affected how certain factions acted towards me in game
 If I decided to kill the queen the Vendrien Guard would call you, "Queenslayer" and want nothing to do with you, but if made peace with them they'll approach you with respect
 There's a lot of replay value here because I want to know what the game would be like if I choose other options in the character creator
 I've already started my second playthrough because I want to get a different ending in the game
 Sounds:The soundtrack is awesome
 As soon as the game started I heard this epic music in the background
 It set the tone for the rest of game
 It was imposing and sounded like a theme that a world conquering tyrant would have in my opinion
 The other sounds in the game are good too
 Casting spells sound like you would expect them to sound in a cRPG
 There is voice acting in the game, but it's not fully voiced
 I don't like this at all and I wish games like this would stop doing it
 If you're going to add voice acting in your game that's fine, but make sure you do it for the whole game or don't bother doing it all
 I could be talking a companion of mine and they'll speak a few sentences, but after that they won't talk anymore
 I'll have to read walls of text until they decide to speak again
 Thankfully the voice acting in this game is really good
 It's Well Optimized:The only bug I ran into in my 25 hours of gameplay was a weird animation bug
 Instead of my companion walking behind me like she should have been she was sliding all over the map
 My FPS never dipped, and I never experienced any game breaking bugs
 This is one of the better optimized games that has released this year
 The Good:Story:It took me a while to care about what was happening in this game
 I'm a fatebinder of Kyros and I help impose his will on the frontlines of battle
 The lore in this game is really interesting, but the execution leaves much to be desired
 I know Obsidian wanted to give the player as many options and branches as they could, but I would have preferred a set narrative over the many that we have here because none of them feel complete to me
 I don't want to give out any spoilers because the game will be released in a few hours
 Some of the storylines were really awesome and they way I could end a certain edict was fantastic
 Getting to know my companions, the Archons, and plotting in the shadows was fun, but I never really got invested in any of it
 The ending was really cool even though it ended abruptly and I do want to play through the game again to see what different choices I could make this time around
 The Bad:Gameplay:I don't really enjoy playing cRPGs
 I'm more of a aRPG guy, but the gameplay here is good if you don't play as a mage
 There was a good variety of weapons for me to choose from, but I ended up going mage and regretting every second of it
 Playing as a staff wielding mage was really boring to me
 Staffs attacks are really slow and the magic system is slow too
 It doesn't matter how many points I put into my quickness my spell cooldowns never changed
 I don't know if this is a bug or intentional, but I stopped investing in the quickness stat just to be on the safe side
 Another thing I don't like about magic in this game is the way I acquired new spells
 In order to learn new spells I had to hunt them down and find them
 This goes with the lore of the game because only Archons can create their own spells, but it's a bad game mechanic in my opinion
 Leveling up my skills in the magic skill tree is pretty pointless if it doesn't teach me any new spells
 In order to learn how to do AOE attacks I would need the right sigil and have a certain amount lore points
 The problem with this that by the time I had enough lore to do AOE attacks I was at the end of the game
 I never had a chance to enjoy my new abilities
 Playing as
warrior or rogue is a lot better
 Skill cooldowns are faster, I do more damage, and battles are over faster too, but when compared to Divinity Original Sin's gameplay this is just average at best
 UI:I'm not a fan of the UI in this game
 It's not modern enough for my tastes
 Most cRPGs have a below average UI and this game is no different in my opinion
 Loot:There's plenty of loot to find in Tyranny, but very little of it was worth my time
 The legendary items that I found were great, but the majority of the items were worse than items I had found a few hours earlier
 I never found any good staffs in the game
 The most dps I got out of a staff was about 9dps while the rest of my party did a average of 25-35
 A
I
The A
I
 in this game is brain dead on every difficulty level
 My party members did a decent job of engaging enemies without me having to issue them commands, but there were too many times when no one did anything even after I gave them a command
 They would just stand there running back and forth doing nothing
 This has got me killed a few times on higher difficulties and it's really annoying
 The werewolf companion's A
I
 is the most broken of all of the companions while the mages seem to have the best A
I
 out of the bunch
 Other npcs A
I
 was just as bad as my companions
 I can't tell you how many times I engaged in combat and murdered everyone because they wouldn't fight me back
 The Verdict: I had a lot of fun with Tyranny, but I can only recommend this to hardcore cRPG fans
 If you love games like Baldur's Gate, and Pillars of Eternity you'll love this game
 You probably already preordered it and is just waiting to play it like everyone else, but if you're just a regular gamer trying to find a good game to play to hold you over until the next AAA title releases I would recommend waiting for this one to go on sale before buying it because it's not worth $45
The gameplay will satisfy the hardcore cRPG fans, but do little to impress someone new to the genre or anyone that's grown tired of it
 75End NoteI purposely left out some features, and details in this review because I don't want to spoil the game for anyone on release day
 I would rather you play and find out for yourself rather than having it spoiled by a game reviewer

An odd game, very odd
 The character creation part and Act I of Tyranny is some of the greatest work in the entire RPG history, I dare say
 30 minutes into the game, you could easily see that whoever developed this game has got some brilliant, or even amazing ideas
 Proceeding through the first act, you might feel the weight of history like Dragon Age, crafty political maneuver like Wheel of Time, and a shroud of darkness like Pillars of Eternity
If only the developer could stick to this level of quality, this game would have the potential to make history
The problem is that good things don't last for very long
 Act II is somewhat exhausted in the creativity department
 By the time you see Act III, it's already obvious that the developer has run out of either money or patience, and can't wait to get this game over with
 Just when you are trying to cope with it and waiting for things to get better after hitting such a low point, the game's over, credit's rolling, leaving a ton of stuff either unexplained, or stupidly tied off
Would have recommended this game just for its breeze of fresh ideas
 But the drop (or shall I say free falling) of quality between Act I and II (not to menion the joke pretending to be Act III) is TERRIBLE
Buy this game simply to experience the starting part if there's a damn nice discount, or else don't bother

Let's be real, if you played Life is Strange you're probably starved for any way to revisit our favorite heroines and would buy this game even if it were rated "Overwhelmingly Negative"
 The good news is that you don't really have to worry about that
 This is a good game, though it lacks the ambitious exposition of the original
 While Life is Strange violently plunged you into a world of secrets and conflict armed with a rewind button, Before the Storm focuses on smaller, and maybe more mundane happenings of Aradia Bay like teen angst, familial strife, betrayal, and the fast formed bond between two very different girls
 Without the superpowers of her best friend Max, Chloe's tale in Before the Storm shapes up to be a much more intimate, personal, and human tale than the original

The saddest part is to wait the next episode
Posted: 31 August
Episode start: Ah this is just normal and relaxedEpisode finished: I WASN'T READY FOR THESE EMOTIONS
Posted: 31 August
There are a few cringe moments, but I guess that comes with playing a teenage girl as a man
 Nevertheless, if you enjoyed the original, the first episode is pretty solid
Posted: 1 September
Deck Nine had an impossible task in Before the Storm: Not just to create a prequel to a story-driven game with a cult fandom, but to do it with:- A different game engine- Different writers- Different voice actors- Different music- No rewind mechanic(Is now a good time to mention that Deck Nine's previous work includes "Neopets: The Darkest Faerie," some remastered Playstation ports, and a forgettable snowboarding franchise
)In light of that, my expectations coming in were pretty low 
 and they've been absolutely blown away
 Episode 1 of Before the Storm isn't just true to the original game — as a one-to-one comparison, it's better than Episode 1 of the original Life is Strange
 I feel exactly like I felt playing the first game, and I haven't felt that way since the first game ended more than 2 years ago
 10/10 I'm not sure how this is even possible; go play it

I want my homie Max back
Posted: 3 September
This is probably the most thorough review I'll ever write on Steam, so I want to say some things before I start:I'm only reviewing the first episode in its release state
 I don't know yet if I'm going to update
I'm going to refer to the original game as LiS, to this one as BfS
LiS was a great game
 People are hyped and give BfS 10/10 ratings, disregarding its obvious flaws
 I would give it neither a thumb up nor a thumb down, but a "meh" rating
BfS isn't developed by the same studio and you notice that extremely
My review will get lots of thumbs down because the review system is broken
 Giving a thumb down means telling that the review isn't helpful
 People abuse the thumbs to vote down everything that doesn't agree with their opinion while voting up single sentence reviews that don't help anyone
I'll try to keep spoilers out of my review as much as possible
Let's take a look at some negative aspects, starting with technical stuff and proceeding into more "relevant" things:- GraphicsWhile LiS was based on the Unreal Engine, BfS uses the Unity Engine
 Believe it or not, but the simple graphics are a lot worse
 I actually loved the art style of LiS, but in BfS I actually deleted every single screenshot I took (and I take a lot of screenshots) because they just weren't pleasant to look at
 Textures often completely lack detail, anti-aliasing is non-existent (even on maxed out AA settings) which is actually a huge problem in this game, even though I usually don't care much about AA
 All my screenshots were heavilypixelated
- ControlsRemember how you chose an action in LiS by holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse into the direction of the action
 In BfS, you hold the left mouse button and use WASD to choose
 In other words, in order to look at stuff or interact you need two hands now instead of only one
 It's not a big deal, it just makes the game less comfortable at many scenes
- VoicesYou've probably heard already that Chloe has a new voice
 You probably still have her accent from LiS inside your head
 That's gone
 Not a big deal, you could get used to that - the problem is that her new actress just isn't good
 At
some points she sounds completely unmotivated and just talks her text down without any motivation at all
 Near the end of the game you will also notice heavy breathing and hear clearly that she was standing to close at the microphone
Chloe isn't the only character with a new voice, for example the famous angry David Madsen sounds really soft now
- AnimationsLots of animations look really clunky and unnatural
 I wanted to call an exorcist when Rachel was turning her head
 In dialogues, characters often lack facial expressions
 David gets angry and raises his voice, but his soft and calm expression stays
 Until BfS I never noticed what a killer missing facial expressions can be
- Paradoxes and other minor flawsFor example, there's a photo of pirate Chloe and pirate Max hanging in Chloe's living room
 However, the Max with the eyepatch on the photo isn't the young Max we know from flashbacks, but the old Max you play as in LiS
In Chloe's diary entry about a schoolmate she writes something such as "He's exactly like my class schedule
 We have history, but no chemistry
" You can read this while following the task "Go to your chemistry class
"The game is full of those details
- Chloe's characterAlright, Chloe's a rebel
 But sometimes it's just too much
 In the beginning of the game you can look at a knife stuck inside a wooden wall and Chloe says something like "This looks exactly like the knife my mom didn't want to buy me for my birthday
" She also likes tossing items just to the ground after using them, even if she borrowed them from a friend few seconds ago
 I mean, come on
- DialoguesSome dialogues actually make me cringe
 I won't go into details here due to possible spoilers
 There's a new feature which enables you to argue with people
 Everytime you have to persuade someone, just look out for the "arguing" sign and you know that's the way to go
 It triggers a minigame like in Monkey Island, where your enemy delivers a statement and you have to counter with a fitting insult
 Despite the fact that everyone beyond twelve years of age knows that you basically lose an argument as soon as you just start insulting your opponent, the arguing dialogues are just the worst in the game
 They are just completely incoherent
 You answer to a statement and suddenly your opponent starts about a completely different matter
 After winning the minigame, it always seems to me like people stop arguing because they are annoyed by Chloes inability to argue, not because she "won"
 But of course Chloe had to be as rebel as possible and so it works in the game's context
Furthermore, the reactions and answers of characters sometimes don't seem logical at all
- Other charactersExcept for Chloe and Rachel, the characters in this game mostly completely lack depth
 You meet them, they start talking about a topic, you choose one or two answers, you go on with the game
 I don't even remember what we talked about
I didn't like Rachel at all until the ending of the episode, but that's just my personal opinion
- ExplorationRemember how you strolled around in LiS, trying to find out everything about the world and its inhabitants
 Trying to find motives for a good photo
 It's almost non-existent in BfS
 Chloe's a rebel and there's a stage play coming up at school
 Everything you'll find are some posters about drug abuse and the upcoming stage play, without giving you any more information
 Instead of taking photos, you can draw graffitis at walls now
 There's a graffiti in every scene, so you just walk along walls until you find the spot to get your achievement
Now, some more positive aspects:+ ClothesAfter the intro you have to change clothes
 You can choose the outfit you want to wear during the episode
 There are two different T-shirts in the base game, you unlock three more outfits if you buy the deluxe edition and you can play as classic Chloe (without blue hair) if you preordered the game
- I probably don't have to mention that this feature is just a huge cashgrab for Square Enix
 It's a neat feature anyway
+ SoundtrackJust like LiS, BfS has a nice indie rock soundtrack which fits well into the game
- Remember the scenes in LiS, where you just enjoyed the scenery and a nice song to it
 They are in BfS too, but somehow they don't seem to fit into the game or they were just executed half-heartedly
 They are nice to have anyway
+ GameplayWell, the gameplay won't surprise you
 If you liked the gameplay of LiS and can live without time travel puzzles, you'll be satisfied
+ New ideasAfter the cool intro and the unfortunately very tedious middle part, the developers suddenly had their own ideas in the end and this is where the game finally shine
 This might be a little spoiler, but there's a difference between Max and Chloe
 While Max was very calm, Chloe can become very angry
 At some part in the game it suddenly gets emotional, and instead of only showing Chloe's emotions, you actually get to live out Chloe's emotions
 And it feels great
The arguing minigame is actually quite exciting, despite it's obvious lack of logic
For each graffiti, you can choose between two different messages which will also show up in your graffiti diary
 Neat little gimmick
+ The endingJust like every LiS episode, episode 1 of BfS has a great ending
 It didn't only leave me sitting with my mouth open, it actually sent a chill down my spine
Conclusion:If it wasn't for the first 20 minutes and especially the last 20 minutes of the episode (3
5 hours in total), I would actually give the game a clear thumb down
 I give it a "meh" rating
 It has very obvious flaws, but it's quite enjoyable if you're a LiS fan

I love this game
 It's different, rich in story, and will make even the coldest of hearts feel emotional
 First time finishing the game (before I got it on Steam) I was up at 3 in the morning bubbling like a baby when I finished I chose the save Arcadia Bay ending and if you played it you know how upseting that ending was
 This game, although it has it's flaws, is a masterpiece
 DontNod made a wonderful game and has proven that their small team can make an amazing, beautiful, heartfelt game
 I paid for the 1st episode before it was released on Steam for free, but even spending a few extra dollars was worth it, as this game has taken me through the incredible and emotional journey of Max Caulfield and Chloe Price
Pros:Beautiful indie sountrackFun use of timetraveling powersDifferent (and stunning) graphicsRelatable characters/situationsNot afraid to talk about uncomfortable topics (assault, deaths of loved ones, suicide, ect)Most small choices still have a meaningful impactStrong replay valueMany subtle refrences to shows/movies/memes Likable charactersVery atmospheric, it feels like a real townHas an unusual but nice mechanism where you can take a "Moment of Calm" and sit down on a bed/swing/bench, and just look at the world around you while calming music playsBeautiful locations and sceneryCons:Voice acting/script can be cringy at timesDespite the choices you make there are only two absolute endingsIs short (but as stated before is replayable)Can be cliche at timesOverall this game is not one to miss
 Even with it's flaws, Life is Strange is one game you shouldn't miss

I wish I could rewind and play this game for the first time again

It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game
 I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror
 And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute
When I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it
 I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag
 It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning
 I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined
 Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless
 Imagine if games held this standard
 Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution
 You can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way
 The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it
Most adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games
I've never felt so fulfilled after "playing a game" as I did today
 Original, beautiful and masterfully executed
 I can't wait for the next episode

This is probably the realest review for a game I will ever do
Coming from a guy who never shows emotions, has been gaming for a good 12 years and has mainly been playing horror, FPS, and MMOs those twelve years
I both see and feel why this game has a warning about support groups for real life
This game guilt-trips you so hard and then kicks your emotions around like it's a soccer ball
I haven't had this much of an emotional roller coaster in, well
 ever
I've never had a video game make me tear up before
Life Is Strange changed that
Easily my "Game Of The Year"
 I know a lot of triple-a titles came out this year, and I know Life Is Strange doesn't get as much attention as other game
 but holy hell you guys
I've never played a game with such an in-depth story as I have with Life Is Strange
Hell, I've NEVER even played a game that kept me up all night, wondering about what the next episode will be, or how my actions in the last episode might impact me
This is a game that I will never forget, and it is most likely a game that I will always come back to

I bought this game for £5
 I now realise it is worth so much more; how I missed this game for two years I don't know, I'm glad I finally got around to playing it; I haven't felt like this in a long time after playing a game, a completely lifechanging experience
 Life is Strange is slightly similar to games of the Telltale series, your choices affect the outcome of the game and make subtle and huge changes throughout
 You feel empathy for the characters in the world, and whilst handling mature themes such as depression, the game grips you to your seat
 It is amazing
 A masterpiece
 The writers are on par with some of the best TV shows and films out there, it makes you question every choice you make, your own reality
 As a player you actually feel like you affect the relationships between the characters
The music and art design are unique and aesthetically pleasing, which is a nice change from the usual games I play
 The voice acting's brilliant, the lip synchronization is not so much, but it is not awful
 Without spoiling anything, the twists in this game, WOW
 I can see why this game has critical acclaim
Finally I must end saying how much I recommend this game
 I've experienced nothing like it before, if you read this
 Please try this game
 You won't regret it
Posted: 26 December, 2015
Life is Strange isn't hard, yet it hits you hard
Life is Strange isn't challenging, yet it shows daily challenges
Life is Strange isn't long, yet its impact lasts long
Life is Strange isn't a puzzle, yet it leaves you puzzled
Life is Strange isn't giving questions, yet it offers answers
Life is Strange isn't replayable, yet finds in the replay its core
Life is Strange isn't real, yet it feels so
Life is Strange isn't about relationship, friensdhip, love, hate, light or darkness
 It's about the most underestimated gift: life
I am unable to call it "game" as it would lose all the artistic veil surrounding Arcadia Bay
 Art is something you perceive, it is something that comes out of the blue without a reason or a purpose
 Art is something you can perceive in every step Max takes, and this is how I would label Life is Strange: art
Dontnod has made a terrific job and gives us lessons that we can easily detatch from this title and apply it in our everyday life
 All the serious themes covered in such a little time amount made me understand the reason why the developers have opened a support group for those who felt really affected by some of them
And perhaps the core of this experience is simple and complicated at the same time:Life is hard, life is challenging, life is short, life is puzzling, life is uncertain, life is one only, life is strange
 But life
is life

But buying it
 that's not the hard part
It's letting go
Posted: 29 May
After watching the Steins;Gate anime, and becoming a little bit obsessed with it, I thought that I would purchase the original game
 I am glad I did
 It adds a lot of depth to the story and the characters, and helps to explain several parts of the anime that I thought were a little odd and inexplicable
 If you have seen the extremely popular anime, I would not say this purchase is essential by any means
 But for those like me who want to experience the story again with a little more depth and expansion, I highly recommend it
For those who have not seen the Steins;Gate anime, watch it
 It is currently streaming on Funimation (in the US) and can be watched for free is you sign up for the 14-day free trial
 It is really fantastic
 For those interested in the story but wary of reading a visual novel, it is a good option
 Although, be forewarned, the first half of the anime is kind of slow
Anyway, for those who are not aware of Steins;Gate at all, I would purchase this game if you enjoy a cast of quircky characters, well-researched science fiction, and an awesome, complicated plot that somehow manages to avoid the plot holes that plague most time travel stories
 Higly recommended
Update (6/28/17):My computer locked up a few days ago and I had to reset it to factory settings
 After a day of updating Windows and all of my drivers, I tried to play Steins;Gate today
 And
 it gave me an error message in Japanese and did not start
So, just FYI, the game is not packaged with all of the software dependencies required to play it
 If it fails to start, try installing another recent game or two and then try again
Posted: 24 June
I love Steins;Gate
 It's unique visual style is something that's always a breath of fresh air
 Every character that you come across feels very human
 Each of the routes are finely crafted
 The soundtrack is beautiful
 The mood of the story is captured perfectly through it, and I can't be more happy with it
 Enough gushing, though, I have to say that I should bring up that I have 2 issues with this game, neither of which are a very big deal
 The first issue is how long it takes to kick off the ground
 This can be a turn off for newcomers, as the first few chapters are paced fairly slow, however, I feel that the slow pacing is necessary to build on the impact that the tone shift has on the player
The second issue that I have with the VN is the requirements for the true ending
 You aren't going to get the true ending on your first blind playthrough of Steins;Gate unless your looking it up
 That isn't an issue, and I don't think it should be seen as one, but the problem comes that the flags required to achieve the true ending can be seen as a little convoluted
Aside from those two things, which may or may not even be an issue for some people, I loved this visual novel
 Totally worth the price
 I'm really glad to see it finally made its way onto Steam for others to enjoy the same way that I have

I've never had a story destroy my heart this many times
 I've never fallen in love with a tsundere genius girl
 I've never been so conflicted on which waifu is the best
It's not a visual novel
 It's not a game
 It's required playing

This is amazing
 Mindblowing
I was a Steins;Gate maniac since i saw the the first anime episode and i really enjoyed it
 It is actually in my personal top-3 list of the best anime of all time
 I have re-watched it a number of times, so i practically know everything that happens there, like the in's and out's of the infinite time loop
 So when i started to play this VN i was qute sure that it cant really surprise me, since i know the anime version of the story so well
 Oh boy
 i was soo naive
 Let me start with the obvious fact that compared to the anime - here we have a lot more details even on the events that has been shown in the anime
 Time travel theories explaind deeper, we have some additional lines, scenes, etc
But the main attraction point is definetly the ability to reach scenes and endings that were never shown in the anime
 And
the way the choices needed to reach the different world lines are made is so smart that it actually got me very confused
 I was even going to comply that this game is not a visual novel at all, but just an interactive book
 Because in the course of the game there were no standart "choose 1 of 3 actions" popups
 The thing is that there ARE choices
 But they are camouflaged and the game itself never teaches you about that - you have to figure is out for yourself
 Now since i dont consider that as real spoiler i am going to say that aloud:
you make choices when you interact (or dont
) with your phone
 Emails, calls, replys(or not
) - this all matters
Honestly i didnt get it until i have finished up my first playthrough
 I just interacted with the phone as i felt natural and in the end i have reached the Amane Suzuha ending
 When the actual scenes started to divergence from the original canon anime i was really, really surprised, since i wasnt expecting that at all
The feels hit like a truck
 VERY COOL, SUNUVABICH
 Now since i have figured it out i will go for the new playthrough, paying much more attention to what i do to the phone
 Currently i am very excited to see what else the game has in store and which outcome will become the new choice of the Stains Gate
 I am sorry if this review feels a bit scrambled, but i just had an urge to immidiately inform every original anime fan that this VN is a must buy thing, since it adds so much to the Gate world
Also i strongly advice you to not read any guides on your first playthrough, and just see for yourself where you will end up
 Let us meet again in the world of the Gates, comrades

If you read this review you are probably like me and watched the Steins;Gate anime before for whatever reason stumbling across the visual novel on steam and are asking yourself now "Is this game still worth buying even though i know all the major plottwists and the true-route
"The short answer is in my opinion: yes it is
 If you enjoyed the anime as a whole and not just the first or the second half, it's definetly worth buying for multiple reasons
First of all the game gives you a lot more information on the time-travel stuff that's going on and even discusses some theories that are actual theories in real-life and it's pretty well researched by the devs
 However it never goes that deep into science that you, as a normal person, cannot understand what the characters are talking about
 So it's really well blalanced and gives you something to think about while reading
Second the characters get a lot more depth
 I guess that shouldn't come as a surprise, that a visual novel with around 50 hour length develops the characters much more than the anime with around 8 hours
 However not just that the side characters like Faris, Lukako, etc
 get more depth they also get their very own ending route, that, even though it's non-canonical, is worth experiencing
Third the art and the soundtrack in this game are awesome
 But if you've watched the anime and checked the screenshots above the review section you should know that already
Fourth the inner thoughts of Okabe gives you a lot more insight on how he goes through this whole journey
 Even though the anime does a good job in portraying how he kinde descends into madness because of the constant time-looping, reading about his inner thoughts gives you a much better picture about the whole situation
 Also having his phone accessable and reading his e-mail exchange with the fellow characters is pretty well done
Fifth you support the devs
 I mean even if nothing from the above convinced you to buy the game because the price is too high or you are still not sure, just wait for winter-sale or something and buy it then, even if it's just to support the devs
 They just recently released the Steins;Gate 0 visual novel and it might get a steam release as well, if the support is big enough here
 Who knows
All in all it was a really nice experience to read through the novel, even with prior knowlege of the anime
 Sure it does spoiler the major plottwists for you, however it shouldn't hinder the enjoyment you get out of the game
Also sorry for possible grammar-typo mistakes, english is not my first language
Posted: 21 August
Anime was 10/10, perfect in every way
This VN is 11/10
 You get to experience the anime from Okabe's perspective, get ready for some feels

Hands down one of the most intense and mind wrecking visual novels/anime I've seen
 Definitely recommended, sunuvabich

*holds cellphone up*"It's me
 Yes, I've tailed the chosen one
 They're at the Steam store page, ready to enter Stein's Gate
but the Organization has sent its most fearsome enemy, a price tag of $35
 Yes, I've told them that the fate of mankind depends on their purchase
 The adventures of the great Hououin Kyouma, insane mad scientist and ruler of space and time, await them
 Should they proceed with their destiny and click 'Add to Cart', I will meet them at the final battle of Ragnarok, where chaos will descend upon Earth
 With the assistance of the chosen one, nothing can stop us
 Even the Organization will cower in fear
 Such is the choice of Stein's Gate
 El Psy Kongroo
"*puts cellphone down*------Oh, hi
Steins;Gate is an excellent visual novel about time travel, consequence, fate, and a crazy protagonist who spews fantasy conspiracy babble that you can't help but be entertained by
 Seriously, I'm not much for the "mad scientist" trope, but the protagonist (Okabe Rintaro, or "Hououin Kyouma" as he goes by) won me over with his crazy dramatic nonsense and wonderful voice acting (for those wondering, he's not actually a mad scientist, that's just his alter ego fantasy)
Along with its humor, Steins;Gate is also a very heartfelt and complex story that explores themes that are often barely touched by time travel stories and visual novels in general
 It's well worth your time, trust me
Posted: 18 May
I thought that time travel could only be a cheesy plot device that inevitably led to unsatisfying contradictions and unresolved questions
I was wrong
I thought that I wasn't really the sort of person to stay up until early in the morning playing a visual novel game
I was wrong
I thought games with multiple endings were generally just trying to recycle limited content and couldn't deliver a meaningful experience
I was wrong
Any game that shatters that many preconceptions is a great game in my book

So Meta, Even This Acronym
OneShot is cute, imaginative and, at times, simply mind-blowing—and blowing the jaded mind of a modern gamer is not an easy task
 The meta nature of the game is highlighted by its name: you only have one shot at it, and then the save file becomes corrupted
 There won't be a second journey
Only
 how is it fair
 Whatever you do, you will have to face a dilemma in the end, and choosing either of the cruel options is reductive and simply wrong
 Can you
 rebel against the whole thing, perhaps
These, however, are the thoughts you'll deal with by the end, but even before it the game is littered with charming meta-humor
 The main character needs to sleep, for example, and when she does, the game closes
 Some puzzles require thinking very much out of the box and using unexpected approaches
 All the while the touching and lovely story of a hero stranded in a strange land and carrying a lightbulb to light up the local sun continues to unfold
The game is at its most poignant during the moments when the hero interacts with you, the player, whom she considers to be a god
 You get to chat, encourage her, and fight your own enemy—often outside the game
The execution of OneShot leaves something to be desired: while very sweet in terms of visuals, it's often clunky and makes you do a lot of unnecessary walking back and forth solving various puzzles; coupled with imperfect location layouts, it gets frustrating sometimes
 However, I'd say the game itself is charming and unique enough for it to be easily forgivable
Posted: 11 June
I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam
I've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot
I don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context
 (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party
 Be warned
)Transistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life
 They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you
 They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously
However, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason
 In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters
 When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the "eyes" of the protagonist
OneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story
 Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all
 It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close
It was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game
It's really hard to put into words
 but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees
 :DAnyways, random game comparison tangent over
 It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended
 Extremely solid 10/10
If you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc
, this is basically a must-buy

Let's be honest
 When I played OneShot, I didn't expect much
 I got interested because of it's very pretty arstyle, but I didn't know what awaits me here
And, well
I was very suprised
 OneShot was the first game in many years that made me feel so immersed in the world and the story, and for the first time in a long time I felt really attached to the main character
But what is the game about
It takes place in a world where the Sun died, and people are living in darknes
 They only have a little bit of light left, and even that is starting to die out
 But
in this world there is a prophecy that says that a Messiah from another world guided by a God will travel to the Tower with a new Sun and will make the world like it once was
 Then the Messiah will return home, and everyone will live happily ever after
The Messiah is Niko, a small confused child
 And the role of the God belongs to you, the player
Which leads to one of the coolest things about this game - Niko knows about your presence and responds to your actions, asks for advice and even has little chit-chats with you
 And let me tell you something - it's such a sweet, precious kid that it won't be long before you will start really caring about this little kid and you will want them to return home safely
Sadly your journey is not a easy one
 Without the Sun, the world is dying
 While many people greet you with happiness and hope, others react differently
 They don't believe that just bringing back the Sun will be enough to save the world, and they question the point of your journey, and so will you
 Can the world REALLY be saved
What also doesn't help is the fact that Niko doesn't realise that you are as lost and confused as they are
 Luckily, someone will help you on your way
 But be careful - this world has many mysteries, and you will replay the game many times
 You will want to know the truth, and more importantly - you will want to know if you can really save both
But all of that will be answered in time
Maybe

NOTE: This spoiler-free review is accurate as of the newest update (Solstice)
 Due to the content and ending added through this update, I highly recommend this game, and if you have finished the game before this, I implore you to replay it to experience the true ending
 I was introduced to this game by Markiplier's playthrough
 I only heard 10 seconds of what he said before I closed his playthrough and decided to get this game myself, feeling that this game is worth going in blind, and would be one with a lasting impression
It's True
 This is the most emotionally-invested game I've had the pleasure to experience
 Even after the end, it haunts me till today
 and my emotions are so messed up just thinking about my experience that it's difficult to even review it
 Even so
 I'll try
Oneshot is A story-driven puzzle-adventure game
 You play as a cat-like persona named Niko in a Mission to restore a world's lost sun, a large lightbulb
 You only have one chance to save the world
 It seems very straightforward
Except you're not playing as Niko
 You are considered a separate entity
 yourself
 By opening the game, you unwillingly become "god", in charge of a world that operates, exists and disappears at the click of your mouse
 Niko, meanwhile, is just dragged in as the "protagonist", waking up in a different, crumbling world
 a child trying to get back home, to the waiting arms of mommy
 You are essentially Niko's guiding voice, in a world both of you have no understanding of, and are in charge of leading Niko to bring light back to the lands
 and at the same time, bringing Niko back home
Of course, its not that simple
 The game is sentient, aware of how it's a program running on your computer, and will attempt throughout your journey to keep you from returning the sun
 But in the end, it is unable to control your final decision
 and yet, it still gives a last stand by denying you a perfect ending
 It's in control of the story and is hiding things, and without you thinking outside of the box to beat the game's coded "story"
 Niko, the world, and the game itself
 will never find peace
 The writing and story in and of itself is one of this game's strong points, as the amount of fourth-wall breaking and events that reveal the true nature of the world is extremely compelling, especially since its all addressed to who the ingame people think is "god"
 you
The biggest draw to this game, however, is simply How personal it makes the relationship between you and Niko
 Leading Niko feels like leading a younger sibling, in which Niko doesn't really understand what's going on, but will deal with events in their own childlike, innocent way
 During your advanture, Niko also comments on Every action you take and even questions you about our world all in your own name
 which further got me attached to Niko
 Standard game mechanics are also used to strengthen this bond, as when Niko is tired, you have to find a bed to let Niko rest in; this is the only way to save and close the game "naturally", and also initiates dream sequences along with more dialogue between you and Niko
 If you decide to close the window instead, Niko will be afraid and in a state of shock when you open the game again, as you brought darkness to the World Niko is in
 This happens often, to the point where you'll likely be afraid to hurt Niko by closing the game
Yet, despite your cluelessness and inability to explain how you can access things out-of-game
 Niko trusts you
 It's a sort of child-like trust towards an adult that's so innocent that you can't help but love Niko back
 When the game denied me the Opportunity to respond to Niko, who was frantically calling my name
 I Realised that I could do nothing but stare at the screen
 That feeling is horrid, accompanying a person almost all the time
 and then being denied the chance to say "I am here for you"
 Eventually, I wasn't playing for the sake of the world
 I was playing for Niko
 For Niko's happiness, and to hear Niko speak to me again
Niko felt real
 I wasn't ready to let my little cat-like child go, even though that's what I was fighting for this entire time
And that made the full game's ending all the more painful
 You wouldn't expect a person's happiness
 to hurt you so much
OneShot is initially a story of trust and moral decisions, but its true lesson is of attachment
 before Letting go
 The initial ending will make you think of your consequences
 The true ending will make you cry, reluctant to pass the credits
 You only have one shot, as once you complete the story
 you'll want it to stay completed
 And yet
 I Don't want it to end
I'll never forget you, Niko

Do you like a game with a story line
 Like to solve puzzles that makes you think twice
 Like games that make you feel soemthing
 Then this is a game that you've been missing out on since December 6, 2016
 As you might have noticed with all the comments, "trying to explain the game would spoil the game"
All I can say is that OneShot is an experience that you won't forget anytime soon
 Just a small note though, "Prepare yourself for a great OST, along with some pancakes
 We love pancakes
"

"The world knows you exists"I cannot describe just how amazing this game is
OneShot is a game where this game breaks the 4th wall and knows about your existance
You are guiding a character named Niko
Niko wakes up in another world that is "decaying"
This world is dying because its sun went out and your mission is to save the world
However
your choices will affect the gameplay
This game breaks the 4th wall by knowing that YOU exist
It has puzzles that you have to find out using your computer, and not the game itself
This game, is by far, the most amazing game I have played
I never know that I can grow attacthed to a cute character as Niko
The soundtrack is really good, the storyline is amazing, and the characters are well placed
This
is the first game that legit
made me cry
I would totally recommend this game to people, because its simply really good
Edit: I just completed
the "original" ending
I'm
crying
Posted: 27 June
Like Undertale, this game is about a young child trying to get home after falling into a land of strange creatures while being blessed with a "videogame" power
 However while Undertale is bright and cheery, OneShot is quiet and somber
 If you liked Undertale, give it a shot

The Walking Dead is a story-driven adventure game
Though it feels more like an interactive story, than an actual game, it still got me from the first minute
There is not much gameplay in it, you walk here and there and talk to other people and every now and then you need to make choices (for most of them there is a short time limit)
There are a lot likable (and not so likable) characters
 Together with the choices you have to make, it is a thrilling and emotional experience
Highly recommended if you like story-driven games and/or adventures

Posted: 25 November, 2014
Loved every part of this game
Some people may argue that your choices don't actually matter, and I'd say they are not wrong
 But they are not right either
 The choices you make in the game may not have an impact on the end itself, but it will have an impact on how the story gets told to you
Posted: 29 November, 2013
I really have to say this game is almost perfection
 I was worried about it going in that it would focus too much on random zombie action and take away from WHY we love the Walking Dead
 We like it because it actually has story and character development
 Not just random gore
 The game is a point and click adventure
 If that's not your type of game wait for the crappy FPS coming out soon
 (That I'll still probably play
) The timed decisions mechanic is a great move from the developers
 Only have seconds to make a split choice really ripens the tension and panic of your situations
 On top of that the game has a lot of content
 5 full episodes that can be a couple hours each to finish, with different paths and outcomes depending on how your handle things
 Every choice you make can affect you way later down the road to similar to the style Mass Effect recently took
If your a fan of the show, comics, zombies in general and like a good game that will challenge your wit and morals, get it
Posted: 3 June
96/100-3 The choices you make doesn't change the ending
 This lowers the replay value
 It's still a great and unpredictable story
-1 A few too many bugs where people are either levitating or the game freezes for a second
Posted: 28 January, 2015
UPDATE: The bug I mentioned below has now been fixed in an update
 I've also finished the game and there are no substantial issues with the game, or any real changes outside of the fact that the stealth sections have paths on the minimap showing you where to go now in order to make them easier
 The game's last moments still leave a bit to be desired, but the majority of the story is good enough that I would definitely recommend this
As a word of warning, at the moment this game seems to save your game based on your steam name
 What this means is that changing your name causes the game to forget where your save is, and if you have any quotation marks, question marks, or any punctuation that isn't allowed in a windows folder name, the game just freezes after you choose your language at the start
I haven't played the game past the opening yet, but I finished the original Indigo Prophecy and the original Fahrenheit release from GOG and assuming they haven't broke anything it's a great game aside from the ending so I'll leave the recommendation at a yes anyways
Posted: 29 January, 2015
At $10 regular price this isn't bad
 I remember playing the demo for the game when I was younger and always being intrigued
 Having played the whole thing now I can say I was a little disappointed
 + Story holds up well until the final act+ Port runs very well
 Maxed out and only had a few weird FPS drops in cutscenes
 + Acting is pretty solid all around+ Gamepad support+ Uncensored version :)- QTE's in this game are ANNOYING, simon says stick moving that goes on forever or controller breaking button mashing- Like I said, the story kinda falls off towards the end- Awkward camera$10 is a fair asking price for this game, but if you're on the fence, wait for a steam sale
Posted: 7 June
Back to 2005, Indigo Prophecy (or Fahrenheit as uncensored version) developed by Quantic Dream
 It's first game that introduces new combination between adventure game and interactive cutscene
 The idea is to provide the movie-like experience and let audiences participate on each event rather than watch the whole scene
 The story introduces supernatural drama thriller where all the things begin in one of New York's Diner as very strong intro
 You take control the character perspectives for both murderer and investigators
 Each character is intriguing and has their own personality where you learn from story and your interaction
 Whats make Fahrenheit unique is storytelling and choices, most in-game interactions and dialogues have consequences in term of moral and ethics
 It could impact on your character mental state or change the pace of story or both along with well-executed and connection between characters
The gameplay involves environmental and dialogue interaction that required mouse swiping as it gives strong feelings of control
 Some scenes allow you to explore small section and interact at you own will or switch between characters to observe and progress the story
 The game also contain heavy QTE in most physical action sequences
 Require player's reflex action which might distract player from whole cinematic scenes
Remastered version offers sharpen textures, new UI, and some typographical changes which are slightly different from original
 It's also uncensored version which contain some nudity contents I used to play on retailed version
On the other hand, mouse interaction are quite unnecessary in some parts
 Transition between two types of QTE might get annoying and bit over usage
 The story pacing also heavily change in final
 It's bit letdown and less interaction compare where the first act is so interesting
Fahrenheit might have some gameplay flaws and story itself left some unexplained answers
 But it first brings fully interactive movie into video games
 It's classic, unique, and intriguing in direction
 Set the new standard of video game as we see nowadays
Plus, I personally did love songs and ambient soundtracks
Posted: 26 October
I'm really on the fence about this one
 I'm glad I played it, but at the same time I feel relieved it's over
Good stuff:- Interesting story
 - The idea of controlling the characters the way you do in this game is interesting
- You get to play many different characters
 - The boxing match
- It's a unique experience and you'll get to say to your friends "I played that game
 And finished it"
- Nice music
- Police isn't stupid
 - I want Carla's apartment
 Bad stuff:- This game has the WORST camera controls I have ever seen
 I watched almost half the game with the camera stuck behind a column, desk or another obstacle
 Especially when you really need to see where you're going (for example the stealth missions) the camera stays at your side showing you the scenic view and won't budge
- The controls suck
 They are awful and buggy
 Half the times they won't register
- Even after so many years, playing the remastered version, there are so many bugs, characters circling around themselves for no reason or going through walls
- I could take the joystick pushing (even enjoyed it some times), but the left-right clicking hurt after a while
 - Guys -and only guys- shower with their underpants on in this game
 - Choices don't matter as much as you think throughout the game
 Only a couple ones really matter
- It's weird that you can't make your character run when in a hurry
 I clicked "Yes" on the recommendation, because you might end up enjoying the experience and you would miss out otherwise
 But the frustration level is really high
 Be warned

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered Original Release: 2005 (2015 Remastered Steam Version) Genre Tags: Story-Driven; QTE; Mature; Noir; Adventure; Casual
My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-12 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Nostalgia chasers; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamers REVIEWI saw a number of other reviews on the store page mentioning bugs, crashing, and other such technical difficulties
That is unfortunate; however, I didn’t experience any serious issues
Did the game work flawlessly
 No
But it certainly worked sufficiently for me to enjoy the experience
Actually, I didn’t experience any problems that affected my enjoyment of the game at all, only insignificant things like the screen resizing a few times on start up
As such, I’m going to review the actual game experience
I’m sure this will bother some people
Oh well
So I never heard of Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy in the past, so the nostalgic aspect is lost on me personally
But I really enjoyed playing it and the unique identity that it offered
Even though it is an older game, I found it to be a refreshing experience
Whether or not you’ve played this in the past, I would imagine most fans of story-driven games with QTE action will enjoy the experience
 The core gameplay involves moving around your characters and interacting with the environment to unravel a mystery
There is a lot of freedom to discover or ignore certain things, but the core arc of the story can’t be affected
The narrative is pretty interesting and the atmosphere is well developed
It felt like the mid-late game is a bit rushed, but I suppose too much filler would have caused it to grow boring anyway
Regardless, the best part of the narrative is the characters
They have some actual depth, which many game developers still overlook this many years later
 And the voice acting is mostly pretty good with very few cringe-worthy parts
 If I was going to nitpick then I would point out that a few lines bothered me as a New Yorker because they weren’t natural (like how the cops say “New York Police” all the time and never say “NYPD”)
 But who likes a nitpicker
 Not me
The “action” boils down to QTE segments that are actually fast paced and can be challenging on the high difficulties
Obviously, it can only be as exciting as QTEs can be (not very); but I would say it’s some of the most exciting QTE action I’ve experienced
No worries though, it is a breeze on easy if you just want to enjoy the story and exploration/investigation aspects
Furthermore, you’ll probably want to play with a controller if you can; I found it significantly more comfortable to execute the QTEs
My main, and basically only, gripe with the game is the ridiculous camera action
Posted: 24 October, 2015
Short version: 64%Imagine a DVD player which is powered by you playing Guitar Hero on Expert mode with a mouse
 Combine it with a terrific thriller to get Fahrenheit: a horrendous video game hiding a great cinematic experience
Long version:When it came out in 2005, Fahrenheit offered something new by focusing exclusively on the narrative and nothing else
 It was a true interactive movie with cinematic techniques like split scenes displaying the same events from multiple points of view (like in the TV show ‘24’)
The plot is entirely character-driven and focuses on three main leads: Lukas, a murderer on the run; and Carla and Tyler, the two detectives on his trail
 Their stories are split into more than thirty chapters on two separate threads that eventually meet in one big finale
A finale about superpowers, Mayan prophecies, an artificial intelligence, and somehow preventing the freezing of the planet with a martial arts showdown against an immortal priest
 If you thought the end of Matrix: Revolutions jumped the rails, it has nothing on this game
Sadly the derailment of the plot is vastly overshadowed by gameplay issues
 The controls are horrid, no matter what control scheme you choose: for example, basic actions like picking up something require at least four-five mouse or stick gestures with bad movement detection
 The few puzzles make absolutely no sense, and all key scenes are progressed by playing a double quick-time event that obstructs the entire screen
 By the way, on easy mode, this minigame leaves roughly a quarter of a second window for each action before failing
I have no doubts that Fahrenheit was one of the best things ever in its time, but it aged horribly
 If you missed it originally, you are far better off just watching a longplay than trying to suffer through its controls

this game is cool
 and then gets entertainingly weird, definitely worth playing Not much of a 'remaster' though
 at least it's cheap+Points for continuing the trend of being able to switch to old graphics and back at the touch of a button in re-releases

A cult classic with a unique approach to storytelling and a polarizing third act
2005’s “Fahrenheit” or “Indigo Prophecy” (the latter was the name given to the censored version released in the USA and other countries) was marketed as the first interactive film
 At a time where few games dared to be like movies, David Cage (who was lead director and writer) aimed to bridge the gap and show that video games can also tell deep and meaningful stories
 Whether Fahrenheit actually did this successfully is up for debate, but what’s known for certain is that David Cage changed the landscape of video games in a huge way
The idea that this game is indeed a movie or movie-like experience is reinforced several times
 As soon as you launch the game you’re greeted with a main menu with several options
 One of them happens to be “New movie”, and when you hover your cursor over the option, a billboard with the game’s title appears on your screen
 When you decide to start a new game: your screen becomes permanently letterboxed (which once again gives you the impression that you are watching a movie)
 This game desperately wants for you to think it’s a movie but thanks to the intuitive controls and surprising amount of gameplay, you’re greatly immersed in this adventure
http://steamcommunity

id=686668516Controls are a pretty simple affair
 The WASD keys move your character around whilst left-clicking and swiping your mouse is needed to interact with objects and other people
 This all feels very natural and you can even just hold right-click and left-click at the same time and use your mouse to move the character instead
 In-between regular cutscenes are action scenes which are essentially long QTE sequences
 There is a hell of a lot of QTEs in this game, which some have likened to a game of “Simon Says”, and they can be quite annoying unless you stick with them
 It’s arguably Fahrenheit’s biggest flaw and I had to warn you all in case someone comes to my house and kills me for recommending this game
 There are also lots of choices to make, which directly ties in with the game's mood mechanic (certain options or a combination of them will either make your character happy or send them into a depression), but the game is ultimately a linear experience in the end and this mechanic is not as irritating as it sounds
Fahrenheit’s story on the other hand, is harder to judge fairly
 Fahrenheit has arguably one of the best intros in all of video games - and there’s so much potential - but by the time you’ve reached the end of the game: the tone, pacing and story has changed so dramatically and so quickly too
 This is sadly due to the fact that this game was meant to be part 1 of a trilogy, but at the last minute this plan was ditched… and the developers tried their best to conclude the game with what they had
 It’s not a terrible ending, but most players will definitely be left confused after thinking that this was a crime-thriller title
 I guess this is why Fahrenheit has become a cult classic
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=686638376Even as a huge fan of this game I have to admit the writing from French developers “Quantic Dream” is pretty hit and miss
 One character named Tyler (who is African American) is treated in such a stereotypical fashion which undermines the serious tone of the game and David Cage’s intent to honestly tell a deep and meaningful story
 Tyler has become something of a running joke in the Fahrenheit fan community but I guess it’s just another one of those things that led to this title becoming a cult classic
 All of this aside, Fahrenheit’s story is still decent for me and there’s some truly epic moments sprinkled throughout
 I really felt what the characters were going through at certain times (this can be attributed to some of the great tracks in this game) and most of them were relatable to me because their situations often had them doing mundane tasks
As for the remaster done by Aspyr: most of the texture work is subtle
 There’s a minor facelift throughout but in some areas the original textures might be preferred
 Thankfully there’s an option to change from remastered textures to original at any given time (via a single button press) which is pretty cool
 The QTE buttons that appear on your screen have also been slightly changed in both appearance and size (they’re much larger now)
 It's worth noting that Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy, which is the name for this remaster, is also the uncensored version of the game which very few countries ever got
 Another plus in my book
 The game hasn’t aged really well but apart from some minor screen tearing, which I only noticed on my last playthrough and may not have been the game's fault, it worked just fine on my PC
 I wish Aspyr did get to change the models in Fahrenheit but apparently they didn’t have access to much of the original game’s art pipeline
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=594985543Obviously I’m a bit biased when it comes to Fahrenheit but I’d still recommend it to anyone who is in the least bit curious about the title
 It’s a quirky, unique game and for the price of $10 you really haven’t got much to lose
 I’ll give it a 7
5/10

Bizarre game
 Packed with adrenaline moments
 (if you have it on hard you don't have much time to react) If you like heavy story games and aren't pessimistic about games using quick time events (which this game has 90% of) then you'll like this one
Get past the graphics and bad animations and you get an interesting tale to share with your friends

I think many that level bad scores and a list of complaints at Mass Effect 2 have fallen into the trap of looking at games purely as a collection of mechanics
 Sure, it's another cover shooter, which taken alone is merely decent
 They're right that the RPG elements are simple and at times are obtuse and too black and white
 You can, at least partially, break the upgrade system by grinding resource collection
 Given all that it would seem there is no reason to even play this game but you'd be wrong
 This game, and the whole series, is trying to be more than just mindless entertainment
 It's trying to to tell a deep, rich story, trying to get you to really care about it's characters, and it's trying to get you to think beyond the mechanics, beyond the game even
 By no means is this just a story with some game attached, but the story and how your decisions effect it and it's characters are a huge part of this game
When you play this game, because to be clear, you should play it, I would urge you to try and actually role play the choices
 This game brings up some pretty serious issues in some of it's choices
 Issues that should stop and make you think, not just about how this will effect your game but about how you would actually feel about this in your everyday life
 You can always go back and play it again and make all the "good" or "bad" choices but at least once you should really put yourself in Cmd
 Shepard's shoes, make the choices you would be comfortable making outside the game
 Don't worry about what the game says your moral score is, play it to learn something about yourself

I recommend the game--just not as a digital download
 The buying options on Steam are misleading (I don't think this is Steam's fault, I believe it is more of an issue with how Bioware chose to package their content); Buying the "Digital Deluxe Edition" DOES NOT include ALL in-game content
 NONE of the DLCs are packaged into the "Digital Deluxe Edition
" And NONE of the DLC is purchasable on Steam
 This is NOT readily apparent unless you carefully read the description on Steam
 Furthermore, to access the alleged extras in this DDE version, you must make a Bioware account, find the proper pages, download the alleged extras manually, and install manually before you can play them
 I originally played ME 2 on PS3, having bought a disk edition that had all the DLCs included
 That is your best bet for this game unfortunately
 If you buy the digital download, by the time you have all the content (vanilla game + DLCs) you will be sinking WAY more money into Bioware's money grubbing hands then this 6+ year old game is worth

Did you know there’s a game where you can come back from death, blow up prisons, take on three factions of mercenaries, deal with wars between species, survive a Suicide Mission and get in a relationship with the hot alien you want
 Nominated as the best game of the generation, winning 150 awards of Game of the Year of 2010 and building so much hype that its sequel couldn’t be more than disappointing, Mass Effect 2 is a game you have to play
Even if you didn’t play the first one, you won’t be left in the dark, people will tell you what’s the deal and the codex has all the extra details
 If you played the first one, then you’ll enjoy the fact that your choices carry over and have some weight on what’s happening
The combat involves 3rd person camera, using your class specific abilities and guns and giving commands to your squadmates and it has an interface made for PC
 There are 6 classes and each of them are varied enough for every playthrough to feel like a fresh experience
 Some are more power based, other weapon focused, but all of them do damage and are awesome and you’ll definitely find your type, whether you like to make shockwaves in the enemy lines, hack the robots, pull them in a singularity, cloak yourself and shoot them in the back or simply slow down time to shoot them while they wonder what’s happening with them
 There are difficulties that vary from casual from insanity, so whether you play games for their story or want to dominate the dominators, you’ll find what you want
 http://steamcommunity

id=312867227 Many will say the story is great
 I say it’s a good one, but that its characters make it to be one of the best
 80% of it you recruit team members and gain their loyalty(only if you want to)
 They all prove themselves to be interesting and you’ll have enough dialogue options to find out what makes them tick

I would give both my legs for the chance to play this franchise for the first time again
 No other game has moved me in such a way that mass effect has
 It is just
 Unbelievable
 I have 42 playthroughs, one being on pc, the others being on my 360
 This game is the best game I have ever had the pleasure of playing
 And I can't thank Bioware enough for such a beautiful ride
Then we get to mass effect 3
 EA, you complete wankstains
 You endorse good games, (I'm EA Games, and this is a game to ruin on the internet) and you help produce them wonderfuly, until it gets to the end sequence, then your money instincs kick in and you want it finished in an unfinished state

Posted: 30 December, 2013
If you havent played the original Mass Effect, this game is still a must play
 You wont be lost as to whats going on, as long as you check out the codex section on the in-game menu
 This game is AMAZING and the story line, voice acting, graphics and overall gameplay are all impressive
 This game is ahead of its time, dont miss it
From the ominous opening music, until the final decisions through the Omega-4 Relay are made, the perfection builds every step of the way
 Sure, there are many cinematic games that play like a novel and are fantastic but Ive never been pulled into a game with a "need to play" like ME2 has done
The diversity of the characters and backstory make you feel as if this universe has been developed for a long, long time, and you are only now being introduced to it
 The characters make you care about them with their depth, and this increases moreso as the game goes on
 I've never experienced anything like it, and Bioware really set the bar with dialogue and character interaction
 The "choices' you are given never feel like lines from a bad movie, like so many games, but are believable and accurate to the story and what you intended to say
The game itself is an exciting RPG/3rd Person Shooter
 When you start you can choose from a few classes
 Some are excellent at biotic powers and some are just for shooting things the old fashion way
 I chose soldier and because of that I had very little biotic powers
 I could slow down time but that's about it
 The biotic side of the game for me was my crew mates
 You level them up along with yourself when you gain squad points
 As you add skill points to a skill it becomes stronger until you reach full potential then you have two versions of it to choose from
 The gunplay in the beginning of the game was a little boring but it became really fun once you were able to upgrade and get new versions of your weapons
 That added a lot of depth to the combat
 There are also different types of ammo to use that increases your weapons attributes
 Nothing is more satisfying then freezing an enemy an watching them implode
When a game ropes you in, like this one did for me, and creates that yearning to play, the developer has done their job
 This game plays like an epic film, but one that creates a universe that I think is on par with any of the great space-epic movies and tv series, and that alone is something
 This game is a pivotal point for me in regards to gaming, and it has changed the way I will evaluate and appreciate all games in the future
Simply put, one of the best game I've ever played
Posted: 20 July, 2015
In this game you can:- punch a journalist- headbutt a Krogan- friendzone a sociopath- fight and risk your life for the loyalty of your ungratef
 erm, best friends- party hard with Asari in da club- buy a fish and a space hamster- use extremely valuable and ancient artifacts as paperweight in your office with the space hamsterAh, you can also epically save the galaxy in your free time

I just finished Austin Jorgenson's LISA and can say that, without a doubt, it is among the strongest indie RPGs I have ever played
 I was hooked on the world of LISA with the slight taste given by the prequel, LISA: The First, which had me eagerly awaiting this title
 The developer cites Mother as a key influence and that shows, but even more than the abstract game OFF, LISA has taken the wacky humor and surreal style of Mother into a dark and very adult place
 Dingaling is able to take simple, old school pixels and work them into truly disturbing imagery
 Lately, we have been inundated with post-apocalyptic settings that are xeroxed and re-sampled at will: zombies, plague, fallout and bad weather
 All of those settings, done to death, are fairly grim, but none of them can even touch the misery suggested by LISA
 Here we have a world where women are extinct and the surviving men, seeing no future for humanity, have transformed the society into a sort of prison yard where hopelessness is drowned in drugs and alcohol, and memories seem uniformly sad
 The main protagonist, Brad, is driven by a past filled with abuse and grief, and literally sets himself against the will of the entire world
 The player will be forced to make tough decisions in this game and to eventually think about and judge the outcome
 Even as we laugh at sight gags and endless pro wrestling references, one cannot ignore the uneasy slithering quality of LISA
 My greatest hope is that the game does well and Dingaling games develops more titles where the heart of the game is a great story, not the ability to snipe someone in multiplayer
 Bravo

A tale of a broken man in a land of perverts and Joy
Crude,Rude, and lewd
 Lisa stars a man who's been broken for many years, incapable of forgiven himself for the loss of his sister long ago, both beaten and abused by their father
 Brad Armstrong grew up protecting his friends and teaching karate in his dojo
 Envied by his friends, hated by his father and deeply traumatized by the loss of his sister Lisa Armstrong he soon resorted to painkillers to forget and wipe away his regrets
The world erased in a white flash, everything changed and everything destroyed
 Mankind had its females seemingly removed from existance and the world crumbled into a inhospitable place, mutants, gangs, perverts, murderers and psychopaths rule the world now
 In the middle of this is Brad who'd become addicted to Joy a new drug in this destroyed world now using it to kill his past
 One day when taking a hit of Joy a baby all of a sudden appears in his arms, not only that but a female one
Brad taking this child to his friends rejects the idea of giving her up for a better living to the local gang leader Rando, Instead he sees this child, now named Buddy as a secound chance
 As his daughter or maybe just a means to put his past to rest
 Wether its either is up to the player since not all of the cards are on the table
The only thing known is that you will suffer and your actions will cause suffering
All in all Lisa is a strong RPG, the roster is amazing, the story is blank enough to allow speculation
The soundtrack is unique and amazing
 The art style is off the walls and the whole world is a perverted joke and will have you cringing and creeped out by its warpedness
 The game is a clear shoutout to Mother and Earthbound and Mad Max so old school gamers and RPG lovers with adore this game
However due to its limited side scrolling the map can be confusing at times, cliffs can easily be jumped off of to your death, bugs and glitches do occur, enemies can permanantly kill allies and the amount of status effects can be confusing
Its probably one of my most favorite games on steam right now and in existance, The story made me feel for Brad and Buddy aswell as making me feel the weight of losing an arm or a party member to one bad move or choice on my part
 You will feel hurt playing this but in the end the game does what it wanted to, to make you feel
 Honestly whats a good game
 One that makes you feel for what its created
 Wether you on purposely play as a selfesh person or a selfless one, or something in between you will feel like you made a impact in this broken and beautifull world

Holy crap
Powerful
This game explores some serious life issues: Abuse
 The pain of childhood, and of parenthood
 Manhood and womanhood
 Strength
 Loss
This game had me near crying at several points
 The story is freaking powerful
 It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times
 And the gameplay
 It's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it
 This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e
g
, sleeping can be dangerous)
 Battles are challenging
 Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered
 I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes
 The game doesn't hold your hand
 There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier
 You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments
 Characters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences
 There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision
 Will you save your friends, or your stuff
 I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it
 You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose
 Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done
 All the options sucked
 But I can't help asking myself, "Did I make the right choice
" Highly recommended

Do you like Earthbound
Do you like Great stories
Do you like staring into the depths of human decay and depravity, unearthing memories of childhood abuse, familial pain and regret, long buried by decades of drug abuse when finally a fleeting light of redemption gives you the strength to move on and quit drugs; Nurture that small light, only to have that light once again taken away by the rest of the world in a vain and futile attempt to prolong its own wasting existence
Do you like goofy humor

I'm not going to extensively rate the aspects of this game, it's just--After playing for almost 10 hours, it's still not over, yet the gameplay or atmosphere don't feel stale
 The world of the game is relatively big, but it feels enormous due to the amount of things you can do
I don't understand
 How can a cheap RPGmaker game achieve that
 How much time hard work was poured into it
 It's mind-boggling
Almost every joke is placed with surgical precision into the story, providing fresh and morbid experience for the player
Art is the perfect tie-in, amplifying the tone of this game to suit the narrative
And, most of all, the gameplay feels smooth
 Smooooth
Without doubt, it draws inspiration from Mother games
 I'd call it "LISA: "Earthboud" for crude and rude adults
" And I like it
Posted: 14 January, 2015
This might literally be the coolest game I've ever played, and possibly the best game that I've played in the last 10 years
Though, I might be the wrong person to ask though as Earthbound is my favorite game, and this game is obviously heavily Earthbound inspired
 Stylistically and comedy wise anyway
 The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game
 The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered
I did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours
 For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright
 The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog
 I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet
Anyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it
 You won't regret it

Lisa tells the story of Brad, a broken man, forsaken by hope, who relies on self-medication to forget his haunting past
 The setting is a post-apocalyptic wasteland, where women no longer exist and porn magazines replace money
 Lust has made monsters of the men that have survived
 You will encounter characters that will fight relentlessly or kill themselves before your eyes
 Soaked with despair, this world varies from being horrid to hilarious
Death is ever-present and you can lose your companions permanently or sacrifice parts of yourself to spare their lives
 Do you deserve your arm anyway
The story begins when the protagonist Brad finds an infant girl, and is given the chance to right his wrongs and spare her the pain he suffered
 Keeping her isolated, although she represents the future for a world that has none
Lisa tells an eventful, compelling story that will make you laugh, aggravate you, and quite often leave you disturbed
 I enjoyed every moment of it and recommend it to everyone that shares a fascination for games that explore the cruel depths of the human mind

If you've just gone through a bad breakup, lost a loved one, had a pet die, or are otherwise in a bad place, this is what you need to do:1) Set aside 15-ish hours of your life where you won't be disturbed
2) prepare some light, bland meals and drinks for those 15 hours
3) Play LISA
 No breaks
 No interruptions
 No contact with the outside world for any reason
 It isn't going to make anything feel better, if anything it'll make you feel worse
 But as you feel the inside of your soul rusting and peeling, you may find some shreds of catharsis
 There are jokes, placed like a breadcrumb trail, to keep you holding on just so long to see what is going to happen to the sad, sad man you're spending your time with
 At some point you may hit a wall and consider giving up
 Don't
 I played through the first 3-ish acts of this game, and then put it down for a year, and it still punched me in the gut when I went and finished it
 I can't imagine how unpleasant it'll be to play it straight through
But why am I telling you to play a game that makes you feel awful
 Very simple: for the same reason that a cultured individual should watch Irreversible, or Come and See, or Magnolia or Requiem for a Dream, or read Exquisite Corpse or Funeral RItes
 Because it's a stunning, beautiful piece of art, and sometimes, it's healthy to expose yourself to complicated, unpleasant, scary feelings
 You will come out the other side purged
 Once you're done1) Have a shower2) Make some tea3) Call your parents and tell them you love themThe only game that made me feel worse than LISA was probably Demonophobia, and I stopped playing that after twenty minutes when I realised that people were supposed to be getting off on it

This game surely has the potential to be translated into English
Plot: 10/10Don't want to spoil this game too much so please check for yourself
Music: 10/10Never expected such high quality music to appear in a Chinese IF game
 Shocked by the first several tunes
 Last time I was shocked by a game's BGM was in undertale
Gameplay: 8
5/10Noval idea and brilliant language tricks, also some surprises which expand the depth of this game in mid-late game, but is a little bit repetitive
Overall: 9/10Extraordinary plot, amazing music, interesting puzzles, diggable lore
-0
5 some of the choices are not so 'logical' on a second thought
+1 The music and text coordinate so well in this game, creating a highly immersive experience
-0
5 could have more branches and endings, maybe add them in a DLC
 In conclusion, if you are a fan of traditional interactive fiction games, or games like undertale/papers, please where you have to make a lot of choices, this game will surely give you something very familiar yet very different
Posted: 7 June
An innovative game of considerable quality with a fresh take on interactive fiction
With little of the repetitive clicking that we so often see in IF, the story and dialogue are highly compact, even to someone as impatient as me
 That said, the story is by no means bland or simple
 It is an immersive, engaging tale that manages to weave in charismatic characters with diverse, yet believable backgrounds and distinct personalities that develop as the game progresses
 Given the game's nature (branching outcomes, multiple character stories progressing in parallel, leaps in time, mysteries and sci-fi etc
), I am rather amazed at how the stories manage to connect and intertwine with minimal flaws in logic
 There are certain segments that I feel could be more meaningful/could be further explored, but personally I do find the story to be set at a comfortable pace
 The game is peppered with countless CGs of very high quality throughout
 I am not an expert when it comes to art/design, but I did appreciate the attention to detail that helped show more of the characters and the story setting
 Music and voice-acting is pretty great too
 Each story piece (represented by a square block) has multiple outcomes but there is often a "true" or "best" outcome which is required for the next piece to open up
 The more text pieces to manipulate, the more combinations, hence the more outcomes that have to be created
 This means that many outcomes tend to feature only a minimal change in detail, although it is understandable given the tight budget and the sheer number of outcomes that have to be created
 Fortunately, alternative outcomes do contain interesting "what-if" scenarios, CGs and/or information that are otherwise not found in the "true" one, so there is still some value in exploration
That said, this game is in no way perfect
 The gameplay, while fairly creative, does get a bit dry and repetitive halfway through
 Sometimes, it is difficult to follow the author's logic ("why is it that rearranging the text in this sequence results in this ending
")
 The overuse of the illusion of choice also cheapens the outcome occassionally
 There are also a few bugs, although nothing that seriously interrupts gameplay
 As an IF game, its innovation is notable; as a Chinese indie game, its quality (art, music, voice acting) sets a good standard; however, it still lacks polishing here and there
On overall, it is a worthy purchase for one to kill time
 It also shows the tremendous potential Chinese indie games and IF games possess
 I truly hope that an English translation can come out soon so that I can recommend it to my English-speaking friends

My first comment goes to this one
This game is not so common in steam but more welcomed in eastern culture
 The gameplay is using choices to control the fate to the character or characters to lead to several ending
The uniqueness of this one is the choice is to switch the sequence of two peoples' talks
 And you can easily see their choices of talks will affect the fate of theirs and others from the tree diagram
Sometimes S level choice might not always lead to the best results
The story is interesting and the music is quite beautifully done to be in tune with the mood
I have always been a fan of such type of game
 I have seen some examples in Japanese games
 This one is Chinese
 Well done
But, there is always a but, some of the lines might not very much logical
 It happens because the line will be switched between different situations
 In order to get all the trophies and badges, it could be repetitious to a certain extent
Still I will recommend it
 The only thing is that it would very difficult to translate into English, I suppose
Posted: 16 June
A creative gameplay system coupled with the intriguing and touching story line
 The music and CGs in the game are also extremely well made
 I would definitely recommend this to people who are interested in mystery/story driven games
 However, as of now, the game is only available in Chinese
 I look forward to an English patch of the game, so I can recommend it to my friends who do not speak Chinese
 All in all, I give it a "whatareyouwaitingforjustfreakingbuyit/10"

Looking forward to seeing the English and French versions of this game, even though the very concept of the game makes the translation considerably difficult
Meanwhile, a little review in English for those who would be intrigued by the concept
---Intrigued by the original design of this game, I played the Chinese version and was very pleasantly surprised
The principle of the game is unique, you play a goddess with a supernatural power: inverting the order of words in the letters that you receive from desperate characters who ask for help, and by this, changing the meaning of the sequence of words, and thus the course of past events and the fate of these same characters
You receive letters as you go and you discover at the same time the interwoven stories full of adventures of dozens of characters with entirely different social background, age, profession and nationalities
The characters are very interesting and endearing and the story rich, magical, dark sometimes yet still full of humanity
 I recommend it to all visual nouvel enthusiasts or those who are looking for original stories without being afraid to read tons of dialogue :)The +:- Very interesting characters- Rich and touching stories- Original and interesting gameplay- Beautiful CG & OSTThe - :- Maybe too many dialogues for those who are not used to it- Obligation to re-read the same dialogues while trying several different solutions- The game could become a bit repetitive after a few hours- Solutions are not always logical- The ending (the story of the "goddess") is a little disappointing

It's a rollercoaster of emotions and it really pulls you in
I don't say this lightly, but it's a masterpiece

This is the only game that has actually been good enough to make me want to write a review
 All for $5

This game taught me how to hit on girls online
 Not that i need it or anything but you know
 it's always good to have more knowlegde of your own gender
 It really shows me what a hard time boys have talking to girls
 I never knew that forgetting a girl's favorite music band
could have such big impact on a relationship

Emily is Away Too is the sequel to Emily is Away
The first game, which was free to play, was absolutely fantastic, especially because of its finale:
no matter what you felt or what you wanted to do, your choices would always bring the same conclusion of you unable to say to Emily that you wanted to be more than friends, and her spending the summer with her boyfriend
 But that was not because of "lazyness" by the developer: it was intentional, and in fact, towards the end of the game,
even if you try expressing your feelings your character would delete what you wanted to say replacing the messages with generic questions
 In my opinion, the intention was to deliver the message that
sometimes in life, especially when dealing with relationships with other people, there is simply nothing you can do except accepting other people's choices and move on
It was a very powerful ending that left me thinking about it for days after finishing the game, even if it was a short experience
Unfortunately, while playing this game I did not feel the same, powerful emotions that I did with the first one
 This is because the game features several different endings, this time with two girls instead of just Emily, which isn't a bad thing per se, but it contrasts with the power of the message of the first one
 Moreover, here
you can actually achieve not one, but several "good" endings
I liked the integration with your desktop and browser, plus the many different references to artists, TV shows and movies from 10 years ago
There are still some "twists" present here, and if you make certain choices you will encounter situations similar to what you do in the first game, but as I said, I feel that they are not as effective as the original game
That does not mean this is a bad game by any means: I would still recommend it, especially for its low price, but make sure to download and play the previous one first
 It's free, too

Despite it’s flaws and simplicity, the original ‘Emily Is Away’ managed to capture a poignant snapshot of youth navigating relationships throughout the transition from high school to college, set entirely within a lovingly recreated AOL-like messenger system
 It not only ignited imagination and nostalgia, but allowed itself to tell an emotionally engaging story in very low-tech yet aesthetic means
 Through a storyline that’s arguably simple and cliche, the novel method of storytelling is able to shine, employing creative devices relevant to it’s context; the use of typing indicators to create suspense and convey hesitation, the occasional forced re-wording of idealistic dialogue choices which protagonist finds himself unable to go through with once it comes to hitting ‘send’, the difference between Emily or the protagonist being the first to initiate a conversation

When Walking Dead is full of sadness and depressionWolf Among Us is full of mystery and dangerous detectivity Game of Thrones is full of shocking moments and regrettable choices that make you think if you did something wrong or too wrongThen Tales From The Borderlands is full of laughs and good time, with fun gameplay where you do not regret every second your choices and have a joy while playing it
(Big thanks to everyone who did rate up this review, i appreciate your support)

Borderland's humour with telltale gameplay, best combination
There are 113% less guns when compared to other Borderlands-games (I know that isn't really possible, but there just aren't enough 9s to describe the lack of guns with 99,9999something%) but you'll recognize it
Don't play if you can't deal with pressure, some choices have to be made painfully fast, but for those who can handle it, definitely try this even if you haven't played Borderlands before
If this review gets over 50 ratings, I will name my first child "Loader Bot
" (I probably won't get children or even 15 ratings on this so I feel safe making that promise)

The Walking Dead is serious and realistic, The Wolf Among Us is dark and full of suspense
 And Tales from the Borderlands is funny and action packed
---------------------------Just finished the series, and man, it's #@
$ good
 I would say this is the best Telltale games so far, it can make you laugh out loud, yet it can also make you cry out loud
 And also, you get to learn a moral from this story:Friends are important, together we can achieve anything :D

It's not exactly Walking Dead, and it's not exactly Borderlands
 But if you enjoy one or both of those, you should love this game
 It still keeps in a lot of Borderlands elements (inventory, loot, humor, etc
), while still playing like the familiar Telltale point-and-click adventure
 The first episode offers a lot (about 2 1/2 hours if you look around), and you're immediately latched to the characters
 You know about everyone's motives about the second they show up, and know if you like them or not
 The writing is still Borderlands-style, so you may get more for your mileage if you're familiar with the series, but it's very well done
 It's not full of boner jokes (yet), but there's still the silly stuff in there
 The game relies a bit more on the inventory like Sam & Max than Walking Dead (still no combining items again, though) ie
 Fiona's character uses cash that can directly influence conversation, whereas Rhys's lets him scan things to let you learn more about the world, and sometimes find items
 Which works well from being based on a game centered on loot
All-in-all -- it's humorous, well-writ, suspenseful, and most of all - good
 If you're hesitant in any way, you could pick up on a sale, but as a fan of Telltale and Borderlands it was worth every dollar
 And I'm sure even non-fans would enjoy the ride this game gives you

"Telltale Games will remember that

I suppose that to the completely uninitiated, Tales from the Borderlands plays out like an action-comedy caper film set in unfamiliar surroundings, but to those who already love the Borderlands games, it feels a bit like coming home
 I really love the way Telltale designed the opening sequence, menu screens, and opening credits in the style of the Borderlands games, so from the very start this is exactly how the game feels
The artwork from the Borderlands series is a great fit for the Telltale format, and allows the setting to blend seamlessly into the graphic novel-style artwork Telltale uses to render its stories
 The music of Borderlands is pretty distinctive too, and the team did a fantastic job of incorporating that into the story as well (in the case of the episode one boss, quite literally)
The story is very fast paced, with a lot of twists and turns and flashbacks
 With two protagonists — a Hyperion corporate lackey and a Pandoran thief — you also quite literally get parts of the same story playing out a little differently from two perspectives
 Narratively, it reminds me a bit of Pulp Fiction with the perspective jumps, as well as the rapid-fire pacing and snappy dialogue
The action sequences are amazing (if not completely plausible) and really keep you engaged with the story
 The dialogue is hilarious, and it was fun picking some of the wittier options and seeing how the scene played out
 The voice acting is great too, though I did find it extremely odd at times to have conversations with some of Pandora's bandits and psychos
If you're the impatient type, you might want to wait until all the episodes come out before buying the season, as it looks like they're going to be spaced a few months apart
 I plan to update my review as the episodes are released, but so far I really love the story and the characters
 I can't wait to see "cameo" appearances by some of the other vault hunters and NPCs from the Borderlands games, and I also can't wait to see what happens with the new characters Tales From the Borderlands has introduced

CLANNAD is one of the most well-regarded visual novels in the world, boasting an epic 80-120 hours of content; about twice the size of the Lord of the Rings trilogy
 It starts off at a very slow pace with lots of light-hearted comedy, but once you begin getting involved with each of the characters' individual conflicts, the story ramps up into some gripping emotional storytelling, sometimes sprinkled with a tinge of supernatural intrigue
 The character routes are very worthwhile in their own right, but the true value of CLANNAD is to be found in its final route: After Story
 It doesn't matter how emotionally hardened you think you are; After Story will hit you like a sledgehammer with its relentless emotional impact, and you won't come out unscathed
So, yeah, CLANNAD is kinda cool
 Changed my life / 10

When I first looked at this game, I thought "Typical anime high school girl nonsense"
 How wrong I was
 What I found was far and away the most engaging and heartfelt story I have ever experienced
 I absolutely love Clannad and cannot recommend it highly enough
Clannad is a visual novel originally released in Japan in 2004
 Voices were added in a 2008 rerelease
 In 2015 it was given an official English release
 It is regarded by the visual novel community as a paragon of the genre and one of the greatest ever
Clannad has several different plotlines which can be read in almost any order
 These plotlines are mostly love stories
 The content and quality of these are what make Clannad a legend
 Rather than pander to sexual fantasies, Clannad's stories aim straight at the reader's heart
 Some of these hit really close to home for me
 At multiple points, I had to stop reading for a few minutes to collect myself before I could continue
 Some were so good that I had to go back and reread them again just a couple of days later
If you complete Clannad, you will cry at least once
 Accept this going in
 If someone tells you they completed it without crying, they're a liar
If you're still on the fence, then consider that I was once in your position
 I was unsure of if I should even give this game a shot
 I took the chance based on word of mouth
 Now here I am gushing over it
 One of the best works of fiction I have ever experienced

Simply put, if you aren't in tears after playing this visual novel,
you're not human
Clannad is the best visual novel of all time, a roller-coaster ride of emotions that will change your life
The popular question of, "Is it really worth $50
"
Yes, in fact, it is worth infinitely more
 You can't monetize a life changing experience, and playing through Clannad will provide exactly that
Posted: 23 November, 2015
Finally, the wait is over
 After a year of anticipation and throwing almost all my money at the Kickstarter campaign, our beloved Clannad is here
 All you VN lovers should already know that Clannad is a universally-acclaimed masterpiece
 But for those who don't know much (or anything) about it, know this: it's one hell of a rollercoaster ride
 Clannad will have you laughing, crying, happy, angry, and a whole slew of other emotions
 In fact, Clannad (both the anime series and the VN) is the only story that has truly made me empathize with the characters and relate to it in my own life
 I dare say it to be a life-changing experience if you open your heart
While Clannad is almost always described as a romance game, there is so much more than that
 While there is a lot of romantic material, Clannad offers an endless ocean of life lessons around family, friends, overcoming hardship, making excruciating decisions, dealing with change, and much more
 Clannad really made me take a deep look into my own life and helped me overcome many personal barriers relating to my own family and friends
 It has positively influenced my outlook in many areas of my life and I will forever be grateful for it
Even if you don't think you would enjoy it much, do yourself a favor and pick it up
 And if you already previously played it, buy it on Steam
 Compared to the original Full Voice version, it has so many new enhancements that warrant playing it again (as if the story alone wasn't enough
)
 The HD assets, Steam achievements, and Dangopedia are all big bonuses to me
 The only things missing are trading cards and emoticons
And lastly, join the Clannad steam group for all your Clannad needs
 We're active and very friendly and love discussing all things Clannad (as well as other games, anime, etc
)
 You could say we're Steam's very own Big Dango Family
 Also, if you ever want to talk about Clannad, feel free to friend/message me

Wow
 That was such an unexpectedly wonderful experience
As this is a CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure), your experience may vary, but, I say with little hesitation that my own experience with the story is the most meaningful experience I've had with a game - ever
Although wonderful in their own right, choice oriented games like The Walking Dead and Mass Effect don't even come close to what this game accomplishes
What Choice Do I Have
CoR gives you choices
CoR gives you lots of choices that make the story feel like your own, fostering immersion in a way that traditional literature cannot
CoR gives you lots of difficult choices that may have you thinking hard and agonizing about the potential consequences
 The game has no manual save function
 If you make choices that lead to a premature ending, you can't undo and must start over
 (such branches seem rare, though, and replaying doesn't take much time once you're familiar with the text)CoR gives you lots of difficult choices that have a real impact
 Something that is uniquely possible when the creator is unconstrained by the need to create full art assets for every possibility
Deep DiveThis "game" has no graphics at all except for the cover image, which is exactly akin to a book cover illustration
 Is it a game or a book
 I say it is most certainly a game
 Graphics is not a requirement of a game
 Interactivity is
 A series of choices that impact the experience do a game comprise
CoR's language is competent, but not "literary"
 It reads like a matter-of-fact narrative of events that might actually happen in your life if the stars align in just the right way
 Initially, I got an "amateur" vibe from the writing, but later realized that the experience may actually benefit from the simple, contemporary writing style
 As the story progressed and sucked me in deeper, I became much too busy thinking about what was going on to criticize the writing style
CoR is (mostly) accessible
 Although the fact that it was written by somebody with a Ph
D
 in Computer Science does show
 Having a CS degree myself, I certainly appreciated that perspective
 Although lots of artistic license is taken for the sake of plot, there is lots of grounding in contemporary technology
The story makes mostly "reasonable" extrapolations starting from the near future forward several decades
 Like all good science (or 'speculative', if you prefer) fiction, the story poignantly references the present while writing about the future, framing the timeless human condition in extrapolated contexts
To elaborate about why I put "reasonable" in quotation marks above, the story explores the future in ways that could, for the most part, conceivably happen, and many futurists would even claim that CoR's extrapolation towards the Singularity doesn't go far enough
 However, the author is not afraid to explore fantastic scenarios that probably won't happen, at least not soon, and in some cases, hopefully never
The scope of the story is indeed quite epic, following the main decades of a lifetime of the character you control
 I do have to object to the game description's categorization of this as a "novel", though, as it is not nearly long enough to count as one
 At best, it is the length of a (very) short story (a single playthrough takes a matter of hours)

I have been in multiple psychology and sociology classes
I have discussed multiple types of technologies and sciences of questionable morality, agreeing with them
Things like the use of robots in war, and the creation of human AI
Never have I questioned my morals, in the face of friends, family, colleagues, anyone
This game has actually made me question myself
I love it
Posted: 2 January, 2015
My brother and I started this game at the same time, I created a robot that looked like a human and felt emotions and together we explored the moral ideas concerning robot rights and the future of robotics
 He created a gigantic war machine and had to stop a robot uprising from destroying the world

I used to love those "Choose your own adventure" books when I was a kid
 I'd sit and reread them over and over trying to find all the different ways the story could play out
This game is like a super version of those books and less than an hour in and I'm already loving it
 I highly suggest this game to anyone who doesn't need pretty graphics to enjoy a game
The further I get into the game the more I recomend it
 In the current enviroment of gaming you lose sight of simple mechanics such as choice
 This game gives it out in spades
 By the time I reached the end of it I had a sense of being in the world created around my choices
For the price asked I cannot think of any reason you should skip the experience provided by this game
If you have trouble gettting into something without graphical feedback I can only tell you that for $5 this is one of the best personalized gaming experience you'll find by far
 Please give the developer your support so that we might enjoy similar experiences in the future

A friend and I each played and our games were so completely different

 I should stop and study now, but I'm going for a second playthough instead

I DIDN'T MEAN FOR ALL THIS TO HAPPEN
 I WAS JUST TRYING TO CREATE A FRIEND
Posted: 29 December, 2014
(Changes have been made to CoR since this review was written
)I recently finished playing "Choice of Robots"
 My first time through I lost badly
I'm still trying to wrap my head around how my own personal choices were deemed inferior
 But since it was MY story, I'll have to accept my failings, though I have to expect the creator/writer of EVERY choice I made to be willing to share those flaws
I've played many text games
 When I began playing there wasn't much else, unless you wanted to play Pong
 Zork, which I played in 1985, is still perhaps my favorite computer gaming experience
 Some of the WONDERFUL Infocom games, such as "Suspended: A Cryogenic Nightmare" actually benefited from being purely text
 I've read many pages of science fiction
 Between my two favorite catagories, science fiction and fantasy, the pages literally number well over a million, so there aren't many speculative fiction concepts I've not encountered
But we're here to discuss "Choice of Robots"
 First off, on the basis of cost/hour this is among the MOST expensive, shortest computer games I have ever played
 True, it was less than $3 (on sale), but lasted under 2 hours (even with starting over on PC #2), most of the time spent in thought
 There was nothing new in this game, beyond perhaps some of the more recent concepts not devised yet when I was doing the bulk
of my reading
 As far as robotics, Asimov has already said pretty much everything encountered in this story, better
 While Dr
 Gold has allowed the reader/gamer to create his own character, or explore themselves (however briefly), a writer as good as Asimov (or numerous others) creates a world so real you believe yourself a part of it
 As far as feelings of reality, I prefer the latter
I began it a second time, but only a few pages, so I'm not sure if I "achieved" further
 I'd presume I received around 1/10th of the achievements
 This presumably means one of two things: 1) either the story branched so often that, even with substantial overlap in story, there were perhaps in excess of 20 endings (seemingly too many to consider equally), or 2) the story was far more fleshed out for a prefered reader/gamer type, and I was not among them
 (I don't understand the purpose behind having achievements in this game, except as a selling tool
 Why create a "loser" scenario (OR winner) in a game marketed as being an individualistic world
 "Personal choice"="wrong choice"
)This felt less to me a story OR game, and more like a personality test, perhaps as component of a thesis
 I admit, by far the majority of the time I spent was in contemplation of what the character I created might actually do if he were real
 While the other characters I was given were extremely superficial, I still felt a strong obligation to create as real, AND as good, a world as possible for them to participate in
 But despite MY agonizing over choices, I felt the writer rapidly lost interest in my character as I made less "literary" choices
 He simply ended the story with no resolution of any kind, leaving the lead character to complete his participation several short paragraphs after life-extending, life-affirming choices
 While I anticipated fighting for life using robotics as tool/metaphor, the majority of the story remaining as life choices are considered/corrected, instead I was reading the last paragraph on the final page
 The overwhelming feeling was one of abandonment, much like Mary Shelley wrote of Dr
 Frankenstein feeling for his creation
 Except that the abandonment was of OUR jointly created world
Quite possibly this game/story simply wasn't written for me
 Perhaps if I were educated or intelligent, or imagined greatness, there might have been some AMAZING stories in this game
 Instead I'm just a regular guy with personal dreams of home, hearth and health (albeit, while dealing with greatness would be for me, a GREAT story to create, or better still, to participate in
) I've read those other people's accounts lived out THOUSANDS of times in other stories
 This time I wanted it to be my story
 Perhaps there are choices that would have made it longer or more interesting, but then it would not have been MY story
 And after all, wasn't that the whole point

I'll start off by saying that Telltale's The Walking Dead is the most intense emotional rollercoaster I have ever experienced in gaming
Season 1 of this series was one of the best games I ever had the pleasure of playing, it had characters you grew attached to or hated with every square inch of your being, and anything that happened to them had some sort of emotional effect on you, this made the story engaging like no other and because TWD is also known for being pretty brutal at times, I have cried some serious tears
Season 2 started off a bit slowly, but once things got going it was on par with season one's experience for me, once again I felt attached to the characters I met, and some heart-wrenching choices had to be made
At one point I even had to pause the game when such a choise was presented, it's things like this that make The Walking Dead an unique experience
Posted: 17 December, 2013
SPOILER FREE REVIEW~If you are a fans of the original
game, this is season 2 of an ongoing popular series based on a comic and tv show
 the main character this time is Clementine, the little girl who must survive in this post apocalyptic world filled the undead and lost hopes will discover that the people she meets and the choices she makes can be much more dangerous
 The game starts off showing off
your previous gameplay choices from season 1
 Also it carries over your save from 400 days which doesn't do much but be ready to load them anyways
 The game
starts off suspenseful, sometimes slows down to give the player a grasp on whats going on and picks right back up on the action
 At the same time,
the story adapts to the choices the player makes while still following a main plotline itself
 If you enjoyed the original series then you will enjoy this one much more, The new way the ui interface guides you is much more nicely done in terms of
being smoother
and cannot be any
easier to understand
 As you watch the episodes play on you'll see that the game slowly advances itself with much more interactivity and choices
The gameplay is quite simple to play and
has much more than just qtes (quick time events)
 Aside from pressing and smashing
certain key buttons during sequence there will be time when players willl have to control Cleminetine to interact with the game's environment itself along with various actions such as sneaking, shooting,
or interacting with other characters in the game in regards to the situation
 As the episode is played the player will have to make choices in dialogues that will be shown on the screen, There will be a limited time to do so before it is default randomly picked to keep the story flowing
Aside from the amazing voice acting, well written dialogue, beautifully drawn cell shaded art and immersive story line
 The game includes choices to make the player feel every emotion humanly possible 
 Depending on the choices that'll be made, Cleminetine will either seem like a cold hearted human being or one that will tolerate and love for everyone
 The decision is yours to make
 Although there are times in this game
there will be limited choices to make due to the main plotline, it will shake the very foundation of her conscience and yours
[WARNING] - If you suck at QTE etc this game will take you a long time to conquerYou will see death scenes, many many death scenes which can be quite gruesome so try to stay alive
[WARNING] If you have a faint heart, be ready because some of the scenes in this game is not for the squeemish
 There will be many things you do not want to see in this game but it brings out the immersion to it and emotions
Enjoy the game Cool hats off to you and Game ON
+ Cell shaded beautiful artwork+ Immersive storyline+ Leaves you on the edge with suspense+ Experience fear, joy, dispair, anger, love, and the feels+ The art is fantastic and well drawn
 + The voice acting is superb and top quality + Adaptable story choices that will keep you playing and wanting more
+ - its a graphic novel game with Qte, you will either like it or don't like it- Its a graphic novel game, not everyones type of game but it is one of the best ones out there
- You'll have to replay the game to see different choices, though it doesn't really change out the main storyline direction itself but it will affect many events- If you haven't played part one of the walking dead or seen the show, you will not understand certain events that is going, just jumping into it is ok but you will miss out on the backstory
- Waiting for the episodes, if you are impatient lol
 written and Played ontwitch/kenuty - Finished on 8/26/2014Yt- Will try to do a video review without spoiler sometimesAll comments and feedback are appreciated, stop by and say hi when I am live, keep the bottom spoiler free and subscribe to the tube if you want and check out my other reviews on steam

Just finished the first episode, and safe to say I'm once again hooked and have The Walking Dead fever
 If this first episode is anything to go by, Telltale Games have once again created a masterpiece
 Can't wait for the next episode
Posted: 23 December, 2014
I miss Lee
Posted: 24 October, 2014
I will be the first to admit that when I beat The Walking Dead: Season 1, I not only cried, but I cried like a baby
 The story, setting, and, most importantly, the characters all pulled me into this world where no one is truly safe, and your decisions matter and go beyond the "choice 1 = good-but-risky, choice 2 = evil-but-conserative" trope
 So when Season 2 was announced, I was eager to get my hands on it
 Now, ten months have passed and the season is over, ending with "Episode 5: No Going Back"
 Was it amazing, and how did it stack against Season 1
First off is the actual game(i
e
 graphics, gameplay, etc
) The graphics maintain the same visual style as Season 1, but look a lot better, and a little less rough around the edges
 There is occasional pop-in when the game just loaded, but this normally isn't the case as long as you don't fail any of the gameplay
 Speaking of which, the gameplay has changed for the better, especially action sequences
 As much as I loved Season 1, I will say
that the action parts could've been better
 In Season 2, though, they are just plain grand, and Episode 2 has prehaps the best action sequence across both seasons
 Also, unlike the majority of Season 1, Season 2 has a full soundtrack that plays the right music at the right time, fitting the mood and tone
 No matter the gameplay advances, though: if you're playing this game, it's for the story
(Note: I will try to be as spoiler-free as I can; however, if there is one, don't say I didn't warn you
) The season opens up with a bang, reminding you in the first five minutes that this isn't some cheery game where everyone is happy: this is the Walking Dead, and people- notably the ones you love- are going to die
 Events transpire and leave an 11-year old Clementine alone and starving, and when she meets a new group, can she trust them
 As the plot carries on, new (and old) characters are introduced, and you eventually have to decide which is better: appealing to your pathos(emotions) or your logos(logic), and this choice not only sets up Clementine for her future, but also kind of defines you as a person to an extent
 This season sees you playing as Clem, and whoever came up with this idea is an absolute genious
 Clementine is just a little girl, and while at moments she may seem empowering, she is still just a kid and can't influence everything to go her way
 However, as those who've played Season 1 know, Lee did not leave Clem helpless
 She can survive, and does so often to the point where a specific, boating character comments that "[Clementine] survive[s] better than any three adults put together"
 As a kid, your power in combat won't be as direct, as she is considerably weaker (physically) than most of the walkers and other survivors
 Instead, she uses dexterity and her environment to win
 And of couse, this being The Walking Dead, dialouge and character-connecting is the focus here
 As only one character from Season 1 re-appears, most of the people you're talking with are people you only met recently, and how you interact with them could affect their trust in you
When the characters die in this season, none of them are quite like saying goodbye in Season 1, but its not supposed to: you've only knew this people for a week or two, so you're not going to get bonded with them as much as you did with Lee and Clem last season
 Nonetheless, you will find yourself liking some characters over others
 Instead of trying to decimate your heart, Season 2 more leaves an uneasy, queasy felling at the end of each episode, almost like "Did I make the right choice
 Is there something I could've done differently
", and it's hard to shake off this feeling
 So, think of it like this: Season 1 was heart-breaking, and Season 2 is gut-wrentching survival
There are a total of five different endings for Season 2, and they all define who your Clementine is and who she will become
 While none of the endings are exactly happy, one left me actually feeling heart-warmed, one left me bitter-sweet, another left me worried for the future, and the last two were not-so-good as the other two good ones (for those of you who know, the two not-so-good ones are both of Jane's endings)
However, I felt that the game had done a very good job creating a tale of growing up
 Most of the decisions that Clem has to make are the same type (albiet without the whole zombie and survival part) that we ourselves make as kids that determine who we are
 Tell Tale Games has recently confirmed Season 3's existence
 If Season 1 was finding and teaching Clem, and Season 2 was molding and shaping her, I think it's safe to say that Season 3 will be seeing that shape and how it effects her views and opinions, which should be enticing for any fan
 So, is Season 2 better than Seaon 1
 In the end, yes, most definatly yes
I hope that I can continue to be there for Clementine as she goes through this jam, and I can't wait to see what directions it takes her in

Really great continuation of the story from the first game
 Even if there is only 1 episode now I can say that game is really amazing
 The idea of giving players to control the Clem is really great
 I really enjoyed all the situations that she was placed in and it was giving me chills
If you havent bought it yet - DO IT

Season two marks the next chapter in Telltale’s The Walking Dead
 The Walking Dead emphasizes narrative and character development over all else
 If you’re looking for solid gameplay, you may be disappointed in that regard
 On the other hand though, TWD excels at providing an engaging story and features extremely likable characters
 It plays out in the form of a point and click adventure game which feels a lot like an interactive movie
 There are no puzzles, and the gameplay is handled through quick time events most of the time
 Season two continues shortly after where the first left off and this time you’ll be playing as Clementine opposed to Lee
 Seeing the world through the eyes of a little girl immediately makes the game feel more depressing and hopeless as she has to fend for herself now
 The zombies, which felt fairly weak in season one are suddenly a much more dangerous threat for Clementine to deal with as well
The story telling is second to none; however my main issue with The Walking Dead is the whole illusion of choice aspect
 At the time of this review, only the first episode of season two is available but this problem was quite prevalent in season one
 At first glance, the game will make you feel as if your choices have a major influence on the story
 Upon further investigation, you’ll realize that regardless of your choices, you’ll always be brought to the same conclusion
 This makes The Walking Dead an extremely enjoyable experience the first time you play but it essentially eliminates any element of re-playability afterwards
If you’re looking for a great story, definitely check it out; just don’t expect to influence it much
For a more detailed review of Season Two, here’s a review video I made for episode One:http://steamcommunity

IntroductionI want to try and tell to english-speaking audience why I like this game, an why they should (or should not) play it
First of all - for some people in ex-USSR countries this game is something like half-life 3 for everyone - we waited it long enough to be happy to get it
 Even if it's not perfect, it's still what we waited so long
Well, where to start
 Once apon a time in the year of 2007, on anonymous imageboard 2ch
ru (now closed) one of the visitors posted a picture he draw, of a young girl with blonde hair
 People liked it, so he draw more pictures of her
 Later, he moved to another imageboard, and with other talented people decided to make a game
 It should have been an adult game with USSR-attributes, becase many people grown-up while there was USSR, and had a good memories about their youth
Well, it was easier to decide than to do
 They started
 And there was a lot of promises
 A lot of waiting
 A lot of drama
 Changes in the team
 Leaking of not ready game
 A LOT OF EVERYTHING
 So, when, after all this years, game was published to steam, a lot of people was like "Wow
 They really did it
"
Now, the reason why I writing this review
 Should you, or should not, play it
 Well, if you wondered what is "imageboard", never leaved in ex-USSR countries or just don't like visual novels - probably not
 Not that you can't like it, it's about feelings, that is the same for everyone
 Also, you probably should not play it, if you expect just a game with lot of boobs
 It has gone far from the original idea of adult game, and even though it has boobs, and you may even find adult-patch in the internet, it's still not the main theme of game
If you are (or ever was) alone, if you live (or ever lived) in ex-USSR countries, if you ever visited imageboards (or even still do) - you can really enjoy this game, I recommend it to you
 Or even if you just curious to see, what non-professional developers can do
 And if you waited too long for this game to be made - you probably already played it)Now, something about this game, not connected to this story
GraphicsGraphics has problems
 It's not because it's bad, but because many people worked on this game on different time, so you
can see the difference between scenes
 Not a big problem, but I needed to say about it to impartial
 And the backgrounds is so beautiful, you may play the game just to see it
MusicI don't afraid to say that soundtrack for this game is brilliant
 I just love the main theme, based on soviet pioneer's anthem
 I hope you would enjoy it too
PlotWell, as often in indie projects, it's the weak spot of the game
 Nice idea, a lot of good humor (but many of it connected to imageboards, so not everyone would understand it
 And I have no idea, how good english translation is), and the target audience would certainly share the feelings of characters
 But
 holes in the plot, unjustified twists, and other mistakes of a beginning story-teller can spoil you some fun
 I still like it, because I somehow belong to the target audience, you know :)SummaryOh, whatever, just play it already, it's free
 Even if you have nothing to do with imageboards, never was neither young nor lonely, and believe russians have a pet-bears and wear hats with ear flaps whole year long - there is still something in the game you may like)

Everlasting Summer is a visual novel that was developed by a group of enthusiasts over a long span of five years
Posted: 24 November, 2014
In Soviet Russia game plays you
Thumbs up:+ Interesting story+ Cool backgrounds and sprites+ Marvellous soundtrack+ 13 different endings to discoverDeal with it:* It's not a hentai game
 Though you can return to game some adult content with a patch (Steam insisted to remove it) story is not focused on it* It's not a light entertainment game
 Depending on you personality it may cause feels of nostalgia, melancholy, make you think about your life or even make you cryThumbs down:- Some arts looks substandard in compare with backgrounds- English translation is rather poor at this very moment (but they are willing to improve it)P
S
 I can't guarantee you would like this game, but it's totally worth to try
Posted: 22 November, 2014
Pros:
- Russian girls
- USSR
- vodka
- Hatsune Miku
- you can be pedo
- you don't have to be pedoCons:
- doesn't provide an actual way to go back into the 80s USSR pioneer camp and hit on rebelious punk chick IRL
- no Elektronik's route
- no Shurik's route
- no Olga Dmitrievna route

Posted: 14 December, 2014
If you managed to finish it one time, you have played 5% of the game
 You need to play at least 50% to reach the state where you can say this game has some potential
 By the time you got to 90%, get ready to get your mind blown with what they offer in the last few endings
 It was unexpected for me and I learnt that this game was not meant to be played only one time in order to reach the end
 Finishing it one time doesn't bring you to the real ending
I repeat, you need to finish all good endings to have a grasp of whats going on
 And also, ditch the girls, go for Samyon route and aim for Yulya
 It won't disappoint you

Everlasting Summer looks like your usual Japan-inspired dating-sim visual novel but you know something odd is going on when the name of the company making it is "Soviet Games" and the title screen greets you with hammers, sickles and Lenin busts
Don't get me wrong, this really is a Japan-inspired dating-sim visual novel, but it takes place and has been made in Russia so you should expect lots of quirky stuff even when they are just trying to fit a stereotype
 The premise is that you are a twenty-something internet addict with no friends and passions, who get sucked in a 1980 Pioneer Camp, the Soviet version of boy/girl scouts, before the Berlin Wall collapse
 Trying to understand what the hell happened to you and how to get out from the Past you got stuck into turns out to be only half of your quest, while the other half is, of course, getting acquainted with all the girls in the camp, have sex with them, and live amazing things you couldn't experience in your actual, dull, apathetic timeline
 Over the course of 7 days you will make some sparse choices that will decide what ending you get access too
 This is weird cause at first it totally looks like you couldn't choose much, but the game has 13 VERY different endings and I would say that this is where it shines
I got undeniably hooked when I realized how different the story can get based on what "branch" you pick
 The problem is that without a guide, and after your first clean playthrough, it isn't clear at all how to get into a different branch or what you could have done differently
 But as soon as you try to get a little deeper into the mechanics you'll realize the amount of story(es), for a game of this kind, is quite huge
 This doesn't change the fact that Everlasting Summer is definitely too long in some sections and the writing is uneven at best, which might have to do with a different cultural style from what I am used to, I'm not sure
 The different endings though, including a few crazy ones, are interesting and while some interactions and dialogues are beyond childish, there are also times when you can appreciate the education background of the writers
The characters get more interesting through replays, since the first trip through the 7 days don't leave much room for their personalities, but whenever you take a different branch you get to know them better
 As I mentioned before, this is the strength of the game: the 13 endings paint a whole picture
 I am not a completionist but this is one case where you can only really say you finished the game when you got all the endings since only then you will really know Sovionok Camp and the story of the guy who got trapped into it
The character design is weird at first, as pretty much everything that wants to look Japanese but it's not Japanese, but you'll get used to it soon and will probably appreciate it after a while, and the background pictures/paintings are honestly beautiful
 Finally, the 1980s Soviet Union setting is just unbeatable
Don't forget to download the Hentai patch from the official website, since the Steam version will just give you a black screen where you are supposed to see sex or breasts
 It is not much at all, this is not a hentai game, but it's better to see all the stuff instead of censorship blankness

Everlasting Summer is a free-to-play animesque visual novel, created by Soviet Games
The game has a pretty standart gameplay as far as visual novels go: there is a static picture that depicts your current surroundings, character sprites are placed on that picture, you read dialogues, sometimes you get to make a decision
 There are few notable exceptions to that rule, but this is generally what you would expect from the game
Everlasting Summer is extremely story-rich, one playthrough has an average span of seven in-game days, each day takes aproximately one-two hours to read through
 There is an average number of 5 decisions to make per day that do have an impact on the story (so much there are actually 13 endings to discover)
 On top of that, ending of Day 5 and the following days are completely unique to the ending you're heading to
 You will have to play through all of them to discover all secrets of the story
Story itself starts out like this: protagonist is a young man in his early 20s named Semyon (Sam)
 He's has almost no social life
 He lives on his parents' money
 He spends all day in the internet
 He has no will to change anything
One day he takes a bus that for some reason takes him through time to 80s, to a pioneer camp "Sovionok" ("Owlet")
 Semyon then has to find answers
 Why did he end up here
 How to get out of this place
 Does he even need to get out of here
Most of the time you interact with 10 very well written characters that may or may not have a secret agenda related to your situation
 The game packs a train of feels that it will happily unleash on you
 Guilttrips, ahoy
Let me give you a list of pros and cons:
+ Interesting non-linear multi-ending story
+ Heavy emotional investment is guaranteed
+ Amazing soundtrack
+ Beautiful scenery and well-drawn character sprites
+ A lot of references to russian culture, mostly internet culture (protagonist's name, posters in pioneers' houses, bus 410, protagonist's thoughts sometimes)
- There are a few screamers (how many depends on the ending you're heading for, but at least one is guaranteed)
 Normaly I would just laugh at these attempts to scare the player but in the overall upbeat mood these manage to scare effectively
- Steam has removed adult content (can be restored with an easy to install patch)
 That's not neccesarily a bad thing, adult content ruins the mood in some moments but black screens infuriate me personally
- Action parts are few and even then you just read through them, doing nothing yourself
 Those who are looking for action gameplay - look elsewhere
Hopefully, I managed to interest you
 A few words of advice: Don't you dare read any guides that reveal plot elements, play for the first time without using any guides, even spoilerless ones
 Don't even approach Lena on your first playthrough
you're guaranteed to score an extremely depressing ending if you do it wrong
 In fact, if you consider yourself an emotional person I suggest that you just read about her endings after you finish the game for the first time, it will make you feel extremely depressed if you play it yourself
You will probably see it in every other review, but I'll repeat these wise words: don't play Miku's ending at night
To sum up, I definetly recommend to give this game a try, since it's free
Have fun, pioneers

Late Shift game is one of the exciting games/movies I've watched/played this year
 It's not just a game but it's a movie too, an interactive movie
 Every choice in the game matters
 I felt the intensitivty grew as I knew that ''This is where I have to choose very carefully'' I hardly could sit still at those moments
The game has 7 endings
 And every route lasts about the same length as an average movie, aprox 1h 30 min
 If you plan on playing it, I highly recommend you play your route from start to finish
 (It has a save feature if you want to continue it later)All in all
 Every path has a good story
 It doesn't look like a low-bugdet film
 The acting is very good, presenting us talented actors most of us probably haven't heard of
 The cinematography is pretty good too and it's very well made
 In my eyes, it doesn't look like an amateur made film
If you feel like watching a movie tonight, give this one a try
I hope to see more releases from the creators
Posted: 2 September
I wish more studios would attempt this style of storytelling
Posted: 11 June
This is my second FMV game (my first was Contradiction: Spot the Liar
), and after having played it once, I am satisfied with my purchase and would buy it again
The cinematography is excellent, the music is good, the acting is largely terrific, and the pacing is great
 It's essentially like playing a crime thriller film; the video quality is sufficient enough for a theater-tier movie
The game is somewhat brief, but I enjoyed the experience, and I am not sure that it would benefit from being longer, as I have read that there are several endings (I got a bad ending from my first playthrough)
This may be the only recent game I'll play a second time just to see how it changes when I make different choices
I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys FMV games, and if you have never played an FMV game before, I would recommend this as a place to start
My only genuine complaint is that the music was a little too loud in sections and drowned out a few of the lines of dialogue mildly (the game does have subtitles, though), and there is no way to modify the music volume separately in the audio options
I rate this game a 7
5/10, as far as FMV games are concerned
Posted: 19 April
TL;DR:Late Shift is the best FMV adventure game in production so far, and perhaps the most costly in making
 If you enjoy FMV games or Choose-your-own adventure games, give it a try
Pros:+Great performing+Very cinematically professional production+Engaging story+Wow, your choice actually matters in this gameCon:-No fast forward or chapter selection making revisiting rather a choreA fine FMV game that's become rather a rarity these days
 We do get stuff like Contradiction, upcoming The Infectious Madness of Doctor Dekker, a Tex Murphy reboot titled Tesla Effect, and Her Story, a piece of real innovative narrative, but I wouldn't go ahead and call FMV ADV genre rejuvenating -- it's as dead as my late grandpa, may him rest in peace, for its high production cost and relatively low gameplay value
And I do look fondly at FMV cutscenes, for it's wonky, it's cheap, its small-budget-ish look and lack of professional cinematic techniques
 I may be fooling myself, but these qualities actually give me a sense of passion and love
That being said, Late Shift, to my surprise, hasn't had any of them
 It's a glorious, triumphant masterpiece among its fellows with the best production I have ever seen
 The performing in Late Shift is great and highly convincing; it's very cinematically professionally filmed -- the closest to a modern film, I dare say -- and its story not half bad, engaging and intriguing
 Hence, as soon as I got my hands on the game, I was utterly surprised by it
The gameplay is the kind of "choose-your-own" adventure that has been popular lately (e
g
 Telltale Games titles, Knee Deep, D4)
 but with actually important choices that can lead to up to seven different endings and many different sequences, unlike that notorious pop-up message saying "Don Trump will remember that" without any noticeable impact on the ending
 Thus although the game is short per playthrough (around 80 minutes), it's worth multiple revisits, just to see how where that butterfly would cast a storm upon
So Late Shift is a great FMV game, perhaps the best so far
But it cannot revive the genre, sadly no
 For what it's worth, I'd say it will have a problem breaking even: it's just simply way too expensive, for the genre to follow up, and for it, as a game in a dead genre, to recover its cost
 Unlike Matt, I'm not good at numbers, I can't figure out how much does it cost to feature approx three to six hours in total of professional movie clips, and how many copies must be sold to start making profits
 One minor issue does bug me though: you are not allowed to fast forward or chapter selection, making revisiting a chore, rather than an enjoyable journey
 After three playthroughs I think I have now memorized most of the lines from the intro sequence
I'm sorry to say so but its gameplay is just not appealing enough to modern gamers
 In that sense, it's both exceeding and lagging behind, the former its exquisite production and the latter its genre
 I do love Late Shift, but I can only recommend it to those who like FMV games and Choose-your-own adventures

Overall a very unique, memorable and impressive game
 Pros:
Mold the story to show who you really are Seven endings Great soundtrack Good acting Relatable protagonist Intreguing story Unique characters BMW i8 <3 (One of my fav cars) Cons:
Most choices end you in the same place You cannot change much in the beginning of the game Cannot fast forward
Occasional volume mixing issues Lost video durring one scene All videos are 1080p, since I have a 1440p monitor I was a little disapointed that they did not have native support for higher resolutions Recomendations For Playing:
Play the full game in one sitting Be honest with your choices (For the first time through) You dont need your keyboard
Treat this game like a movie (Don't go in with too high expectations or else you will be disapointed) 
Posted: 16 August
This is a great example of an FMV game done right, and perhaps the only one to really deserving to be called an 'Interactive Movie'
 The acting and production value on display here is far better than the rest of the genre
 Admittedly, that's not saying much, and the performances certainly aren't acadamy award worthy, but it's at least on par with a decent cable drama
 There are a few lines that don't quite land though
 The game's tech is fairly impressive as well, effectively editing the movie in real time in response to an intuitive visaul-novel style decision system
 The story is entertaining, and has enough suspense an intrigue to keep you interested, especially through the first playthough
 This is a game, however, limited by how much could be filmed, so while your decisions do matter, you certainly don't have as much freedom as in a traditional game, and you will be seeing a lot of the same scenes again over multiple playthroughs
 That's to be expected though
 I also think this is a great game to play with someone who is new to video games
 It's at least as entertaining as watching a random flim, and the controls are as easy to pickup as they possibly could be
 There is a good amount of replayability here too, with multiple endings to discover, though to get to them all, you will be treding a lot of the same ground over and over
 Overall, I can easily recommend this game if you've even a small interest in interactive FMV
 I hope to see more games using this tech in the future
Posted: 22 April
A very good FMV game
 High production values, descent actors, good story and nice decisions to make
 And for what you get it is well priced
 It also has 7 different endings and scenes you won't see in your first playthrough, so there's some replay value here
 Can definitely recommend this to everyone who likes FMV games
Posted: 3 September
This is one of the examples where you ignore the professional critics' reviews and use the Steam review system as a guide
I thoroughly enjoyed "playing" this "game"
 The trailer does not do it justice, and the trailer whets the appetite without giving away too much of the plot
I am not the type of person that watches a movie or a TV show twice (there are other things to watch)
 However, I may have to make an exception in this case
 I've completed my first playthrough, and in a few weeks I will do another; make different choices; see how the main character fares
The acting was also far better than I expected
 I'm not a prude and I swear a LOT in real life
 but I felt that in a couple of places, they were swearing for the sake of swearing - to the point where the sentence just sounded wrong
This "game" is on offer as I write this review - £7 instead of £10
 It is definitely worth the £7

A good crime thriller full motion video gamePROS:+Charming, relatable protagonist+Impressive production values+Generally good acting+Beautiful soundtrack+Compelling story+Seven endings+May-Ling <3CONS:-Not every choice matters-A few perplexing plot holes-No save or fast forward function-Occasional volume mixing issues-Occasionally cheap props and effects-No interaction outside of story choices-A few underused/unnecessary characters-Stereotypical depiction of Asian characters-Some odd, downright frustrating story outcomes
Posted: 24 April
Pros:- Great film quality- Choices ACTUALLY matter- 7 possible endings, so there's replay value- Decent story- Solid actingCons:- No skip or fast-forward option when replaying, so you're stuck watching some of the same scenes over and over
Posted: 10 June
Quickly to the point:Pros:- awesome story without dull moments- sense of urgency will keep you on your toes and always working towards your goals- plot changes depending on your own agenda- combat is quite complex and doesn't seem to suffer from the whims of RNG- exploration is key, campaign map is huge and varied- quests usually have more than one way of handing things and generally stick to shades of grey when it comes to morality of your actions- your actions have impact on both the world around you and your team- not sure how historically accurate the game is but it feels pretty solidCons:- many, many bugs - haven't encountered a game-breaking one yet, but there's dozens of smaller ones- long loading times, SSD is a must (fortunately the game is quite light)- lack of ability to skip/speed up animations - they do get pretty repetitive- random events seem to pull from a fairly limited pool making it very easy to see repeatsConclusion:One of the best RPGs I've played in the recent years
 If you can get over the slightly janky technical side of things you'll find a real gem here
Posted: 26 May
I played it from start to finish and I must say its my surprise game of the year
 The many little details everyplace was so amazing
 The story, music, gameplay, the builds, the quests, the loot, the battles, the camping, the crafting, the repairing,
the timeline(which gives you plenty of time to do all you want)
 Just so much I got out of this game
 It was bittersweet to finish, everything depends so much on what you choose
 I LOVE IT

A great strategy / rpg game with splendid plot, which takes a hit from minor bugs in questing
Video, if you'd rather watchhttps://www

v=YupU5yPY3-cAbout the GameExpeditions: Viking is a Strategy/Tactical RPG game where you take control of a band of Norsemen in 790 AD
 The game process is split into three parts: global map (of Denmark and England), questing locations (think Neverwinter Nights) with real-time movement and conversations, and then same locations that switch to turn-based combat when battle starts
The Good•	The world is really big and there’s lots of things to do
 However, when I was playing, I never felt swamped with quests: it’s like every location balances on what it gives, so you don’t have a 20+ quest log, but receive them gradually instead
•	The quest themselves offer a good diversity of choice: there are multiple ways you can solve most of them, violent or not
 The dialogs between characters remind heavily of Neverwinter Nights, and the actual quest plot quality is close to that level too
•	Lots of possible character builds and interesting levelling system:
there’s no levels per se, but you get the special upgrade points after questing / combat
 As you gather more points – you can invest them in specializations for your crew: weapons, skills, utility stuff and some special perks
 Overall more than 100 skills that you can level
•	Deep turn-based combat: the tactical element of positioning your characters and using appropriate skills in the combat makes the game challenging, but not impossible to beat
•	Solid graphics; the game has its own distinct style that puts you in a dark world of 8th century Europe
•	Great music and sound effects that make you feel immersed in the game world
The Bad•	The biggest thing that breaks the immersion is lots of bugs in the quests: it seems that they often were made with assumption that player is going to take one exact sequence of actions
 As an example, there’s a quest about Roman cult that is split into two parts: there are multiple branches, but overall if you descend to the dungeon and kill one branch leader and then pick his banner (without meeting the second one at first) – you’ll be asked to go to the dungeon again, pick the banner
 Except there’s nobody there anymore, right
 You killed them
 Then the combat sequence starts, but there are zero enemies
 After that: the combat instantly ends and another copy of the “unique banner” appears
 Nothing gamebreaking (well, except for one in the beginning, when you can’t talk to Gunnar after killing him when I had to replay it, but it was fixed) – but that gives an impression that game did not have enough quality control
•	Quest Locations could really use a minimap (like Diablo style)
 Pressing “M” all the time to open the map (and then close it) is really troublesome
•	Somewhat slow loading times (but maybe it’s my computers fault, although I haven’t seen such slow loadings in any other games that I’ve played)
SummaryOverall, if it was not for the multiple minor bugs in quests: Expeditions: Viking would feel like a top quality AAA game
 Everything is there: character build possibilities, diverse quests with lots of outcomes, resource and group management, global map with occasional random events
 If you think you can look past through occasional bugs in quests – I highly recommend the game to tactical / strategy game fans, as well as people who just enjoy good plot and captivating quest writing
EDIT: as per Gorgeous_Joe words, I think it's fair to mention that the game has limited timespan (one year) to complete objectives
 So you won't be able to do everything at once
 I liked it because it allowed to prioritize stuff, but obviously some people don't because they want to explore fully with one character instead of starting another game after one is done
EDIT#2:The time limit can now be disabled entirely, see patch 1

Expeditions Vikings, The first 30 minutes
 Well I thought it was 30 minutes turns out it was the first two hours
 TIme is flying
 The character creation options are great
 Lots of different options for different play style and honestly my first impression is that replay value could literally come from wanting to try different kinds of characters
 Want a super melee
 A skilled leader with diplomatic options
 A ranged titan with an eagle eye in perception and sense
 I am so torn between going melee or ranged spec its crazy
 The game starts out with a really interesting story and characters, the dialogue is good and the conversation options, including the special ones you can unlock with skills is great
 I really thought this would be a one playthough game from other types of games in this genre, yet the subtle ways conversation and choice can impact what happens and who your companions are and how they respond to you is really very vast and I doubt One playthough will be enough to satisfy my curiosity as to what would of happened had I done this
 Honestly my first two characters were super spec melee
and I ended up losing my trail by combat
 I decided I reroll as a shield and sword spec and see if I do better that way with a few different skills selected then the last time
 Happy to say 3rd time was a charm, I was able to win the duel with no optional help
 How did you do your very first time fighting that duel
 I'm very happy with my character now and can continue on knowing I'll be ready for future fights with a better understanding of how to build my squad mates and what skills to take from what I learned from these fights
 *Combat is excellent
 Finally a turned based squad game that does it right
 Easy to learn in theory but defiintely will take a few battles to really learn and understand the best ways to use your troops and skills to maximum effect
 Finally a game that allows you your true turn
 In your turn you can use any character you want in whatever order you want
 You can move and attack or attack and move
 Example:I move my main melee up to an enemy archer, clearing my archers line of sight, I attack with my archer on the enemey, he hits, I have now harried my enemy and since for my main I took that skill, I'll get a 50% damage boost for hitting a harried enemy
 So now I use my main to hit the archer and boom
 Archer goes down
 With the way they did combat, you have so many variables on how to take down the enemy including traps and so on
really excellent job on combat
 I already love the game, which visually is great as well
 In short this game offers a multitude of choice within the story and combat, skills and choice are worthy of dragon age origins
 If you like squad based tactical combat, with choices that really matter and change how your play through is gonna go
 Expeditions Vikings is the game for you
I just wanted to add that this isn't all about combat
 Careful management of your home villiage, skills you use and spread through your party are the keys to not only battle but a successful camp to ensure your people are feed, rested, guarded, scouting is done and any crafting you want to do
which is very powerful a skill to have
 How you manage your relationships based on your choices throughout the game, the skills for camping when you are traveling and how and when you start upgrading your home (right away) are all key to having fun and being a good leader
 Fail at any of these and its going to be a rough road for you and your companions
The game is an upgrade in every way to expeditions conquistador and My only complaint is that they went with a pretty close view of the world eagle eye wise instead of letting you zoom out
they did this purposely I was told via the forums, the devs are very very active with the community on the boards, and Jonas said he did it for performance reasons
 While I would perfer to be able to zoom out, I do get it
 Like anything else its just a choice that while i find less then great, it would of cost performance the other way so I'm getting used to this super close up view
 (not that we have a choice lol)Its really a great game and its going to be bitter sweet when it the journey finally ends
 ****Side note
The music is actually great
 Reminds me a little of that old movie last of the mohicans when they were on the move
******Pro tip, be sure to loot the bodies of your enemies and search the maps you are on, there are a lot of items and materials to be found in containers and so on
even a side quest to be found very early on if you search the farm well enough

So far I recommend this game, however this review is subject to change
 I've not spent too much time with Expeditions yet, but so far it's almost everything that I hoped it would be
 I've been waiting for a proper period Viking game for quite some time (instead of silly rinse and repeat Viking tropes), and to finally have one that is modeled after the old Infinity era games (i
e
 Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment et al
),for me, is a dream come true
 In this game you get to forge your very own Viking chieftain, your goal is to advance the interests of your clan, while also trying to maintain your rule
 You do this in a number of ways, but mainly through choice of action, and words
 At the moment I can't speak too much about different consequences, however, right from the beginning of the game, your choice of stats shapes npc perceptions, and molds your personal biography (the biographical aspect needs a bit of polish, as it doesn't mention your father's name, but a place holder)
 Furthermore, your actions shape how the members of your party or hird-as the game calls it-view you, how they view you affects their morale and morale influences how well your party fights
 The English writing is localized well, and I enjoy how the developers allowed a few Old Norse names and words into the dialogue
 There is some voiced dialogue, but it works similarly to Baldur's Gate where an only a small portion of the dialogue is read by an actor
 The little that is there, in my opinion, sounds fine, and there are some proper Scandinavian accents
 I will add that I wish that the dialogue was a little less 'modern', but that is something more for real history aficionados, so I won't hold it against the writers
 The music is also rather good, typical, but it gets the job done, it does not have the exotic quality of an OST like that of the History channel's Vikings
 Graphically, it looks nice
 The game looks similar to Pillars of Etternity's engine or the Conquistador game, thus the characters are a bit on the rough side, but the locations, and world look rather nice
 There is some decent character customization, but I'd defiantly welcome more
 There is enough to keep it from feeling shallow
 Your options are not extensive (you can't change every aspect of your characters face e
g
 nose and eye shape etc) but there are enough options to personalize your character
 You also choose from a few character portraits that are used during dialogue, in time there will probably a mod to add more, or a way to add one's own files for the portrait selection
 The RPG element gives you a decent amount of skill customization, and it was seemingly designed to mix and match a few roles
 Your stats consist of strength, endurance, finesse, perception and sense
 Each of said stats will dictate the role you play (warrior, archer, rogue etc
) When you level up you are given multiple points to spend on passive perks, and combat skills
 On the world; you travel around as one would in an old CRPG game, with you leading and your party following behind travelling about the world space
 This game world is supposed to be open, so far I've noticed a few closed off areas, but I've not really explored enough to rightfully critique the exploration aspect of the game
Combat is a turn based tactical/strategy game, it is similar to the other Expeditions games, you move on a hexagonal battle map, and take turns attacking the enemy with your party
Story wise, it's essentially like an old Viking tale without the romanticism, you are the new chieftain vying with your rivals for survival as well as honor and glory, so as to reach the halls of Valhalla
I'm not expecting too many twists and turns
 But who knows
 There could be a few surprises; I'll speak more on this once I finish the game
 Character interaction so far has been well done, there are branching dialogues and multiple options; however I did notice a few options that had the exact same outcome (I reloaded a save, to check this)
 This game is also supposed to include romance options, but I've not played long enough to speak of them
If people are looking for a more historically accurate Viking game, with a real story and character interaction like an old Infinity Engine game, this is the one to get
 I think that the devs put a great deal of love into this game, and they also seem to be sending out patches as I write this
 Tentative, 8
5/10
 *I will update this review once patch 1
06 comes out, and I play through th egame again

Posted: 2 May
There is a timer in this game
 Its artificial and to be honest so poorly thought out that many people playing the game will not even know there is one
 Once your time runs out its game over
 Any movement on the main map counts against you and the timer, if you make a mistake and say travel to the wrong town due to unclear quests or what have you, you can easily lose 10% off the timer in that way
 Meaning you might not get to see a lot of the content
When you camp the timer runs
 All in all it hurts this game and nowhere do the DEVs mention the timer
 So if you like to be rushed and just have your game on its own, by all means purchase this game
 But if you despise timers and feel its out of place in a RPG setting then stay away you will be disappointing

If you mostly liked Conquistador for it's exploration elements, this game may not be ideal
 It prefers a Baldur's Gate style map system to charting out the map
 While this may make sense due to the setting(Exploring charted territory and developed kingdoms), if you thought Conquistador's highlights were it's explorationIf however, you view Expeditions:Viking as a game in the same vein of Conquistador but adjusted to a new setting, as opposed to a direct sequel however, this game does many things well
Firstly, for something of an indie title, this game looks and feels incredibly proffesional
 Characters and maps are well designed, and there is something almost beautiful about the way the towns and cities in this game feel
As an RPG, the game is fantastic
 The game has frequent opportunities to flesh out a character, a well-done character creation system, ect
The Writing, by game standards, is fairly good and the character's do feel very fleshed out
The gameplay is good, and combat is well done, allthough if you are good at learning rules for strategy/RPG games, you'll probably find it fairly easy
Overall, I'd say it's a solid game and I'd absolutely reccomend it

Finally
 After years of searching for a party based RPG that would draw me in to another world and existence, I have found it
 I'm a jaded old gamer of 60 that has played every CRPG/ARPG since Ultima and Wizardry, the SSI Gold Box D&D games, Interplay and Blizzard, and everything since up through current releases
 More recently I found the occasional game that scratched that itch, but there were a lot more disappointments than hits
 While I was able revel in the Witcher series, loving each one more than the last, I was still longing for a party based RPG
 This game is what I have been searching for
Beautiful graphics, scenery
 Amazing and perfectly fitting music ( one of the view games I haven't muted the music for)
 Great writing and really captures the Viking Saga feel
 I am a bit prejudiced here, having Norse ancestry via Ireland
 Exciting and challenging tactical combat, with "magic" being more psychological/religious, not mystical
Regarding all of the "bugs" posts, I didn't experience a single one
 So no idea on that front, but flawless for me
 Maybe because they have all been patched by now
Having just finished the saga, I'm immediately starting my second playthrough
 There are so many paths still to follow
 I'm excited already just thinking about it
Oh, and to the developers, Logic Artists
 I happily signed up for your newsletter, so if you can create any DLC's in the future expanding on the storylines, I'll happily throw money at you

This is an amazing RPG
 Tho, a very combat focused one
 If you're the kind of person who only ever wants to play pacifistically and solve everything by dialogue, don't even bother reading any further
But if you like hitting things with your axes, this is an amazing game to do it in
 The encounters are mostly very well designed (There are virtually no random encounters, i had two throughout 25 Hours of play) and the combat is fun
 Seeing arrows flying into someones face or being blocked by a shield feels and looks very well
The combat got enough depth to be challenging, and good lord, some fights can be extremely challenging, but it's not quite extraordinair
 Sometimes you'lll still find yourself hitting things rather mindless, like when raiding a church full of civilians
Which brings me to the next point, killing civilians
The game is rather sandboxy in its main quest and allows for a lot of different routes to go down on
 The basic premise is that you, new appointed thegn of your families viking clan, are deemed a weak ruler and have to defend yourself and your clan in the next althing at the end of the year
 In order to gain strength and propserity you seek out the british isles, while running against a (not very pressuring) clock
But what you do there is entirely up to you
 Try to establish trade routes with the kingdom, raise an army and conquere britain, be part of political schemes in order to gain alliances or just raid, murder and pillage everything and build a strong clan with all your money
 I, Hegdor, and my crew from the warship Mabufudyne decided to reinstall a new king in the kingdom of Northumbria, wage war with the picts of the north in his name and make the entirey of britain my ally in the process
The game is extremely reactive in how you do about things
 This also includes fail states
 More often than not, losing in a fight does not mean the end of the game, but a new, different outcome to your quests and a different story progress resulting out of it
 All RPG's should be like this
In addition to that, the game also allows you to toggle the lethality of your attacks in a fight
 It's entirely up to you wether you want to kill or only defeat the enemy
 Even this can sometimes, tho not always, make major or minor impacts on your quest progress
The third major gameplay pillar of the game is the camping
 When traversing the world, your party will get fatigued and hungry which forces you to rest in a camp, as your party will become weak and fragile
The camping allowes you to give all of your party different tasks for different shifts, such as guarding the camp - to prevent being attacked by wolfs and such in the night -, healing Injuries, hunting, cooking and a lot more
 It's a very integral part of the game and it's worth having party members specialised in different camping skills as otherwise you're quickly going to run out of food or medicine and will slowly wither away
Basically, it's more of Expeditions: Conquistador, but with a new setting
 If you like one you're going to like the other
Very highly recommended for everybody that likes turn based strategy and RPG's
Posted: 26 June
I am blown away by the level of atmosphere and story that the heightened RPG elements have brought to this turn based strategy game
 The art work is beautiful as is the music, the combat is tactical and satisfying with diverse character skillsets to customise that can change the way you play and the scale of the game borders on epic
 Dialogue is well written and there are very few quests that don't contribute something to the atmosphere or overall narrative
 In short I have been waiting for a game like this for many years
 Don't be put off if you weren't too impressed with Conquistador (which I didn't think was all that great) as Viking is leaps and bounds better in every way
 I am mystified as to why it doesn't have a higher overall user review rating as I have thought about what faults it may have and the only thing I can think of is that there is an excessive ammount of barrel bashing
 I guess you COULD just ignore them altogether but then you wouldn't have the best resources for crafting and for upgrading your settlement
 There are just too many positive elements for me to detail here
 It's a better RPG than most recent RPGs and it's a better TBS than ALL recent TBS games
 If, like me, you have been yearning for an RPG with meaty depth and size where combat is sufficiently complex, or a TBS with satisfying tactical combat and an engaging storyline then you really need to play Vikings
 If I had to make a stab at a percentage I'd give it 92%

I had a contract out to kill a mime
 I planned to lure him into an alleyway by chucking bottles at his head, then Displace behind him and cut his throat
 The bottles didn't phase him, then I got frustrated, messed up the displace, and teleported inside him -- at which point he burst like an overripe tomato and painted the walls with gore
 If you can't get behind exploding a mime from the inside-out, don't even talk to me
 Billie is brutal as hell
 I love it
Okay serious review though: NB, I have a pretty solid gaming computer, and I'm playing on medium settings
 I have experienced 0 technical issues thus far
 I understand a lot of the negative reviews are from people who are having issues running the game -- PLEASE check the required specs before buying because this does seem like a serious problem
Pros:* Billie has a much smaller pool of powers, which leads to a much more deliberate and stealth-heavy gameplay style
 As Corvo you could always fight your way out and it was super fun, but playing as Billie is TENSE in a way I haven't encountered in a long time
* Big maps, lots to explore
* GREAT dialogue/writing
Posted: 14 September
Everything is pretty much the same like the original Dishonored 2
 Whatever your performance is for Dishonored 2, same goes here
 Gameplay wise, mana is now regenerated to full over time, no more drinks needed
 Special actions in the original game are now some contract missions you get in the black market
 You will only get 3 new unique powers that doesn't need to be upgraded, and 3 of Emliy's and Corvo's powers in OG+ mode
 Mixed reviews are casued by some angry Chinese players who can't launch the game because their system language is not set to English xddddd (release day)
 
Posted: 17 September
Forgettable and uninteresting
 Definitely not worth the price, wait 'till a sale
 5 missions; 2 of which are played on the same 'map', a 3rd which is The Royal Conservatory from Dishonored 2, 4th being a relatively small mission and only one actually good-sized 5th map
 And the thing is even then that barely annoys me when compared to the other things I'm about to list in this review
 Like Daud's nonsensical hatred towards the Outsider, which gets so annoying to the point you'll hope he'll shut up (until you realise it's the only thing he does in the game)
If do you like great potential being wasted however (or what I like to like to call whole-lot-of-one-thing bloated in your face) then you'll love all of the different cults
 There's the brand-new-Eyeless gang (discount Bottle street gang), then the good-old Outsiders who have brought their blind sisters along for the party (because you can't have enough cults
Posted: 17 September
I'll admit, this game is the weakest in the series
 I was so looking forward to this title but it turned out to be kind of a let down
 1) Like in dishonored 2, they elaborate on what made the outsider, and what he is, therefore making him a tangible and understandable being, and less mysterious
 2) The length of this game isn't any longer than the dlc for Dishonred 1
 It's 5 missions long, and I beat the game on the hardest difficulty in about 5 hours
 The only reason this did not release as a dlc, is so they could charge more for it
 Overall, I'd say it's an okay experience but it felt lackluster in the end
 Not really worth $30
Posted: 17 September
No spoilers in this review
 In short: It's a fantastic game
 But a terrible Dishonored game
 Wait until it goes on sale
+ The game is well optimised and runs fantastically on PC+ The visuals are gorgeous as always+ The contracts system adds a lot of fun new challenges
- There aren't enough consequences for your actions
 The removal of the chaos system reduces replayability, and all endings lead to the same overall outcome
- No Clean Hands achievement means that non-lethal players are not rewarded for their playstyle- There are far too many enemies in lots of the levels, making it a pain to get around
- One level is used twice, and another level is a slightly tweaked level from Dishonoured 2
 So as a result, in a 5 mission game, we only have 3 genuinely new levels
 That's the same amount as in the Brigmore Witches, for double the price
 That said, the new levels were all fantastically atmospheric, particularly the final one
- OG+ mode is awful, and only allowd you to use three powers from the previous games - Blink, Domino, and Dark Vision
- The characters are all pretty badly written
 Daud is especially dire, and doesn't act in any way resembling his real character
- Billie's powers are awkward and limiting, making it far less enjoyable to play than previous games- There is no way to upgrade or buy powers, so this is the first Dishonoured game with no progression system whatsoever- Sometimes you finish a level only to learn that a character has died, even though you never killed anyone
- Only 5 missions
 Honestly, I was expecting more for my money
Overall, it's still good fun if you like Dishonoured
 I got 20+ hours out of it
 But if I had to rank both Dishonoured games, the Dishonoured DLCs, and Death of the Outsider, I would consider this to be the worst
Posted: 18 September
I really wanted to like this but overall it's not worth full price
 Its definitely not a bad game but I can't give it a thumbs up
 The gameplay is just as good as it is in Dishonored 1 and 2 but this one has some other big issues
 To start with there's only 5 missions and the last one seems like they're padding by placing a bunch of enemies on the map and trying to make the game longer
 My second issue is the writing, it's pretty bad and the story is not great
 This one is also far more linear and only having 3 powers doesn't help that
 I was also looking forward to original game + but was disapointed when I found out you only get 3 powers and don't get to choose
 The powers you get from Dishonored 2 are also pretty similar to the ones Billie already had
 On a positive side the performance is pretty good and there's alot of options to tweak including a FOV slider
 If you've never played Dishonored 1 or 2 pick those up instead
 I would only get this if you love Dishonored and have played the first 2
 This is definitely the weakest in the series so far
 I liked the idea of a standalone release since I didn't own Dishonored 2 on PC but this seems like it should have been 15$ dlc
Posted: 16 September
I really hate how they wrote the Outsider in this game
The Outsider was one of the strongest characters in the first game and knife of dunwall
In Dishonored 2, they changed his appearance and voice actor, and his writing felt weaker
In Death of the Outsider, he was just plain uninteresting
 Which pretty much sums up this whole dlc
 Not offensive, but nothing particularly memorable
Get Knife of Dunwall instead
Posted: 16 September
This is my favorite franchise of all time
 I've bought every game and bit of DLC released
 Even the books and such
 I have almost 160 hours logged in D1 and over 90 in D2, so it pains me to say that DOTO did not hit the spot for me
 I paid $50 for a six hour game for starters
 This just wasn't long or deep enough to warrant a full separate release
 It should have been $20 DLC
 Spoilers may follow:- The ending of D1 left me awed at the journey the game had taken me on
 The end of D2 left me satisfied that things had been set right
 The end of DOTO made me feel like I'd been trapped in a corner by a philosophy major who'd had too many coffees and wouldn't STFU
 I was caught between apathy and annoyance
Posted: 26 September
Is Dishonored: Death of the Outsider a good game
 Absolutely
Is it worth $30
 That, is debatable
Depending on how you play, the game can have a lot - or very little to offerIf you're going for a no-kill, never-detected playthrough, then you're in for a pretty fun game
 You can spend 5 hours on a single mission alone, finding all the different nooks and crannies to try and find the tools you need to do the job quietly
But if you don't care about any of that and you go around sword fighting everyone and not really trying to avoid detection, then the game can be over real quick, even if you're not trying to speedrun it
There's only 5 missions
 Some are a lot longer than others, and some feel repeated
 I mean Missions 2 and 3 happen in the same level, and Mission 4 is just a redecorated area from the base Dishonored 2 game
 Kinda feels lazy, although Karnaca is still a beautiful city, I wish there were more new areas that I haven't already seen
The plot is
 Eh
 I mean it's an awesome concept, "Kill the Outsider, kill a God" but there's no final boss fight against him or anything so don't get excited
 It feels a bit weak in some parts - Billie, the main character, is so quick to hop aboard the "Lets kill a god" train
 She needs literally 0 convincing to agree to help Daud end the Outsider
 Overall - great concept - not-so-great execution
 I won't say poor execution because it still held my interests, just some parts made me thing "Um
okay"If you ever wanted to get the game, I'd say it's enjoyable - but wait for it to go on sale to get your money's worth
If I were rating this on a scale of 1 - 5, I'd give Dishonored Death of the Outside a REAL strong 3/5
 It's a good game, and I had fun
 But you might not enjoy it that much if you're not that into the Dishonored franchise
If you're just starting with Dishonored - go play the first two games before this, and see if you enjoy them
 If you did, you'll most likely enjoy this
Posted: 19 September
First of all, this game should be a 10 dollar DLC, not a 30 dollar standalone
Secondly, this game kinda sucks
The most fun part of Dishonored was how there were multiple, creative ways for you to get through an area
However, in this game, you only get 3 powers, and their functions only reinforce the linearity of the levels
The powers are a sort of blink where you can leave behind a marker and teleport to it later (the only thing that can be used creatively in combat) a sort of dark vision, and a camflauge
None can be upgraded
The ability to speak to rats is ultimately useless as they tell you nothing you couldn't simply find out by looking around
There really isn't anything interesting for you to do in each level, which would sometimes lead me to just run straight for the objective and get it over with
I haven't even bothered playing original game plus, I heard it only gives you 3 powers from the original game which are very similar to Billie's default powers, not helping at all
 Another problem;
The game is 5 missions long
Way too short for the price they placed on it
Also probably plays a role in how crappy the story is since there wasn't enough game time for it to develop
Let's talk about the story
Sucks
Rescuing Daud felt incredibly anti climactic and all of his character was thrown out the window
He's only here this game to tell you to kill The Outsider
Pretty disappointing, I really liked Daud in the first game
And the whole "kill The Outsider" thing seems interesting at first but it isn't
There isn't really any build up to it or feeling of "oo I can't wait to kill him and see what happens
"
The ending is also very anti-climactic, and this whole story itself seems unnecessary
All this does is make The Outsider even less of a mysterious, omniscient being, which are his interesting traits
If you really want to play it, wait for it to go on sale for at least 50%
There's no boss and the last level is just a bunch of enemies simply to make it last longer

Ah, KOTOR II
 Where to start
 First, download The Sith Lords: Restored Content Mod
 I state this because the standard game is highly unpolished, is missing a lot of extra dialogue and has many bugs that will frustrate anybody, whether they are new to Star Wars or loved the first KOTOR
This game shows mechanics that would later be implemented into Mass Effect
 A definite meter to determine morality, the breaking down of gear into components (or "omni-gel" for you Spectres), combat that can be paused while issuing commands to you and your squad along with a focus on dialogue options between NPCs and your companions
 Your choices in these dialogues could allow you to avoid a combat situation, help progress a quest, or give more information on your companions or your surroundings
Those familiar with some Star Wars lore (such as the movies or KOTOR I) are probably aware of the black-and-white morality shown
 For example, KOTOR I gives you a situation where a woman is attempting to sell a hunters trophy belonging to her late husband
 You can either buy the trophy from her (the light option), or convince the woman using the Force to give you the item (the dark option)
 KOTOR II blurs morality into tones of grey, where the Jedi are not seen entirely as the paragon of all that is good and where the ultimate "light" option is not always perceived as the most prudent one
Part of this blurring of the lines is due to Kreia, one of the companions accompanying you, the Jedi Exile
 A mysterious woman whose becomes more cryptic with every word, her musings and personality have convinced me she is one of the most fleshed-out and well written characters in video game history
 The strange thing is, not many of the other characters seem as interesting as Kreia in comparison
 Actually, I'm somewhat wrong; HK-47 is a great companion as well
 His mannerisms about murder, his copies and his past are worth listening to if you want to chuckle
 Atton is somewhat interesting wisecracking pilot and the remaining characters aren't worth writing home about
 They're not bad characters, just not great ones
I'm going to stop this review now before I type spoilers and just tell you to play it
 If you enjoyed Mass Effect, if you played KOTOR 1, if you enjoy learning about the lore of Star Wars, or if you need an RPG fix sorted out, KOTOR II is a great option
 Just make sure to get the Restored Content Mod
 It's really necessary to have a good experience

Graphics are nice, scales nice
If you're gonna play, DO NOT FORGET TO DOWNLOAD THE RESTORED CONTENT MOD
 It replaces all the lost scenes and quest arcs left out from the console port

"Perhaps you were expecting some surprise, for me to reveal a secret that had eluded you, something that would change your perspective of events, shatter you to your core
 There is no great revelation, no great secret
 There is only you
"That is the culmination of Obsidian's Knights of the Old Republic II, a game which flips the entire Star Wars universe on its head via deep character interactions and a unique spin on established aspects of the franchise
Make no mistake - the original release of KOTOR II was a flawed, incomplete mess
 Not only was it missing a large chunk of its ending (notably, what happened to the player's squadmates when they landed on the final planet), but it was buggy and prone to all sorts of glitches
 Yet, despite all that, the game still remains a classic of the RPG genre for how often it defies standard conventions and plays with the series' established tropes
You play the Exile, a former commander who committed a terrible sin to stop the Mandalorian Wars, and was exiled from the Jedi Order because of it
 The game begins with the Exile waking up onboard the Peragus mining facility, alongside T3-M4 (a returning character from the first game) and an enigmatic woman named Kreia, who knows more than she lets on
 Together with sprung prisoner (and ace pilot) Atton Rand, the quartet escapes the facility and discover that the Jedi have been driven to near-extinction
 With the help of a cast of supporting squadmates, including a former Sith protegee named Visas, the fun-loving (well, as fun as a homicidal robot can be) assassin droid HK-47, a bounty hunter, the leader of the Mandalores and more, the Exile sets out to stop the Sith and rebuild the Jedi Order
The biggest difference between this and KOTOR I is how linear this game is
 Not that it diminishes the plot at all, but there's a definite rhythm to the way you approach areas and plot situations
 Whereas the original game's only real goal was to activate the four pillars to find out the location of the Star Forge before assaulting it, II has you either aiding or working against a planet's internal war, taking part in a trial to exonerate a wrongfully-accused civilian, taking apart a crime syndicate and more
 The plot is a lot tighter and focused than its predecessor
The cast of characters is where the game really shines, though
 Aside from Kreia (an enigmatic woman who stresses being neutral in all decisions), every character has some backstory that requires trust and increasing the "Force Bond" with them to access
 I truly liked that you could upgrade various aspects of your teammates' abilities by either talking to them a lot or helping them with certain decisions
It's pretty much a given that if you're going to play KOTOR II, you need the Restored Content Mod
 Not only does it restore the bulk of the ending which was scrapped by Obsidian in their rush to finish the game for a Christmas deadline, but it also fixes a lot of the bugs and underlying coding issues found throughout the game
 I used it the first time I played the game, and I can't imagine going without it
 In the same vein, the M4-78 Enhancement Project fills in an unfinished questline and gives some great upgrades to your droid party members, along with some awesome consequences later in the game - I was so pumped to see the droid army helping me during a later encounter
It's not all perfect, though
 While the crafting system is very good (and has shades of Mass Effect, which came out three years later), it's far too easy to be stuck with a large amount of components and weapons that are unusable, and there's never any real need to upgrade your gear beyond a handful of weapons
Likewise, the ending (even with the Restored Content Mod) is a huge slog
 There's a mid-mission quest with a robotic remote, which you are forced into, which is impossible to complete if you didn't clear out all the enemies from the map just prior to starting it
 Likewise, the final fortress is a huge slog and is only passable through spamming Force powers or avoiding the majority of enemies
That said, KOTOR II is well worth your time and money
 The way it turns many of the elements of the Star Wars universe on its head and keeps up the energy and characterization through its runtime is still near-unmatched in this day and age, and I heartily recommend that every RPG fan check this game out at least once

KOTOR II is one of those classic RPGs I can replay over and over
 This sequel was released in 2004 and is still a great game and remains extremely playable today
 Even though Bioware developed the first KOTOR, they ended up handing the job over to Obsidian who, as always, did a fantastic job with their work
The use of KOTOR II's Light Side/Dark Side system is a lot like the modern day systems of good/evil characters
 When you as the
character does or says evil things then you grow more in tune with the dark side of the force
 The contrast to this is of course, doing good deeds and saying not-so-evil stuff
 This leads to the Light side of the force
 In either case you will grow more powerful and influence those you travel with
 This will also effect your force powers amongst many other things
The StoryThe single defining feature of KOTOR or KOTOR II is the story
 Anyone who loves Star Wars must love a good mythos from the Star Wars world, especially one this early in the timeline of the Star Wars Universe
 This sequel begins when a stranger, oblivious to his past, wakes up in a Mining Station medical bay, only to notice no one is around
 No one
except a mysterious elderly woman
 Journey to several planets and cause havok or create order
 Kill the weak or defend them
 All the while, you search for the power to make you a Master of the Force
Pros:- Great main storyline with various other mini-quests, all which act in canon with the Star Wars universe
- Open world that you would expect from an RPG- Choose what you say to someone carefully; You could end up in a fight or effect the story
- Choose light or dark side; Your actions will decide what you become
- Tons of lore from the Star Wars universe you can't find anywhere else
Cons:- Graphics are from the first Xbox generation, but it still holds today
- Some of the voice overs for alien species are simply repeated recordings on loop
- Occasionally, a glitch or two might happen- RARELY, but sometimes there are game breaking bugs
 There are only two that I know of, and one of them ruined my first game
 This requires the double save slow technique
 Verdict
 - 8
5/10 This is my favorite Star Wars game hands down
 Many people also recognize this particular game to be LucasArts' crowing achievement
 Obsidian does a great job with the sequel to Bioware's KOTOR and does Star Wars in general great justice
Posted: 15 July, 2013
Well, I liked this game so much I spend years working on a mod to fix issues with it that happened due to LucasArts rushing Obsidian
 And again several to work on adding a cut planet (M4-78) with a lot of self-made content to make it a fully fleshed out planet matching the ones ingame
 That should tell you enough
 If not just know this is a "must play" RPG you can't miss
EDIT:Since it was unclear for some people which mod I talk about, TSLRCM
 You can now get it from the Workshop

A great idea for a main character, memorable teammates and a plot shrouded in mystery makes The Sith Lords one of my favourite games of all time
 Some people may find the first section of the game quite linear, but the game only really begins once you leave Telos
 Also, the wait for a lightsaber makes getting it all the better
Be sure to install the latest version of the Restored Content Mod, which adds in dialogue, scenes and missions that were cut from the official release
 The mod also removes many of the games glitches

It took me a little while to really warm up to this game
 Since I like the movie a lot, I had to get used to the different looks and voices of the main characters a little bit, at first
 Also the relatively limited freedom of movement in this style of game felt restrictive
 After I replayed the first episode on a different path and continued to the second episode I was hooked and the game became really immersive
 The story feels authentic, fresh and original, with a sense of mystery, humor and adventure
 I loved the ancient alien temples and locations, somehow they felt very real
 I began to care about the characters
 By the 2nd episode I really felt at home on this ship and enjoyed being with this colorful bunch of characters, learning more about their personal struggles and living the adventure
 Can’t wait to play the next episode

I don't quite know what to say
 It seems as if there is less and less effort being put into these games as time goes on
 It's heavily reliant on QTE more than real storytelling now
 The episodes themselves are growing much shorter and for a first episode I found this truly weak
 I'm not saying it was bad I just wouldn't reccomend it until the rest of the series is out
Posted: 6 June
Not for everyone, the "action" scenes are nothing more than glorified QTE's
 This is above all a point and click adventure, and a good one, not the best of it's genre but not the worst either
 Much like Tales from the Borderlands, you start to make meaningfull choices early on and your choices will affect the other characters, whic is made even harder if you have seen the movies or read the comics
 I alos like the art style of this one, it's more like an animated film than a comic book, mixes it up abit
 Still, I wish this were a short film or mini series rather than a game, as most TellTale games feel
 Get this only if you are patient enough to put up with it, and dont go in expecting it to be a third movie because you'll be very disappointed
 Oh, and TellTale, please get a new engine to run your games on, I am getting way to much stutter for my PC's specs
Posted: 10 October
First off, I want to go ahead and qualify that I am a big Telltale fan
 I've played every one of their story games since Back to the Future
I can't, in any good conscience, recommend this Telltale title
 I'm not really sure what happened here, but I feel like the Telltale team (sorry guys) really phoned this one in
 It feels like nothing you do or say matters like previous titles, and overall the story isn’t even that spectacular
 Telltale’s games have been getting better and better with each new title, but I feel like something happened here
 Something internal to the company changed and things went haywire
 There’s no other way to describe the poor writing, poor dialogue, and overall poor gameplay
 Each episode lasts about 45-70 minutes which is WAY below their previous titles
 I remember Wolf Among Us taking roughly 2-3 hours per episode
 Every single time an episode would conclude in Guardians of the Galaxy I would feel massive disappointment
 “Wait… that’s it
” was a pretty common phrase that I uttered
 I’m not recommending this title simply because I’d like it to be brushed under the rug
 I don’t want people new to Telltale to think that this is how these games usually are
 So I want the reviews to reflect this
 I want to detour anyone thinking that this is where they should start for Telltale
 I also want to warn any diehard fans to keep their money and wait for something more up to the quality that we’ve come to expect from Telltale
 Could it be that Telltale has decided to take on too many projects at a time
 It does seem like they’re juggling an awful lot of other titles and I would hate to think that those titles were suffering all in the same way because of some financial bottom line they hoped to meet
 I’m so sorry Telltale
 I never thought I’d see the day I’d say “No” to one of your games
 You can do better, you have done better, and I still look forward to whatever comes next
 We’re still on your side
 Just don’t lose whatever goodness you started with

(This review has been rewritten for episode 1-5
)This game was a hell of a ride, I wasn't big into superheroes until recently and Telltale really helped me love the Guardians and Batman through their games
This is a game about your family, in this case (members of the 'Guardians')

This is everything that TWD: Season 3 wasn't
 If Telltale keeps up like this and ditches the lazy, repetitive and forced gameplay from the TWD then they're gonna be back on top
After TWD, I was ready to pack it in for Telltale but this has made me change my mind
 If you're thinking about picking this up, do it, it's refreshing to see Telltale bring this up to the standard of Wolf Among Us and the first two TWD seasons
Plus, ELO on the main menu
 10/10
Posted: 7 June
What can I say
 It's Guardians of the Galaxy
 If you're a fan of the comics or movies then chances are you'll like the game
Great Story
 Great Soundtrack
 Only downside is the long wait between episodes
Even for someone who is completely new to the Guardians universe the game sets up the characters and gives plenty of backstory while walking around on the ship that you'll be able to catch on to who everyone is and what's going on fairly quickly

Voice Acting: GoodPlot: Captivating & InterestingAction: FunComedy: Light hearted, slightly worse than the movies but by no means badCaptured the essence of the movies pretty well
 
Posted: 28 April
A fun game that only Telltale could do
 It's story is a mix between the movie and the comic book source as a whole
 And just like the Batman game they are making it their own
 Not as much as the Batman game but this is a uniquly telltale story set in the Marvel U
 The setup for the next epsiodes seems decent enough to keep me going but the character dynamics are spot on
 And the action sequences were well done, fluid and quick with the right ammount of tension
 I can't wait for episode two, just wish the epsiodes were just a bit longer then the usal 60-90 min playtime

I do recommened this game however, I sadly had more negatives things to say 
Great first game and looking forward to further touch ups and improvements in the future 
Bought this because I have much love and mad respect for Game Grumps
However
 I want to give an 100% honest review
 Probably gonna get a lot of hate for this one - please note it's just my opinion
 The game is
 extremely short in a sense and lacks any real "spark" on some of dates
 It can be
 rather boring
 It's quite upsetting that you only get three short dates with one person and then it's over
 It makes it hard to really build any sort of emotional connection with the person of choice (wow almost like a real date
 haha
) It's a hefty amount of reading which is fine with me honestly but as it is said to be voiced, this can be misleading as its 'voices' are grunts, huffs etc
It makes me very upset as a fellow Grump fan to say that I don't think this game was worth $15 USD ($19 AUD for me
) Highly recommened to wait for this game to come out on sale
 It is still a good game and the storyline mainly follows the life of a single dad of whom guides his daughter, Amanda, in the later stages of being a teenager
 The scenes with Amanda are very heartfelt and thought provoking, especially considering I'm a female of whom is not a Dad and doesn't have a child
 If you were to touch up this game it'd be nice to see some "out-of-style-type" cutscenes, if that makes any sense
 Like in Persona 5 for example, they have their art style for when you're fighting and running around etc
 but then they have anime-like cutscenes where it shows lovely movement and flows really nicely
 That would've broken up DDADDS really nicely if it had cutscenes similar to that
To end on a good note
- Amazing puns- Amazing art- Amazing Dads: I like each individuals personalities, they're all quite unique and have varied styles
- Amazing team and crew

I think I need to disclose some things before I start talking about why I do not recommend buying Dream Daddy
 The first is that I adore Game Grumps (specifically Arin and Dan), and that they've had nothing to do with the development of the game save for some voicing-- which is really just grunts and 'ah
's, and some marketing on their channel
 The fact that the Grumps' name is on this shouldn't really be taken into account
 The second is that I bought it pretty much the day of release and had been following it since it'd been announced
 Not as actively as some people, but I knew about all the dads
I'm going to be starting with the negatives-- frankly, the game itself isn't *really* the issue here
 It's the developers
The developers have been a little shady from day one
 Originally, I was unsure if this game was meant to be a joke, like a lot of other people first suspected-- I'm a queer man, so I was hesitant at first
 I think it's important to note that I DID read several posts online about how someone close to the dev team had played the beta and got the impression that this was a grab at Representation Points(tm) and that it was just a cash grab-- here's the post
 [yollgraveyard
tumblr
com] During the release delay, the devs were suspiciously quiet-- they apologized afterwards, but it was still super unprofessional
I also vaguely remember (EDIT: I should mention that I can't be bothered to dredge up proof of this) the devs promising they'd add other dads and extra content, and a few of my friends remember them saying similar
 And these two above points are absolutely tied; we're three months out from DD's release date, and the devs have gone silent
 Since release, we've gotten two patches-- two bug patches, despite fans asking for more
 There's still a bugged achievement that the devs haven't explained, and the second patch was a patch so small that it isn't even mentioned on the Recent Updates section of steam, nor on any of the twitter accounts
The devs have essentially dropped this project as soon as it stopped making money and was no longer in top sellers for the fact that it's a queer dating sim
 Which is what a lot of people feared
 I feel genuinely ripped off by the developers and the game; if it weren't for the fact that I've got more than 2 hours of this game, which is INCREDIBLY short and lacks any real story arc to tie everyone together, I'd refund it in a heartbeat
 This game is almost $20 AUD and yet I wouldn't honestly say it's worth even that much, especially considering a) length and the fact that the game isn't even really complete and b) the devs have abandoned it
It's a shame, because otherwise, the game is really pretty and has some great characters; Mat's route is my favourite and the game introduced me to PUP, one of my favourite bands now
 It's diverse and cute and I love the fact that you can make a trans dad (even if the CC is godawful compared to character art), BUT the fact that you can now tell that it absolutely was a cash grab destroys it all, and
I wouldn't recommend buying
this game to anyone because of it

Tldr: cute but wait for a sale
The artwork is great and the stories I've done so far are cute, but
i just expected so much more
 I really wanted to like this and especially after waiting through delays and being so excited I'm super disappointed
 The game, at least to me, feels cheaper than it is
 I just don't feel the price tag is justified
 I do feel it's important to mention that i love how inclusive this game is, I just really hope the devs continue to add to it and hopefully address some issues
- There isn't proper voice acting- The customization for your dad kind of sucks- it would have been nice to customize your child or at least pick between a son or daughter but that isn't a big issue -while the story is adorable, it feels really basic and bare
 I didn't personally get much connection with the characters something which is important for this type of game
 I know a lot of people will disagree
with my review and that's cool
 I'm glad most people are in love with this, but it's just not worth $15 in my eyes
Posted: 22 July
First of all, I DID like the game
 But it was, at the same time, deceiving
 I'd give it a 6/10, but if it were the right price, I'd give it a 8
5/10 for sure
Let's start with the good things about it: it is a very enjoyable, nice and light game
 Most dads are also charming, the art is great, too
But on the other hand
 routes are extremely, extremely short
 Takes around 45 minutes to complete each route
 Not only that, but the endings are very limited, only having 2 endings, so there's no room for replaying it to find the rest of the endings
 I remember the Official Twitter promised multiple endings per dad
 You don't get to know the characters, and most of the time, it doesn't really feel like you're flirting with them
 I only got that impression with Damien
 It's like you guys are obviously just friends until the end of the third date where you suddenly kiss and love each other
 I was really excited to do Brian's route, but was very deceived to find that his route is just
 being rivals and at the very end kissing
 Nothing more
 It felt empty and superficial, despite the cute shirtless moment or the final kiss and hug at Amanda's party
 Didn't feel like a real developing relationship
 I think that it wasn't only because of how short the route is, but because of how it was written as well
 You could also have a short route where it does seem like they're flirting, like Damien's
Your character also has a personality that can't be changed, which I've found a bit distracting when it came to dating other dads, because I felt there was no chemistry between my character and his love interest even if I really liked the dad I was trying to romance just because my character spoke for me
 I don't know if this is normal for dating sims, though
Next issue is how overpriced it is for such a short game
 15 dollars isn't what this game is worth, in my opinion
 I'm mostly upset about having spent that amount of money on a game that isn't worth it
 Had it been cheaper I would have been content because I paid for the content I was given
 It is, still, a very nice enjoyable lighthearted game
Another thing that bothered me was the voices
 Grunts isn't voicing and it gets really annoying
 I don't care about the Game Grumps, but it feels like they haven't done much for the game
 Would have been better if they hadn't participated in this project at all
And now, this is my personal opinion but
 Amanda can get reaaaaally annoying
 I know it's a Dad game and all that, but when you have to do several routes and hear her story once and once again it gets tiring and irritating
 But once again
 this is a nice game
 Cute, entertaining (except for the Amanda bits
) and with interesting characters, even though they don't really get to be fleshed out
 I recommend it, but not for this price
 I'd wait for a sale
 I really, really hope more content is added later on, because despite my review looking negative, I really liked the game and some of the dads and I'm looking forward to some more dad dating

Posted: 25 July
I really wanted to like this game, and was really excited to play it but honestly for me it was a huge let down
There are some bugs in the system that really took me out of the experience
 For example at the beginning you have to choose if you had a wife or husband previously
 I chose wife but time and time again they were refered to as 'dad' or 'your father', just a small thing but quite irritating when I was given a choice
 I also had some really weird stuff with Robert's route at the end where he got mad at me for trying to sleep with him, and I did nothing of the kind
 It's like the games branches aren't working properly (another example is my character asking him about Val, and in that route he never told me about her
) It just takes you out of the experience and leaves you quite confused
 You think this kind of thing would have been ironed out in testing
 The entire game became quite formulaic to me as just one wrong answer can give you a bad mark and apparently a bad ending, so I took to saving before every answer to make sure I got hearts for it
 Going back and loading and saving for answers that seem really inconsiquential is a silly way to play a game like this but I really didn't want to have to skip through all the scenes again and again to get the good ending because of one wrong answer
 My main gripe however is that the game just feels
hollow
 I really applaud the game for its inclusion, but the vast majority of the characters are really tropey and without any depth
 The dates with them are super short and seem to go nowhere exciting
 Honestly
I think the plots are really dull
 They just do not DO anything
 To have a characters entire story be 'I secretly like a sport that millions love worldwide' is not really the heartwrenching, romantic plot you expect from a dating sim
 There is no build up to these romances, they come out of nowhere almost every time and feel forced and unnatural
 There are so many things that are mentioned that seem important then never come up again, and a lot of the routes are very similar
 In fact they ALL end on the exact same ending which kind of makes it feel like the whole thing was pointless to begin with
 I'm not expecting Shakespeare or anything, but i've played dating sims which have made me tremble with anticipation and cry with sadness for way less money
 (Tbh I wish they put that 'secret ending' in, because at least that sounds exciting, and all the hints for it are in the game
) It's like they couldn't decide where they wanted this game to go or be
- funny, serious, sexy
 So instead it's a mishmash of all those things and all of them fail
 Some of the dialogue is funny but it's not sidesplittingly funny as the situations don't give rise to anything that could be
 Some of the scenes seem like they might be sexy then they cut to black
 Moments feel like they might be serious and finally going somewhere, but then they're over in a click
 It just feels rushed, unfinished and wholly unsatisfying
 I can't even say it's TERRBLE cause it doesnt do anything extreme enough to be terrible, it's just dull dull dull, and in a way, I think that's far worse
 :/

STAR WARS™ - Knights of the Old Republic™ – Adventure/RPG; Squad Tacticsa spoiler-free reviewRating: Recommended as EssentialYou wake up on a battle cruiser during an all-out firefight, find your way to the escape pods when it gets severely damaged, fight your way through enemy soldiers and crash-land on an unfamiliar planet
 Knights of the Old Republic [KOTOR] takes place some 4,000 years before the events of A New Hope; Yoda, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker are names of no consequence in the Star Wars universe
 You are in completely new, unfamiliar territory here
Star Wars fan or not, KOTOR is a game that everyone should play
 A companion system ahead of its time, multiple storylines, rich dialogue and backstory, YELLOW lightsabers and a unique tactical approach to combat allow this installment in the Star Wars series of games to really shine
- Companions -You will meet several unique, diverse characters in your travels; a few of them can join your party
 Grab two party members of your choice and your main character and hit the streets (or dunes, or forests, or whatever)
 These characters come with set attributes and skills, but when they level up (yes, there is a leveling/experience system; this is an RPG), you control how they improve
- Story -No spoilers here, don’t worry
 There are a multitude of side-quests to complete that complement the main quest, backstories to explore for each of your party members, fascinating lore on the origins of a few prominent species and multiple storylines
 Depending on dialogue decisions, you can earn either Light Side or Dark Side points, determining the final path your story takes
- Cons -Not too many of note
 I clipped through the floor a couple times
 A number of seemingly random fatal crashes
 This game was put out in 2003, so it’s a little behind the times in visuals and the cutscenes are really cheesy
 The camera is a bit tricky to figure out at first
 If you’re not expecting tactical battles (give orders rather than do battle yourself), it can be quite confusing
 The biggest thing is that your companions will, at times, slow down or stop when you’re not looking for no reason, preventing you from entering the next area
The Bottom Line: None of these presents anything more than minor frustration; the game is well-built
Well, that’s all I have to say about KOTOR
 An aged but timeless classic that any Star Wars fan (and quite a few non-Star Wars fans) will enjoy

Amazing Story

Great and Addictive Combat3
Tons Of Side Questsand finaly 4
 BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED
Verdict this game is to good for standard Scoring 11/10
Posted: 30 April, 2015
I got this game on a sale for 1
49 EUR and it was the best deal ever, it turned out to be amazing
 It's not for everyone however, as it's quite long, you need to pay attention to the story and get used to the clunky combat - you'll either love it or give up in the first few hours
I started the game to see what it's like, struggled with the fighting, played half an hour until it suddenly crashed and I realised I didn't save the game
 I didn't really like what I saw first, but I decided to give it another chance
 Fortunately, the dialogues are skippable, so I could continue almost immediately and this time I read the tutorial more attentively and managed to find out how to properly kill enemies
 As the story progressed, I got more and more into it and started to enjoy the game very much
GraphicsEven though the game came out in 2007, it's beautiful
 The environments are detailed, colourful and interesting, most places are not just visually but aesthetically pleasing
 Heck, even some dark crypts and caves look exquisite here and there due to the nice colours and great lighting
GameplayWhen you start the game, you have to choose a style you want to play it in, and you still have the opportunity to change this anytime
 You can have an isometric camera or OTS, so you can play point and click style, and also in third person if you want to (I chose the latter)
 Being inexperienced with RPGs, I played on easy
 My character became pretty strong eventually (maybe too strong for this difficulty), yet there still were a few challenging parts to balance that out
As you play, you gain XP and level up
 While meditating, you can access the skill tree, which looked a bit complicated at first, but it makes perfect sense
 Alchemy is pretty useful, especially for bigger fights, I haven't used any bombs though
The gameplay is not particularly interesting on its own, the story is what makes it special
 Sometimes there's a lot of running back and forth, collecting things, which gets boring after a while
 I was very grateful for the few fast travel options we got
On the other hand, there are lots of side quests to keep you busy
 Some of them are of the general collect-this-and-I-reward-you tpye, and there are more important ones as well
 Some side quests enrich the story a lot and have an overall impact on how you experience it, so it's definitely worth completing those
CombatIt's doubtless that this is the low point of the game
 The first time I saw Geralt grabbing a sword and swinging it around above his head like an idiot, I laughed out loud, I thought it was a bug
 (Later though as I applied more talents on the swords, he became a much better fighter
) To evade attacks you need to dodge by pressing one of the direction buttons twice or more times, depending on how responsive it wants to be in the current situation, I had some trouble sometimes when Geralt got cornered
 To attack, you need to click on the enemy and do not click again immediately, doing so will cancel the attack
 Only click again when the cursor changes, allowing you to do combos if you click in time
 It definitely takes some getting used to
Collect as much information as you can on the enemies you have to face, it's important to read the Journal, especially the pages on Monsters to learn what they're immune to, where they can be found, which fighting styles are efficient against them
 It helps you a great deal
 The Signs are very useful and fun, too
The controls during combat are pretty awkward sometimes, even if I had the right fighting style selected, I couldn't attack or hurt the enemies
 I had to switch to another style and then back for it to decide to work again
StoryAfter the low point, here comes the best part
 The story in this game is incredible
 It's very detailed, very deep and exciting
 The dialogues are filled with humour and deep philosophical thoughts here and there
The world is consistent, the characters are likeable and unique, after a while you find yourself caring about many of them
 They all respond to your actions and choices
 There's quite a number of decisions you have to make that (sometimes pretty heavily) affect the story and your relationship to certain characters
 I loved the amount of freedom I had in the game, I was never forced to get in an intimate relationship with any character or play dice, etc
 - it's entirely up to the player
The way women were portrayed though - boobs, boobs and more boobs
 I've seen more boobs in this game than my own
 :P Jokes aside, I simply had to play very carefully when others were in the same room with me, because almost every woman you can interact with is um
 underdressed
 Good for Geralt I guess
 ;)As you play more and more, the story just drags you in - even if you don't like the combat or the gameplay, it's definitely worth to play this through just for the story alone
Animation and voicesThis is something I wasn't entirely pleased with
 Yes, it's not a game from today, but the characters often looked very stiff, which is not a good thing when there's a lot of dialogue
 Another thing which detracts from the experience is the mediocre voice acting
 First I found it very awkward, but got used to it eventually and after a certain point it simply didn't bother me anymore
(I kept finding the same character models throughout the game though, now that did annoy me a bit
)Music and atmosphereThe music was pretty great, fast paced and dark when needed, beautiful and calming while exploring beautiful areas
 It really spiced some great moments up
 Same with the atmosphere, the time of day really sets the mood of some locations, as well as the occasional rain and storms
I also loved the art style, there's some gorgeous artwork during storytelling parts
Summary:+ nice visuals+ amazing story with brilliant dialogues+ great music and atmosphere- combat might be hard to get used to- bad animationsIt took me 46 hours to finish the adventure and it's become one of my all-time favourite games
 If you can get used to the combat and want to take a break from no-brainers, I highly recommend The Witcher, it's going to be an amazing and unforgettable experience

When I first played The Witcher, I was in middle school and I had pirated the game
 Like most middle schoolers, I wasn’t very smart and the only thing I really looked for in a game was how many bad guys I could murder
 I finished the game and quickly forgot about it
 Only after I was in college did I realize to the full extent the awful choices that I had made during my first playthrough of The Witcher
 My crimes were beyond description
 I killed street dogs and innocent travelers just to loot 2 orens worth of stuff from their corpses
 I slept with women and promptly abandoned them to be murdered by angry mobs or overzealous knights
 I killed a fellow witcher
 I walked away from a chance to have a happy family with a woman who loved me in order to sleep with my sex buddy sorceress who I thought looked hotter
 I helped commit mass genocide, murdering dozens of non-humans fighting for freedom
By chance I happened to see The Witcher: Enhanced Edition on sale during Steam Summer Sale 2014
 I took it as a sign from heaven
 Lord Gaben the Redeemer was speaking to me through my computer, offering me a chance to atone for my sins of the first playthrough
 Now I could do what I had not done in middle school
 I would uphold justice and help the weak
 I would be the hero that Vizima needed, but not the one it deserved
 And I could do it with 75% off
 I clicked buy and my $1
99 ascended to the heavens while the face of Lord Gaben smiled down upon me

The Witcher Saga begins here for "Geralt of Rivia",* One of the Best Stories told in a RPG, it's not just the Main Campaign even all the Side Mission adds lot of depth
* The In-Game Choices & Path you choose defines how the story & gameplay unfolds, I loved it
 * Sound & Music are Awesome, so does the dialogues which were very nicely done
* Atmospere & Graphics are good nothing ground breaking though for game released on 2008 using Aurora Engine
* Such a Dynamic Combat System, It's Joy Ride to Play on Hard Mode that’s where you start using lot of "Alchemy"* Many People didn't like the control system, even i find it very wonky at the beginning but once you familiarize them it's a cake walk
Four years back I've finished this Game twice with "Sco'iatel Path" & "Order's Path" each in a Non-Steam Version and now this time around In Steam Version - I’ve done it right and completed the game with "Neutral Path" which is the True Witcher's Path
****A Definitely Must Play RPG for the Fans of the Genre
""""Witcher 1 >> Awesome
Witcher 2 >> Stunning
Witcher 3 >> Spectacular

This game
 It's amazing
 First off, don't let the first chapter fool you
 It starts off really slow
 Like, REALLY slow
 It can turn a lot of people off
 The slow-paced combat at the beginning and a few graphical hitches doesn't help it at all
 In fact, it took multiple attempts to try to get into the game because of it, as I felt there were just better games for me to play
But, once I got through that first chapter, the game picked up quickly
 You encounter unique characters and environments, difficult decisions that aren't just black & white "good versus evil", a great soundtrack, an engaging storyline, and hell, even the combat begins to show a little variety
Overall, this game is just absolutely great
 I recommend playing it on the Hard difficulty, as it feels like the right way to play the Witcher
 You have to make use of your alchemy to make bombs, potions and oils to turn the battlefield to your favor

The Witcher: Utterly brilliant, but rough and over-ambitiousThe first game in The Witcher series has often been called a "rough diamond", so my title doens't tell anything new
 This review was wrtten just a couple of days before the release of The Witcher 3, and without having played The Witcher 2 yet
 This way I hope to be able to look at the original game in the series with fresh eyes, not with the hindsight of the other games somewhere in the back of my head
 It's also important to notice that this review addresses the final release of the game, from september 2008, i
e
 The "Enhanced Edition: The Director's Cut"
 This version represents the developers' final thoughts and ideas on the game, and it differs considerably from any other version
In this game, the player takes the role of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher or a professional monster-slayer
 There is no character-build menu, no fancy options about hair-colour or the width of your eyebrows
 You are Geralt of Rivia, you are a Witcher
 And to put it simple: the game is so utterly brilliant since it manages to let you believe that, almost from the start
 Seldom have I felt so deeply connected to the character I was playing: after a couple of in-game hours, I started to think as Geralt, react to my surroundings as Geralt, even feel like Geralt: I was completely involved, the game got deep under my skin, I was bewitched
 It's not that I played the game for hours and hours on end, or that I played through the night, no: it's more like I felt Geralt had become part of my life, not only while in-game, but also while not playing
 I started to look for articles and websites to read about The Witcher and its world, and I even dreamt a couple of times about the game and its characters
The game's greatest strengths: the world, the story, the choicesAs is commonly known by now, the Polish developer CD Project Red started working on The Witcher – actually their first game – out of love for the books, novels and stories by the Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski
 Sapkowksi is the author of The Witcher-universe: a collection of books and stories about a fictional, fantasy-world with a profound background and a history all of its own
 Sapkowski has often been called "The Polish Tolkien", and while that might be too big a compliment, I often felt like I was part of a world that could hold its own against Tolkiens incredible rich universe
 And I suppose that explains why I felt so connected to the game and so deeply involved: the world of The Witcher did already exist before the game, and is completely coherent and believable by itself
It is one thing to have an interesting world to build a game in, it's another to write and develop a story within this world that works well for a role-playing game
 The story of The Witcher however succeeds brilliantly in keeping the player's interest
 It is ambitious, full of twists and unexpected turns, but it stays believable right up to the end
 The different characters, both Geralt and his main protagonists, are complex and multi-layered: hardly anyone in this world is just "good" or "evil": most of the time, its a mix of both, often with one or several other characteristics
added
 The game does a fantastic job in introducing the player (Geralt) to this world, using an old trick: after having lost his memory, Geralt has to rediscover not only the places, the stories and the people, but he has to rediscover himself: he has to give himself a place in the dark, conflict-ridden world he lives in
The main way to do this, is by making choices: the game's strongest point by far is the feeling you get that the decisions you make actually matter, and do influence the flow and even the outcome of the story
 This is especially impressive since almost every choice, from minor to very important, is difficult and hardly clear-cut
 The games offers tons of dialogues, more than 5000 lines of text to be read and/or said, but very seldom did I feel like doing the "good thing"
 In most cases, the situation was so dire or the possible answers so gruff, that I had a hard job to make decisions that felt "right" at all
 It was more like "trying to do my best, and hoping for the best", since often decisions or roads taken early in the game, proved to have unexpected consequences (much) later on
 The way in which this game manages to make me think about good and evil, about morality and consequences, is utterly and completely brilliant
The game's problem: it tries too hard to be the best rpg in the worldFrom whatever angle you look at it, it is obvious that The Witcher is a very, very ambitious game
 The developers made no secret of it that, even back in 2007 when they were almost unknown, they wanted to make "the best rpg ever"
 Ambition definitely is a good thing for any developer, it can also be a trap
 While CD Project Red succeeded brilliantly with everything story- and character-related, they paid dearly in some other departments
 The actual gameplay, the movement and combat, form the game's biggest downfalls
 As a matter of fact, lots of people have tried the game, only to leave it after running into frustration with the combat system
 Combat is an exercise in rythmical feeling: by clicking at the right moment, Geralt can chain attacks together so that they become much stronger
 Fast clicking is of no use whatsoever, as is blocking or parrying since the game takes care of that
Moreover, Geralt has two different swords (steel for humans and animals, silver for monsters) and three differend combat styles (strong, fast and group style) at his disposal, so choosing the right weapon and the right sword for any fight is an important issue
 Combat is much more tactical than in most rpg's, and since dozens of alchemical potions, lots of special coatings for either of your swords, six magical signs and even some bombs are thrown into the equation as well, it is very easy to get overwhelmed by this avalanche of ideas
 Still, when one is prepared to play the game slow, with lots of attention to the myriad of entries in the journal (on quests, people, monsters, alchemical ingredients, recipes or locations), the sense of fulfillment can be enormous
 This is most of all true of the alchemy, which is a very important part of the game
 It takes a time to get the hang of it, when once mastered, it proves very rewarding
Final thoughtsPlaying and mastering The Witcher felt like climbing a mountain: it takes time, patience and commitment, even preparation, but once everything gets going, the long way to the summit becomes a joy by itself
 In the case of the first game in the series, the mountain definitely is not Mount Everest nor even Mont Blanc, and the path is littered with dangerous spots and possible downfalls, but the scenery is gorgeous nonetheless, and the journey towards the summit proved one I won't ever forget
Gameplay: 25/30 (provided one takes the time to master the combat system)Graphics: 16/20 (the game looks brilliant for its age)Sound: 8/10 (the music is fantastic, the voice-acting is not)Technical stability: 9/10 (I got no crashes whatsoever with this final edition)Steam integration: 7/10 (like any older game, it comes without cards or achievements)Game for the money: 9/10 (it's a very long game, but it's not an open-world sandbox)Personal appreciation: 10/10Overall Score: 84/100

The Witcher is an action role playing hack and slash game developed by CD Projeckt RED and published by Atari – being released on PC in late 2007
 This is the first game in the Witcher Series
 The gameplay in Witcher a split between focusing on the hack and slash, and the other on the heavy dialogue scenes
 The game can be played in one of three camera angles, there are two top down angels, and one over the shoulder view – I mainly used the third person view as it suited the gameplay more than the others
Combat in this game is something that sometimes receives criticism but I found it to be a nice change from the regular combat you see in RPGs – you have three different styles of attack, a quick, heavy and group attack – each of these attacks have three stages of attack and you have to click at the right time in order to continue your combo of attack
 This does feel a little like a QTE, but for me it is disguised well enough that you don’t really notice it
 The Witcher also comes equipped with two different main weapons – one sword which deals more damage to monsters, but is less effective against humans, and another weapon which is the opposite
 Another major portion of the gameplay is based on alchemy, you will be spending a lot time collecting herbs in order to make an assortment of potions in order to help you progress
This is one of the first games I have played that your actions really do have a massive impact on how the story flows and concludes
 A lot of the dialogue options when conversing with other characters will also affect the story and how that character in particular interacts with the player
This game is eight years old now, so you would expect the graphics to be a little on the dated side, however when wracking the resolution up to 4k, the game still has a current gen look to it; whilst some of the textures may be on the lower quality scale still, the open worldness of the game means that you can’t really expect mind blowing graphics at the time of its development
The game also has some very nice looking special effects, such as water effects
 On release of Witcher, the game’s voice acting was supposedly one of the worst that has been seen, however the Enhanced Edition of the game, which everyone got who purchased the original version, greatly improves the voice acting to acceptable levels – whilst it is still not the best by today’s standards, every single character in the game is catered for and has a voice to be heard
The game has a couple of sound tracks that are really iconic too, and the sound effects are all really on par
 Witcher’s plot is one of my all-time favourites – it is very rare that a game is able to completely suck me into the story right from the word go
 The game is split in to various chapters, which allows the game to create sub plots whilst also progressing the overall main story line at an acceptable pace
 A lot of the quests in Witcher will bear no importance to the main story, and often are there to add an extra layer of depth to the world in which you are in
 The immersion levels are sky high in this game as you will find yourself caring greatly for the characters
This game comes with three levels of difficulties; Easy, Medium and Hard
 I was playing on medium on my run through the game and was still challenged to the point where I had to replay a few parts due to death
 Hard mode is seriously for the hard-core RPGers out there; you will need to take full advantage of the alchemy system in the game as most of the more advanced fights will 100% require the use of multiple potions
 Your average Joe gamer will get a great amount of enjoyment and challenge from the medium settings though
 Witcher is one of the longest games I have played
 Having just finished the whole game with the majority of side quests, and exploring done, it has taken me eighty hours to complete
 Although the replay ability in Witcher is quite high given you can change the middle part of the game and outcome quite heavily depending on how you act and play; you would seriously have to be a huge fan to want to be putting eighty hours into another play through
 I am very happy with the longevity of the game; you cannot complain about a game this good having a huge amount of content available
 Technically, the game is sound
 I didn’t have any problems running the game at higher resolutions, with a fairly nice selection of graphic options available to optimize your game for your computer
The game needs to be played with a keyboard and mouse though – there are mods which you can install for controllers but the gameplay really needs a mouse to be completely effective
 In conclusion, The Witcher Enhanced Edition is easily one of the best games to ever been made and every RPG fan needs to experience it
 The low regular price of £6, 99 makes this game an absolute must buy
 It has been known to go as low as £1, 39…which you would have to be brain dead to not pick it up for that price
 Eighty hours of stellar gameplay and amazing story line, makes The Witcher one of my top 5 games of all time

The Witcher manages to be one of the best RPGs that I have played in spite of many little flaws
 There are times the game will frustrate you in minor ways, and yet the game deserves the cult classic status it enjoys
 The story is dark and engaging,
the world is deep and lore filled, and the moral ambiguity will have you racked with doubt about the choices you have made
 But make no mistake, you will make choices in this game, and you will have to bear the responsibility those choices bring
If you dont mind working through a clumsy interface, and like a game that makes you work for it: The Witcher: Enhanced Directors Cut may be the game for you

At first I was put off by the clunkiness of the controls and the rather lacking graphics
 But as I played on, it turned out to be a pretty darn good game, if a bit aged
 I kinda wish I had played it back in the day

Do yourself a favor and play The Witcher if you love games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age
Posted: 25 November, 2013
If you're reading this review, you probably want to know if this game is worth the money, and time
 Assuming you're into rpg's (otherwise i don't see any reason you're here), and want to get your mind blown away, then this game is for you
 I can't possibly describe how fantastic Witcher 2 is
 While the "general" story might not be something outstanding, the way you progress through it, the way you interact with people completely engulfs you into the experience, and you won't even realize when it's already 5 am, and you've been playing for 12 hours at least
 This is partly because of the side missions
 Unlike other rpg's where they are mediocre at best, and mainly consist of something like "Get to point B, Talk to someone, Return, 
, PROFIT", side missions in Witcher 2 are self contained stories, some of them being more enjoyable than the main game itself
 And of course if you don't want to do them for whatever reason, you'll miss A LOT
 Another thing at which Witcher 2 excels is the combat
 While at low difficulty you should be able to complete the game by "pressing X to win", other difficulty settings require knowledge, thinking, and tactical aproach
 You'll have to create mixtures, craft weapons and armor, find or buy herbs and recipes, just in order to be able to survive
 While this might be confusing, and hard, trust me that it's not
 It's understandable, it's logical, and requires just a little bit of initial effort
 At this point you're probably thinking "Yeah, cool, i'll go buy it", and you won't be wrong in any way
 BUT, be advised that while this is a great looking game, it isn't particulary well optimised,
and you may find yourself struggling even at minimum settings if your PC isn't powerful enough
So what is my score for the game
 Definitely 10/10
 I really do think it's such a good game
Posted: 26 January, 2014
At first I was a bit hesitant to play this game because I don't typically like fantasy RPG themed games
I do like games that have deep and mature narratives
I also like games with complex combat mechanics
I heard that this game was very good at these things, so I decided to give it a try
The story is
very good
It is also very complex so it is important to pay attention to the dialog
Player choices definitely have an impact on the game world and many choices are morally ambiguous which tie-in well to the mature theme of the story
What impressed me the most was how much impact player choice dynamically altered the game world and the direction of the story
The game has 8 different endings based on the player's decisions
This is also the only game that I have ever played that completely alters the main quest line depending on these choices
This means that you will not see every main story quest, characters and locations unless you play the game through multiple times
Many games that change the world based on choices usually do so using trickery that gives you the "illusion" of choice
The developers of this game actually took the time to create all of the extra story content instead of using tricks and this gives the Witcher 2 a ton of replayability
The combat system in this game is also very deep and challenging
You will carry a steel sword to take care of humanoid opponents and you will carry a silver sword to deal with monsters
Knowing when to switch is important to dealing proper damage to your target
Combat also requires proper preparation so the player will need to know how and when to use magical signs, place traps, drink potions, oil swords and use bombs and other Witcher tricks to get the job done
Simply wading into the combat only slashing away with a sword will often times get you killed
Combat can take some time to get used to and is definitely a refreshing departure from simply auto targeting and mashing a single button
Visuals are very impressive and it is very apparent that the developers took a lot of time in creating the environments for the game
Music is outstanding and the score sets the tone appropriately
One of the few downsides that I can think of is the disparity of the difficulty levels
Normal difficulty can be daunting with the complex combat mechanics and is a bit harder than the normal difficulty level of similar games
Easy is a nod to RPG beginners, but is so easy that you can ignore most of the combat mechanics and simply survive every encounter by using only the swords
The only other downside that I had with the game was related to map design
I found navigation on some of the maps to be overly complicated and I spent a lot of time simply wandering about trying to find a way to get to certain points on the map
Other than these two small quibbles I found the game design to be very solid and entertaining
Lots of content in this game
My playthrough took about 40 hours doing most of the side activities, and I mostly took my time without rushing things
Additional playthroughs would be required to see the other 7 endings and to play the other story paths leading up to those endings
You can easily get hundreds of hours out of this game if you wanted to explore all of these options so lots of replay value as I mentioned earlier
I highly recommend this game
I understand that the Witcher 3 is supposed to expand to a much more open world environment and have even more non-linear story options
After playing Witcher 2 I am looking forward to playing the upcoming sequel when it comes out

 A very well Polished game
heh, get it
 this game is Polish
 no one

Warning before buying this game TOO MUCH PLOT
Do you like games with main stories with perfect, detailed, explanation
Do you wanna rush main quests like maniac, to learn what's next
Do you like multiple characters in main quest with their own stories and desires
Do you wanna know who's behind everything
Do you like to get the ability of choosing your character's fate
Are you a hardcore gamer
 (Play this on the Insane Difficulty)Do you have bad pc
Then this game is for you
It's really unmissable when on sale it only costs 3$
Posted: 26 November, 2013
First off, know that The Witcher 2 is not a game that will hold your hand
 If you're thinking about purchasing this, know that to get the most out of this game you need to be prepared to fully immerse yourself in the experience and pay attention to what is going on
 This a game which deals with many adult themes such as politics, racism and sex to deliver a mature and complex game supported by rich lore and stunning visuals
 The writing and storytelling is exceptional throughout and the moral ambiguity and choices are second to none
 The gameplay, in particular the combat, is an acquired taste but offers a refreshing level of depth and potential for improvisation when compared to games in a similar genre
 Sound design and voice acting is also of high quality, with the environments coming to life through impressive visual and audio support and characters each sporting distinct personalities and prejudices
It is also worth mentioning that if you have played the first Witcher game, your choices and gear will be reflected via an imported save in The Witcher 2, however the choices have limited effect and it is not necessary to play the first game to enjoy the second (however you will be at a slight disadvantage in some situations)
In my honest opinion the experience as a whole is unparalleled, and The Witcher 2 is easily the most enjoyable and immersive RPG I have played in recent memory
 I would also advise reading the books by Andrezej Sapkowski as these offer an interesting insight into the protagonist's past
 But back to the game, overall I would highly recommend The Witcher 2 to anyone with at least a passing interest in the RPG genre, it is the definition of a complete gaming package with spectacular production values and a lasting impression

Originally released in 2011, The Witcher 2 flew under the radar for a lot of people and was overshadowed by the ever-popular Skyrim
 While not as well known, The Witcher 2 offers a much stronger narrative along with solid gameplay, beautiful graphics, and varied areas
You once again play as the Witcher; Geralt, who finds himself protecting King Foltest of Temaria after an assassination attempt
 Ultimately, the second attempt succeeds and Geralt is framed for the murder
 After escaping from a Temarian dungeon, Geralt decides to track down the real kingslayer in order to clear his name while trying to piece together his fragmented memory
The game is separated into three chapters each with their own main area along with a handful of side-quests
 These areas are structured and paced well, allowing room for exploration without straying too far from the main storyline
 The decisions you make along the way directly influence the narrative and can have a dramatic effect on the rest of the game
 For example; decisions made in the first chapter can completely change the second, allowing plenty of room for re-playability
 The game also features multiple endings, which vary based on your choices
The choices are morally ambiguous; there is no clear right or wrong answer in most cases
 It’s more about choosing a side and watching the events unfold
 While the first Witcher game focused more on slaying monsters, Geralt is trapped in the middle of political turmoil in this installment
 These elements of the story add an additional level of complexity and immersion as the game feels almost similar to a season of Game of Thrones
 Playing the first game is by no means necessary to enjoying The Witcher 2 as it provides plenty of backstory as well as a solid and cohesive narrative
The combat is solid as the game will have you balance between swordplay, magic, as well as parrying and dodging
 The use of traps can also add an additional level of strategy and planning to most encounters
 There is also the inclusion of alchemy, allowing Geralt to drink various potions each with different passive bonuses as well as negative side effects
 The potions are generally used on a trial and error basis though, since Geralt isn’t able to use them during combat
 The game does provide a reasonable challenge, especially on the harder difficulties, which is refreshing compared to a lot of other titles released these days
Orens, the main currency in the game is rather scarce, placing a large emphasis on crafting
 The crafting system is solid and will have you hoarding as many resources as possible in order to create various armor, traps, weapons, and upgrades
CD Projekt Red is a company that really loves their fans
 While other developers release paid DLC, CDPR released an Enhanced Edition at no additional cost which added multiple cut-scenes, quests, and additional polish
 The soundtrack is fantastic, as it really adds an epic feel to the game
 The voice acting for the main characters is top-notch while some of the acting for the additional characters is re-used but that is to be expected considering the overall length of the game
The graphics are absolutely stunning, as the environments are extremely detailed and varied
 The character models and armor look great, although the facial animations can be a bit stiff and lifeless at times
 You really have to look hard for low-res textures as even the smallest objects are carefully rendered
Overall, The Witcher 2 is a game that should be played by anyone that is a fan of the genre
 It features benchmark graphics, a top-shelf narrative, and offers plenty of content along with elements of re-playability
For a much more detailed and thorough review, here’s a video I edited together for my friend Trent:http://www

For too long I ignored The Witcher 2 in my Steam Library
 I heard that the game was great
 Tried playing it twice, gave up at the very beginning of the first chapter
 That was a huge mistake
The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt trailers were all amazing, and oh boy, the Hype Train was going offtrack
 But how the hell was I supposed to play TW3 without even playing TW2
I've played the first one, liked it a lot, even though the game had some strange gameplay techniques
So there I was again, Flotsam
 The very beginning of the game
 Would I give up this time again
 No
I needed to play TW2, to see if I would like it, and only then I would Pre-Order TW3
Played it
 Played more
 The story just got better
 The gameplay is amazing

I usually
don't write reviews, this might be the first one I do on Steam
 What makes be "break the silence" is the pleasant and extraordinary surprise I had playing the game
I never heard of it until a couple of days ago(two days before release), I wasn't hyped and never heard about the company before
 So imagine my surprise when I started playing the game:Fully random world each time you play, no handmade scenarios, no premade campaign
 Sound scary no
 On the contrary, they manage to pull it off
 Each world is beautifully generated, no odd stating points or placement of terrain etc
 Each game you play is unique
New lore: It's Slavic (or so they say) folklore
 Is that enough to differentiate
the game lore from the generic fantasy
games out there
 Yes it is
 Just enough to keep you interested and too much that you have no idea what those creatures are and you have to either take notes or take random action against them
No legion of units to manage, each unit is one piece, it has more skills and abilities that any RPG I've played and when they die, it's forever and you really feel it
 Not just because you cared for them but because it brutally handicaps you
 You can't recruit units when you want to
 If you're not careful and build enough of the right buildings you don't even have enough units to survive(gather resources and defend)
All that micromanagement of units and building might sound scary but you only get one settlement in the game
 That's right, you won't have a ton of cities, legions of units
 No sir, one is all you get
The world (planet) is trying to kill you
 Only once have I experienced this feeling and that was
while playing Alpha Centauri (SMAC)
A multitude of ways to defeat your enemies (aside from fighting)
A unique card based combat system that is actually fun to play
Hundreds and events and quests that remind me of King of the Dragon Pass
All that originality for 15-20 euro
 And coming from a small indies studio
 My hat off to the devs
 And a recommendation to anyone reading this to try the game
 It's more than worth the price and time to learn the game (about one hour for me)
 
Posted: 2 October, 2015
TL;DR: Great game + great devs + great originality = great purchase
 This is one of the games i dare recommend to people without attaching a caveat lector
Three hundred seventy-three
 That is, at the time of writing this review, the amount of games in my steam library
 Yet despite having a fair amount of games to compare Thea too i just cannot find any combination of games that would adequate serve as a comparison
 Thea manages to blend several game genres surprisingly well - you will see elements of the survival genre mixed with RPG, civilization (city-building) and roguelike-lite genre while playing the game
 It also has a set of game systems that i do not recognize as being borrowed from other games in those genres
 Thus, If you are looking for a refreshingly original title instead of the so-manieth title that is essentially a clone of another game you played before i can strongly recommend Thea
Intro - What is the game about
The premise of the game is that you are a god in a post-apocalyptic world, who managed to survive with a handful of followers
 Your villagers have set up a new village and now it is up to you to make that village thrive and to uncover what happened to the world
 Initially you will be focused on exploring the world around you by sending out expedition parties that map the world, find old ruins that can be looted for materials and fend of enemies that threaten your town
 Meanwhile random events and an overarching main quest focusing on the fate of the world will keep you busy
 If you wish to do so you are free to simply ignore the games main quest and focus on your village instead if that is your preference
 One thing of note is that the game is centered around this single village
 You cannot build new villages or expand as you would in civilization-type games
 Neither will you be be fielding gigantic armies to take over the world - you will instead start the game with about ten villagers in your town and thats all you have
 Villagers are not a particularly renewable commodity either; They can and will die if you end up having bad luck or play poorly
 Every lost villager actually hurts and this is not just due to them being a somewhat hard to replace resource
 Each and every single one of your villagers has his own set of equipment, a class and a set of skills
 You will know that the villager you lost was responsible for crafting half of the armors your other villagers use
 You will know that the warrior that died had been around since the start of the game, slowly upgrading his stick sword to a full suit of armor and decent weaponry only to fall to a horde of skeletons
 You will know all of them, and you will not want to lose any of them
Combat, Crafting and QuestsA point of interest is the games combat system, which is unlike any i played in this type of game
 Combat and some of the other games activities resolve around a card game system that determines the outcome of each event
 In this card system each of your villagers is represented by a card that contains their stats, skills and abilities in combat
 Each turn you and your opponent play cards until all villagers and opponents are on the table, after which the actual resolution of the fight or challenge will take place
 The rules of the card system are somewhat hard to describe in a review but in practice they works rather well, creating a system that is easy to learn but hard to master
 There is plenty of tactical variety to the card system that allows you to develop optimal tactics and gear for your villagers, without taking overly long
 An entire fight takes 1-3 minutes at most from start to finish
Also worth mentioning is the crafting system
 The game map around the village is procedurally generated and randomly seeded with resources that can be harvested
 Since you only have a single village retrieving these resources requires the formation of expedition parties that go and get them for you (Always a risk, since there are plenty of dangers on the world map)
 Each resource has its own quality and advantages that tie into the crafting system
 For example: A recipe may have the base requirement for "Wood" and "Metal" to be added
 If you add regular wood the result will be average, but if you add dark wood the crafted weapon will be stronger and have poison damage
 The same applies for metal so you can mix and match the stats you want
 Factor into this that each weapon type functions differently in the combat card game and you will end up with a resource gathering system that actually matters quite a bit
I cannot write in great detail about quests since the survival gameplay keeps distracting me time and again
 So far i know that the game features both a a (long) storyline quest and random event quests
 The former of these is the overarching story of the game while the latter happen at random
 Each random event quest i encountered so far provides the player with a situation they must react to
 If you see see slave hunter what would you do
 Try and convince them to hand one over to you
 Try and set up an ambush
 Or just charge in yelling
 Or perhaps
 you just want to ignore the situation and walk away
 So far i haven't encountered the same random event quest twice after about 20 hours of gametime though random quests are somewhat rare
 Even so i am bound to believe the developers claim that the game contains 130k words of quests text - more than the average novel
 ConclusionNormally i like to end a review with a list of the games good and bad points but in this case i simply cannot - for the sheer reason i cannot really find any problem severe enough to warrant a specific mention
 Yes, the game is early access and has a few bugs but they are being fixed exceptionally fast once reported
 The developers themselves are highly active on the forum and listen and respond to criticism and suggestions which is always a plus - i think we all met companies on steam who prefer the reviled "Lock, ban and delete" approach when dealing with those matters
 Usually i don't like writing reviews that only seems to sing praise without adding a critical note since a good review balances the positive and the negative aspects of a game
 In this case I will be making the proverbial exception to the rule since complaining for the sake of complaining makes even less sense
 If you actually managed to reach this line by reading this entire wall of text stop wasting time and buy the game
 I am nigh certain you won't regret it - though you might end up regretting a lost night of sleep or two afterwards

TL;DR Uniquely surprising 4X-RPG hybrid
 A truly underrated gem that deserves to be played at least once
Thea: The Awakening is a genre-blending strategic game where you, the player, are a God
 But not any kind of God: you're among the few survivors of your consumed, dying world, in a quest to ensure the survival of your people and your own
Your worshippers, from artisans to gatherers to warriors, are organized and together have managed to build a thorp, from where you will lead them across the land, deciding what to harvest, what to hunt, where to explore, and ultimately how to stop (or maybe even help) the cataclysmic forces that are destroying your world
 There are other dangers here as well, like local bands and cities of goblins, lairs choke-full with man-eating spiders, treant-like demons of old and
other fantastic creatures that hide in the shadows and haunt the long, cold nights of your people
Mechanically, the game is pretty close to other 4X games like Endless Legend or Age of Empires
 However, the differences are welcome additions to a rather static genre, and standing among them is the simple-yet-deep mechanics of the combat/challenges you will face in T:tA, where a card positioning mini-game determines if your people will live or die
Sadly, the game is not flawless, but whereas other games' mistakes come from its very design, here the formula keeps going on and instead it's the interface the one letting you down in your divine journeys
 Fortunately, those are minor mistakes, easily ignored for a game that is definitely a must-buy to any strategy fans, and an outstanding addition to any game library worth its salt
Get it before its sequel goes live, for bragging rights at the very least

I had a rather unique experience with Thea tha I thought I would share
Purchased this game a few months back and played for 4 hours
 Thought it
was neat, but I grew attached to the few people you start with and after they died a few times/i lost a few times it got put on the side for other games
I got bored 4-5 months later and decided to give it another shot, and maaaaan did I not realize what i'd been missing out on
Once you realize the vast amount of choices and just how much each action you take affects them it opened up a whole new world for me
You start with a few people in a dark unforgiving land
 You manage them, collect resources, research, craft like crrazy, build and equip and try to survive
You will lose people, this land loves to make you lose people
 Whether it be giants who step on you, goblins you couldn't talk down, hags, bandits
they will die
 If you can get past that and play as your village and understand you history will be dark at points it becomes an incredible, amazing story of survival
I had one group that suffered disaster after disaster (incredible difficulty modification allows for a truly realistic game), but they found a source of elven wood nearby
 We slowly built our elven village, but really wanted the mythril that wasn't too far so we could make better equipment
 Expedition after expedition failed and we were down to just a few people left, not even enough to safely try again, but elves kept seeing this elven city and appreciating it so much they would join me
 In one last brave attempt to get the mythril, the last of the humans perished and I realized I had only elves left
 They're a magical race with a high social ability, so my new expeditions of elves were able to banish undead/spirits and talk their way out of danger most times
 Having this kind of story, while having to break out the pen & paper to manage how to craft their equipment, and a dangerous unforgiving world
holding the materials i need for said equipment
 o man, do yourself a favour
 Buy this game and give it time to unveil it's magic,Update - Free DLC (New content plus cooperative--no small task), and quick fixes to outstanding issues
 These developers are on point
Posted: 3 December, 2015
The more I play this amazing game, the more opens up
 It is a 4X fantasy world with card battles, and village management
 The lore of this game just amazes me, the more you play the more stories become open to you with important choices to make
 You gather, craft, upgrade, explore, quest, fight, and alot more
 For the price of this game there is so much here, it is very well done
Posted: 23 November, 2015
King of Dragon Pass meets Dwarf Fortress meets Don't Starve meets Civilization IV
With a deck of cards
The art caught my eye for this game, but the reviews were largely positive and I gave it a shot
 I'm extremely glad I did
The gameplay is extremely fun
 Managing both your village and expeditions is a lot of fun and the landscape remains hostile and varied enough to keep you interested
 In fact, there never comes a point where you feel "safe" when you step outside your village walls
 There's always something worse coming out of the distant mists
The crafting system is much deeper than it looks on the surface
 Materials gathered from your expeditions are used to create items such as armor, tools, weapons, or structures and the quality of said materials reflects in the items
 The crafting reminds me slightly of Star Wars Galaxies played at a strategic level 
 find the best resource, send a team out to extract it, then come back to your base to build it
 Only instead of the view of a single individual, you manage the entire village
The storyline 
 I haven't finished it yet
 I'm intriqued by it, but it's not very invasive
 I find myself putting off going to investigate some distant point on the map that my deity wants me to look into just so I can go gather a little more wheat to make some bread (sorry, obscure deity)
The interface felt clunky at first but a lot of my problems with it were due to poor documentation
 Once I found the appropriate hotkeys things moved along a lot better
 The graphics on any setting look great
The card game that is used for combat is tough to figure out
 At first I just auto-resolved all the battles to avoid it
 Then later I found that I was getting into the card game in order to play extremely difficult battles
 I don't know that I do better than the computer, but at least I know what went wrong
There's some warts in the game still
 I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs but there's some text errors
 There's also some balance issues in that one thing you do will seem vastly overpowered compared to every alternative (goblins, I'm looking at you)
I'm giving this a hearty recommend
 Deep strategy players will feel like they missed out without this one in their library
 I'm also intriqued by what a small, independent team did
 This game grabs me as much as Civilization ever did, and I thought I'd become completely jaded by those sort of hex map genres
 A lot of flops trying to recapture Master of Magic and Civilization burned me out
 And then along comes a tiny, obscure studio who knocks it out of the park without making any of those outrageous claims or trying to follow tired old formulas
 AND they're still working on it
 Another sign that the big studios may be on their way out and we're entering into an exciting new era
It's like a craft ale produced by a really good microbrewery by experts who really like craft ale

About time I wrote a review for Thea
 I have played the game for 900 hours now and I still don't see myself getting bored with it anytime soon
 More on the replayability later but first a quick overview
Thea: The Awakening is a turn-based survival strategy game on a procedurally generated hexagonal world
 It plays a lot like the early exploration phase in Civilization
 The main difference is that the game is about survival instead of expansion
 You won't build an empire with a large army, instead you have to defend your only village from evergrowing threats while also finding the time to go out and gather materials and do quests so you can become stronger
 If you don't keep up with the enemies in terms of power they will overwhelm you but don't worry, there are many difficulty modifications
 You can play on 50% (very easy), 350% (very hard), and anything in between
 The game has a lot of RPG elements, an excellent crafting system, and a card game to resolve various types of conflicts
 The game combines regular fantasy creatures such as orcs and elves with slavic mythology
 If you don't know anything about that you'll meet a lot of new creatures here such as Stryga's and Baba Yaga's
I would say easy to learn, hard to master applies to this game
 It has a short tutorial that explains all the mechanics very well, and for me the game was much easier to learn than most 4xs
 But figuring out the best way to deal with all the situations you get into takes much longer
 The devs have really listened to the community and as a result the game is very balanced now, so there aren't a lot of wrong decisions you can make
 There are many different strategies that can lead to victory and you often have to improvise and use a plan that works in your current situation, every game is completely different and you can't just do the same thing every time
There is so much replayability and variety in this game
 The world is randomly generated and so are all characters, your own as well as the enemies
 Sometimes you'll have great materials near your village and sometimes your village spawns in the middle of a snowfield and you'll have difficulty moving around
 Because of this the game will continue to be challenging and even if you have beaten it on max difficulty you may still lose the next game
 Just starting a new game and seeing what your characters are like, what items you start with and what the world looks like is already a lot of fun
Apart from that there are more reasons why the game has such great replay value
 There are many different kind of characters you can get
 You can attract orcs, dwarves, and other creatures depending on what materials you use for your buildings
 You can also get new characters in random events
 There are hundreds of random events that can occur and if that's not enough for you you can always download the ones made by the community, or create your own
 Believe it or not, despite my 900 hours of playtime there are still several creatures that I've never had in my party and several random events that have never happened to me
The story is alright and it is written in a rather unique way with a lot of humour
 The random events can also lead to very interesting situations
 There are multiple endings depending on the decisions you make and you usually have several options to resolve conflicts
 Maybe your party isn't very strong but has great social skills so you can use diplomacy instead of weapons
 Or maybe you have a stealthy party and can sneak away from the bad situations
 As I said before, no two games are the same and you'll often have to look at your party and see what strategy works best in the situation you're in
About the card game, your characters basically turn into cards during conflicts and you have to use them to destroy the enemy cards
 Their stats and abilities depend on the stats of the character as well as the type of challenge
 The mechanics of every challenge are the same but they all use different stats
 It can be a little confusing a first but you can auto resolve if you don't want to do a battle
 However this can be risky and can lead to unneccesary deaths so it is recommended to learn the game eventually
 Personally I did not like it at first but after playing it for a while it became a lot more enjoyable
 I still auto resolve the very easy battles since they can be done without risks
Now about the crafting system, there are a lot of materials in the world that you can find either by gathering them from the ground, beating monsters, or from random events
 When you do these things you get research points which you can use to learn how to craft/build new things or find and gather new materials
 The items and buildings you make will have different stats depending on what materials you use for them, there is a lot of variety between the items and you won't be able to make the same things every time, instead you have to work with whatever you happen to find
One thing people don't like about the game is the micro management
 You have to make every character gather or craft and although you can make them continue indefinitely, you still have to give them new tasks often, for example if you run out of materials or if you want to craft something else
 Note that this only takes a lot of time when all your characters are in the village
 Most of the time you're out on expeditions so you won't have to deal with this
 But when you do have your entire party in the village it can get very tedious, especially in the late game when you have 20+ characters
Another thing I don't like about the lategame is that it's very hard to lose once you've stabilized
 The challenges will continue to be hard and you will still lose battles, but actual game over almost never happens when you reach the end game, because you'll continue to attract new characters to replace the dead ones
There are many other amazing things in the game that I haven't mentioned yet such as the card art and the music but you'll find out all about them when you play the game
Last but not least, I just have to say something about the devs
 They are a small team but they are honestly the best company I've ever seen
 They have listened to the feedback and implemented many suggestions, and it has really paid off and made the game so much better
 They are very quick to respond despite being such a small team
 It has happened to me more than once that I reported a bug or made a suggestion, went to sleep, and woke up the next day to that bug already fixed or the suggestion already implemented
 And it's not just me, I know many others who had similar experiences
 Aside from that they made all their DLCs free and only gave us ways to donate when their customers were practically begging for them
I don't expect anyone to do this but I would actually recommend to wait until the winter sale is over so you can buy it for the full price
 When I bought the game almost a year ago I had just missed the steam sale and in hindsight I'm very glad I paid the full price for it, the game is worth far more than that

Bought on a whim, installed and hit play
 8 hours later I reluctantly saved and quit
 I'm impressed
 'Thea' is flipping all my switches
 Plenty of meaty strategy and management to be had here, set in a world that is well written, interesting and actually feels alive
 The RPG and rogue inspired elements are just gravy
 Can't wait to dig in for more
 Definitely the biggest surprise game of 2015 for me

Early Access Review
I'm writing this at 5:50am because I stayed up that late playing
My wife will come kill me soon, I'm sure
This game is brilliant
The 4X portion of the game would be serviceable on its own, with interesting gathering/crafting mechanics for feeding your populace and equipping your fighters
The writing does an excellent job of giving you an otherworldly feel; it makes me want to read the mythology its based on
The combat card game is amazing
I'd play the card game even without the 4X game
The mechanics involved in that one I think would be deep enough to support even a living/expandable card game implementation
The fact that it's tied to a whole plethora of hero stats for 6-7 different types of challenges (social, physical, combat, tactics, hex, etc
) that all play out in "combat" is what really makes the game shine
The connection between your units leveling and equipment, the writing and events that get you wrapped up in various sorts of contests, and this "combat" system that provides the test of skill for resolving all of the conflicts is why the sum of the two decent games (the 4X game and the card game) becomes something amazing
The designers behind this are geniuses
I'm so impressed with this that I already want to buy their next game

As an author primarily of dark fantasy allegory, myth, and bleak science-fiction, Thea: The Awakening speaks to my soul
As a woman, it's nice to see some grave lady deities represented - Mokosh being my favorite
Whoever did the art for this game deserves special recognition
 So much about this takes me back to my childhood, poring over old books and fantasy accessories for CRPGs and the old artwork in the Diablo booklets
It has that classic, gritty 90's American pop-art style that will always be a part of my mental landscape
As a game it functions well
I'm a strategy addict, and a survival-game addict, so putting these two together ALONG WITH gorgeous art and serious mythological chops
I couldn't be happier
Well, I could
There are issues
- Tedious micromanagement
I'm not a huge fan
Some quality of life improvements would be great, chiefly, the ability to hit a single button when creating a new expedition and automatically supply it with, say, twenty or thirty days of a variety of food and fuel
As it stands, this is the single most tedious thing in the game, having to manually drag every single item and manually enter in the numbers
I'm old
It hurts my poor hand after a while, and interrupts the flow of the game
- Weird card game combat
Am I the only one who just clicks auto-resolve every time
Like, EVERY time
Even if I liked the card game (I don't really care for it) it doesn't add much to the experience, in my opinion
This isn't Age of Wonders 3, we don't have the budget for a serious hex field and some turn-based combat, I get that
It just feels like a waste of time
But since it doesn't force itself on you, I suppose it's not a big deal
Those are my only two issues, really
Some people have complained about the 'writing' being bad because the person who wrote this game's events and designed the world clearly has some incredibly MINOR issues with English
I wouldn't even call them issues, it's more like reading an accent, which I enjoy, as it gets me looking at my native tongue in different ways
"weakened, lost, and scared" I would have used 'frightened' or 'afraid' but they chose 'scared
'
Somehow, I find that more compelling
It has a child-like quality to it
It conveys that sense of helplessness better
It is an excellent word choice, but I would have never done it
As a professional, let me tell you: this writing is exceptional
Some of the best writing I've ever seen was ESL
Why
Because of earnestness and enthusiasm, and storytelling
Atmosphere
See, the stray odd word usage actually spices up the world for me
This game has soul
It has so much obvious passion pushing behind every word and paragraph
This game loves itself and it loves its players
And with its sincere roots in myth, it can't go wrong
The orcs I especially like
They have this strange way of speaking with semi-modern slang
I heard one reviewer complain about that - I've looked
It's only the orcs who do that
Chalk it up to cultural differences
I found it charming, but, that's just my opinion
Buy this game, on sale or not
I have four friends on my list who want this game but haven't bought it yet
It's twenty dollars
It's worth thirty
Buy it

After playing The Stanley Parable for a while, Stanley decided that he enjoyed it so much that he had to write a review
 He would carefully deconstruct his experience and share his unique view and opinions in tremendous detail, until he finally summed it all up with a simple "Thumbs up" gesture
Proud of his critique, Stanley confidently clicked the "Post review" button and -

Roger Ebert once said that video games cannot be an art form, because they "by their nature require player choices, which is the opposite of the strategy of serious film and literature, which requires authorial control
"This game shows how video games can be an art form not despite of player choice, but BECAUSE of it
But I'm getting ahead of myself
The Stanly Parable is, at it's heart, a parody of Video Game (and general) narration tropes
 However the point the Stanley Parable tries to make is that narration, as done in most other linear mediums, can't (and furthermore SHOULDN'T) be handled the same way in video games, because the player controls the action and pacing (and sometimes the outcome) of the story in video games
 even in completely railroaded and highly linear First-Person Shooters you can still decide to just stand in a corner for 10 hours and not do anything, which would obviously break up the narrative flow of any story
The Stanley Parable instead delivers a reactive story, one that adapts to any and all choices the player makes
 You can decide to follow the narrator's instructions and get a totally boring and clichéd ending, or you can decide to stand in the broom closet for 15 minutes and look at a bucket
 Both are narrated
In Short if you are interested in a game that's NOT just a AAA linear movie-esque railroad, but want to see a game that perfect utilizes it'S medium, this game is for you

I want season 2 of Telltale's TFTB, TWAU, GoT, and Batman as much as everyone else but this is not the place to get pissy about that
If you enjoyed season 1 of Minecraft: Story Mode (like I did) then you already know what you're gonna get with this; a fun, lighthearted adventure with old as well as new cast and challenges
 Though there are some new interesting gameplay improvements (some slightly more in-depth building and combat) that fit the Telltale format nicely
Also: "Just because it appeals to children doesn't exclude me from enjoying it

TellTale have really done it now
 I'm really satisfied on how TellTale have done season two
 Season one was good, but I love how TellTale have actually taken their time to perfect this game
 Totally recommend this game if you haven't played the first season of Minecraft Story Mode
Posted: 28 August
UPDATE FOR EPISODE 3 RELEASE:Okay, yeah
 This is the first time I've encountered a choice in a Telltale game and had to sit there for a few minutes and really think about it
 The intensity just keeps ramping up here
 I really enjoy the writing in this season a lot more compared to the first
The first season was a good character building chapter to enjoy, but now that all the characters are fleshed out, they can be thrown around into all sorts of scenarios
 It's only getting better
 Love it
---Original review below---Only played the first two episodes so far and I'm thoroughly enjoying it
 Love the new combat system and the cinematic choice mechanics that have been added
 Crowd Play is also pretty fun
Only problems I can say is that I miss the original voice actor for Olivia, it's almost as if they didn't even try to get someone that sounded similar at all
 And the voice animations seems kinda janky at times
But back to the good stuff, the new characters are awesome and I have to say, the antagonist of this is the best one yet
 Really excited to ride this story out
 If you're a fan of the first one, be willing to accept a little change
Posted: 2 August
Great improvements on the first game with a slightly altered UI during selection, fighting requires more strategy now that you have limited stamina, and can roll and such
Overall an amazing sequel to the first, but the only con I find with this is the fact that it takes a while for episodes to release

I recommend Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two to anyone who enjoys serious fantasy stories that feature funny, memorable characters
Excuse me for having an opinion, but I really enjoyed Season Two so far
I realize there are many people who would rather play a different Season Two, but this is the sequel Telltale chose and it deserves proper criticism
I assume anyone interested in buying this game already knows what Season One was like, so I base my review on improvements upon the original game and how enjoyable I feel it is
TL;DR huge improvements
Improved visualsImproved audioImproved battle systemBetter balance between comedy and plotThe general quality of animations has been improved greatly, haven't noticed anything as stiff as Axel from Season 1
The camera work and scene transitions are better now, didn't notice any sound being cut off unless I hurried up the scene
Better voice actors have been hired for a few (main) characters
I don't know if choices make a big difference in future episodes, but there are definitely still alternate routes within the same episode
One thing I really liked in Season 1 was the addition of proper dynamic battle controls
 Unfortunately they were pretty basic and barely ever used
 They have been improved in Season 2 however:They are used more frequently
 You must predict what your opponent's next move is going to be and time your defense right
 Evade the attack by either backing away or dodging to the side, depending on what's required of you to do
 There's even a fun boss fight at the end of episode 1 where you need to get a bit creative
 I definitely want to see more of this
Another thing I appreciate is the balance between comedy and plot
 Season 1's emotional balance had some problems, Reuben's death being the most infamous example
 This changed in Season 2
While there are of course still hilarious scenes (like fighting your way through Stella's) and I love the humor, the mood can turn serious in a heart beat, and in a good way
 I'm talking about your relationship with Petra and Jack Morrison here
Jesse and their friends don't have petty arguments anymore, either
 If they do argue, it's either lighthearted or serious, but never annoying
Excuse me for having an opinion, but I really enjoyed Season Two so far
 I hope Telltale keeps up the quality in future episodes

This is a great second part to a Great game
 I am looking forward to the next episodes so see what happens to Jesse and his friends
 It is worth the $25
 It has a rich and interesting story
 I don't understand how someone could not like it

When I was younger, my gramdma came over to my house to hang out
 She was a "OG gamer grill", so we played a lot of the same games
 When ever Fable TLC came out she fell in love with it, so she made a pirated copy for my 12 yr old self
 I installed the game on my dinky little pc and started playing it immediately
Posted: 25 November, 2013
Fable TLC is an amazing game
 I remember playing it for the first time years ago and I still play it on occasion
 The gameplay is fun and basically everything about it is pretty awesome
 I guess it would have been better if they had added different difficulties, but it's still a great game regardless
This is my first review, so I apoligize if it's not too well written
 I strongly suggest trying out this game sometime
Posted: 26 November, 2013
The game that just keeps giving
 I played this game years after the original xbox release and having owned the pc version previously, and still enjoyed playing through this classic once again
 Build on a fantastic world that sucks you in from the moment you start the game up till the credits are rolling
 Very impressive
Posted: 25 July, 2013
Fable TLC was my first RPG as a kid, graphics actually dated pretty well today because of the cartoony style of graphics so it doesn't look that bad
 You have two options throughout the game to be the good or the bad guy depending on your decisions

Fable
 Yo
 The Lost Chapters
Alright where do I start
This game was my CHILDHOOD
I PULLED MY FIRST ALL NIGHTER BY MYSELF PLAYING FABLE THE LOST CHAPTERS ON THE ORIGINAL XBOX
 If that isn't love, then I really don't know what is
Let's get down to it
Pros:-Fun combat
 Sort of basic hack n' slash action rpg fare
 Now I love to be rewarded for me kills
 Typo was unintenional but I'll leave it there
So you got SWORDS, BOWS & ARROWS, AND CROSSBOWS, and MAGIC
 For each type of way you eradicate your enimies, you get experience for that category of killing
 So, if you bash a hobbe's brains out with a hammer, you'll get melee experience, then stick in between the eyes with an arrow, you'll get ranged experience, and then finish him off by burning him to a crisp with a fireball, you'll get magic experience
 And to put icing on the cake, whenever you finish off an enemie, or an innocent civillian, whatever, you'll get general experience
 HOW EXCITING
Melee combat comes down to left clicking, blocking, dodging, and doing cool overpowered attacks with the right click when your weapon lights up
 Ranged is holding down the left click to draw and charge your weapon then popping heads from afar
 Magic is self explanatory even more so than the other categories
 Do your thing, Harry
 You are the chosen one
-There are a lot of spells
 Lightning, teleporting, reviving the undead, being a jedi and unleashing the wrath of hell
-Obvious character evolution
 Not only do you feel your character getting stronger but you can also see it
 Upgrade your strength and become The Hulk
 Upgrade your skills and become Shaq, because you get tall when you kill enemies with a crossbow or scam someone out of their money, because hormones work like that
 Use magic and you'll turn into a super saiyan
 No lie
Another example of that character evolution would be your morality
 I think morality systems in video games are dope
 If you're nice, you'll get a pretty little halo will float above your head, butterflies will hoard you, and you'll grow angelicly
 If you're evil and kill your sister lol, you'll grow horns and people will cower in fear
-Chicken helmet
 'Nuff said
-Story's a little cliched, but only really the beginning
 You play some as some kid who's village gets burnt to the ground by bandits but a wizard saves and takes you to meet a short Hulk Hogan, who raises you to be a hero
 The story then turns out to be a lot bigger than story of just vengeance will the balance of Albion hanging in your hands
-The game doesn't take itself TOO seriously
 There are serious moments but the overall tone and atmosphere of most of the zones is all laid back and chill
-Soundtrack's pretty dope too
Cons:-The game's ugly
 "Oh, Levi, the game is ten years old," well, I DON'T CARE
 The game has not aged well
 It didn't look good ten years ago
 Deal with it
 Anniversary edition looks beautimous though
-Its pretty short
 I don't have an exact estimate of how quickly I got EVERYTHING DONE in the game, but I got all the sidequests done, max'd skills, fully geared, ect and started a second playthrough in less than 30 hours
-Your morality and story choices don't have a huge impact on the world
 Yes, there are consequences for killing an important character at some point in the story, but it all really boils down to that the life you took was expendable anyway and their death would've decided whether people would talk smack to you or applaud you
 Other than that though, the story is basically the same regardless of choices and the two endings are very slightly different
-The game is really linear, zones are small and there a little opprotunities to go off the beaten path
 However, if you can find a place to explore, you will most likely be rewarded
In a nutshell, the game has a good but cliche story, fun combat, and you can get experience by eating meat
 Buy it
 Or the Anniversary edition for Xbox 360

I was stuck in Havana, Cuba for 2 weeks
That city (and country) is a cesspool
I was starving, sick, tired, and angry
I was also cut off from electronic civilization
No email
No internet
No phones
No nothing
It so happened that I had this game installed on my laptop and was able to play it in offline mode
Accordingly, the hours I played this game were not clocked on my profile, but believe me
THIS GAME IS AMAZING
It is older, but it maintains it's classic status
For 2 weeks straight, the only pleasure I found in life was playing this game and roof drinking
Do yourself a favor and buy this game
Now

I took a side quest from a random guy at the age of 18 when my skin was tender and smooth as a baby's bottom
 I made him stand there and wait for me for 40 years before I actually did the quest
 When I returned to him, he was still exactly the same and I was looking like Gandalf The Grey
 10/10 Would take on more side quests

One of my old time favorites, one of the best RPG ever
This game is for you if you like:- ambience and game depth- philosophical discussions- weird characters- to use a sharp mindand you do not care that the graphics are not up to date (it's an enhanced edition, not a remake
)This game is NOT for you if you:- do not like to read long descriptions- you prefer quick action and fighting- do not have a morbid sense of humour
 your first companion is a floating skull
 you wake up in a mortuary
 again
 get it
Guys, thanks for this release

The best book I have ever played, and the best game I have ever read

Amazing story and gameplay
 As a child I loved this game for the character interaction and the imersive world of Planescape
 I spent many hours playing this game completing various quests to find out the meaning of the game, and the meaning of what they want you to know
 Torment was one of the greatest parts of my childhood and I will forever remember and imortilze it
Buy this game if you want to lose yourself in a wonderful world full of adventure
 I have always wondered why he was blue on the cover but grey in-game

Unlike Baldur's Gate and other Infinity Engine games - getting Planescape: Torment modded to perfection and running right on modern hardware was NOT FUN
Posted: 23 June
Originally released in 1999 by Interplay Entertainment and Black Isle Studios, Planescape: Torment is a legendary cult classic among RPG enthusiasts
 Picked up later by Beamdog, the same publisher/developer responsible for the outstanding Enhanced Editions of other classic RPGs such as Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment has received the same Enhanced Edition treatment, complete with a remastered soundtrack, native 4K support, and a few more modern features to make gameplay a bit more user friendly
To avoid spoiling any part of this bewitching tale, only a very brief synopsis of the plot basics will be included in this review
 You take on the role of The Nameless One, a possibly immortal man whom has awoke with a severe case of amnesia in a grim, zombie-infested mortuary
 He is soon approached by a sarcastic, yet witty, floating skull named Morte,
who helps to guide The Nameless One through his confused state, but can this seemingly harmless companion be trusted
 Unsure of his past, his name, or even his purpose, The Nameless One and the skull then set off on their ultimate quest of attempting to restore The Nameless One's memory, and figure out just what the foreboding, instruction-like tattooed scrawls on his back mean
The game takes place within the Planescape multiverse of the Dungeons and Dragons universe, a setting that entails various planes of existence; though do not let that deter you if you know little to nothing of the classic board game
 Planescape: Torment does an absolutely stunning job in conveying both basic and detailed information about the vast and seemingly endless world that it takes place in; I went in with virtually no knowledge of this realm, and I feel as though I could now write a book on it
 However, if getting to know the lore so in-depth is not your thing, a great feature of this game is being able to sink your teeth into it as shallow or as deep as you prefer
It's true that you can lose yourself for hours at a time when becoming immersed in just the setting of Planescape: Torment alone, but each of the characters are equally as memorable, and most of them have intricate backgrounds
 During your long and difficult journey, you will meet many, many people; some of which will become companions if given the chance, others are there simply for conversation sake, and some you will run optional errands for
 This again boils down to how deep you wish to dive into this adventure, to which it is whole-heartedly recommended to let go of reality completely and sink all the way to the bottom of the countless fathoms of this story
If you choose to totally immerse yourself, you can expect to get anywhere from 40-50 hours out of this title, though it also depends on how quickly you read
 It's best to not go in to the game expecting an RPG full of battles, but rather to expect a ratio of about 90% reading, 10% fighting
 Most of the combat is reserved for the much later portion of the story, and even then it's still not a primary focus
 There are boss battles, but the combat and loot system are primitive at best, a bit boring at worst, though this feature should not be your deciding factor on whether or not you decide to play Planescape: Torment; simply be aware that this is a heavily story based title
 Despite a lacking combat system, you are able to choose between three classes for The Nameless One; mage, fighter, and thief
 As for any RPG, leveling up and attribute points are also included
Aside from all of that, in typical Dungeons and Dragons manner there is a karma system
 It's not overly complex by any means, being comprised of the Lawful, Chaotic, Neutral, Good, and Evil rankings
 At any given time, depending on your actions and interactions, you can be Lawful Neutral, Lawful Good, Lawful Evil, Chaotic Neutral, Chaotic Good, or Chaotic Evil
 If you're new to this kind of karma system, it's best to let either the game or a search engine explain it to you, but it's quite basic
 Your overall karma level will determine how people around you react to you, including your companions, so it does make a difference
 As well, the companions that you keep with you throughout the game will make a difference in some dialogue and interactions, especially during the end game content
There are hundreds, if not a thousand or more, unique dialogue interactions
 The possible and neigh infinite conglomeration of their branches means that replay value here is extremely high
 Not only do you talk to dozens of people throughout the campaign, it's also good to speak with your companions from time to time to get their input on things; they may even reveal more of their backstory to you over time, if you treat them well enough
 There are also a couple of different endings to attain, and even replaying the ending alone has a ton of story-based benefits
 While on the subject, the last dying breaths of the game are just as renowned as the rest of the title, and it fills the player with a deep sense of completion and satisfaction no matter the final outcome
So, should you play Plansecape: Torment
 Beyond any possible shadow of a doubt, absolutely yes
 That is, so long as you want to experience one of the best and most detailed fictional stories ever written
 It's a tale that your mind will keep summoning back to you while you're working, stuck in traffic, or completing other mundane tasks
 The characters are unforgettable, and even if you happen to take a couple weeks off to play something else in the meantime you will not have forgotten a single thing about this title by the time that you return; unlike many other RPGs where you have no clue where you left off at, it's just that remarkable
 There is not enough praise in the world for Planescape: Torment, and it's certainly not an experience that you should rob yourself of
Rating: 5
0/5
0 - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played

I've played a fully modded GOG version of Planescape: Torment and within 5 minutes of playing this Enhanced Edition version, I can say that the clear winner goes to the Enhanced Edition because of the following Quality of Life improvements:1) Tab reveals all interatable objects with subtle icons to indicate which interaction will happen if object is clicked on
2) Mouse scrollwheel WORKS, which is SO GREAT for such a dialogue heavy adventure3) The popup dialogue boxes when examining objects aren't center screen, but hover above the objects4) Alt+Tab toggling without any issues5) Other programs or Desktop icons no longer occasionally flicker into view6) The sound hasn't cracked or glitched yet7) The HUD and icons are super polished and are set to the perfect size and resolution8) Game is super polished, but will only become more polished over time

You've seen a lot of games
 You've also watched games like movies
But did you ever read a game like a book
 And each of your choices opens a new, probably unique chapter
And you can read it again and again, each time discovering something new
This is a definition of true classic RPG
One of the best ones ever made
The best, by my opinion
And a definitely good remaster
Posted: 29 April
This game really updates my journal
Beamdog added zoom functionality, and that alone makes it worth getting for me
 There are still some issues, such as Drusilla disappearing once you are done with the Smoldering Corpse, or the fight with the Many-As-One
requiring you to get out of the room and going back in again, but it is in general a pretty damn good remaster

Best Game ever read
Best Book ever played

I don't have any Nostalgia for this one
 I just finished the game for the first time
 This game is amazing
 I would easily rank it among my top 3 RPGS, maybe even my number 1 pick
The story is very good for a video game, The setting and world are fantastic
 It does have some flaws but if you can overlook those flaws you're in for a real treat
 I can't recommend this title enough

This review is 100% spoilers free and discusses why some people did not like the game
Some Supergiant's fans gave it negative reviews, I disagree but understand their point of view
First of all I would like to address that Transistor is my favorite game on Steam and Bastion is not far from there
 I spent +60 hours in each one of them and absolutely love them
 Supergiant Games however are famous for creating a totally new and differenet experience in each of their games, going from action RPG to mostly strategy and finally to some weird visual novel party based fantasy sport
 I expected that Pyre would be different than the other two but some fans did not, they expected Supergiant to do their famous gimmick in which they blend the story telling in the middle of the gameplay
 I personally believe that Supergiant should not be stricted to a system just because they perfected it and were famous for it, they might try something totally different (which they also perfected here with Pyre as an almost visual novel)
 I can understand why they want Supergiant to stick with their old system but that does not justify the negative reviews on the game just because of its genre is visual novel and did not use the same gimmick as the previous two games
Pros: + Amazing story which you can dive into as deep as you are interested
+ Memorable unique characters, you might love some of them you might hate the others but in the end they're all interesting which creates the connection between you and them
+ Do I even need to talk about the soundtrack
 Darren Korb kills it again here
+ Art style is absolutely gorgeous and developes an awesome atmosphere that pulls you into the game, in my opinion one of the best arts in video games by far
+ The core gameplay (The Rites) is a lot of fun with great character differences and variety of play styles
 You might find it too easy at the beginning, well, wait and see how the game can give you a good challenge if you're willing to accept it
+ The RPG elements in the game are important and highly customizable, whether it's the items or chatacter upgrades
+ On a technical level my mind is blown by how the story goes by with the decision making and your wins and losses
 It's like every and each player will get its very own different story than the other
 I played Telltale games and The Witcher but this one stands out among them as the highest number of possible results you can get
 Like even in some major choice matters I found that my options were totally different than my friend's because of how we approched the game and our relationship with the Characters
Cons: The cons in my opinion does not affect the enjoyability of the game but just to mention them
- I personally do not think this is a con but some people might be bored with the too much reading in the game and that is why I stated that Pyre is close to be a visual novel
 So if you hate reading a lot of dialogues this might not be the perfect game for you
- The core gameplay (The Rites) could've taken more parts in the story since each match lasts only like 4 minutes, that is not something annoying or negative in the game I just think it could've been a little bit better
- My only take on Supergiant games is that they should've mentioned how Pyre is close to be a visual novel so that their fans who played Bastion and Transistor can understand the major changes happened here, in other words the game description is missing some elements
Overall: I find Pyre to be one of the best games I ever played so far especially in terms of story and choice matters
 The characters are strong part of the game and influence your choices a lot
 The soundtrack and art style are on a different level
 And last but not least the core gameplay is well thought and really entertaining and much deeper than what you think which most visual novels don't usually devolop
For those Supergiant fans who did not like the game, I can understand your point of view but does not mean the game is bad just because it does not use Bastion and Transistor's gimmick, or because the genre is not your cup of tea
Thanks for reading

This game is truly completely different than all the other Supergiant games
 I’ve played for a while now, and I believe the following points are important to know about Pyre
1
 The game is extremely story centered
 You have to read a lot
 If you don't like reading dialogues or anything at all in games then I think this game is not for you
 The game depends on you reading everything
 The story is interesting though
 Sometimes there are really funny moments
 All in all it’s not boring to read it
2
 You have to make many decisions, and yes they do impact the story to a certain extend
 Some have more impact than others though
 3
 So, expect for the fights, this game is like a Visual Novel
 The most time is spent reading
The story is interesting and I want to know what happens next
 Also the characters
 Those are so diverse and likeable; it’s nice and refreshing
 The art is just gorgeous and the music is too, just like in any previous Supergiant games
 I personally really like reading a good story so I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who does too
--- I've written a little bit more about story & characters below (light spoilers) ---StoryI‘ve read a lot of Visual Novel’s (not sexual one’s, mind you) and I also read a lot of books
 I think the story is interesting but not as engaging as it should and must be as a Visual Novel’s
 There is a whole backstory written in a book about the Rite’s that you are completing, which you can read
 It’s mostly told out of the perspective of a person, but it still gets boring fast
 Sometimes after completing a rite, I gained up to 8 pages of this book at once
 It’s not fun reading 8 pages at once
 I do believe there is a better way of implementing the backstory into a game
 I really wanted to read it all, but it began feeling like a task all too soon
 Of course, this could have been me being lazy
CharactersI love the diverse and likeable characters that Pyre presents to you
 In fact, I like them so much, that sometimes I ask myself: Why can’t we speak more with them
 Instead of having so much text written in a book, why not be able to deepen your friendship with your companions
 I did ‘care’ about them a little bit, even with the relatively short and rare interactions that are available
 But being on a journey with them, being a team, completing the rite’s together… I think it would have been good for the game if there was a possibility to speak and interact more with your companions
 But that’s really just my opinion
 Obligatory German: ‘I’m sorry for my bad English’ and thanks for reading
 :)

Something I believe I should note right off the bat is that Pyre is not a game that will appeal to everyone
 Even if you're a fan of other Supergiant games, do your research before you buy this game
 That doesn't mean Pyre is bad
 No, it's the direct opposite of that
 However, compared to their other games, this one might be harder for some to enjoy due to its heavy visual novel elements
 Now that that's out of the way, I think the one word to describe how I felt after finishing this game is awestruck
 Even if this is a more niche title, it doesn't change the fact that Pyre is one of the best games 2017 has to offer
GraphicsBy Supergiant standards, this is the best they've done in the visual department
 While all of their games look great, this one was eye candy from start to finish
 All of the different areas really set the tone, and the character designs are extremely diverse and unique
 There isn't much to say here, but there isn't anything about the graphics I can fault
 I don't think there's any way they could've done it better, because the game is absolutely gorgeous to look at
GameplayPyre's weakest aspect is its gameplay, however it's not bad at all
 At worst, there was a lot of missed potential, but at best, you have an extremely interesting and unique take on football/basketball
 There's no denying that Pyre's gameplay is extremely unique, and it's extremely fun
 It's not completely polished, as certain characters like Ti'zo and Fae/Dae/Bae/etc
 are ridiculously OP, but the concept is there and it works
 I loved experimenting with the different playable exiles and adapting to the fairly dynamic (and constantly exciting) Rites, and the game encourages flexibility
 That being said, the Rites themselves don't actually get all that interesting until about 1/3 of your way into the game, where more gameplay options are provided to you
 It's quite understandable if you find yourself slogging through the first part of the game
 But once you get passed that, the gameplay becomes far more complex and interesting
 Also, it's important for me to mention, this game has awesome online multiplayer potential
 I was surprised to hear this game didn't have online multiplayer, because the Rites are very enjoyable once you get through the beginning stages
 Overall, the gameplay's still good, but definitely where Pyre falls short
StoryPyre's story made me feel a wide range of emotions
 At some points, I was getting teary-eyed, and at other times I was audibly yelling at my monitor in excitement
 It felt like a real journey, and it was so fascinating to watch all of these problems unfold and see how the characters respond to it
 But that's where Pyre is at its best - the characters
 I loved every single one of them
 Every single Nightwing who joins you is fleshed out and three-dimensional, you can tell plenty of time and care was put into making them lovable
 One thing I also liked is that the game did take certain character clichés and flip them on their heads, one example being my favorite character, Rukey
 The way he's portrayed at first gives you the vibe that he's going to be a shady, self-centered, and annoying prick who will want to make you bash your head into a wall
 Instead, without getting too much into spoilers (but I'll censor it anyway just in case), Rukey turns out to be an honest and supportive person who cares deeply for his family's well being
 Anti-trends like this are pretty common with all of the characters, and it made me love everyone, even the exiles you face off against
 Pyre is probably one of the most deep and open-ended games I've ever played, with there being a ridiculous amount of lore and ways for the game to play out
 It's definitely going to overwhelm some, but if you power through it, you will find that this game is very immersive and keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish
AudioSupergiant games have always had a great soundtrack to back them up, but they went above and beyond with this game
 Each piece feels different and fits their intended tone
 There wasn't a single piece that felt out of place
 The songs with vocals, however, were the highlights
 Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett have beautiful voices, and every time they sang, I got goosebumps
 While some might be disappointed by the lack of Logan Cunningham's normal narrator voice, the one they had for this game fit the theme a lot better in my opinion and I was perfectly fine with him
 This game's narrator especially got more entertaining as the game progresses, although explaining why would lead to spoilers
 To conclude, just like the game's story and visuals, I can't find anything to fault here
ReplayabilityThe amount of replayability in this game surprised me
 There's a LOT of different outcomes to the game, and with the incredible story, I'm considering going through it again just to see what other interactions I can find between the charming ensemble of exiles
 It's a shame that the game doesn't have online multiplayer, though, otherwise I would be even more hooked on this game than I already am
VerdictAlthough Pyre is most certainly unique and an incredible experience, I think a good game that it can be compared to is Undertale
 While Pyre isn't a 10/10 game and some people will find the visual novel aspects tedious, both games have extremely well developed characters, an amazing storyline from start to end, and soundtracks where every single song is enjoyable in their own way
 Supergiant has given us yet another high quality game, and if it appeals to you, dear Reader, you will be more than satisfied with this incredibly brilliant and enthralling emotional rollercoaster

 What is "Pyre"
The game "Pyre" was made by Supergiant Games and was released on the 25th of July in 2017
 After "Bastion" and "Transistor" this is their third game
 "Pyre" is an indie-action-rpg, which story is mostly told in form of a novel
 The gameplay is very different to the experience you probably made in "Bastion/Transistor", which lead a few people to put a negative review on steam
 Now you will no longer play as one single character like before, but you are responsible for a group of exiles
 The gameplay at it´s heart can be declared as 3 parts: part 1 contains travelling/exploring the worldpart 2 contains social interactivity with your group (talking/trading/decision-making)part 3 contains to take part in the rites, that means a fast-paced action ball game (3 vs 3) without
a planning phase (like in "Transistor")2
 Technical details-the game runs fine on my windows 10 64 bit machine and it needs about 8
2 gb space of your hard drive
 Unfortunately the game runs bad on old machines, because you need about 4 gb ram to run it without an error (my other 3 gb ddr2-system couldn´t run it, I received a ram-error-message when starting the game)
-controls with mouse+keyboard or gamepad are good and well implemented
3
 What does the game right
-great rpg-novel-mixture as a whole unique and emotional experience-despite the linear progression (mentioned "phases/parts" above) the game stays interesting enough to continue-a colourful and fantastic world to explore (no open-world)-great character-design and a good variety of different creatures, which affects the gameplay during the rites-beautiful artstyle with a lot of detail and smooth animations -believable and fleshed-out storyline (NOT "black and white") with a personalised ending
 -wonderful soundtrack (mostly ambient)-the creatures of the world speak their own language, subtitle is displayed in old-fashioned English-rites: the thrilling-faced-paced-action-game has a lot of depth to it (skill tree/character selection/items/area of the rite)-selectable difficulty level (rites can be optionally restartet), which can be changed during the game (+ "titan-mode": advanced challenges you can add separately like in "Bastion/Transistor")-meaningful and emotional decisions to be made (I´m looking at you mass effect), thankfully there are no dead-ends but different endings (personalised
)-"Pyre" is "2-3 times" longer compared to "Bastion"/"Transistor" without getting boring-good mouse+keyboard and gamepad support-"versus-mode": you can play against friends together on your pc or alone against CPU (with all the characters in the game
)4
 What does the game wrong
-the fast-paced-gameplay during the rites can be very fast and too stressful at times (I experienced some unfair situations here and there)-controls are sometimes not precise enough, especially when the gameplay is getting hot-hardware requirements (like "Transistor") with 4 gb ddr-ram are over the top regarding old rigs with dual-core cpu´s -some minor bugs during the rites (ball gets stuck, switching between characters over distance, bad camera angles over distance)-"versus mode" can only be played as local multiplayer-no bonus material for fans at all 5
 tl;drPyre offers a fantastic but linear action-rpg-experience with a great story, which is told in form of a novel with a personalised ending
 The gameplay is a mixture of exploration, social interactivity and a 3 vs 3 ball-sports-game
 The level of creativity considering world-building, character design, music and the way the story is being told is on an insanely high level
 If you liked "Bastion" and "Transistor" you need to know that you don´t play just as one character anymore
 But what you can expect is a game with a heart, just like their games before
 Pyre is in my opinion a masterpiece and the best Supergiant game so far

 Final thoughtsAs a child of the 80´s I played a lot of pc games
 Sometimes I look back and remember how I bought game boxes from a company called "Lucas Arts"
 There were times I didn´t even inform myself about the upcoming games, I just bought them because I loved their games I purchased before
 For me Supergiant reached that status in the present time
 Until the stars align

Do not buy this game purely because you are a fan of Bastion and Transistor
 I can not stress that point enough
This game shares the amazing atmosphere, soundtrack, and story telling of SuperGiant's first two games, but the meat of the game, the combat, plays absolutely nothing like them, and is brutally savage
This game isnt a casual topdown shooter, its not a semi-turnbased ability centered hack and slash: this game is squad rts 3v3 football on crack
It is not easy, it is not casual, and sometimes it is not fun
Generally when I play a new game I put the difficulty on the highest setting, as I find that is the best/most fun way to play, but for this game I found myself challenged on the standard setting
In my opinion, It would take an experienced veteran of this game to attempt a run on Heightened difficulty, and that is not really what I came looking for
The game is fast, unforgiving, and frustrating
If this game did not have its beautiful art and characters, I would have already given up on trying to play it
If you want a challenge, get this game
If you want to try out an entirely new kind of squad based rts, get this game
If you want to scream "Excuse me, what" over and over at your monitor while trying not to physically hit things, go ahead and get this game
If you are here for the same casual experience you received from SuperGiant's old titles, consider just playing them again instead of this
This is a good game, but definetly not the casual game that I expected it to be
Edit: This review was based on first impressions of the game, which is all I felt I needed to get a feel for it
 I understand that someone should probably play a decent amount of a game before writing a full review, which is why I have not written a full review of the game
Posted: 25 July
You know, after enjoying Transistor and Bastion so thoroughly, for some reason, I didn't think Pyre would really be on the same level as those two games
 The gameplay, at first glance, whilst interesting, didn't seem too engaging
But the more and more I play Pyre, the more I think I'm wrong
 This game - whilst it has a slow story->gameplay->story pace not all may enjoy - is actually shaping up to be one of my favourite games of all time
 Allow me to explain why
 (And if you don't like long-winded reviews, you'd better find another one haha)
Pyre is an inspiring, lovingly-crafted, and clever game of quality I've only experienced in few games
 When it comes to a mixture of creativity, quality, and a genuine love for the product they're producing, Supergiant has proved to me they're one of the best companies out there in that regard
 Whilst I'm not one to read every inch of lore, I love being immersed in a certain setting, getting a feel for characters, and really feeling 'part of the game'
 Pyre absolutely excels in that regard
The gameplay itself appears simple at first, but there are many layers of complexity to it which I think would make it a really excellent multiplayer game
 I won't fully go into details, but it's basically like playing top-down basketball made a lot more exciting with excellent graphics, sound design, and with a selection of many characters spicing up your different 3v3 matches with their own abilities
 There are honestly tons of ways you can play, with characters such as the slow and powerful Jodariel offering an aggressive/defensive playstyle, or the super speedy Rukey allowing you to quickly rush down the celestial ball
 Matches can get tense: seriously tense, if you find yourself getting thrashed by the AI (thankfully that's only happened to me once)
 I wouldn't go as far as to say the gameplay is flawless (though it is very very good)
 Even at max difficulty, whilst I'm sure things are getting harder, I find it rather easy to repeatedly 'rush down' the celestial ball with fast characters
 It would be nice to see a level of difficulty above the 'hardest' one that already stands for crowds looking for a true challenge
 That said, if you lose a match, as far as I know, you don't just 'restart'
 That loss goes down in history forever, so it's pretty intense
 You /can/ restart a match if you lose, but
 I'd sort of recommend against that, really
Also, I'd love to see online multiplayer in this game, but unfortunately, I don't think it'll be possible to impliment it
 It offers local multiplayer, though, and an 'arena mode' if you just want to hunker down into some gameplay and ignore the story
Gameplay aside, another very big strength of this game is its characters
 As you meet them (and yes, you meet more than the initial trio as you go along), you slowly begin to learn more and more about them
 All of their dialogue is carefully written, and if you like seeing a lot of dialogue from a seemingly huge lineup (a bit like Fire Emblem), then this is a game for you
 I also love how there's loads of little 'hidden interactions', and the game sometimes gives you 'multiple-choice options' that I'm sure will accomodate The best thing about this game overall, though, for me at least, is the creativity of its design
 I don't know if I'm the only one, and it's sort of unrelated, but I'll be going into university to do a Game Design & Writing course
 I've always thought that, being a writer, I'll always be the 'useless' one of a game creating team when it comes past the design/ideas stage
 This game, however, has encouraged & inspired me to think otherwise
 The writing in this is truly superb, well-thought out, and it's funny how much a few little words on a screen can make you think and inquire about a character that
 well
 doesn't actually exist
 And there are so, SO many multiple choices and ways you can go about this game, I can't even begin to imagine how many lines of dialogue were actually written for Pyre
Oh, and this game costs not even half of what I'd be willing to pay for it
 If you're cautious of your money, whilst I haven't completed a full playthrough yet, I am very, VERY sure this is worth your money
So, waffling aside, what would I rate this game
 Personally, it gets a 9
8/10 (which may as well be 10/10) from me, and I'm rare to give games I even consider 'good' anything higher than an 8
 I'd only recommend against buying this if you're someone who doesn't like story-driven games, or someone who gets annoyed when they're pulled out of gameplay and just can't bring themselves to care about characters at all
 If you're one of those people, whilst I think you're missing out, I'd definietely say your money is better spent elsewhere
Amazing work, Supergiant
 This game is - no hypobole at all - a masterpiece
Posted: 26 July
Narratives in video-games have a stigma that their structure is to the detriment of the player’s ability to interact with the world, and if Pyre is to be commended on one thing it has mastered the illusion of structure by taking inspiration from oral storytelling to let the Readers have total influence by how they tell its epic adventure
After playing games like Moon Hunters and Stories: Path of Destiny which failed to make a story from your choices, Pyre has managed to create one by taking into consideration all the player’s failures and successes
 However, like these other games, the problems come in the form of a repetition of simplified gameplay, which does manage better than these other games by raising the stakes each time you begin a new cycle
 As much as I want to enjoy Pyre as much as I love Transistor, which is still my favorite by Supergiant, the imbalance amounts of gameplay with the narrative as well as the concessions made to accommodate this storyline ultimately weaken the experience, yet the moments that can be borne from the player’s actions can be hauntingly memorable when it hits home
 Literal Fantasy Soccer Manager RPGOf all the games that come to mind for a comparison to Pyre in the gameplay inside and outside of combat are the Banner Saga games crossed with an ARPG styled Fantasy Soccer manager
 In-between each competition, the Rites, the Reader and his companions travel across story-book popup landscapes with various choose-your-adventure styled vignettes to apply status effects or debuffs as well as allow more character interactions between you and the rest of the characters
 These moments also allow you to train characters, buff your team or forage for supplies to upgrade your equipment
 When engaged in the Rites, they consist of three-on-three battles where the player can choose up to eight companions to mix-and-match their strengths into different scenarios when pitied against other teams with unique match-ups
 Each faction has their own story-arc and relevance to the team you foster, the Nightwings, as you all are competing for the freedom from a land of purgatory consisting of exiles, convicts and unwanted people from the world above
As someone who enjoyed the previous games because of the variety of playstyles for the Kid in Bastion and for Red in Transistor, the focus on a “RPG sports” game based on team-play was something I did not initially enjoy
 This is why it’s more appropriate to describe it like soccer with various one-on-one battles of offense and defense rather thinking it’s all about dunking basketballs
 You can still play most of the game controlling one or two characters in every round; however, in the later challenges the coordination required to win ever increasing odds will tax players to come up with tactics between two or three characters
 Combined with the “visual-novel” style of an RPG and the change in narration behind its story, and it’s easy to understand why this game is so polarizing amongst fans
 If, however, you manage to see past its simplistic gameplay elements, which only becomes more difficult the farther you delve into the next tournaments of Rites, then you can begin to appreciate how far Supergiant has come in interweaving the story into a player-driven experience
Whispers of Rites Told Among Charred AshesLike the name suggests, Pyre is involved with the ceremonious structure of honor to burn the remnants of people lost; however, instead of focusing on death it’s about the path of redemption through adversity to burn away one’s crimes and restore the individual’s glory and rights
 When the Rites are performed, the narration that follows are like the whispers during a mourn spoken upon the charred ash of the purifying flames
Beyond the poetical implications, this style of narration is used by being a narrative told through the victories and defeats you will create to shape the story not only amongst your companions but with every single NPC you come across that can be given freedom or denied it by you
 Even in the case that you suffer defeat, it’s not the end; it’s rather another moment for the game to create new conflicts and aspire for their resolutions
 The result of such an experience is that the story will be different with every player depending on the choices you make and the failures/victories you accrue
 This is a major shift from Supergiant’s previous games which were entirely linear experiences with some choices made for areas (Bastion) or alternative challenges (Transistor)
 While choices are available in different manners and there are specialized challenges, they’re in small numbers compared to the journey you undergo
 And instead of having one main character that wasn’t the player, Pyre has the player assume the role of a (default: male) Reader that interacts with various major characters
 As you might expect from the title, you are going to have to read a lot due to the amount of characters and variables there are to accommodate with only the Voice as the announcer having audio
 Beyond its technical limitations, the lack of vocal narration is also used for themes of knowledge and freedom as you play one of the only literate characters
 Literacy amongst non-Scribes are against the law; every character grunts, makes noises, and possesses limitations of their abilities and knowledge until you help them become enlightened; characters have reasons behind their narrowed viewpoints that you can attempt to broaden; and the lore constantly questions powers of authority, knowledge and equality and the struggles they create
 Even in the Nightwing’s ultimate Plan, the ultimate goal is to help others by using each races’ abilities to foster growth of knowledge and of true freedom to the world beyond their own
 While the tone and consistency of this theme is weaker than their other titles, the narration behind its subtler moments truly shine when the player is given free-will to exercise these ideas through their own means
Cats May Have Nine Lives; People Get Bored By OneThis all leads into what is perhaps the greatest issue of Pyre, and that is the story as well as the gameplay becomes repetitive because of how the game is designed
 In its structure, you will have to engage in a series of tournaments not once, not thrice, not five times but seven times to complete the game
 Each tournament becomes quicker than the last, but the extent of which this game repeats itself can become an issue to some who become tired of the gameplay after the first few runs
 While the game becomes more difficult because they add more challenges by having fewer companions to choose from as well as adding new ones, every following tournament becomes a series of battles with a moment before to prepare, and it’s mainly the narrative that will keep you playing
 Encounters can sometimes break the rules with an added difficult spike as well as emphasizing the stat-management system behind the core gameplay as well as added penalties that force you to mix up the gameplay over time
 Pyre does all it can to sustain itself with added challenges and higher odds to overcome, but it will inevitably feel tiresome to players who enjoyed how focused Supergiant’s previous games are as well as how formulaic the last six runs will feel outside of the variables you can influence
 To the game’s credit, the final showdown was perhaps the hardest fight to overcome that the tension of failing could have impacted this fight was perhaps the best moment from the entire experience when I overcame the odds
 None of these complaints should mean I don’t like Pyre; however, I realize that out of all their previous games it’s perhaps the most bloated with extra content that impacts the pacing and the consistency of it
 Like skinning a cat, no matter how many ways there are to achieve the result it all begins to drag after the fifth life

Pyre is a story surrounding a band of outcasts all fighting for the same thing, yet all willing to sacrifice their own freedom for one another
 Like Transistor and Bastion before it, Pyre is treat to the senses from start to finish
 Where both Bastion and Transistor centered around a single person Pyre dove into the lives of many different people, each with unique and deep character
Each time the liberation rites came around it brought with them a difficult decision that made you question whether to be selfish or fair
and each time got increasingly difficult
 Soon enough you realise that these are more than just people, they are your companions, each of whom deserve their freedom equally
 With gameplay that could sometimes be frustrating and walls of text to read through at a time, it never took away from the experience as it didn't feel like a chore but rather enhanced and deepened the experience
Pyre isn't about the gameplay, the story, the art or the music, it's about the experience of all of it brought together
 Where Transistor and Bastion said so much with so little, Pyre went the opposite route, and tried something different with a more visual novel approach
 It might not be Supergiant's greatest work, but it is an excellent experience none the less

"What does freedom mean to you
"I was first drawn to Pyre because I fell in love with Bastion and Transistor
 Yet, Pyre has come to mean more to me than both of its predecessors
This game quickly distinguishes itself by drawing you into the story and giving you the perfect role, whilst not demanding you forfeit your own personality or will
 Your victories and failures, your mercy or your ruthlessness, all matter here
I never imagined that a game could so perfectly knit you into the story like Pyre does
 The immersion is flawless
 You're not simply guiding The Kid or Red this time
 You're you, "The Reader," and you will live in this story
This unique experience is no doubt a credit to the incredible writers
 The dialogue, vocabularly, relationships, character development, and especially the humor, are absolutely phenomenal
 I can't count how often I laughed with tears in my eyes, paused to take a breath, then resumed only to be surprised by more hilarity and laughter
 Of course, the art is completely irresistible
 The ingenuity of Jen Zee's character design is so outstanding that you will be delighted and surprised by every new character you meet
 Love or hate (most likely love), each one is visually ornate with personalities to match
 The vivid, colorful world with its abundant detail will keep your eyes lusting for more
 However, many times, I wanted world exploration to creep by slower so that my eyes could feast a little longer on the landscape and catch every intricacy
 As for the soundtrack; it should be no surprise that it's incredible
 I paused playing, just to listen, many times
 Not a single track failed to bring a smile, or more, to my lips
 Many people seem to have conflicting feelings regarding the sport-like gameplay of "The Rites
" It feels foreign to anything I've ever played before, so I fumbled here and there
 However, that only made it more entertaining and rewarding
 The game eases you into the oddity and, in time, presents some serious challenges
 And, there is some room for strategy via customization of your team, their personal traits, and the items they wear
In conclusion, I highly recommend Pyre
 It has become one of my all-time favorite games
 Greater even than its brilliant story, characters, soundtrack, and art, is how this game can make you feel
 It invokes profound emotion without crushing and wringing the tears out of you with tragedy and loss
 Instead, it's uplifting, even when the path you must choose is difficult
 It gives you courage and inspires hope
 It sets you free

This is a hard game to review
Reason being, I'm a fan of Supergiant's games, of the style, the beautiful visuals, the amazing music
 First off, you have to be a fan of both sports games and visual novels
 In that sense, its a strange hybrid
It's rare to find someone who's a fan of both those extremes
 As you probably already know, it's basically a 3v3 ball game, with a story built around them through a visual novel
 It's all very pretty, and the 3v3 ball game is fun
 The issue is that, after the first 6-7hours it becomes terribly repetitive
 You just play one team after the next over and over and over
 At some point, I stopped caring about the story, and just wanted to rush to the next match and get the game over with
 It is a sad way to play, but I couldn't help it
 It just gets very repetitive and boring
 I think it would've made more sense to just make it a visual novel or a sports game but not both
 Independently they are both good, but together it seems like a never ending drag and you don't enjoy either much
 When I started this game, I thought to myself this is awesome, I'm going to give it the best review, but by the end of it, it left a sour taste in my mouth
 I can understand why someone would like it, and why others would hate it, personally I neither loved nor hated it, but I didn't enjoy it much
 And as such I cannot recommend it

I swear the game is messing with me
- Got a deal with city hall that they will let me hire three more cops but one of them has to be son of the guy who made the deal with me
- I accept the deal
- A guy named Persly joins my shift A and he is horrible
 (had only 5 points)- Not allowed to fire him so decided to pay the mafia to kill him
- The time comes to kill him and he doesn't show up for work, 1000$ wasted
- Decided to try again with the mafia hit
- Persly decides to take a vacation the day I was going to try to have him killed
- That same day I had three of my best cops all get murdered by some punk teenager who robbed a store
 (one of them was ranked 1,200
)- Got pretty annoyed with the game and decided to close it out and play it later
- I get three steam trading cards
- ALL three of them are Persly
GG game

A very wealthy man came up to me with an offer, he wants to fund the police station with enough money to support 3 new officer positions, with the condition that his son take up one of the slots, and I cannot fire him under any circumstance, I accepted his offer, and arranged for the mafia to kill him the very next morning, I then had the paperwork buried so nobody would know about his death, his paycheck now goes directly into my pocket every week
10/10 game

One of my officers asked me if she can stay home because she partied too hard and is drunk
 I told her no
 A few hours later the Mayor calls me and tells me they will cut my budget and I have to fire one officer
 I told the drunk officer that she'll have to quit at the end of the day, but not before going out on one last mission
 On the way there she had a car accident and died, because she was drunk driving

There is a lot to like about This Is The Police
 Some solid art
 Some great music (I love how you can purchase your own records in-game via a music catalogue)
 And the concept itself is really good
 A police chief on the take who has to make daily management choices with narrative implications
 The comparisons with Papers Please are obvious enough
 And to the extent that it is similar to that game, it works
 Unfortunately it falls down in a crucial respect - player choice
 Papers Please does not rail-road you into certain decisions
 It gives you some requirements (feeding your family
), and sets up the pressure that encourages you to make some choices rather than others
 However in the end you are shaping the experience
 You are chosing who to let through, and who not too
 Monetary pressures may influence your choice, but it is still your choice
 In This Is the Police, however, you have no choice
 Early on the game presents you with the "choice" of working for the mob or not
 Aha
 So I thought what I had here was the option of being full-on corrupt (OK, some people might like this), or just a guy who is gaming the system, but had some kind of 80-20 gray morality (you do what you gotta do to get by, some nudging and wiking within limits, but fundamentally, i
e
 80% of the time, you believe in some semblance of law and order)
 However if you choose not to work with the mob, you are forced to anyway
 Making your choice meaningless, and raising the question - why even give you one at all
As you play your mob overlords will give you commands
 You can refuse to do a specific job, but refuse more than a few and your game is over (you get arrested by the feds, or what have you)
 You are, in other words, - forced - to be at the beck and call of the mob
 You are a puppet
 Basically
 Do what we tell you
 Or else game over, buddy
 You do at some point get to choose if you work for the old mob, or the new guy in crime, but that is as far as it goes
This is when the game lost me
 Playing an old police chief who is trying to build up a little retirement fund
 Great idea
 But the developers needed to place the emphasis on letting the player enjoy that simple experience
 Narrative should help as an elaboration, but the purity of the experience (what Papers Please really is about), should be the driving force
 Otherwise you are taking a back-seat to your own game, in a sense, and may as well be watching a movie
If it comes up on sale, you might want to grab it
 Because this game does do a lot of cool things
 It's just that as a -game- it doesn't really respect the player
Posted: 6 August, 2016
Don't be fooled by the countless positive anecdote joke reviews from people who haven't beaten the game
 It's not worth the 25+ hours it takes to finish
 The achievement page reveals only one percent of the people who've started this game have seen it through to the end and trust me when I say it's not worth it
 The whole game is a huge mixed bag
 The plot, music, and voicework is amazing
 The game sprinkles a few pop culture references and jokes inside a handful of dispatch requests
 The game shines brightest as you maintain the balance of power among the church, big businesses, the government, organized crime syndacites, law abiding citizens, and your police force
 This game fearlessly tackles controversial issues all from the rarely percieved point of view of the police
 The world feels incredibly immersive and the duration of the game can really pull you into its world
 Despite all that I still can't recommend this game
Aside from cops you have detectives who unearth clues (frames) that you piece together for investigations
 In dangan ronpa you piece together the crime in summary by sorting the pictures and events in order
Posted: 18 May
Overall score: 5/10Did I get my money's worth
: YesRecommended input: Keyboard/mouseI experienced a lot of mixed emotions in my time of playing This is the Police
 Through story telling and haunting choices, the game handles immersion well and gives the actions of you and the character you represent, retiring police chief Jack Boyd, a ton of weight
 The game's plot oozes severe situations, resulting in an overall bittersweet experience
Notice carefully that this isn't a "choose your own adventure" game, but a management game
 You don't have the options to be a completely good or bad cop; your task in this game is to balance your play style as perfectly as possible
 With that said, without spoiling anything, I'll tell you here what I wish I knew before buying this game: you have power, but you do not have control
 What that means is that, when playing this game, you're never making an overall good decision, just a decision that is either bad or less bad
 Basically, your character is going to have a bad time in this game and no way of playing can change that
 If you want to be a good cop that holds the city together, outplays and dismantles the mafia, makes all of your employees happy, and finishes with a strong retirement and happy family, this game isn't for you
 This isn't a game where you finish as a winner - you're either a surviving loser or a dead loser
 You'll never feel that things are going well or that you're doing a great job progressing and there really is no happy ending, no matter how you play
 To have this premise, I respect the game, since it smacks you with reality
 If that's your kind of style, you might appreciate this game a bit better than I did, but this game saddens me
 People play video games to get away from the real world, to feel accomplished in something or to experience something wonderous
 I didn't experience any of that
 I understand that it's my own fault for running in with a different expectation, but you should know what you want from the games you play as well
 This didn't have to be a happy game by any means, but every hour I played this game I had to ask myself if anything I was getting back was worth it
 If you've read this far into the review and are still thinking about playing the game, please do so
 The parts of this game that really shine are only for those who can withstand the game's faults
 TITP will be known most for its intensive settings, but the management aspects are pretty solid
 You start off with a set team of cops with different skill levels and behaviors and from there, your choices of management unfold
 Each police call made to your station is unique, they will have different levels of risk and many of them give you multiple choices that determine the outcome of the assignment
 Even small tasks can result in cops quitting, being killed, becoming more skilled, less skilled, make you a profit, and having their feelings towards you change
 You choose when to allow the mafia to do as they please, making you a little money but causing the city to come down on you or stopping the mafia in their tracks and risking being killed for protecting the life of a citizen to restore the trust of the city
 Do you listen to your corrupt mayor and violate the rights of the people to please him or do you choose to stand up for your city to result in the mayor forcing you to fire one of your cops that are crucial to your success
 These are just a few of the tough decisions you have to make in this game and you'll quickly find yourself making many, many more
Many say that the management parts of the game are mundane, and while I see where they're coming from, this IS a mangement game and plenty is done to spice up situations
 Each in-game day offers different feats and experiences that will shape the remainder of the game depending on how you play through them
 If you're a filthy cheater like me, you'll find yourself reloading your save file when you realized that you screwed up that last police call and four of your best cops are now dead
 Calls lack consistency, which I feel is crucial for this kind of game where curveballs make situations interesting
 Rather than being a game of trial and error, the biggest turning points in the game and its story mean that you have to choose between trusting your head and trusting your gut
 That's the kind of game TITP is
Overall, despite having to choose not to recommend this game, I'm really 50/50 on it, hence the flat 5/10 rating
 Now that you know what to expect, if this seems like your kind of game, I urge you to try it - you won't be disappointed
 Otherwise, if you don't want to play a game where you can't win, you can play a sandbox game where you're always a winner
 TITP is not for everyone, but the right people will find that this game does everything right for them

This game comes loaded with promise
 You play Chief of Police Jack Boyd, a hard-boiled old-school cop trying to get enough money to retire and survive a city full of gangs, political corruption, and apathetic citizens
 It's very atmospheric, and I was drawn in almost immediately
 The voice acting for Jack really helps set the scene, and there are lots of little touches that make the game's world feel real
At first
 *MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW*You see, this game gives you 180 days to get Jack to his goal of $500,000
 I had met this goal by day 80, and even with some story-related time skips, the game drags and the story gets sparser and sparser until I felt like the developers hadn't had any idea how to wrap things up
 Main plot threads are tied up in increasingly contrived manners and the game railroads the player in its final act into a forced binary choice about which corrupt, sleazy individual to support for head of the city
 Sure, it lends to the game's dark atmosphere, but by this point the player feels no sense of agency
 I was playing like a hustler and a supercop- City Hall loved me, my staff adored me, I made tons of money off the mob only to betray them and break up their operation to the tune of almost half my monetary goal- and then the game says "No, you suck again
 Which one of these two characters who cannot succeed without you would you like to have win rather than you
" I badly, desperately wanted an option to tell them both that I didn't care and wouldn't help either, which would have perfectly fit Jack's character
 Heck, even an option to run for mayor myself would have varied things up, maybe given me a chance to call in all the friends and connections I had built in gameplay
 but nope, pick your flat Pepsi or sour Coke and watch a final disappointing cutscene
I'm fine with stories where the protagonist doesn't win, but this is diabolus ex machina of the worst kind
 Everything in gameplay was going my way, but the story went its own way and decided that heads I won, tails I lost
 If this struggle had been reflected in gameplay and tied in with the overall narrative better, fine
 As-is, I got a little bit of foreshadowing and then had the game metaphorically beat me up and take my lunch money
The ending of a game is important
 And this one has a complete lack of respect for the player, its world, and the game as a whole
 While I had fun in the first half of the game, the latter half of the campaign is a slog and the story unravels and careens in wild directions
 Not worth your money

"Me: Ye- wait what
 *checks my officers list**His father is also a policeman and he's already checked in at work for today*Me: You little lying ****#BestExcuses10/10
Posted: 22 September
TL;DR AT THE ENDThis Is The Police is an
interesting game
 It starts out with an amazing premise, interesting gameplay, unique characters and then just doesn't do anything beyond that
Let's get this out of the way first: TitP is NOT a Visual Novel
 It is not a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game that many people seem to think it is
 TitP is a simple management sim game and that's all it is
 The choices presented to you throughout the 20~ hour story have little to no effect on the story
 They may help you get to the end of it but they will never change the outcome
 In this way it's essentially nothing more than a management sim with an on-rails story
Story wise, you "play" as Jack Boyd, a retiring police commissioner who wants to earn $500,000 before he retires in 180 days
 The game takes place over those 180 days (gameplay wise it's around 150 days)
 You'll be introduced to the corrupt Major Rogers
who holds your job by the balls, the Sands Mafia who controls the city from the underground as well as a bunch of other interesting characters as you try to survive for 180 and earn all that money
As far as gameplay goes it's not overly complicated
 You spend 99% of the game overlooking a map of Freeburg (the city the game takes place in)
 Crimes will pop up around the city and it's your job to send officers to solve them
 Your offierces have "Professionalism" points
 Each officer will earn +10 every time they arrest the purp and officers with over 500 points are almost entirely self sufficent, being able to solve crimes on their own
 There are some unique dispatches as well
City Hall will sometimes ask you to do certain things (like fire all black officers) and it's up to you wheteher you wish to do things like that
 Very early on in the game you get to choose a mafia side to team up with (you can't say no) and they'll sometimes ask you not to send officers to crimes in return for some money
There are more options that open up as the game goes on, such as bringing back contraband to the police station or the mafia, sending officers to protests and forging evidence to pin any violence caused their on a certain faction
 There also detective cases which are really quite fun
 Sometimes a murder or robbery will happen and you'll have to send detective(s) to try and work out the crime
 Every day a detective is assigned to it there's a chance you'll obtain photos of the scene
 Once you have enough photos you can use witness accounts to piece together the crime and arrest the criminal
 It's an interesting idea and stays strong throughout the entire game
So where does it go wrong
 The first and i'd say the biggest problem is that the game is just simply way too long
 Story elements are few and far between and the game overstays it's welcome even before the halfwway mark
 150 days is a LONG time
 The early game is absolutely the most fun as you're struggling to level up your ragtag officers, teaming them up with other awful officers to try and create a strong police force all the while trying to juggle tasks between the mafia and city hall
 As the game goes on, it more or less just becomes "send your best dudes and a few smaller dudes to the crime"
 Once you get an officer past 500 points the game essentially becomes unloseable
 If somehow a low point officer dies you just recruit a new one
 Even the heavy crimes such as massacres and armed robberies become nothing to a high point officer leading some rookies
 You can also choose to send a swwat team and paddy wagon to some crimes but with enough high point officers this isn't at all needed
Apart from the game being too long, the gameplay remains stagnant
 After learning what everything does and how to control your squad, the game does nothing with your experience
 You will spend all your time sending officers to crimes
 Mid game an interesting side quest pops up, but it can be solved fairly quickly and doesn't deviate from normal play
 Choices you make have no impact on gameplay, officers dying means little, not sending officers to crimes doesn't seem to have much repercussion (sometimes you simply just don't have enough officers)
 Essentially, as long as you don't screw over the mafia you can coast to end game with a few strong officers
Really, there isn't much else to say
 The gameplay is repetitive and never changes and the game goes for far too long
 It could have ended after 60~ days and it would have been amazing
 You unlock a sandbox mode after beating the game but by that time you'll never want to touch it again
PRO'S:- An interesting story with unique and interesting characters- An amazing concept with (inital) amazing mechanics- Each crime (and there's well over 500) has unique text that is almost always worth reading- The detective cases add a nice distraction from the gameplay- A great art style- Simple and easy to grasp gameplay- Great soundtrackCON'S:- Story elements are few and far between- Your choices made in game have little to no impact on anything- Game ends up becoming repetitive and goes for FAR too long- After a certain point the game requires no thought and is unloseable- No way to speed up each dayTL;DR A interesting and unique concept that falls flat on it's face
 The game lasts far too long with no incentive to go forward apart from the scattered story elements
 If the game lasted for half as long it would have been an absolute reccomend

People are liking and disliking this game for the same reason: It offers only the illusion of choice
 You will either be a terrible excuse for a police officer who freely lets innocents get murdered and crooks get away just to put money in your pocket, or you will be dead
 Those are your options
 There is just no option to be the good guy
While I do appreciate what the developers were getting at (i
e
 making the best of a terrible situation), I don't take well to games that force you to play in a way you don't want to
 If this game was exactly the same, but the storyline allowed you to just be a good cop and take care of people, I would love it (and seriously, the market is sorely needing a cop game where you are actually a good person)
 I would also enjoy it if there was a way to do a few small favors for the mob while secretly probing their weaknesses and finally taking them down
 But I just don't identify with a character who wants to be the bad guy

Short Review: Stunning setting (visually and thematically), great voice acting, story is top notch, but gameplay is a little lacking
 If you're someone that plays games principally for story and setting, then this is for you
 If not, and it breaks my heart to say this, then I would avoid this as it is narrative heavy
 If you've played previous Dreamfall/TLJ games then this is definitely a worthy successor
 If you haven't, then this review might not be helpful for you but give it a shot anyway
Long Review: This is a difficult game to review
 The first in the series, The Longest Journey, was released around fifteen years ago
 The second, Dreamfall, was released eight years ago, and was riddled with cliffhangers that are only now being resolved
 I honestly couldn't tell you whether someone who hasn't played the earlier ones would enjoy this, so I won't bother
 This is a review for the original fans of the game
 The game is visually stunning
 It's not next-gen graphics or what have you, but it's modern and the love and care the team at Red Thread Games put into making Europolis feel like a 23rd century proto-dystopian city which still manages to look fantastic and somehow make me wistfully want to live in such a place
 The darkened, rain filled, sky with neon all over the place and an odd mix of 19th century, 21st century, and 23rd century architecture is fantastic, with neat little details
 You'll walk past a big modern skyscraper and see parts at the base which are crumbling and showing brick walls or the original iron supports
The voice acting and story is great
 The voice acting is phenomenal, and in all characters you can feel the genuine emotion and thoughts running through their dialogue
 Better than most AAA games
 The dialogue system they've set up should be the gold standard in games, where you can mouse over each of the answers and hear the protagonists thoughts on why that would be their answer
 We only see a small snippet of the story in the first episode (called a 'book'), but already you can see how the threads are beginning to weave together into a coherent whole
 And when I say a small snippet, I don't mean that it's short
 My playthrough lasted four hours (it flew by so fast, I could've sworn I wasn't playing more than an hour), so in total this is looking to be a 20 hour game of pure content, and not achievement hunting, or pointless side missions, or collectibles
 It's certainly got me itching for more
 There appears to be genuine choice and consequences as well, though again - it's still too early to tell before the other books are released
 That said, this is where one of my main concerns lies
 The game has the option to track your decisions, and the majority of decisions I made, so too did 80%+ of other players
 Hopefully they address this in future so there's more genuine choice, instead of obvious ones
The gameplay, sadly, is a bit lacking as well
 Which is understandable, this is essentially one of the old 1990s adventure games, transplanted and moderately reworked to fit a 3d setting and is a bit lost as a result, but there haven't been any sections that have been unenjoyable as a result, and it hasn't detracted from the games main strengths
 Fortunately, they haven't included combat (thus far) as they were forced to do for Dreamfall, but so far there have been none of the 'impossible puzzles' that were common in so many such games if only because there have been few puzzles full stop
I was in my early 20s when Dreamfall first came out, and it's probably the game that's moved me (emotionally
 spiritually
) more than any other game
 I say this with considerable relief, Dreamfall Chapters evokes the same kinds of feelings now that I had when first playing Dreamfall back in '06
 If you're a fan of the series, or of top-of-the-line storytelling, this is a must-buy

BeautyDreamfall chapters is the third and final(
) game in Dreamfall saga
 The game blends fantasy and sci-fi and it works very well
 You’ll be traveling through beautiful worlds in this adventure
Game plays from third person view, same as Dreamfall the longest journey but has less annoying things
Throughout the game you will have to make some choices which will change some things in future chapters
 I think that worked pretty well, some decisions have really big impact
 Gameplay is typical adventure style
 You run around, talk to people, collect some items, combine and use them to solve the puzzles and move on to the next location but you will do a lot of running back and forth too
 The puzzles are pretty good imo, some of them are hard to figure out
 Other part of the game plays like story driven adventure game where you must choose what to say
 You will play as three character
 Zoe Castillo, Kyan Alvane and Saga
This game shines in graphics department
 At the beginning when you go out in the city for the first time it looks stunning
 Characters could use some work, their faces are badly animated and look emotionless, but good voice acting makes up for it
 Character design in general is truly stunning
 But you need a powerful PC to play it on the highest settings
 Just to compare it performs worse than Witcher 3 on ultra + hairworks
Now I need to talk what I disliked
 I don’t like being lost
 Yeah yeah the maps are small but I still got lost, I wasted so much time on just finding the place I need to go
 Why in the future when people have holographic phones and intelligent flying robots making jokes there is no GPS
 I must rely on some stupid map in some spots in the city which is not very helpful
 In magical world, well there’s magic so you could just mark the locations on your magical map, but instead again I must rely on stupid map posters around the city
 After some time you get used to cities and in later chapters you already know where everything is located
Another annoying thing is auto saving

Warning: This not a review but a personal thought about the game
If you are looking for a review go check what other good people wrote :-)It was 7 or 8 years ago, I bought a (long gone now) PC Gaming Magazine called PC Master
In it, there was a game called Dreamfall : The Longest Journey
"The long awaited continuation to the Longest Journey" it said
I started playing it and that was it
I fell in love with the protagonists
Fell in love with the story
But the second game ended and I was full of questions
And then nothing
 Years passed
I finished school, I nearly finished my studies
 My father died
Life continued
And then I heard about a kickstarter campaign to create a third game to the series
That was one of my happiest days of my life
It reminded me of a simpler time
 And today, at long last I finished the story of this game
One chapter of my life closed
But the story has not ended
My life continues and this game reminded me that every decision I take, adds up to who I am
And to where I am going
Thank you Red Thread Games for creating an awesome finale to the series
 Thank you

EDIT: Book Three out
 As soon as a new episode comes out or something gets fixed, I will update
The bad:-God-awful optimization
 Constant fps drop in busy areas in both books, even on a high-end gaming PC
 Multiple people have these issues, which I repeatedly checked on
 In the two biggest areas in both episodes, the frame rate can drop to around 15fps
 Unacceptable, especially since those are the areas you are stuck in for the longest time
 Some people however can run and play the game fine, even on lower hardware, so it's a really weird issue, but it's still unacceptable to have these frame-rate issues on stronger machines
-What used to be occasional bugs has gone berserk with the release of episode two
 A big chunk of bugs, starting from even the menu that sometimes spades out and will just do what it wants
 There is a surprising lack of bug-testing and polish
-Very noticeable difference in quality and polish between models
 Some textures look really good, some look pretty damn dreadful
 Some character models are really good, some just fail to impress in comparison
-Animation, although sometimes relatively solid, at other times just seems very weird and especially walk cycles of some characters as well as how they rotate and/or talk seems very out of place
-Barely any explanation of the games that came before
 Newer players will most likely feel lost
The good:-The game looks really nice
 The art style is really good, it has a really nice range of colors, and some areas like the main city you explore in the first episode are insanely detailed and look alive and believable
-Really interesting characters, both from older games in the series as well as new ones
 Mostly good voice actors, although some sound a bit amateurish compared to others
-Relatively lengthy episodes, which can easily take around 3 to 4 hours per episode to finish
-The story continues right off of the last game and brings a slow but interesting new start to the series
-Good choices that actually change whole parts of the books (episodes) themselves and do offer an incentive to replay the game again
Dreamfall Chapters is almost a game that should be recommended to every fan of modern adventure games
 It is very slow paced, and it completely consists of walking around and talking with people, with little variation and very simple puzzles in between
 Taking all of that into consideration however, it does manage to (so far) tell a really interesting tale with fun and colorful characters, and has a beautiful art style as well as decent length and structure to it
 The only thing holding it back are the poor optimization and the bugs found every now and then (More so since book two)
 Even though players new to the series should have no big problems getting into the game, they might be left a bit confused at the start, and it does seem to target older fans more than anything
 Everyone who loved the last Dreamfall game should also be in for a treat with this one, anyone else who is new to the series should still risk a look if they are primarily interested in good story telling and a slow atmosphere-focused game with little action, but a lot of wonder to breathe in
 The lack of polish is the only thing keeping this game away from being as good as its predecessors
EDIT: Game still has huge performance issues and some bugs, but apparently the transition to the updated engine has helped for some people
 Stay tuned for how it turns out once that engine update is out of beta and/or we get episode 4

5/10genre : point and click adventure game in 3rd person+ high production values, beautiful art, great character models, especially Zoe is very well designed, stunning environments and worlds+ excellent voice acting, one of my favorite soundtracks, music is both epic and emotional+ the story is one of the best you can find in gaming, heart breaking and emotional, other times dark and mysterious - the writing and dialogues are better than most movies you have ever watched - you continue the story of the previous games in the series, following the journey of the 2 heroes in parallel worlds, of science and magic, reality and dreams, order and chaos+ gameplay wise it's a point and click adventure game in 3rd person - there are inventory based puzzles, puzzles are scarce but well thought , but the most important part of gameplay is observation and dialogues, where the choices have consequences, the path changes according to them and the balance is shifted - combining items in inventory or choosing the appropriate action when interacting are also basic gameplay functions+ pretty long for episodic game, the 2nd book i'm playing right now seems to be twice the size of the 1st one - replayability is also good since most people will replay it to see the alternate results of their actions- it would be a 10/10 game for me if it wasn't for the optimization issues and frame drops on large open areas, it has been fixed a bit since the release but it still needs some work- some animations could be better, but for an adventure game they are way above averagethe whole series of longest journey/dreamfall is very special to me, it just feels that playing these games and following the story is something more than just gaming - makes you feel things and maybe reconsider some things in your own life - ofcourse the game is recommended to everyone , although it would be wise to play at least the longest journey first to understand the worlds since despite the fact that there is a story recap it's not enough

It's not an easy task to review this game
 The biggest reason is that It absolutely shines in one area, but then fails to deliver an on par experience in other
 It's not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, but it has some not-so-minor flaws
First of all, it's a 3D point-and-click adventure game, which heavily depends on dialogues and choices
 This is the 3rd and final entry in The Longest Journey/Dreamfall Saga
 It's highly recommended to play the first two games before playing this one
 Most of the questions are finally answered and the story nicely wraps up in the end
 Dreamfall Chapters has quite a lot of fan service: many returning characters, dialogues that hint to events of previous games, familiar locations, few easter eggs, etc
Unfortunately, the game suffers from the same problem most of other games with multiple playable characters suffer: consistency
 Without telling too much, you'll be playing as two characters: Zoë and Kian
 While Zoë's story is mostly well-thought and consistent, Kian's leaves much to be desired
 Thankfully, the game brings out few surprises throughout the story and absolutely nails the ending
 Despite the choice-and-consequence structure of the game, there is really only one ending, but slightly different paths to get there, so playing at least twice is necessary to get the full picture
 In the very beginning of the game we are introduced to Zoë's powers, such as slowing down time, illuminating the environment and reading minds, but as soon as we're awake, all of those powers are gone
 Such a missed opportunity, the game would've been twice as good if they left her powers intact and gave us space to toy with it
 But we got what we got
Dreamfall Chapters is commonly compared with "Life is Strange", and rightfully so
 Both are point-and-click adventure games, are heavily based on dialogues, are episodic, have the choice-and-consequence structure, have female leads, etc
 But the main difference, however, is the consistency and brilliant writing of "Life is Strange" that Dreamfall Chapters simply lacks, which is a shame, since the first game "The Longest Journey" had the same brilliant writing as well
 Sometimes it's a 10/10 and you can't wait to watch the rest of the story unfold, but then things start to fall apart
 Fortunately, the final chapters more than make up for that
So should I recommend playing this game
 Yes I should
 Fans of the "The Longest Journey" would want to pick it up anyway, since this is where you'll get all your answers and a little bit on top of that as well
 Environments, character design and voice acting are superb and some of the "smaller characters" absolutely bring the joy and the spirit of the first game
 And the actual final scene of the game
 well, you're in for a treat, I can tell you that much
Edit: The review was written before "The Final Cut Edition" update
 After playing the updated version, I can say that the game is mostly the same
 A couple of new NPCs have been added, as well as some characters have gotten a visual upgrade, for better or for worse
 Also, a stealth quest has been moved from the main game to the playable "deleted scenes" section, although in the game the events of the said quest are still mentioned
 And an in-game map has been added for easier navigation
 All in all it's still the same game
 If you want to play the old version (or if the game keeps crashing during cutscenes) just untick the update in your game page, as it appears as a DLC and not as a regular update

Book One:It’s been almost a decade since the ending of the previous installment left us with an abrupt cliffhanger while making us eager for more ventures of Zoë Castillo
Ever since then, the future of Dreamfall was uncertain, with Funcom shifting its focus to online games before finally being salvaged with successful Kickstarter funding
 So how does the first episode hold up after all those production perils and is it a worthy successor of the Dreamfall series
For those of you who just tuned in and are unfamiliar with its predecessor (shame on you
), this story-driven adventure game takes place in two worlds, technology-infused Stark and magical land of Arcadia
 Our heroine Zoë will start the journey by investigating the disappearance of her ex-boyfriend Reza Temiz, before unraveling a global conspiracy led by Japanese toy manufacturer WATIcorp
 As you would assume, their real focus is far from making toys for kids and more on delivering a new, vastly damaging lucid dreaming drug to the market, something which will have dire consequences on both Stark and Arcadia in later events
 Slowly you are introduced to new characters and find yourself jumping between worlds following the WATIcorp trail before realizing how small of a cog in a story they are and that much more is at stake
The story picks up several months after the Longest Journey ending with Zoë still being stuck in a Storytime limbo
 It is an otherworldly realm now swarming with Dreamachine addicts and other trapped souls
 Following the gloomy finale in The Longest Journey, WATIcorp has gained even more power and influence by openly selling dream consoles from previous game labeled now as “Dreamachines”, a device marketed as a tool for enhancing lucid dreaming while making most of its users highly addicted in the process
 You will get to witness that side effect firsthand while roaming through the streets of Europolis later, tripping over many of its comatose inhabitants in street corners
At first, you will get a glimpse of storyline by helping other trapped souls and Dreamachine addicts in Storytime and later reconciling with our old mysterious friend Vagabond, who will inform us that both of the worlds of Stark and Arcadia are in great danger and Zoë’s help is needed once again
 Before finding ourselves in Stark again, the game will briefly reunite us with another familiar face Kian Alvane, where we also learn more about his fate after the events in The Longest Journey
 Along with Zoë, he is one of the three playable characters in the first episode of Chapters (I don’t want to spoil who the third protagonist is but let’s just say it is someone who I found quite charming and took me completely by surprise)
Seeing how this episode mostly acts as something to entice new and returning players of Dreamfall, I can understand the lack of challenging puzzles in game for the most part
 Usually you will find yourself merely repeating what the game asks of you or just combining items on few occasions but sadly that’s all there is to it
 Luckily, that would probably be the only flaw that you might see in game, since everything else has been polished to the perfection
 From the soothing scenery of Storytime (but only if we ignore that nightmarish wardrobe with slimy tentacles coming out of it) to the luminous and lively streets of Europolis – it is quite clear at first glance to where most of the love for the game went
Some older fans of Dreamfall might be displeased with the new voice actor for Zoë Castillo but frankly, that is something you might notice if you finished the previous game in the series only recently
 And I assure you, beside that minor change the game does not hold back when it comes to delivering some quality voice acting
 I can safely say that now we have a strong contender for one of the most adorable voices for a repair bot in video games ever
Speaking of Europolis, it is one of the few locations in first episode where you will spend most of the time and for a good reason
 The whole city is gorgeously designed,
highlighting the contrast between rich and poor on every corner
 One moment you might find yourself gazing at the beautiful skyscrapers in Sonnenschein Plaza before stumbling over one of the many slumbering Dreamachine junkies
 And let’s not forget our old pals from EYE, a global police agency who will watch over your every move, creeping on you and thousands of other citizens in Europolis
In most games and movies, I always found the inclusion of lens flare nothing more than a cheap gimmick and what developers tend to incorporate when they run out of any other creative additions
 But in this context, it is a feature which works incredibly well and adds something new to the whole dreamy (wink wink) undertone of the game
 Dreamfall Chapters also does a remarkable job in pushing the capabilities of Unity engine to the sheer limits
 Often i found myself going on short breaks from whatever game was asking me to do and decide to take an excessive number of screenshots instead
 Even some seemingly bland section such as medieval prison complex makes up for an interesting and enjoyable location in the game
Another thing on what developers focused more in Dreamfall Chapters are choices
 Just like in a certain Telltale’s post-apocalyptic zombie game, you will now be notified with a large text prompt whenever you make an important decision while having an option to see the percentage of selected choices from other players online which might significantly help you in making a decision
 The real question here is will these decisions result in greater variety, establishing a different image of the world for each player or are they nothing more than templates merely guiding us to one of the few prearranged endings of the game
 For now, I believe it could go either way
 One of my decisions in prologue during the second playthrough resulted in having a completely different job and doing business with a new key NPC once I found myself in Europolis again
 Every other choice implied we might only see possible results of them in upcoming episode(s), especially when I played with Kian Alvane
 To be fair, I am still a bit skeptical on how my choice between pork sausages or cheese soup for boyfriend’s dinner might leave a significant impact on the future of both worlds but i guess only time will tell
Abstract:Despite the serious lack of challenge in puzzles and relatively short length (although this point might prove invalid later with the release of new episodes), Dreamfall Chapters is quite deserving of your attention
 With its superb voice acting, stunning locations and captivating story which will only leave you counting down the weeks for the release of the next episode, I will say we have a rewarding sequel for the Longest Journey
 After an intro as good as this one, it’s hard not to expect only the best from the next episode
8/10

I like Dreamfall Chapters, but will you enjoy Dreamfall Chapters
Some things to consider:This is the third game in a series that started with The Longest Journey (2000) and continued in Dreamfall: The Longest Journey (2006)
The Longest Journey is a wonderful point-and-click adventure game classic: if you like adventure games and haven’t played it yet I highly suggest you do so
Dreamfall (there’s no way around it) just isn’t as good
This is not to say that it’s unplayable or that I didn’t enjoy it at all, but as a stand-alone game I wouldn’t whole-heartedly recommend it
In order to really appreciate Chapters you don’t need to have played TLJ, but, unfortunately, I really think you do need to play the original Dreamfall first
Among other things, Dreamfall ends on a cliffhanger and Chapters more-or-less picks up where it left off
Chapters takes places in a rich game world revealed and developed over the course of the series
This applies both to Stark, a vaguely cyberpunk version of our world set in the near future, and Arcadia, a fantasy world that’s the flipside of the coin—where magic rules rather than technology
I think the legacy of TLJ and Dreamfall is both a blessing and a curse for the creators of Chapters
As I said, they started off with a storied, well-developed setting; but, at the same time, Chapters needed to continue Dreamfall’s story—a story that had arrived at a critical moment where sinister forces are on the verge (we’re talking like seconds) of upsetting the balance/taking over the world/ripping everything apart
Marcuria, the city we visit in Arcadia, is under military occupation and the invaders (who have their own interesting culture) want to stamp out magic and replace it with their steampunk technology (and the purpose of some of these machines is very suspect)
Meanwhile, in Stark, an entertainment device called the Dream Machine has become ubiquitous and people are using it to escape the troubles of reality and spend more and more time in a virtual dream world
From the very beginning one feels that a dramatic climax is imminent
Chapters is a story rich game (and it’s an interesting story), but sometimes story rich means gameplay poor
The episodes where you have control over the main character and get to move around solving puzzles are unevenly interspersed between long conversations and cut scenes
This is, to some extent, made up for by the fact that you’re sometimes given a chance to make choices which will affect what happens later in the game (Chapters sort of beats you over the head with “This choice will matter
” although there’s an option to turn those messages off)
So all-in-all, I think you’ll risk being lost or not invested enough in the characters if you play Chapters without playing Dreamfall and there are parts where the game is light on interactivity and heavy on dialogue and exposition, but the story is an interesting one and in other places gameplay and story are balanced enough to satisfy

[POSSIBLE SPOILERS]As with many of you, I have many fond memories about the previous two games in this saga, so I really tried to like this game
But what have appealed to me the most in the previous games in the series are notably absent in Dreamfall Chapters: the characters
This series felt so good because it had such strong, yet very believable characters like April and Zoe, who looked so different from typical super heroines of other games at that time
We could easily relate to them because they were just ordinary people, like us, at the begining of their journey
 Both of the games allowed us plenty of time to familiarize with the characters, and showed us many little details about their personal lives, like going to school, hanging out with a boyfriend, and etc before revealing to us how their fate would change all that in an instant, which made it much more believable and astonishing at the same time
However, with Dreamfall Chapters everything has changed
Now all the important characters start with a big mission from the start, and as the story picks up the pace, there's no time to spend on those mundane little details which are, however, crucial in making them really believable
It feels especially bad for Kian, who had limited appearances in the previous game but has been given much bigger role in Dreamfall Chapters, though without sufficient details to make him feel as familiar to us as Zoe or April in the previous games
And his story almost feels like the writer couldn't decide what to do with him, as his personality seems to fluctuate from one moment to another
 In the previous game, he made various comments about how hot magical womens look in Marcuria, or saying that how deep an impression he had when he met April for the first time
Even in an earlier episode of Dreamfall Chapters, he looked to be such a guy who has led an abstinent lifestyle his whole life and he just begins to open up his eyes to the other sex, when he
awkwardly allows himself to be warmed up to Enu, for instance
But only a moment later, he just declares he's a gay so he doesn't feel anything about women at all
Earlier on, he said he doesn't drink at all, and later remarked that beer was not so bad
 And in the final episode, he's going about commenting how he can't stand a Northern wine brand compared to ones at home, as if he was some kind of a somelier himself
At the beginning, he was presented as a serious, or even a blunt kind of a person, which is quite understandable considering his supposed background
 But too many times, his character is abused to fill mandatory share of witty remarks which players might expect from an adventure game
 But unfortunately, this series isn't The Monkey Island, and him not Guybrush Threepwood (or April Ryan, for that matter, as she had quite a few hilarious lines in TLJ)
It's very unfortunate that we have such a fluctuating and underdeveloped character as one of the main protagonist in this game, as he deprives us much time we could spend enjoying more familiar characters, like Zoe or even Crow, and he's not alone in that regard because they have introduced many other new characters in Dreamfall Chapters, who feel even more shallow and underdeveloped than the character of Kian
Enu, for example, seemed she could become one of the more memorable characters in the series, but her potential completely wasted as the story moves on
 The same can be said of the most other characters as well, as Dreamfall Chapters is filled with such cheap stereo types, like a girl who have a crush with the one who saved her, or a caricature of Hitler, for instance
Even those intriguing characters from the previous games turned into cardboard villains in Dreamfall Chapters, like Brian Westhouse suddenly starting to play a Sith Lord impersonation (and with that signature 'bad guy' mask, and force choke ability), or Helena Chang becoming a typical 'mad scientist' we've already seen gazillion times in movies or other games
A few characters which could have been memorable, like Shitbot, Bip, or even Mira are quickly swept aside after their brief appearances, probably to make rooms for what developers thought to be more important, like some out of place political agenda, for instance
You will keep hearing extremely exaggerated and obviously ridiculous racial hate speeches from a caricature character of Hitler all through the game, until thankfully he burns himself out in the last episode
And a cold blooded warrior in a semi-Medieval fantasy world suddenly reveals his most liberal mind for the one who wanted to kill so badly, once the target of his revenge begins a long tirade about how it is to live as a sexual minority
Probably to emphasize the importance of social diversity, people in a magical world of Marcuria show more ethnic diversity than that of modern European countries, but somehow they can't stand to live with those have blue skins
 It makes them even more unbelievable as their Japanese, German, or many such contemporary regional names, as the developers decided to name them after Kickstarter backers, apparently
Granted, the plot of Dreamfall Chapters is quite complex compared to others, as it involves travelling across the multiverse and even shaping the reality itself by dreaming
 But without strong characters to move the story going, and without sufficient attention to details, it simply feels like a cheap sci-fi comic from an artist with too big an ambition, and not enough skill to realize it
 (And perhaps, the notably bad quality of animations and, in some cases, that of graphical effects have contributed much to that feeling
)Understandably, the high points in Dreamfall Chapters, at least for me, were those moments when I could get a glimpse of old, familiar characters like Crow, April, or even Wonkers
Thinking about those beloved characters made me realize that, however may I have been disappointed in Dreamfall Chapters, it's probably because I had such high hopes for the sequel of such a great series - a series which had so many memorable moments which haven't faded a bit, even with the disaster of this game
And it also reminded me that how hard they must have worked to create those games, and even in the times of financial difficulties, how they remembered the promise they made, to continue and conclude the story of April and Zoe someday
 And actually kept their words
For that, I really feel grateful for all who have been involved in making of this series
 Even though I'm utterly disappointed what it became in the end, I'm now fully aware all my fond memories of the series wouldn't have existed without their efforts
I suppose I'll play TLJ and DF again someday, when the bad taste DFC has left me fades away
 And then, I'll probably stop playing at what I believe to be the emotional climax of the series, which was the moment when Zoe meets Faith in TLJ: Dreamfall
 And when the credit rolls, I'll try to pretend I didn't know how the story ends and Zoe and April had so much interesting journey left in them beyonds that big cliff hanger

I played Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and completely fell in love with that game, so I obviously had to get the sequel
 I love these games with all my heart- favorite series of all time- but I found myself a bit bored at times in chapters 1-3
 Do NOT let this discourage you
 In chapter 4, I felt all the flood of emotions from Dreamfall flood back and wrench my heart
 Chapter 4 alone makes this game entirely worth playing, along with the in-depth characters, originality, and beauty throughout the entire game
 I cried several times
 Also, the decisions I've made warrant another playthrough in hopes that mistakes will be fixed
 In Telltale games, it appears to me that the game is decided no matter what choice you make because your choices never affect the NEXT chapter
 Not so will Dreamfall: Chapters
 Each decision you make will have an impact on future gameplay
 I cannot wait for chapter 5 to see what I will regret and cry over next

Have you ever wanted to set up hidden cameras in the girls locker room when you were in high school
 Of course you did
 We all did
 Well, you can't do that in Beholder, and even if you could, it wouldn't be very sexy since every character is a black amporphous blob
 Beholder puts you in the role of a landlord hired by the state (that seems to resemble Russia an awful lot, which is fine, it's fiction) that tasks you with spying on your tenants, keeping tabs on them, making note of suspicious things they do, characteristics, laws they may be breaking, etc, and then reporting them to the state to (probably) be taken away somewhere and locked away or mysteriously committing suicide
 I don't know, I haven't gotten that far yet
 I put off getting this game for a while

THIS REVIEW WAS MADE BEFORE THE RELEASE OF THE DLC****I completed all the achievements and done all the stuff
 I would like to praise the art, it's really great
 I want another game from Warp Lamp done just like that, that's gonna be insta buy for me
I want to talk about the lack of testing at this game
 It seems like the testers didn't even play the game or just said: Not gonna work on that
There is a stage at the game when your daughter gets ill and you gotta buy an aspirin for her
 Then she needs special antibiotics for 20 000 and your son needs 15 000 for university
 After you do that your daughter needs another special drug for 15 000, on top of that your wife wants like 2 000 to buy groceries and stuff
 Ridiculous ammounts that aren't possible to achieve
 But you can do that just by simply letting the quests be, because you are the one who collects quests and if you simply don't talk to your wife about your daughter's illness, she simply isn't ill
 That also applies to your son's university fee and all the other quests that function like that, you can ignore your wife even before your daughter need that aspirin
 So you can wait to the near end of the game where you receive tons of money
 The key to get through these stages is just to ignore your family
It just ruins the whole immersion of the game, I would have no problem if they have given you a limited time to talk with your wife/son about that problem with need of lower prices, or they should atleast give you more quests to get that money
 Nothing, it's just lacking any proper testing
And that's not all, if your family dies
 NPCs still mention your family, offering quests that earn you money- to save your family
 You agree because of your family
 BUT YOU HAVE NO FAMILY
That's just sad
These are really big problems
 I love the game, the good ending is absolutely adorable, music is great, quests are good with a lot of endings, and the artstyle
But I will still give the game a NO
Please guys, if you test your game, test it right and spend your time doing that and repairing that game
TL;DRGreat concept, fantastic art, great music, lack of testing which leads to messing the whole game up
Update: Remembered about more spicy stuff
There is sometimes a case when a tenant wants to kill you
 How does he do that
You come to him, talk, he kills you, if you don't talk to him, he doesn't
Some woman wants to offer you a tea that's poisoned to kill you
 It goes like this:She offers you a delicious tea, you can say yes or no
 I said yes (achievement for that)

God damn, you guys
So I just bought this game off the Humble Indie Bundle, and the artwork kinda managed to pull me in immediately
 I didn't read any reviews, not even the steam store description
 I decided to just boot it up and see what it's about
 What followed was a complete emotional rollercoaster
 The game started off well enough, I went into my usual routine of poking at the gameplay mechanics to see what my options are, and maximizing my profits, all the while still trying to be the good guy as much as possible
 I thought I was doing pretty well, some fine gentleman was being manipulated and I decided to help him
 My son needed a lot of money for school but I got by
 Even when my daughter got sick, I had already managed to find a doctor beforehand to help her
 And then he died
 Murdered
What followed was a cruel torment
 I started doing everything I could for money
 I stopped paying bills
 I stole from my tenants
 But it was never enough
 A couple of hours later I was just completely engrossed in the game
 My heart broke a little every time I passed by my coughing little daughter
 I resented the woman who murdered the doctor, who was still living with us because I had sold any evidence I had against her earlier
 I saw the money leaving me as fast as I could gather it, and all that time the only thing I could think of was how to save my little girl
God damn, you guys

Beholder is an interesting game that pretends to be more than it is
 A simple gimmick of spying on people and surveillance, but with a minimum of actual interaction to go with it
 After the first few hours, most of the game is about finding out what the developers planned for you to do and then following the story they wanted to tell you
 If you wanted to just spy on people and have a few renters to keep an eye on, you're in the wrong place
Mostly, Beholder tells you a story
 And this story demands that you are a dou-che to everyone and extort them until they have no money left to give you before forcibly evicting them so you can steal whats left of their stuff and pawn it for spare cash
 If you do not do this, you will either be given a game over or your family will die
 Multiple times at that
 In my one playthrough so far my son has died three times and my wife twice, forcing me to pay for five funerals for two dead family members
 Through all this, people still threaten me with hurting my family which already died, and there is a good chance that if I don't go along with it they will dig up the body just so they can kill it again and force me to pay for another funeral
There is not a lot of choice to be had, there are a few stories, and you have to just follow them
 Some stories appear to have multiple paths, but in the end only a few seem to have any effect on others at all
 Coupled by a world that appears to be intended seriously but comes off as a satirical joke where people try to one up eachother on cynicism, dialogue options being vague ("Tell me" -200 reputation- Could mean threatening them, right
 Nope
 It's asking nicely
) and the fact that you don't really get to do that much for most of the time except wait for people to leave so you can rummage through their stuff makes this more suited to something you can watch someone else play rather than something you can play yourself
Aside from all this, I've found there to be some serious issues with Beholder, family members dying multiple times, the game not recognizing them as dead, the complete lack of manual saving, barely functional tutorial that doesn't even explain the basics right and very harsh penalties on what is essentially trial and error gameplay makes for a sadly unsatisfying experience where I found myself deciding that I was done and got the good ending after a bomb killed everyone in the building
Graphics are simple, but they are pretty good at what they do
 Renters are different enough to distinguish between them and the music works well for most of the game
 I don't think it was entirely necessary to hear the basement stove turned on nearly all the time though
There are good things to be had in Beholder, but it feels very much like they had a story and a single game mechanic planned, and then just jammed them together hoping it would work
It doesn't, or not very well at least
 The start of the game is fairly well worked out and entertaining, but then after that it mainly becomes a hunt for finding the right thing or dialogue you're expected to find while at the same time bringing in renters just to extort them for money
 A routine that encourages you to not care about any of your renters, your family, or the game as a whole
 And all throughout this everyone will stress how everything is bad without ever having anything good happen
The game claims your choices have consequences, but the only choices and consequences are "Do as we intended for you to do or you and/or your family will die" with nearly no room for error
 Even if you accept the loss of one or two family members you do not have many meaningful choices, seemingly by design
Take that as you will, but I can not in good conscience recommend it to anyone but those who are the most hyped about spying on people while also being a fan of passive gameplay

In this interconnected world where every political, international, and minuscule thing is shared via thirty different social media accounts, it really isn't a surprise that privacy and confidentiality are a hot topic
 You can't turn on the news without hearing about leaked information, deleted E-mails, and how big is somebody's butt is these days
 So it's interesting when a game developer takes these issues head on and translates them into a video game
 Beholder has drawn quite a bit of attention because of this and it makes one think about their own privacy; how external forces can affect that
Beholder is a game about spying on your neighbors
 Not because you're a creep, but because your government is asking you to do it for the good of the country
 One can see how this already translates into reality in rather terrifying ways
 Now this game comes along in the same vein as other games that have had similar political or social commentary, such as Papers, Please or This War of Mine
 The trick about these games, at least for me, is that while the message comes through loud and clear that these games still retain a level of enjoyment and don't get preachy to the point where I wanna kill myself
 Looking at you, This War of Mine
Beholder, I am happy to say does accomplish this using a whimsical, if not sinister, art style and fairly easy to grasp mechanics
 The story/scope of the game all takes place in an apartment building and between its tenants
 Espionage is key and knowing how to use that information you've gathered effectively is the name of the game
Tackling the story first, Beholder has MANY possible endings, multiple ways to handle a situation and it lends itself to replay and seeing what new outcomes you can get
 I would love to say I got all of the endings, but that would take quite a while
 You can play the game as a completely evil bastige, who cares for nothing but himself and his family
 This is by far the easiest route to be honest
 However, being a good person is possible
 It's difficult and will have a cost of either money or possibly the life of someone you love
 The chips are always stacked against you and the house usually always wins
 This is a mindset that is extremely important to bear in mind as you play Beholder
 You are battling your morality and the clock
To overcome the odds, you are going to have get your hands dirty
 Beholder plays with its monotone colors for a reason
 Your actions are going to end being shades of grey
 Blackmail your neighbor to save your daughter
 Steal an illegal firearm to protect a young woman
 These are questions you will have to answer quickly and that have immediate consequences
 This is Beholder's greatest strength as a game
 It mixes hundreds of possible narratives and decisions seamlessly with something new to discover around every corner
From a functionality standpoint Beholder is on the simple side
(No controller required) You left click with the environment to plant cameras or evidence
 Also to discover information about your tenants and make reports
 There are two sources of income in the game, one is straight up cash, the main resource, and credibility which allows you purchase more cameras and get out of a jam in certain events/conversations
 The game has a decent tutorial that teaches you the basics, but the rest is kind of learned as you go
 The most important thing I felt the tutorial ignored was the placement of items inside of other containers
 This is vitally important as framing your tenants is key way to make money or get rid of somebody
While there are many facets that require a bit to wrap your head around, once you do figure it all out it becomes easier to rig the system in your favor
 The save system also makes is rather easy to abuse as you can reload often to a previous point if you screw up
 Not saying that I did, but the temptation was there on occasion
 Aside from that, which is hardly a gripe, Beholder is extremely well put together
 I didn't run into any bugs and all the mechanics are easy to understand
One thing I will say is that the games difficulty can be called into question
 Your main problem is never having enough money to accomplish some story related issue
 Gameplay itself never really challenges you in the same way something like Papers Please did, where a keen eye was pivotal as more scrutiny was involved with passing people
 Beholder is far more decision and story based
 Nothing is wrong with that but felt it should be noted
 The game does have two game modes, including one that reduces the amount of money/credit you get per action/blackmail etc
 This just stacks the chips higher against you and makes decisions more stressful but doesn't change the overall difficulty of the game
The art style of Beholder is an absolute treat
 The game needed to capture many emotions using its black and white sprites, from terror to being adorable
 I was utterly amazed by the kaleidoscope of
emotions/tone of the game could shift through
 From being stabbed, to giving your wife a candy bar, and an entire range in between
 The eyes of each sprite are used effectively and it just spoke to me, the way the characters were all unique in this dreadful totalitarian setting
 The apartment itself is drawn well and serves as a nice back drop
 It comes off very dreary so it never really caught my attention too much
 There are also well illustrated cut scenes that are shown occasionally
 While there are plenty of gloomy events in the game such as your daughter dying or tenants leaving penniless, the game rides a fine line but never forgets that its still a game, which to me is as important as the subject matter
One area I wasn't a huge fan of was the music which does come off very gritty and low key
 It matches the over all theme of the game but it just isn't all that pleasant on the ears
 It may not be meant to in all honesty, but I found myself just turning it down and focusing on completing tasks
 There are some other areas that do well though, sound effects are very well done and there is even a little bit of voice acting that is delivered quite well
Overall game length is going to vary from game to game due to the branching narrative but the game has high replayability as I mentioned earlier
 You're looking at somewhere between two to four hours for one game session
 I would say and that all really depends on your familiarity with the mechanics and how you want events to play out
 There is a fast forward that does make the game go a hell of lot faster that I would use on occasion
 So that may drastically alter your game length as well
Beholder is a game that makes you think about the ramifications of your decisions
 It doesn't get preachy but it doesn't shy away from its subject matter
 The game retains its level of fun from beginning to end and I found it to be a very satisfying experience
 Games that look to deliver a message on social/political commentary can go wrong in many ways, but Beholder avoids all the pitfalls in style
 I believe that the developer was very innovative in the way they tackled this subject matter and I hope to see more games like this in the future
 Games are after al,87ul another form of freedom of speech, one that we must not take for granted
At the low price of $9
99, Beholder is quite a steal if you are looking for a game that has a message but does things in its own way
 With Steam cards, achievements and the developer putting out more updates and patches to tackle any issues that arise, I can easily recommend this title
 So check the game out, in the meantime I am going to put on my tinfoil hat and check for bugs
They are always watching

I am simple spy working for glorious motherland
 Woman was not who she said she was, told me she is running away for love
 I say okay, believe her
 My family takes care of her
 We make wedding veil for her
 Her future husband is man who is caring for my sick daughter
She kills man, leaving my daughter with no help, and laughs in my face
 Says I can't prove it was her without revealing I knew she was filthy liar
So, I buy illegal item and plant it in her apartment, then report illegal item
 Cops come, and woman is sent to jail to rot for dooming my child

Okay, so, in the first 2 hours of the game that i've played, the following happened: - My daughter died of Pneumonia after i couldn't get 30000$; - My wife and son were arrested because they were reading books; - One of my occupants wanted a wife
 I went to get one for him

There's a story behind it
 A really good one, but dosen't really appear unless you play it a billion times
It's on android as well, which I did most of my experimenting before coming here to quickly beat it
 Good soundrack and characters, I gotta say it's a solid 8/10
 Sure it feels like there are things that go on repeat, but it wasn't till then I started noticing patterns and whatnot
 In fact, RNG is not much of a contribuitng factor at all
 Certain things actually do/lead to certain events and whatnot
 It's a good game and very meaningful with a genrous amount of warm fuzzyness at the end
 (If you get the correct ending)

Reigns is a relatively fun game
 It's not without it's flaws, but it has it's moments
 I think the problem is that it feels kind of repetitive, there are apparently about 1000 cards to swipe through in total
 Having played for about 90 minutes, I experienced just under half of them
 A lot of the cards you read will be the same card you've read several times over, and while the game's progress seemed to be moving along at a decent pace for the first 40 or so minutes, it hits a plateau around then
 What I mean by this is that you end up with a checklist of goals that you're supposed to accomplish to progress the story and unlock new cards
 You end up waiting for well over a hundred years in game for the corresponding card to appear, and there's little or no noticeable reward for performing the tasks to complete your goals
 The other aspect of the gameplay is the resources management, which is seemingly nonsensical, but it serves it's function adequately
 You need to balance your citizens, the power of the church, your treasury and your military powers to keep everybody happy
 For example, your Bishop may ask to buy executive power, causing your religious and monetary spheres to rise
 If any of these spheres raise too high or drop too low, your monarch will die and your heir will take over at the beginning of the next year
 It's worth mentioning that you will automatically have an heir, so you can die during your first year in power with no consequences
 Each new year is marked by a new event, represented by a card
 You control the response to the events of the card by clicking to the left or right of the card
 Sometimes, you trigger an event with a side effect like "Money is perpetually rising on a timer which operates opposite and contrary to the rest of the game's mechanics to make life more difficult"
 The game is structured in such a way, typically, that you can take as long as you'd like to decide which reaction you'd like to pick in response to each card drawn, and the timer implemented by these events makes it damn near impossible to form even a rudimentary strategy
 Especially because of the way the UI is laid out, which makes it wholly unclear whether your decision will lead to increases or decreases in each sphere
 Taking into consideration that this game is only $3, these things are likely forgiveable
 It's got a nice art style and minimally irritating audio
 It's a good time killer for a few hours, maybe more if you really enjoy the mechanics of the game
 I guess I'll give it a cautious recommendation
 Worth a try when it's on sale

Tinder meets ruling a kingdom
 It's an interesting game mechanics, probably more suited to mobile in all honesty
 However, the stories and characters are interesting
 The ambiance is well tuned
 The art design is consistent and unique (in regards to everything else out on the market) and easy on the eyes
The combat is simplistic and aimed to work with the basic mechanics that they've attached of swiping left/right in a turn-based way
 It works for the game and it does feel satisfying when you win
If you're going to play this, and I recommend that you do, play it in small bursts
 Don't try and complete the story or entire dynasties in long sessions
 The games mechanics become very tired and you'll see a lot of the same cards over and over again
Play it in 10-30 minute bursts and you'll get an ongoing and pleasant experience

Manage the world's most unstable medieval kingdom with a collection of incompetent traitorous and corrupt advisors, enemy nations and raiders all around
 A kingdom so mismanaged that if you disappear for a few years it'll be run to the ground on its own
 Also note the variety of ways you can die
 Get killed by usurpers, relatives, monsters, diseases, fanatics, oligarchs, your own hubris

DO NOT PLAY THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE PLAYED 999 AND VIRTUE'S LAST REWARD ALREADYWithin minutes of starting the game there were several things talked about that relate to the two of them
 Unless you have played them, you WILL end up simply confused and lost

Its pointless for me to write a review saying to buy it or not to buy it
If you played the previous installments, I don't think anything I could possibly say could dissuade you from buying this one
If you have not played Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors and you have not played Virtue's Last Reward, go play those first and then you will fall into the former category
Posted: 30 June, 2016
The best series of all time but have to give a warning like many others have said on every review:PLAY 9 HOURS 9 PERSON 9 DOORS FIRST THEN VIRTUES LAST REWARD IN THAT ORDER
 DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THE PREVIOUS TITLES OR A HUGE PORTION OF THE EXPERIENCE WILL BE LOST
 IN ADDITION THERE WERE HINTS GIVING BY THE DIRECTOR THAT THE PREVIOUS TITLES WILL BE RELEASED ON STEAM, SO BE PATIENT OR FIND A WAY TO PLAY THE OTHERS
 ALSO DO NOT WIKI THE GAME AT ALL BECAUSE HUGE SPOILERS ARE THERE EVEN IN THE FRONT PAGE
 AVOID THE WIKIS
 Moving on, there is no story that is epic like this series on PC at all
 It's the best story period and not much details can be given because it will be a spoiler
 This is what many people will tell you about the Zero escape series when trying to explain it to you
 However all we can say is that the game starts out basically as you being a participant in a game with other people
 There are decision making events which effect actual outcome and you will get different experiences from each choices
 There are puzzles as well which play a huge role to the story
 You'll learn theoritcal ideas and you will learn knowledge which are used in real life work environments
 At first, it starts out simple then the story just explodes and branches out in to braingasm of events in which you won't get the experience in any other games
 This one expands on the previous title in a much bigger way you won't expect if you played the previous titles honestly
 The first title is about 5 to 9 hours if your only going for the story which is still good enough, second title Virtues Last reward increases to 40 hours and finally this one goes beyond that in terms of elements
 I own both the VIta version and PC in support of the team that made the series and trust me I don't buy multiple port versions of a game if it sucks
 This game has done an excellent job on the PC side on it's first try as well
The Series has won awards in the past for best story so please consider playing the previous titles in order before playing this game without looking at the plot
 It's 100% worth it
Posted: 2 June
Zero Time Dillema is a good game, but its the weakest of the entire 999 series
First off, the puzzle design could use some improvement
 The escape rooms have a lot of repeat puzzles
 One type of puzzle re-appeared in 4 different escape rooms
 It isn't even a particulary interesting type of puzzle
 Granted, the 999 series has always had repeated puzzles, but usually you would only see repeats in the final escape room
 The real cool feature of hard mode versions of puzzles from VLR is also missing from the game
 It was cool to be able to solve a puzzle multiple ways
 The game also basically gives you the solution to some puzzles if you don't solve it right away
 This is really annoying because some puzzles require you to look at an item in your inventory before you solve it
 The game still has some interesting puzzles though
How the game handles some of its characters is also lacking
 Compared to the rest of the series, the character design is really low-key
 Part of the 999 series' appeal is the flashy characters, Due to the nature of how the game works, some really unatural characterization is forced on an important character
 It doesn't really add up with the character's history, despite how they try and justify it
 Furthermore, the character is even made ignorant of knowledge they should know at this point
 It also doesn't help that some of the animation is really low quality, so you get some wonky facial expressions from some characters
Thankfully, the story still has the signature craziness of a 999 game
 It certainly goes places
 Although it also unfortunately fails to resolve some hanging plot threads from VLR
 It does leave an opening for a sequel, but to be honest, I'd be happy if the series ends with this game
Overall, I did end up enjoying the game a fair amount, so if your a fan of the previous 2 games you should definitely pick it up
Posted: 6 July, 2016
This comes from playing the first two games in the franchise and thouroughly enjoying them
To begin, this isn't a horrible game in and of itself
But it suffers, struggling in almost every area
1
 New people are going to have an impossible time getting in to it
It starts slow out of the gate
just trying to catch up newbies with a massive information dump, and it's going to create a lot of head scratching
There is some dense dialogue about premises from the previous games that is hard to swallow
Its still possible to approach for new players, but I can't possibly see it being as enjoyable for the first hour
2
For fans of the series, there are some red flags for you as well
The presentation completely restricts the narrative and makes no sense
Unlike the previous two games, this isn't strictly a choose your own adeventure story
By adopting what the game calls "fragments", you basically play only snippets of a story, before jumping to another line of the story
Your choices don't result in a feeling of accomplishment or weight
Instead of encouraging choices about how to progress through the story, its really just an inane system where you put check marks in a box as you move along
3
And the story
Don't get these games wrong
There are always puzzles, but the puzzles always play fiddle to the story
There aren't very many and they aren't hard enough to challenge someone who likes puzzle games
In the past, this has been okay because the story was so good
But the story is lacking in this installment
The first half is addled by the presentation like I've already said
The elements are all present to be interesting, but its a slog; however, the third quarter is where this game shines
For a brief moment, it gains some direction and feels like its headed somewhere big, and the excitement is there
But then
Without spoiling anything
The home stretch of the story is the most ridiculous series of deus-ex-machinas that I have ever seen
There are huge concepts that are introduced at the very end with basically zero set up, and, somehow, even less explanation
Its borderline offensive how stupid it becomes
In summary
There are moments of greatness, but most of it is a slog
The puzzles are fine and the story is a slow build that nose dives just as it becomes satisfying
Players of the first two will inevitably play this, but it won't live up to the previous installments
New players
Just go play the first two games (999 and VLR) if you can get your hands on them
They are fantastic
I was excited to play this game
 I loved the first two
But I am extremely conflicted about this one
It's not a bad game, but its not good

Before you read my review, there are a few things you should note:- This game is very text-heavy and you will be doing a lot of reading and listening
- This game is rated 18 for a reason; topics and imagery that could make people feel uneasy will appear in this game
- You're probably going to need a notepad and pen If all of the above things bother you, you probably won't like this game
 If you're alright with these, then continue to read
 Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma - Overview9 people wake up to find themselves trapped in an underground facility
 They're told the only way they can escape is for six of them to die
 In addition to this, they'll be put to sleep and lose their memories every 90 minutes
 You're also told a story about a woman going for a run
 She comes to a fork in the path, however this time she takes the left path rather than the right path like she usually does, because there was a snail
 Two hours later, she's murdered
 In ZTD, you become the snail
 (Metaphorically of course, but that would be pretty cool
) Zero Time Dilemma is the third (and final) game in the Zero Escape series, straight out of the mind of the wonderful Kotaro Uchikoshi
 The game features a non-linear narrative (meaning you don't have to play the game in a set order), and depends on your choices and their consequences to advance
 There are essentially three parts to ZTD: cutscenes/story, Escape Rooms, and player's decision
 Like I stated above, there is a lot of reading to do as the cutscenes feature heavily between different segments of the game, and (depending on how adept you are at puzzles) you're probably going to spend most of your time watching these cutscenes
 The escape rooms are the majority of the gameplay - you'll be placed in a variety of different rooms, and must use your own knowledge and the items and clues provided for you to make your escape
 Players decision is exactly what it sounds like, similar to the choice aspect of Life Is Strange, but with a bit more of a twist - the choices you make are weighted on a percentage chance, so they may end well or they may end horrifically
Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma - My ThoughtsI have played the entire Zero Escape series (albeit in the wrong order - oops), and I love them
 As a puzzle fan and an avid reader, the series is perfect for me
 However, you do not need to have played the previous two games to enjoy Zero Time Dilemma, but it is recommended
 I repeat: you do not need to have played the previous two games to enjoy Zero Time Dilemma
Story: The story behind ZTD is phenomenal
 Every twist and turn poses more questions, and you feel as though you can't stop playing until you've found all the answers
 There are many different endings to explore, both good and bad, and you won't feel like you've truly completed the game until you've seen them all
 As previously stated, it follows a non-linear story and you can play it in any order - which works extremely well due to the participants losing their memories every 90 minutes
 They don't know what order things are happening in, and neither do you
 However, as endings are unlocked, you'll be able to see the game's story flowchart, and this will allow you to pinpoint things you've missed
 Gameplay: I love the gameplay within ZTD
 I've managed to escape all of the rooms without help, but I did struggle and become frustrated at points
 Escaping from a room off of your own back is extremely rewarding though, so try not to use guides unless you're 100% stuck
 (See my tips for escaping below
) The only thing that bothers me, is lack of gameplay during the first hour or so
 The introduction is quite heavy, and you'll find yourself waiting a while to get into things
Characters: The characters are very interesting too
 There are 4 returning characters from the older games, and 5 totally new characters - and they've all got their own story to tell
 You start off by only knowing their names, but after playing through their teams fragments, you'll slowly learn how they came to end up in this messed up game of murder
 Whilst I'm on the subject, the 9 people are split into 3 teams, each with a team leader (and that's who you'll control)
 But I honestly loved getting to know them all, some of their backstories really took a turn for the worse
Visuals: The art and animation is average honestly
 Now, this does not mean bad, it just means compared to the rest of the game, I don't favour it as much
 If you love the artstyle from the Telltale games such as The Wolf Among Us and Telltales The Walking Dead, you'll probably like the art in ZTD
 However, the animations are quite clunky, and the mouth movements can be quite bizarre at time
 That being said, the team making the game was small and they had limited time and resources so they did a great job considering that
Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma - Pros and ConsPros:- Compelling and interesting story- Amazingly written characters and backstories- No puzzle room is the same, and they will all make you think- The addition of the skip text button
- Flawless PC port- Estimated 20 hours playtime without skipping/using guides- Gab Cons:- Janky animations- The memopad (partially because it has a limit, partially because no one likes writing with a mouse or controller)- Lack of gameplay during the intro- No 'rotate' prompt on Xbox Controller (it's RB)- I pressed the button- Snails Do I recommend the game
 100% yes
 I'm honoured that Spike Chunsoft provided me with a review copy, ZTD is currently my favourite game of the year
 If you love mysteries and puzzles, get this game
 Fantastic

WARNING: Zero Time Dilemma is the third installment in the Zero Escape visual novel series
 If you care about avoiding spoilers and sticking to the correct order of story elements, do NOT play this game until you have met the following prerequisites:1- Finished the Nintendo DS game "9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors" and attained all endings
2- Finished the 3DS/PSVita game "Virtue's Last Reward" and attained all endings
Otherwise, playing Zero Time Dilemma without doing the above will spoil most of the plot line for you
 IMPORTANT UPDATE: I have finished the game and will now write my review below
 However, a bit of news first
 It was recently confirmed that the first two Zero Escape games will be ported, most likely to Steam
 It was also suggested that 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors may also receive voice acting
Now, the review
Review (Without Spoilers)Being the third installment in a series of visual novels that already far exceeded my expectations, I thought it would be hard for Zero Time Dilemma to win me over
 However, it did, and with flying colors
+ Exceptional storytelling, as expected from the great Uchikoshi
+ Mind-bogglingly fun puzzles in some of the later rooms in the game
+ Beautiful character design, especially Zero
+ Intense decision-making moments with befitting UI
+ Some reviewers argued that the voice acting is bad, and I agree only when it comes to a few characters
 The rest are very well voiced
- The character animations feel unnatural at times (even though it appears they tried their best to avoid this)
- Though the music was sublime, too many tracks were borrowed from previous Zero Escape games, which I found to be lazy
All in all, if you've played the previous games, Zero Time Dilemma will offer you plenty of satisfaction and fond memories
 If you haven't played the previous games, I strongly urge you not to play this game until you do
Have a wonderful day
Posted: 21 July, 2016
Only one way to enjoy this game1
 Play 9992
 Play Virtue's Last Reward3
 Play Zero Time DilemmaPiece of cake
Posted: 1 July, 2016
The first 10 minutes into the game and casually assumed the first decision was merely just a tutorial to introduce risk and reward with no real consequences at the beginning
 Spent 9 minutes afterwards watching the credits thinking the game will soon start
Then I realized I got a bad ending this entire time and had to restart
Posted: 12 July, 2016
Absolutely brilliant ending to this mind-bending trilogy
No amount of stale animations, "trial & error puzzles," or lacklustre voice acting can take away from how ridiculously fantastic the story is
 The series made me question reality, it made me question who I am, how my mind works and why it works the way it does
 The series has sparked an interest in me that I hope will never die
 Zero Time Dilemma wrapped everything up, while still managing to create its own unique mind boggling tale, and great new characters
I cannot recommend this game enough, although I do recommend waiting until the first two of the series are released on Steam
 It's a shame they're being released out of order this way, but I'm just glad that more people get to experience this masterpiece of storytelling
 In my opinion this is one of the purest forms of "interactive storytelling
" It truly shows how video games can produce stories that would never work in another format
It's just so goddamn good
 Seriously
Posted: 13 June
+ Amazing Story
I love story driven games and this one didn't disappoint (I actually watched all of the credits in its entirety) + Episodes in the middle
in most movies, tv shows or games, you have no idea why the antagonists of the game do the things they do
 The 25 minute show in the middle of each acts succeeded brilliantly in showing the other side of that coin
+ The choices of the game
Sure, the choices don't have an effect on the ending but they determine the way the story of the game goes through
+ Combat
Loved the time powers and the final boss battle
+ Characters
Characters from both sides of the game were lovable and the cast was very well chosen
- Optimization
Horribly optimized (very playable though), so much that the credits scene had framerate dropping to 10
 Most areas had a framerate of 35-50, which is very disappointing for a high budget game
 My system achieved constant 60 only for a just few areas of the game with high to ultra settings
(GTX 970, i7 4770k)
- Episodes in the Middle
Really hated the fact that the episodes had to be streamed from the internet, they stuttered a lot
 (geddit geddit
)
- Length
Can easily finish the game in less than 10 hours, if you're not going for the 100% Achievements
- Combat
The cover system isn't that great and because of the short length of the game, the combat part ends just as you were about to master the powers, so that's unfulfilled potential for me All in all, this is an awesome game if you're looking for a great story and can forgive the frame drops and the short(ish) length
 Worth it even for the full price (but saving an extra 15 bucks doesn't hurt)
***wow this actually made it to the top, tiny life goals right here, thanks :')***

A science experiment goes horribly wrong which leads to jack joyce gaining incredible powers such as deflect bullet, freeze time, burst bullets in frozen time, teleport across rooms, reverse time
Quantum break has ten hour long campaign which consists of live action tele drama
 The consequences of drama changes according to your decisionsGameplay: A third person cover based shooting game, but in here you can use your powers to gain over enemy very quickly
 It’s advisable that you gather skills, so that you can utilize your powers properly
Well I really Loved Jack Joyce’s journey of turn Back time, save the world
 And waiting for Quantum break-II

Good
 hope other microsoft games comes to steam someday
 Window store is a disaster
Posted: 12 May
Gameplay: 9/10 The gameplay is pretty solid
 You get cool powers combined with your typical third person shooter
 It reminds me of mass effect gameplay
 The only thing that gripes me is the auto cover system, but it's not a deal breaker
 I did not experience a single glitch the entire time I played
Graphics: 9/10 The game looks very pretty, but the graphics did not blow me away
 There were a few times where textures would take a while to load, but it does not happen very often
 With this in mind, it takes a pretty high end graphics card to run this at max settings if you want to play at 60 fps
 I'm using a 980ti, and I had to downscale from 1440p to 1080p to play at ultra settings with 60fps
 I had ocassional framerate drops but not very often
 Sound: 8/10 The soundtrack definitely sets the mood, but none of the tracks were memorabe
 I did not experience any glitches with the audio the entire time I played
 The voice acting is phenomenal
Story: 9/10 The story was the best part of the game, and I was intrigued the entire time
 I found myself trying to find every collectable just so I could dig up a little more information about the overall story of the game
 The choices you make throughout the game really dont matter that much
 They have very minor changes to the episodes and dont effect the gameplay at all
 I feel like it offers the players an illusion of choice and it is cool that it's there, but the game would still be just as good without them
 The ending is left open which makes me think that there will be a sequal
 Overall: 8
8/10Pros:-Amazing story-Great acting-Cool powersCons:- auto-cover systemBest Character: Beth

Okay, guys, seriously
The main selling point of the game, IMHO, is the story
 Simply put, it is excellent, and I think it is one of Remedy's best works yet
 It is about time travelling - a topic which is extremely difficult to write a good plot about
 Yet, they pulled it off
 Not without hitches and some plot holes, mind you, but they are not major, and overall everything boils down to a very coherent and competent story that can very well be on par with the best works of fiction of this genre in other media
 I am very picky about my time travel movies, but this game hit all the right notes with me
 The only thing that bothered me was the ending: it wrapped up most story arcs quite well, but left some questions unanswered hinting at a possible sequel
 Knowing how that ended for Alan Wake, I would prefer they did not do that
 Although I would absolutely love to see a Quantum Break 2
The gameplay was fun as well - overall shooting and using your special powers in action sequences was a blast
 Although there were not as many gun fights as I expected
 Also, no slow-motion, Max Payne style, which is weird considering the theme of the game - basically you can freeze time only locally by creating a time bubble in certain spots
 Also there is no hip fire (to shoot you need to aim first by holding right mouse button) and no blind fire from cover, which I found odd
 Nevertheless, these are minor nitpicks
The music, as in any other Remedy games is top-notch, and atmospheric
 The visuals are nice, especially I like the effect they used to show time raptures, which permeate the whole game - it is quite impressive
Unfortunately, the game was poorly optimized
 The technical requirements are way too high, and there were some strange graphical artifacts on my screen at times (I mostly blamed them on the fractures in Time that were happening in the plot, so it was not that bad :) I was running the game on High settings on my GTX 970, and overall I did not experience any serious game-breaking technical problems with it, even fps drops, which others are talking about
 Again, the experience could be different for everyone, as the port is not perfect
I am giving a 10 to counter all the other reviews, because people are sometimes being just ridiculous
 The game itself is a strong 8 or a 9 for me
 It was a blast to play, and I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed Alan Wake, Remedy's previous work
 I strongly recommend it to all action-lovers, and people who love games with strong plots
 Well, at least after they have patched the game up a bit and ironed out all the technical hiccups, you should really give it a try
P
S
 As a bonus, the game even contains a mini series with live actors, which is shown between episodes (which you can skip if you are not that into it)
 It is very professionally done, and just shows you how much effort and care went into the game

Short review:
A game that tries to combine TV series and a video game and it actually works great
 Little longer review: Quantum Break is a third person action shooter game where we take control of Jack Joyce
 As Jack due to the accident ( at very begging to the game) we have obtained powers to manipulate the time
 Pros: + very enjoyable combat + good puzzles/climbing elemenets+ great looking+ awesome story+ many interesting characters+ TV series are surprisingly good in this one+ good soundtrack ( nothing spectacular though, but it fits well) + many collectibles ( most of them with some backstory like audio logs or some e-mail )+ optional choices ( don't afftect the ending ufortunately ) + easy to get 100% achievements ( only last boss battle on hard LvL can give you some trouble )
Cons: - decent optimization, request at least some medium spec PC to enjoy this one ( but in the end it looks great so it's worth it, can be to blurry for some people though)- all TV episodes are streamed- can be short ( especially if you ignore all TV episodes you propably got around 7-8 hours max of pure gameplay )- auto cover system
Overall rating 8,5/10http://steamcommunity

One does not play Quantum Break
 This becomes quite evident in the game's vocabulary, preferring to refer to itself as a "show" rather than a "game"
 The game's format is novel in both senses of the word
 Five "acts" separated by four 20 minute live-action episodes showing what happened as a result of the previous choices you made
 Those episodes, along with interminable follow-the-character-through-the-environment-whilst-they-explain-the-story-to-you sequences, interspersed with brief moments of mildly inventive third-person shooter combat means that you do not actually play this game, you watch it
 You watch it, as the passive spectator you are
Let's cover
 combat
 The only noticable part of the game that can actually be considered gameplay involves shootouts featuring conveniently placed chest-high cover and your collection of six "time bending" super-powers
 Four of those superpowers are limited to simply slowing or stopping time while another two of those superpowers have no discernable effect on time at all
 Despite having six of these, you will only regularly use the four which require a single button push, and forget about the other two completely because those other two would actually require you to aim
 You will solely reserve aiming for shooting people with your guns
The high point of this game is the graphics
 Very pretty
 That's where your 70 GB went
 The graphical niceties include the 3D scanned likenesses of the real cast members
 I'm fairly sure Lance Riddick's own model is accurate down to the pimple's on the back of his neck (which are unreasonably close to the camera at one point which is how I know this
)
 This reinforces the point that the point of the game is to be looked at, rather than played
 In the game, you are required to go to various points to hold a button next to a glowing light in order to upgrade your superpowers
 I'm fairly sure this mechanic exists just to get you to look at the marvellous scenery
 One thing I'd like to know is if those live-action episodes, are streamed from your hard drive or the internet
 For 70 GB, it had better be the former
On the topic of choices, the game has four main "junctions" where you choose between two conflicting major outcomes of the junction decision
 The choice you make will alter the course of history itself and lead the game to eventually conclude with wildly different endings
 which are all completely identical
 That is to say that no decision I made had any impact whatsoever on what happened to the protagonist at any given point
 I still ended up doing the exact same things in the same order to reach the same conclusion
 The only notable difference is which characters perform any given action
 One character seems to exist solely to fill the shoes of the person who would have been there, had they not died moments earlier due to a decision you made
 Having played the game twice to encompass all possible choices, I can see no way in which the game is distinguishable from one that is entirely linear
 This game is linear; the decisions merely decide whether the paint on the walls is white or snow coloured
You can watch this show if you want, I'll be getting 70 GB worth of hard drive back
Posted: 2 June
just finished the game and i can say i loved every little part of this game the combat the story the short show and the graphics 
 i didnt encounterd a single bug which is surprising tbh
of course ill play this game again just to see the diffrent paths that i didnt choose im giving this game a 10/10
 worth every single coin

See written review below or watch it here: https://youtu
be/8_rPuvSZlUITL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSIONQuantum Break is unique mix of a time manipulation third person shooter game, and a live action show
After a catastrophic event involving a time machine occurs, time has become fractured, giving two people the powers to manipulate time itself
 You mainly play as the protagonist Jack Joyce, and you’re trying to fix time before it’s too late
 You also play briefly as the antagonist Paul Serene, where you make four separate choices that directly change how the story is told
I love using time manipulation abilities in games, and Quantum Break is no exception
 I enjoyed the combat very much
 It’s fun and fast paced, but the combat kind of easy, and it’s very forgiving because you start regenerating extremely quickly
 The character movement feels responsive, but there is auto crouching when you go near cover, so it may take some people a little getting used to
You will also need to use these powers outside of combat to progress through some of the areas
 There are upgrades for your abilities that let you use them more often and more effectively
Pros:the story, and concept of how time works are interestingthe script is written very well, and watching how the decisions played out as a live show with such a phenomenal cast is really enjoyablevoice acting, music and the sound effects are done wellcinematics looked absolutely amazing, and they really captured the actors likeness and expressions incredibly wellcombat is fun, fast paced, and forgiving - you can rush in and kill a bunch of enemies, and bail out to find cover if you start taking too much damagefull controller and mouse and keyboard supportmaking different decisions allows for some replay value (After finishing the game with my original set of choices, I went back and made different ones to see how the live show played out
 Some parts of each episode were the same, but there were also several things that were changed, which in turn also affected the following chapters slightly
)upgrade points are easy to find without having to go too much out of your way, but there are lots of other collectibles to be found that give you more insight into the story for those who like to take the time and explore more thoroughlyCons:performance wise, the game is not optimized the greatest (on ultra settings, 40-60 frames using a GTX 970 with periodic frame drops into the 30s; lowered the settings to high and was getting about 50-60 frames consistently)there were some times during gameplay that the characters looked grainy (usually when lots of other stuff was happening at the same time) - it was noticeable, but certainly not game breakingmouse thumb buttons bind as "null," and even though they work properly, all the prompts in game say "null" as well(nitpick) no way to tone down or turn off the motion blur(nitpick) some of the load times were a slower than I would have liked (even using a SSD)(nitpick) when trying to climb onto some objects, you have to re-position or come from a different angle to be able to climb upConclusion:The game took me about 9-9
5 hours or so, and I really enjoyed the gameplay as well as the show that’s incorporated into the overall experience
 Although, I am already using Windows 10, I’m glad that they made the game compatible with Windows 7 and available on Steam
 I wound up playing the whole game in one sitting
 I really liked the game, and recommend it to those who like time manipulation games combined with a well-told story rich experience
 Keep in mind though, the performance optimization needs some improvement, so even with the recommended GTX 970, don’t expect a solid 60 frames per second on ultra settings

ORWELL, what a great gamepros:- AMAZING story- Gameplay is interesting- I like the artstyle- The featured characters are fleshed out- High and consistant frames- Definetly worth the pricecons:- 4+ hours of gameplay- Not much replay-ability
Posted: 13 November, 2016
I'll be honest, when I purchased Orwell I did so on a steam sale, as my expectations of this game were not high
 I thought that this would be the game you "play for a few hours because you bought it and it's kind of OK, and maybe you'll finish it in a few months, but in reality you never will and every-single-time you see the game in the library you'll think "Oh, better finish that
" and then feel guilty for spending the money, but at least you got it on a sale
" kind of game
 I did not expect to be sitting at the edge of my seat every Thursday for a new episode, grieving over the things that happen to the lives I'm invading and battling with my own morals and conscience half the time
 Orwell, seriously, has become one of my top 5 favorites
 As devoted fan of "Life is Strange", I didn't think Orwell would emotionally capture me the same way I felt in that game, but I'd say it has
 You become familiar and interested in the lives you investigate, almost personalizing them to your own life and experiences in ways I didn't think were possible
 Now for the Tl;dr: Pros
Amazing storyline - keeps you interested and captivated Unique format - I've never personally played a game like this before, and the fact it's 'you' controlling the information put into the computer system makes it feel that much more personalized
 You start feeling like this is your actual job
Choice based - although some of the storyline is somewhat linear, I have heard of different outcomes for different plots
Emotionally captivating - no spoilers, but you defiitely have your heartstrings tugged at least once or twice Has replay value - I'm honestly about to start over when I finish this storyline so see how my choices effect gameplay in the end
 Cons The game highlights sections of information that is important to your investigation, and although this is helpful, sometimes I wish that we would have to read the information and it wasn't highlighted until we asked for a "hint" on what information we needed
 That may be too difficult to programme, and maybe some people would hate that format/idea, but I think it would add more value in terms of gameplay
 Overall, this game is a solid 5/5 for me
 
Posted: 28 October, 2016
It's 5 minutes into the future, in a fictional nation where you have just joined a secret government organization whose job it is to gather information, sometimes publicly available, sometimes deeply private and personal, and use it to prevent and solve crime
Your job is to rifle through this information and pass snippets of it that you deem important to the case over to your superiors, who will constantly give you feedback and requests for more
 It doesn't take long before you realize that this is a horrible system where your personal opinions and feelings can decide what picture is painted of the people you investigate, and that "Nothing to hide, nothing to fear" is as empty and absurd as saying that only troublemakers need freedom of speech or personal lives
 And your superiors are constantly suspicious of everyone
Facebook posts deleted after the medicated user had an outburst
nothing to hide, nothing to fear
Take statements out of context and ruin peoples lives with them
nothing to hide, nothing to fear
Cherrypick contradicting statements and go with the interpretation you feel like
 Did the attack happen in defense, or out of anger
 Nothing to hide, nothing to fear
Cause tension in a relationship by reporting the theft of a credit card that one had willingly lent to the other
 Nothing to hide, nothing to fear
Thanks for reading my review, NSA

Don't read too much about it, just do yourself a favour and go in entirely blind about the story
Here's the things you need to know This isn't like any game you've played before, the gameplay is weird and more or less takes place in a 'super powerful' browser
 You are not a hacker You will liken it to a telltale game, yet it is much more subtle in how it plays
 let it move you don't just read the data chunks be prepared to read everything, you'll learn more about the story that way
 It plays like a book Forgive my excitement and hyping, but it's for good reason
That's all you "need" to know
if you're interested, download the demo and try it out
Also: Cool developers for allowing the game to have a demo which is a fully playable segment of the actual game, and not a controlled showcase

>Just wanting to deliver justice and deal retribution >mfw I realize I just became the bad guy of 1984Holy damn, just played this game for the hell of it but boy I can tell you that you can't deny that this concept of a society/government is not that far away from our reality
 Sure, it's the old game of weighing safety over freedom but you really get tangled up in the lifes of people
 You start to hate them or even like them, feel sorry for them
 And you come to a point where you can't control what's happening even when you have this much control
 It's bizarre and devastating at the same
9/10 Otter-High-Fives would recommend

Do you like Dystopian fiction

This is what I wrote on my social media right after I had completed Orwell:“There have been occasions when I regretted not having put enough efforts into learning English
 And this moment is definitely counted as one of those occasions
 If only I had a better command of English, I wouldn’t be at a loss for words now, after having played through this game
 There is so much that I want to tell you about it, yet I don’t know how to construct all my thoughts into words
 All I can say now is:“This game is brilliant
”Can you feel the enthusiasm there
 xD Orwell is a good game
 It knows how to build an ambience
 It knows how to tell a story
 It has characters that are complicated like real people
 During the process of uncovering the truth, there were times when I literally dropped my jaw in shock
 xD There were also many times when I thought that something must be the truth, and only to realise later that the “truth” I had believed was just one of the many aspects to the big picture
 Despite occasional plot holes, this is indeed a game full of thrills
However, I also understand that this game isn’t for everyone
 It is very text-heavy, and it took me eight hours to complete my first playthrough
 If you do not like games in which you have to read a lot, then this game is probably not for you
 This game becomes rather dull if you are just going to skim through everything, drag all highlighted information and drop it into the box on the left of the screen
 If you are hesitating about whether to get it, there is a demo version at the bottom of the store page that you should try out before buying

If there were a "maybe" option for recommending this game I would have given it that, but with only a "yes" or "no" choice unfortunately I have to just come down on the side of the latter
This game is essentially a "choose your own adventure" detective novel wherein your decisions are all made by choosing which information to share with - or conceal from - the authorities
 The concept is an interesting one and the game does throw up some nice surprises in both the gameplay and the plot, and there are occasional moments of humour
However, the limitations in using conflicting information are rather annoying
 For example sometimes the game will let you choose only one of two (or more) different pieces of information even when both are true and could be vital to successfully completing your objectives
 (I get that this is a key game mechanic, but I think it could be explained or handled better to make the game feel less forced
) In particular there is one key decision which just comes down to a 50/50 guess with no supporting information to help the player make the correct choice
 (I am talking about the part where the player must determine the third location - If I missed any clues as to which is the correct answer, somebody please tell me
)Another major concern is the quality of the writing; whilst for the most part the writing is capable and there are some memorable moments, the writing is never compelling - I gave up reading about halfway through my first playthrough, instead just scanning text for the (conveniently highlighted) choices
 Whilst I can forgive bad writing in some games, for a game that is all about the writing the standard really needs to be higher
 Some of the text simply drags on too long, especially any form of dialogue (phone calls, chat text, etc
) - this is doubly annoying for dialogue as there is no way to skip it
 (Usually you can just let it run in the background whilst you read other in-game documents, but be careful with this as some actions are time-critical
)Replay value may depend how willing you are to work through the text again
 Whilst it is nice to see the different outcomes your actions can have, it feels like 90% or more of the game remains identical so it becomes a slog to see the few changes or pick up achievements
 Some of the achievements are so ambiguously described that the only way to complete them seems to be relying on lots of replays and blind luck, or of course walkthroughs
It is a shame to see such a nice idea and plot wasted without sufficient polish, but if the devs learn from this I do look forward to seeing what else they can produce

DescriptionOrwell is a visual novel that puts you in the shoes of a Big Brother employee: you are tasked with spying on people and uploading to the system anything suspicious
 Unlike most visual novels, you are not presented here with walls of text followed by lists of choices
 Rather, your interaction with the game and its unfolding story goes solely through the gimmick of uploading the data chunks you find (or not)
 By picking among conflicting data chunks or by choosing not to upload some sensitive information, you impact the story in small and big ways
Pros Fresh interaction gimmick that goes very well with the theme Credible writing with many characters each having their own style of speech Interesting choices going WAY beyond the good/bad dichotomy Decent art style Fair amount of consequences to choices made, though the game remains linearCons Notification system takes some getting used to (the system will sometimes find old information suddenly relevant, requiring you to regularly browse through the lists of documents to make sure no red star has popped) Because all chats and phone calls are delivered sloooooowly (and I found no way to speed them up), replaying the game to get the achievements or test other choices is a bit of a chore Political messages are (very) thinly veiled and might annoy (or even anger
) some playersVerdictDo you hate it when someone tries to convey a political message artistically and ends up as subtle as a bull in a china shop
 If so, stay away from this game
 You're going to hate it
Still here
 OK, here's an idea: put yourself in the shoes of an orwellian enforcer and imagine the consequences of government trampling all over freedom, privacy and presumption of innocence
Interested
 Then try Orwell
 Go in expecting a fresh visual novel and a politically charged (to the point of being heavy-handed at times) thought experiment
 There is much to like
Posted: 26 June
This game is fantastic
It takes the themes expressed in Orwell's 1984 and allows you to take a "big brother" role by reading through social media to decide who is responsible for a series events thought to be done by terrorists
I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, and it also made me think about every action I took
Did I want to mark this suspect as potentially dangerous based on an altercation she got into a long time ago
Is this article an accurate depiction of the person she is now
Actions like these will come back to haunt you based on the outcomes later in the game
Overall, my only complaint with this game is that the ending felt a little too abrupt
The game is episodic, and the final episode was significantly shorter than every other episode
Overall, though, I would highly recommend picking this game up
Posted: 25 November, 2013
Having sunk over 200 hours into this game alone, over 500 hours in total for this whole trilogy how can I not say this is one of the greatest adventures I've had ever in my life
 This is not just a game that you play like call of duty just to pass the time, this series has become a religious experience, a lifestyle
When I first loaded up this game I had no idea what I was in for, but it gave off a seriously special energy and I got sucked into a living, breathing universe
full of wonder, full of excitement and it shook me like Star Wars KOTOR never could (and is the reason why and how I even bought this game)
 Don't even think is this game going to be good enough for my $20 (Australia), if you can afford it just buy it and open your heart, mind and soul to this amazing experience
 Don't listen to the haters crying about there ME3 endings that they never got etc, its the journey, the friendships you create, the relationships you forge, the hearts you can break, the tears that can be shed
 Don't miss out
Love you Bioware, you have turned my world and my views, my inner essence, my personality upside down, inside out and blown it to hell and back (in a good way)
 You've made me mad, you've made me sad, made me happy, made me cry, made me scream the roof down
 How many games can you get emotionally, psychologically and spiritually attached to
Games are artwork like paintings and music for this technological generation, this game is a work of art
 AAA+

I'll be honest and admit that I very rarely finish the games that I purchase
 I usually play them until I get bored or see something else that grabs my attention
Not Mass Effect
 I've finished all of these games several times, ME2 probably being the best of the bunch
 They are all good and well worth playing
 I'm a 35 yr old physician and I was waiting in line with teenagers at midnight for the release of ME2 and ME3 at Gamestop
 I had a great time

Favorite game of all time
Awful inventory system, didn't really care about the combat system, couldn't care less about upgrades, weapons, etc, graphics are fine for its time, BUT
But if you are a fan of epic science fiction stories (Dune, Hyperion, etc) as I am, with the vast, diverse and interesting worlds and species and their relationships to each other along with an ominus evil lurring to destroy the galaxy, then BY GOD this is the game for you
Great characters, a plethora of game-changing choices, awesome antagonist, amazing story, incredible dialogue
 Simply excellent
 I cannot recommend this enough

"A tear comes to my eye as I think about how best to express the pure joy this game brings
 That sense of joy can come from climbing to the top of a mountain on a world at furthest reaches of the galaxy and witnessing an alien sunrise, the stunning and original story line, and even looking down at your feet as you board a cargo ship and see the entire universe below you
 All these things can only begin to explain the wonders of this game
" Beautiful space opera, with huge beautiful world to explore, and with great and deep characters to discover
 it's a whole new world and you going to fall in love with it

Mass Effect is a sci-fi shooter with a great storyline and characters that I grew fond of, as if they were really my squad members
 I fell in love with this game with time as the story and characters developed, I've never played any game like it, and I highly doubt any other sci-fi game series could be as awesome as Mass Effect
 It is truly unique and very enjoyable to play
 Give it a try

Punched a reporter
10/10 would punch again
In all seriousness, Mass Effect is a well-rounded game from BioWare, the people that defined my childhood with such classics as Neverwinter Nights, and my all-time favorite, Knights of the Old Republic
This first step into the trilogy, puts you into the boots of Commander Shepard
 He (or she) is given the task of stopping a rogue Spectre from
 you guess it, taking over the galaxy (OF COURSE
) Along the way, you pick up a colorful cast of characters that help Shepard every step of the way
One of the things I really like about Mass Effect is its approach to morality
 It is not the standard good vs evil choice
 To put this in Star Trek terms, Paragon Shepard is more like Jean-Luc Picard or Kathryn Janeway, always willing to go for diplomacy first
 Conversely, Renegade Shepard is more analogous to Benjamin Sisko; doing whatever it takes to get the job done, and sometimes crossing the line
 But even though ReneShep may cross that line, he or she, is willing to live with the decision regardless of the consequences
Gameplay may seem a little archaic especially when compared to the later games in the trilogy, but there is something about it that I find charming in its design
 Sure, inventory management can be a bit of a hassle, but let's face it, no game has ever really had a perfect inventory system
 The shooting is solid enough, even though the guns sound like pea shooters (This only applies to the pistols
 The shotguns, and sniper rifles have weight to their sound assets), and the variety of ammunition types, equipment and powers allow for a lot of replayability
 Plus, you can take your completed Shepard, and import him or her into the next two games, taking your decisions with you
So, what about Shepard
 Take a seat, relax, and begin your journey to find out

(Just for clarification I've played this game like 6 times outside of steam)There are games you like
 There are games you love, and replay many times
And then there are the games which almost bring a tear to your eye every time you start them
 The games which you've played enough times, you can quote the dialogue, speedrun the game perfectly, and remember every encounter from
 Because those games are masterpieces
This is one of those games

Let's get this out of the way - Arcanum has horrible, horrible dungeons, combat sucks, the end game is a rushed boring crap and there's a bunch of bugs (so use the fan-patches)
Yet, it's one of my favorite RPGs - voted by the RPG Codex the #5 best RPG of all-time
How so
 Because it excels at everything else
 The world is amazing, a clash of medieval fantasy with the industrial revolution
 More than just a nice background, it's used to offer an intriguing magic/technology duality and raise complex questions like "should orcs receive equal pay to humans at factories
"The classless character system is highly detailed and with several races, backgrounds, spells, skills, crafting recipes and technological schematics
 You can play anything from a charismatic elven enchantress who relies on its 5 followers to a spiteful dwarf inventor, adventuring alone with his trusty flamethrower
Moreover, the world will react to your choices
 Expect to suffer racism if you play as orc or half-ogre, to be expelled from trains if you play a mage (who cares, you can teleport
), to be banned from men's clubs if you play a women, etc
Quests are amazing
 To hell with the "kill 5/5 X" MMO-ish garbage push out today, Arcanum has you investigating murders and rumors, debating economics and politics, dealing with prejudice and racism, etc
 And they often have multiple solutions
 Need to solve a murder
 If you're a necromancer, why not raise the victim's spirit and ask him directly
 FINALLY A GAME THAT UNDERSTANDS MAGIC
Then there's the beautiful soundtrack, the gorgeous grid-based inventory with detailed artwork & item descriptions, the clever plot twists, the countless role-plying opportunities, the reactive companions, Tarant - the best city in any RPG
 hell, this is a game where you can complete a quest and read about it the next day on the city's newspapers
 Arcanum is easily one of the most ambitious games ever made
 Building upon what Fallout 1 & 2 did, it showed players just how rich, reactive and interesting an RPG could really be
 It has many failings, but no other game ever came close to its successes
Posted: 29 August, 2016
Arcanum of Steamworks and Magick Obscura is a very underrated and forgotten crpg
 It was the first game created by Troika games, which was founded by several of the developers of the original Fallout
Arcanum takes place in a Victorian era fantasy world
 And has all of the staples of typical medieval fantasy elements
 There's magic, dwarves, elves, gnomes, orcs and so forth
 But they've all been adapted into a more modern world
 Now there are firearms, steam power, zeppelins, and so forth
 Intermixed with orcs that wear tailcoats and wield gattling guns
The game plays very similarly to the original Fallout
 But it allows you to select between turn based and real time, with turn based being the obvious better option
 Arcanum was ahead of its time in a lot of respects
 For starters it is a true open world game, allowing you to walk from the very start of the game all the way to the other end of the continent uninterrupted
 It was also to my knowledge the very first game to feature preorder DLC, if you preordered the game you recieved an extra dungeon on a CD
 The soundtrack is all classical music and still remains one of my favorite OSTs
 It's a fantasy version of Fallout set in a steampunk world
 It's everything you've ever wanted in an rpg, released 15 years ago
 Go figure
This version appears to be the CD version of the game
 It appears to work with Arcanum's widescreen mod so it's really a toss up if you wanna spring for the GOG version or the Steam version at this rate

 It is, put simply, a piece of RPG history

DISABLE STEAM OVERLAY IF YOU WANT TO BE ABBLE TO PLAY
A masterpiece of an RPG
 I played well over 1000 hours at this game when i was younger and had the CD version of it
 Loosing that cd shatered my heart as this is, in my opinion the best RPG ever made according to what i have played so far
In Arcanum, freedom is the name of the game
 Of course it is still a game and is restricted by the amount of content it has but even then, there seems to be an endless stream of it
 Make any caracter you want, from a fighter, mage, gunslinger, armorer, archer, thieve, assassin to a diplomat, you can do it
 I cannot guaranty your build will pull you out of every situation but nothing ever will eh
It has its few bugs and old graphs but this doesnt mar the beauty of the game itself, not to speak of the godly steampunk-violin soundtrack wich only helps in keeping you immersed
Overall, i spent way too much time on this game when i was younger and still spent more recently and i cant seem to get bored
Worth a big 10/10 to me, worth buying anytime
Posted: 6 September, 2016
This is the best game ever
 Made by Troika Games, authors of Fallout and another bugged, unbalanced, yet cult game Vampire: Bloodlines
Arcanum has horrible graphics
 It has horrible combat
 And its 'balance' is nonexistant
 You can literally walk through the entire game by using ONLY one spell
 The one you can start with
Yet still Arcanum is the best game ever
 It has one of the most captivating settings
 It's a wonderful world, a merger of steampunk science and magic
 It has lots of characters and story choices, most of them hidden and not given out in the open like in most modern RPGs
 Of course sometimes even in Arcanum you have an option 'you either go here, or go there' but there is always a third way
 And a fourth
 And in most cases a fifth and a sixth
Almost all quests in Arcanum have 4 or even more ways to finish them (and several to fail)
 This brings enormous replayability, and even after years you can find out that some quest could've been completed differently
Arcanum is offering all of it
 The moral dilemma, the ambiguity of your choices, the vastness of the world
 If you can tolerate the graphics, clunky combat system and the fact that all skill choices are unbalanced, you're in for a treat
 Dumb Half-Ogre
 Halfling-thief
 Intelligent Half-Orc
 Elf-Engineer
 Selfless or selfish, savior or villain, or anything inbetween
 Possibilities of real roleplay are endless here
This is and will stay my only review for a game on steam
 Just because this one is the one I deeply care about
And the soundtrack
 Best soundtrack for a game ever written
Posted: 29 August, 2016
This is probably my favorite game, one which I have played throughout most of my life
Imagine if a fantasy world inspired by LotR or D&D hit the industrial age
Arcanum is an open world, open ended RPG with either turn based or real time combat (can be changed at will)
Magic and technology are two opposite sides of the same coin, and you can choose one or the other, or may walk the middle ground
The game often offers many ways of tackling a quest
 For example:In one of the first quests, some bandits require a toll be paid if you wish to pass a bridge
 You can pay this toll, you can convince them you're a bandit yourself, you can work with them, you can steal the key, or you can kill them
Another thing I like about this, which you don't see in some modern games like Skyrim (still love that game though) is that you can fail quests, and can pretty much kill anyone
 Sometimes this results in failing that quest
You've got a variety of spells and technology to choose from
 You can raise the spirits of the recent dead to speak with them at and early level, or at a high level can even resurrect the dead
 Your companions can die, but if you have the spell, resurrection scroll, you can bring them back
As a technologist you can craft guns, tech armor, automatons, and more
 As you progress through the tech field, you get schematics for crafting your stuff
 Alternatively, you can also find schematics out in the world to craft things you wouldn't get from just leveling up
There are also other skills your character can utilize, such as bartering, gambling, persuasion, and pickpocket
 If you have the relevant stat (strength, dexterity, etc), you can train its respective skill
 If you get that skill to the maximum level, you're not done yet
 You have to train with the masters of that skill to gain the most benefit from it
 The final Master level of each skill has a quest which you must complete to be considered the master
You can also steal most things, if you have the relevant skill
 Sneak in to a shop, and you can steal all of their wares
The game has some bugs
 I recommend installing the official and unofficial patches, and the high resolution patch
 http://www
terra-arcanum
com/downloads/There are some things I wish the game did better, like shopkeepers won't shoo you out of their shop before they head to bed, which makes it a bit easy to steal their stuff
 I still love the game though
Tip: F1-F6 give quick commands to your companions
 F7 quicksaves, F8 quickloads

While the gameplay is pretty fantastic it simply is not designed to run on Windows 10
 I've spent a lot of time trying to optimize the game but after a few minutes it will almost definitely slow down on you to the point where it is unplayable
 Every few minutes will require a fresh restart
It cannot be run in a high priority mode without destroying the graphics
 I even tried setting up short cuts to run it in on high with no luck
 It uses an ancient version of direct X that simply doesn't work as well on Windows as you'd expect
This definitely needs a reboot though
 The game is so much fun
Posted: 20 September, 2016
The only reason Arcanum isn't well known as the all-time classic that it is, is because it was released right between Diablo 2:Lord Of Destruction, and Baldur's Gate 2:Throne Of Bhaal
They were massively popular expansions to massively popular games that essentially shared the same general visual style and similar gameplay to Arcanum, a game no one had ever heard of
Naturally, it went overlooked in favor of the vastly more famous expansions
Arcanum is an absolute masterpiece
As much as I LOVE Diablo 2:Lord Of Destruction, I'm NOT sure that it was the best isometric PC game to come out that year
Arcanum MAY be the better game
Imagine everything you love about the Fallout games and Elder Scrolls games, and imagine a steampunk version in a DRAMATICALLY more elaborate and interesting world, with more depth, and more customization, but in isometric 2D, like the original Fallout games
Arcanum was created by the creators of Fallout
It IS steampunk Fallout
I'll be real honest, if they told me that a new Fallout or Elder Scrolls game was on the way, I'd shrug
That's cool
But if they told me they were making Arcanum 2, I'd be LOSING MY GORRAM MIND waiting day by day for that game to come out
 I've been waiting for Arcanum 2 to be announced for like 15 years
Posted: 1 June
without exaggeration this is one of the best rpgs ever made
 it has a depth and breadth not found in modern roleplaying games with a focus on creative problem solving
even though the game is over a decade old it has still aged well and should still be accessible to people who didn't live in the golden age of crpgs
if you do buy it make sure to read the manual because it is a gem and there is a nice bread recipe in it

Two years ago indie outfit Stoic Studio released the first part of The Banner Saga to highly favourable reviews
 With a team comprised of ex-Bioware employees it’s no surprise that The Banner Saga involved making meaningful choices that directly affected not only those under your banner but also the world in which they inhabited
 Always billed as a trilogy, the first game’s success paved the way for the team to continue the story
 Where will the journey take us now as the story continues in The Banner Saga 2
One of the first things that hit me about The Banner Saga 2 is its art style
 Like its predecessor the whole environment is beautifully drawn with an almost classic Disney feel to it
 It brings with it a wonderful tinge of nostalgia and when coupled with moody music score it creates quite a haunting atmosphere
 Let’s not forget that overall this game is about survival, loss and overcoming what seems to be unsurmountable odds all in the name of making sure you and your clansmen survive
 Make no mistake, The Banner Saga 2 is not a game full of happy endings and rainbows
 There is a dark and menacing foe at work and in times like these sacrifices must be made
 Each choice you make on your way has meaningful and long lasting consequences
 However, so as to not spoil the story which is one of the anchors of The Banner Saga 2, it’s fair to say that almost at every turn more sacrifices are having to be made
 As the journey progressed we got the feeling that each new choice carried more weight than the last
 With dwindling numbers and clans seemingly annoyed at our leadership it’s fair to say we weren’t surprised a coup wasn’t enacted
 However the fact that a game made us feel this way is a testament to how well the story is written and how, only by dialogue, we felt the ramifications of a choice we just made
 We were almost reluctant at times to make one in fear that it would be our last or that we’d fall to another ambush
 Speaking of ambushes, combat in The Banner Saga 2 is presented in a classic, turn-based, style
 Before the battle commences we were afforded time to choose our heroes, equip one special item and, once on the battlefield, place our chosen heroes within a set area
 It's worth noting that the order in which you choose your heroes determines their play order
 After clicking the giant “Ready” button battle commences with the turn order shown at the bottom of the screen
 This really aids in planning battle strategy as knowing which enemy moves next will influence where and how you attack as well as when to use your heroes’ special abilities
In a world seemingly bound by honour it’s no surprise then that the currency of the world is renown
 Each felled foe earns renown as well as winning battles and certain dialogue choices
 This can then be used to promote your heroes, buy special items to equip your heroes with but most importantly it can be used to buy supplies
 As each day passes a set amount of supplies are used
 If you run out of supplies the morale of your caravan will decrease and, unsurprisingly, they will start to die of starvation
 The less clansmen you have the less foraging they will do on the road and you will also have no-one to train as fighters should those numbers dwindle
 The fewer fighters you have the more dangerous the next battle becomes
 Morale is also vital as a low morale can have appreciable, negative effects should you go to battle
 What’s more is that to increase morale (and heal heroes) you need to camp and, for every day you rest, the more supplies you use
 It can leave you in a very tight spot if you fail to plan ahead
 This added piece of micromanagement increases the depth without adding too much complexity and really makes you take a personal responsibility for those under your banner
However, if this is your first entry into the series like it was for us you may find yourself at a disadvantage in the care stakes
 The first thing we were required to do was pick who we were to play as
 Backstory is given but it’s light especially with regards to supporting and minor characters within the game
 Whilst those who played The Banner Saga are able to import their save and carry on from where they left off as a newcomer we felt at a loss
 For the first hour or two of my playthrough I found it hard to engage in the characters introduced having only just met them
Thankfully as I progressed the strong story came to their rescue and by the final few, crucial hours, we found it hard to make those ever more difficult decisions
The Banner Saga 2 is a game that warrants multiple playthroughs not only so you can learn and appreciate it’s simple yet nuanced combat but, like any choose your own adventure, so that you can experience every ending
 Given how many choices I was asked to make on my playthrough, I get the feeling there’s plenty of replayability here
 Overall though it's a game that rewards those who have already played the original The Banner Saga
 Without the Spanish Inquisition style start that Mass Effect 2 gave those who had not played the first game it can make it hard for the newcomer to break in and start caring for those at their charge
 Whilst the questionnaire start to Mass Effect 2 took a while it meant those playing for the first time had a say in how the universe they were about to enter was comprised
 In comparison, beyond choosing the main character everything else is that went before The Banner Saga 2 is predetermined
Whether you’ve played The Banner Saga or not if you give the game time hopefully you’ll experience the same wonderful, meandering tale that I did; one that rewards any player who loses themselves in the story and the world that Stoic has weaved full of fantasy and wonder

I don't understand how people could complain about this game being the same as the previous one
 I think it's obvious that it's a direct sequel to Banner Saga
The game is great, the characters and their abilities are even more original in this one
 And I hope we will see Banner Saga 3, even if it's going to be "the same" - I will still play it
 PS: One of the characters is literally based on Thomas Middleditch's face
 How about that huh

Banner Saga 2 Review Banner Saga 2 is finally here and it carries on where it left off
 This review will analyze the amazing amount of fun I had in my first playthrough (many more to come) of TBS2 and the moments that were less than pleasant
 I aim at comparing the second game's structure to TBS1, and measuring the good, bad changes
 Alright lets break it down
 Story Very much drawn up like a Tolkien-esque world, Banner Saga 2 plays out like the Two Towers of Tolkien, great fantasy writing accompanies the 2nd novel in a great trilogy that builds up to an upcoming climax in the third
 Although it stumbles in a few places, the story proves to drive this epic adventure well into its second episode
 The story starts off at a meager pace and suffers from bogged down streaks of fighting(explained in gameplay section)
However, these negative aspects are QUICKLY and STRONGLY forgotten when thrown into the heat of the carvan's struggle of getting to one story sequence after another
 Tolkien's Two towers is the worst of the best and the same can be said for this game
 The first Banner Saga had a more complete narrative that was well supported by its characters and driven by tension from one scene to the next
 Banner Saga 2 struggles to build tension or as intense interest in the beginning than the first game did, but with the option to start where your clan left off, this breathes continuity in the epic and gives it a semblance of being one game
 Because of this, the first saga helps drive the second extensively
 It does not fail to set up a Banner Saga 3 to outperform this entry in the series
+Great story is continued+sets up for a climactic finale-story does drag in the beginning
--- 8
5/10 --- Characters The old group is back headed by the two protagonists Rook and Iver
 These characters that are brought about from the first installment led with remarkable chemistry prompted by great writing
 Unfortunately,
many supporting characters don't get the screen dialogue time to continue developing themselves and create the sense of a united clan that was present in the first game
 This is because the cast of characters grows too huge during this game and many characters were left behind either too late in the game or appeared not enough
 Many new characters are ho-hum and plagued with some poor character designs that mimic the original cast slightly
Its only a select few of new characters that shine through and represent the new regions visited
 These select new characters bond and become a part of a character driven exchange that works well with the story
+Original characters are great+A dynamic interplay between characters-Too many new dull characters -lack of further development in some older characters
--- 8/10 --- Gameplay The gameplay consists of leading a clan across the tundra and forest making decisions that effect the outcome of the story and the survival of the clan
 When battle ensues, characters can be chosen to fight in a tactics style form of combat
 Gameplay differs from the original in a few good ways and many uncessary ways
 Firstly, the caravan system is now unbalanced
 With the ability to find food far more easily and obtain renown especially too easy, management of food is almost never a problem
 More renown is gained every battle, almost exponentially as the game goes on and this plays to TBS2's detriment
 This leads to mass upgrading of characters and not as great care to tactical upgrading
 The renown needed for upgrading is also designed incorrectly
 The satisfaction of leveling up a character and feeling as if a distinction exists between levels is muddled
 I found myself with the majority of my characters being able to level up 3-4 times in a row because of the previous kills that carry over to the next level
 This also led to most of my characters being OP throughout much of the game and very little difficulty in combat
 Combat soon became tedious at parts because battles would consist of enemies that presented no challenge at all for stretches of the game
 The great aspects of the combat are still there however, and thats what makes this game's battle system amazing despite the related shortcomings
 EDIT: I played this game on normal and that should represent the adequate balance of difficulty and story telling
 But in the end, the combat was too easy
+original combat has not changed-leveling and character progression is shoddy-difficulty has been nerfed from the last Banner Saga-last fights proved to be far too easy--- 7/10 --- Presentation The main aspect of this game that makes it great and separates it from every other game is and always has been -- its presentation
 The atmosphere created by its authentic Celtic/Nordic music and a throwback art style that is captivating and adds so much to the game
 The art is beautiful and haunting when it needs to be
 The characters are represented well save for a few new characters that look awkward
+Music is perfect+animation is classic and unique to games of this day
+Creates an atmosphere that is an ensemble of perfection-New characters have questionable designs--- 9
5/10 --- Conclusion The second Banner saga was amazing and amped up the story to an amazing height that can only get higher in Banner Saga 3
 It was easy to tell when the first Banner Saga came out that it would turn into something awe inspiring and it has
 A game I immediately want to play after beating it is a rarity for me, but now it just seems ritualistic to me with Banner Saga
 Don't hold out on this one, it is one of my favorites and the game is truly a gem
--- 8
25 --- TOTAL SCOREEDIT: TBS2 is by no means a perfect game, and the story is very well constructed, its gameplay is poorly integrated at times and the 2nd game is a step down from the previous
 This game deserves more criticism than it is getting and the amazing story should not blind the analysis of the game as a whole
 This game should be paid more attention to, its originality has sparked the creation of other games following its lead

Superb improvement over an already decent original
 The combat is more interesting with a greater variety of both allied and enemy units and more in the way of battleground terrain and structures
 The storyline is also improved over the original
and the better quality of writing is almost instantly apparent
 The training tent is also not so much of a white elephant and now periodically contains training puzzles which boost reknown on completion
 The somewhat boring travelling sections have also been given an overhaul and creating a good balance between fighters and clansmen is no longer just random as clansmen can now be trained into fighters at the training tent
 These fighters will consume twice as much food as clansmen and clansmen will now actively scavenge making them more than just the dead weight they were previously
 It's certainly an advantage to have played the original (and the final save from your previous adventure can be imported) as continuity is maintained with regard to storyline and base mechanics
 But despite this BS2 remains a better and more well rounded game than the first making it a must-buy for story driven TBS fans
 The only valid reason I can see for not getting hold of BS2 is if you absolutely hated the original - and why anyone would have is beyond me

Even better that the first one, which was awesome
 More
 Please
 I will give you money
 The level of immersion you've achieved is so rare these days
 I don't know exactly how you're doing it but it feels amazing
 Reminds me of reading Tolkien for the first time when I was a kid
 You guys nailed it, again
 Great job
Posted: 22 April, 2016
Well color me impressed
 Actually used my previous save data to continue the tale
 Seriously this team is making a great series here

In 2014 I had the pleasure of playing through Banner Saga 1, and I had this to say in my review:"There's something about this game that I can't put my finger on
 It might be the entracing music, the Disney quality hand-drawn art, or perhaps it's the fact that everytime I play this game it's always 30 minutes later than I expected it to be
 The combat is simple, for the uninitiated
 As you begin to dive into the character types, their respective special attacks, and equipable items, you'll soon realize that there is a depth to the combat that will keep you coming back
 When the odds are seemingly against you, and you do in fact manage to reduce your foe to a single unit vs
 one or more of your own, you will feel like a champion
 A real champion
What has surprised me the most about The Banner Saga is the number of choices and chances the game allows
 Every combat decision, every discussion, every step on the map brings consequences
I can't tell you whether or not you should buy The Banner Saga, but I can tell you that you would almost be a fool not to
"Even though I've (so far) only played Banner Saga 2 for an hour, I am happy to tell you that 2 years later everything I adored in TBS1 is alive and well in TBS2
 The art, the music, all of the hard and rewarding decisions are back
Anyone that loved The Oregon Trial, enjoys turn based combat, or just wants to experience a really well made game should pick up The Banner Saga 2 now
Oh, and your save from TBS1 can be imported
 If you didn't play the first (and I highly recommend doing so
) you can press a Recap button on the main menu to get up to speed
I look forward to playing this game over the next 15-20 hours and salivating over The Banner Saga 3 for the next year+ :)

Teal DeerDevelopers: StoicPublishers: Versus EvilInitial release: April 2016Genre: Strategy, RPG, Turn Based, Dark#Worth/NotWorth: #AbsolutelyWorth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationThe Saga continues
 and is improved in almost every way
 What was an incredible game the first time around is even better as the story continues
 Up front you are given the options for importing your save or selecting one of the characters to be your main leader
 As I am not of the group of people that attempt to play sequels before their former experience has been gone through I cannot speak to how approachable this is if you did not play the first Banner Saga
 As for what should be quite obvious I imagine, this is a highly narratively driven game
 The combat system remains very similar but is vastly improved
 More classes and more abilities
 Maxing a stat now gives you options to further improve that stat
 Options like Robust or Divert
 Being a percent chance to resist strength damage and avoid armor damage respectively
 Among many other ways to specialize
 You lead your caravan as you did in Banner Saga 1 but even this is improved
 Clansman, fighters and Varl still aid you
 Helping in foraging and fighting
 The tough balancing act of having fighters to aid in battle at the expense of using up more supplies on the road
 As well as attempting to hold some morality in the events that take place
 How it is improved is that the consequences your actions are having are much more clearly conveyed to you
 Including the very real effects of morale on your caravan
 Training at camp also has added functionality in that you can now train clansman to fighters
 Additionally there are challenges to be had in training as well
The party also splits and is told from differing perspectives
 As it seems tradition for the series
 The actual story telling is also even higher in production value this time around
 Extremely well animated cut scenes and quite a bit more voice acting is present
 The hand drawn art style continues to be vastly gorgeous
 Though the main crux of the story is told through text
If you enjoyed The Banner Saga 1
 This game is that and plenty more
Follow my curation for more 
Posted: 4 May, 2016
Before you read, note that English is not my native language, so expect errors and for that I apologize in advance
 Let me fill you in if you have no idea what the Banner Saga is
 You are nobody and you wake up to find the world that you and everyone once know is breaking apart
 You struggle to get by and are forced to make tough calls, so that you and your people can survive
 And through these choices you are bringing changes -- though small, they may escalate
 I am not going to tell you the exact plot, since it would spoil the fun
TL;DR:+Decent story+Super amazing music+Even more super amazing art style-Lore not very friendly to people new to the seriesVerdict: Recommend, and I recommend you to play BS1 as well if you haven't played it yet------------------------------------------------------When I recommend BS1 to my friends I'd say "a perfect game, if not for a lousy lack of unit variety and customization"
Well, it's a good thing to see this time the "if not" part gets improved greatly
 While inheriting the already-interesting move-based system, Stoic put a lot of work in character development
 Compared to merely investing stat in BS1, in BS2 you can get talents (passive abilities), characters get more abilities through progression and some of them got to choose one from many, which allows players larger room for customization
 Even though the optimum is easy to find, it's still an amazing improvement compared to the system of BS1
 Of course there are new units introduced to both the protagonist side and the enemy
Not much to say about the art style
 I did enjoy the look of BS1, so here I enjoy BS2's too, and they include more cutscenes this time I think
 Notably there are some more boldly designed godstones compared to mere faces engraved on a rock in BS1
Music is composed by Austin Wintory as well
 I personally prefer BS1's music rather than this one -- maybe because I know what to expect this time
 I'm particularly impressed by the song in the end
The game itself is shorter than BS1 and I see people grumble about that, but it gets more immersive this time IMO
 Some say the ending leaves things hanging, but you know how a trilogy works: the first one introduces the setting, in the second things escalates and followed by the third, the grand finale
 I hope I can live long enough to play BS3 before darkness consumes the world
 :(Update: tBS3 is happening
 Successfully kickstarted
 Another remarkable thing is that your save from BS1 can be imported
 It's not super impressive since we all know Bioware's been doing that the whole time, but it's still decent enough: in an unforgiving world where you are forced to make tough decisions, save import reminds you that your choices have effect
I could, but I am not going to discuss in-depth since the new review showcase policy is discouraging (volvo only cares whether you give a thumb-up or thumb-down, not the decency of your writing), but I think my point is crystal clear: I recommend this game even at full-price to those who have played BS1
 And for folks new to the Banner Saga, I suggest you to buy them both
 Honestly, this game is amazing and it's sad to see BS2 doesn't get as much attention as BS1 did

Please DO NOT buy this version of the game
 Get the Ultimate Version instead
Although it is an amazing game, there is no easy way to purchase all of the DLC for it through Steam
 At regular price the base game costs $20, with the much needed Awakening DLC costing another $20
 The other 8 expansions for this game can't be purchased through steam, but rather through Bioware points
 If you decide to pick those up, it'll cost another $60 out of your pocket
Instead of paying the $100 you'd need to spend on this version, buy the EXACT SAME THING for $30 in the Ultimate Version
Edit 6/23/2016: Another steam sale, so my review is high up again
 I just want to note that the Ultimate Edition of this game is region locked, so some places will not be able to get it
 The Ulitmate Version might be available on Origin, so I'd check there
 If it's still unavaible, then it's okay getting this version of the game
Posted: 26 November, 2013
I'm not one of those types of people to replay video games
 I play 'em once, and I'm done
 That's all that I need to do
 On occasion, if a game is really good, I'll go back to it once or twice
 Maybe
 What I don't do--what I absolutely do not DO
 is put two hundred and eighteen hours into a game, which at present, is exactly what I've done with Dragon Age: Origins
It is, suffice it to say, very much an exception to the rule, and I can't entirely be sure why
 The plot's bog-standard fantasy fare (and worse, it requires that you be friendly to elves, who are the single worst race that has ever (not) existed, and every single one of them deserve to die; I think you and I can both agree that elves are, in fact, lazy scumbags who probably eat babies; I am highly offended at having to play a game as if I am, in fact, a friend of elves, because everyone knows they're horrible people responsible for all the world's problems, with their high and mighty 'we were so immortal and cool and awesome and amazing and perfect but you puny humans destroyed us' well you know what, you punks
 if we destroyed you, maybe you just sucked; or, hey, maybe you just pretended you were awesome because you REALLY just live in wagons rolling around the prairies being terrible at everything you DO
)where was I
Right
 The plot's not that great
 The gameplay, well, it could be better, I suppose
 The Fade is so bad, that people have modded it out, and Orzammar, once you head out of the city and into the caves beyond, is just awful
and yet I've beat it three times, played through the expansion, bought all the DLC religiously, and, despite all clear warning signs to the contrary, purchased a copy of Dragon Age II, which ended up being worse than a good number of people said
 But its lack of quality is fairly self-evident--it's been said that retail chains refused to stock a GOTY edition after EA approached them
So why do I love Dragon Age
I dunno
 It's certainly not because I'm a Baldur's Gate fan, as some have suggested, because I've never played Baldur's Gate before
 It's not because of Morrigan, who, up until Fenris, was the most anime (and not in a good way) character the series had
You might notice I'm bashing this game an awful lot, and I don't really mean to
 The truth is that I just don't know why I love this game as much as I do
 I have fun with it
 I think the systems are deep
 I've set up my team tactics so well that one time, when I forgot to pause, I left, and returned to find a boss dead
 I've beaten the game twice as a rogue (when it comes to Bioware games, the hardest difficulty is Rogue + Hardest Difficulty, always), and experimented with other classes; what's fascinating is how differently both of my rogue playthroughs were
 In one game, I was a melee archer
 In another, I was a backstabber with grenades
 I've discovered that the game isn't particularly fun if you roll mage--best to keep just one mage in your party, otherwise it kinda sucks
I love the characters who aren't Morrigan or Zevran
 No one is exactly what they appear to be when you first meet them, except for Dog, who is exactly what you would expect from a Dog who loves you unconditionally; this is a game that benefits tremendously from the player actually trying to role-play
 Leliana isn't just a puritanical priestess
 Wynne looooves alcohol
 Oghren isn't just a boozer, he's a man/dwarf with a broken heart
 Sten loves cookies and wants to go on adventures with you, which you'd never guess if you were intolerant of weird religions
So it seems weird to say that the actual combat isn't super compelling, the plot itself is rather boring and just another Bioware plot, so it's nothing special or good
 Plus and the main acts of the game are boring--the mage's tower's time spent in the Fade, EVERY SINGLE SECOND spent helping elves out, and the awful writing in Orzammar
And yet I've put two hundred and eighteen hours into it, I'd willingly play through it again, and I know I'd have fun doing it
I just can't tell you exactly why that is

If you are a fan of rpg's then you cannot let this game pass and give it a try, it has a really full lore in it for those that love it as well as a easy learning curve (gameplay wise) out of all the DA games this one is pretty much the best of all, sure it's the first one and the others may have some improvements but they don't get that feeling of acomplishment that this one gave
Pros:+ It has a replay value since you get to chose different paths in the story so you would need to play again and chose different options to fully see what this game has to offer
 + Mods
enough said; You can use mods to improve the feeling of the game plus add much more things to make a great game even better+ Great story
seriously we all now that the most important thing in a rpg it's the story so im happy to tell you that you wont be dissapointed by it
+ Amazing and immersive soundtrackCons:- Even tho i said that it has an easy learning curve, it might not be at the beginning so it can feel frustrating at first, just don't let this stop you from playing it
- It does require a little bit of grinding (money wise) but for some people it's not really a con, IF you are one of the people that hates grinding you will have to here but its not annoyingly long like some games
And that's it
I really recommend this game if you want to play a classic rpg because that's what this is, a classic and a must play

I'm writing this review to say a few things
Notice: My hours don't match how much time I've actually logged, as I've been playing with Origin (yeah, I know)
1: f5 is the quicksave button
 That button is your friend
2: Don't break the quest "Cammen's Lament
" Meaning, finish that before you do anything else should you accept it
 I mean it
 Actually, just look up how not to break it
 It is stuck in my quest log, un-completable, and I am irritated
3: Try not to rage too much when getting stuck on the top stair
 Go at it quickly from an angle
 Or rage
 I feel that
Now why I'm using Origin
 For some unknown reason, this game ceased working for me
 Luckily, Steam provides you with the CD key for this game, which allowed me to activate it on Origin
 I have had no issues there (though I did have to start over as my saves and character refused to load)
Despite everything I just wrote, I reccomend this game with every fibre of my being
 I have clearly had a few issues, but this is a fantastic game despite them
 There are mods, I'm sure, to fix the issues I listed above
 Also, I almost aggressively regret not buying the Ultimate Edition
 Don't be me
 Don't buy the standard edition and regret it
 Don't break the quest
 Try not to get angry at stairs
Posted: 30 August, 2016
Buy the ultimate edition
 Install
 Load up the game
 Lose 400 hours of your life, get divorced, the kids start calling the post man "daddy" and you lose all feelings in your legs
 Bang Morrigan
 All worth it
 One of the greatest RPG's I have ever played

The best in the franchise, even at its age

After 5 years playing this game I'm still amazed that I can still find new possibilities
Bioware was at its apex
 A well crafted RPG following most of the elements from Baldur's Gate 2 and at the same time modernized and inovative for its time
"You can choose out of 3 classes and 3 races different origins and embark on a journey as a Grey Warden to defend Fereldan from the 5th Blight and a civil war
"That was enough for me to get hyped with this game
 As an old school gamer I had to play it
The main quest at first seemed to be one of those generic RPG stories where you have to raise an army to defeat a great evil
In part it may be true, but there are so many surprises along the way, lots of ways to achieve victory and amazing well written characters and companions
Aside from that you have amazing side quests that will mix with the main quest, instead of being generic "read & fetch" side quests
More than that YOU can be either a legend remembered as a good hearted hero during a time of dispair and suffering or a profiteer that only cares about gold, glory and power
Ahh, how great Bioware was
 Instead of creating amazing sequels (DA2 and DAI), Bioware decided to simplify what was once an epic Dark Fantasy RPG to please both casual players and SJW,
the kind of people that can't grasp the beauty of a tactical game with brutal moments from a medieval universe
Posted: 22 January, 2015
Great game, but get the ultimate edition instead of this
The ultimate edition is the only way to get dlc for this game short of buying them individually from Bioware, and you can't upgrade to the ultimate edition if you have the base game
Posted: 3 May, 2014
This is a great game
 First of all, this game surpassed my opinion highly on Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and I adored that game
 I believe that I got this game on sale, but I would gladly buy it again, full price, if I had the money
 Second of all, my mom plays this game on my laptop instead of on the Xbox, which is nice, because she hadn't touched the game in a long time
 When she saw that I had this game, she asked to play and has now raised my time on the game up to 66 hours
 The greatest parts of it, in my opinion, is the freedom to choose
 Of course, the story-line is always the same, but there are minor differences that still change the ending, at least a little bit
 Other great parts of this game include loveable characters, balanced gameplay, and moderately difficult combat
 One bad part that my dad complains about is the amount of talking in this game
 It has an excess, so be wary
I would definitely reccomend this game to a friend
Posted: 26 June
Really fun game filled with hilarious dialogue
 There's a lot of little quests to do, but you technically only get one day to do them: The day starts as Monday, do whatever you want, the day ends
 The next day is Monday x2; it's like Groundhog day, but you keep whatever items/money you collected that day which is stored in your room
The gameplay is repetitive (you're repeating days), but you choose different dialogue/actions to try and complete different quests
 The puzzles are complex, but the game has a "Hints" menu to help guide you a bit
 If you mess up, you can either restart the entire day, or you can restart the current room/class period you're in which is really helpful
My only complaint is that there's no "Skip Dialogue" button; dialogue can be a little long sometimes and it'd be nice to skip it especially when you've heard the same lines 50 times
The main quests took me about 5 hours; I still have cards I could collect
 Definitely a fun little game for $5
 Don't think I'd play it from scratch again, but would love to watch friends play and see their reactions
Posted: 20 June
I really appreciate the dark humour in this game
 This game looks simple, but seems to be quite complex with flexible playstyles
One day you could be a snitch and eliminate kids you don't like, and in another day you could be a nice kid that does favours for people
 This game is worth the money

Early Access Review
ok so i bought this game because it looked like a silly little bit of fun, my mate and I just spent the last 8 HOURS completing whats available to us, and had a blast the whole time
 this game has some crazy personality in it and so many winding crazy paths, and don't forget the brutailty thats just hilarious
 there was only one or two times we had to look up a way to get a hidden card
 but this game is well thought out and well made
i'm really not crazy about these "find all the hidden objects/things games" but i had such a great time
 i'd love love love to see more days later on down the line, i'd even toss another 4 or 5 bucks in for a tuesday and so on
 so much fun
 also Nugget is the man
Posted: 22 June
A very fun game, however it is only suited for a specific person
 If you hate trial and error games where you find your self constantly restarting the game because you realised you did something wrong, very difficult tasks and "bad graphics" then this is not the game for you
 I cant wait for the next game to be released
Posted: 27 June
Things said by wife as she observed me playing:"hehe, bouncing boobies""Nugget wants you to eat his nugget
Posted: 28 June
This is a clever little game
 Not too long, but with lots of weirdness and secrets buried in it for a ridiculous amount of replay value
Posted: 15 June
I bought this game as a joke, thinking I would be returning it within the next 30 minutes
 I ended up playing it for 4 hours not even realizing how long it had been
 I can honestly say, from a pretty picky person when it comes to indie/low budget games, this game was quite good
 I liked the open endedness and variety of missions and possibilities
 At first it didn't make much sense but I ended up really liking it
 If you have $5 and are looking for an entertaining time killer, I would defintely reccomend this game
 9/10
 Only thing that I wish was that the cards you pick up did something
Posted: 2 July
I picked this up on a whim, thinking
 hell, can't be awful for $4
 Then I wound up getting four hours of gameplay out of it
The game is deceptively simple: you're stuck in a Groundhog Day-style loop, reliving the same Monday over and over
 Every day there are phases: before school, morning class, lunch, recess, and show & tell
 Your mission is to try to figure out how to uncover the weird stuff going on at the school
When you complete one of the NPC's storylines, you unlock a permanent item that stays with you when the day loops over
 As you complete more and more of the NPC quests, you'll get more and more items
 Then you'll have to use those items in order to finally beat the game
It's dead simple, but the "same day" loop makes this feel very much like a puzzle game
 How do you get that one character to be in a certain room at lunch
 How do you ensure somebody will have the item you need by recess
 How can you earn as much money as possible before the day ends
 Though it's simple, the adventure/puzzle aspect of the game really works
The writing is funny, the characters are absurdly over the top
 Gore and cursing and abortion and drug abuse and more
 The game is definitely not for kids, but it doesn't really feel like it's trying too hard

Early Access Review
At this point, I'll buy anything that Sean Young is involved with
 Magicite and RogueLands were fantastic, and while Kindergarten is wayyyy different, it shines just as brightly
What a really fresh game we have here
 I've not played anything quite like this
 First off, you should know that Sean's games typically are usually not in Early Access long
 This one is apparently for the most part done, with just bugs and smoothing rough edges left
 I think it needs an ending, or so I've heard
 Ok, how to describe this
 Essentially, you are playing through a day as a child in kindergarten, but the day loops Groundhog Day-style
 It is dialogue heavy
 You have an inventory, and make choices such as who to be friends with, and what to do with items
 Part of the 'game' is learning what is the 'game' and how to play it
 I'll leave it at that
A few things you should know
 The music is good, although a bit repetitive
 Just like the movie Groundhog Day, this game can be repetitive and is probably best played in spurts
 Try to finish one run, then take a break kind-of-thang
 It really shines with the humor - I laughed out loud several times and thats not typical for me
Pros:+Utterly fresh; I've not played anything like this - and I love that it takes risks and blazes a very unique path+It knows its scope and size and doesn't over-reach+Humor is outstanding+Makes me smile while playing+It's fun figuring out what 'the game' is+Too cheap+Controller supportCons:-Repetitive by nature (the mechanic is built around this)-Music could use some polish/variety-Probably not much replay value when you finish it, but thats ok because it's quite cheapIf you love indie games, please pick this up and support a genuinely great developer who delivers

Another one of those games that I wish steams' review system had a grey "neutral" rating for, because "It's complicated" doesn't even begin to discribe how I feel about this release of shuffle
 While I am happy to see the day Shuffle is on steam
 god so many issues
This is essentually the Playstation 2 all ages version of shuffle "On the Stage" which removed all adult content and added two additional routes (Mayumi and Kareha) as a reason for anyone who owned or played the original to have a reason to buy it
I, like many it seems from what I've read in the other reviews, bought this for those additional routes as its the first time we've had them in offical english (I am specifically a Mayumi fan) and while I am semi satisfied with what I got
 This really is a disappointing and inferior game to what we could and should be getting at this point
I am not going to sugarcoat it even as a fan of the series
 Shuffle is old, and has a limited appeal to people, yet they are pulling these blundered moves lets examine things:1) The steam version being non-adult
While this isn't a huge surprise, it is a little disappointing in an era where there are ways to provide adult content and not step on people's toes (taking examples of Nekopara, Huniepop, etc) where a one step disconnection from steam allows people to get their adult content and still sell an all ages product which allows neither market to be alienated
 It really is getting to a point where there is no acceptable excuse for this and either YumeHeaven or Navel is too lazy to look into these avenues, or does not want to give us the adult content, either one is not something I agree with
2) Giving "On the Stage" instead of "Essence+"
The first issue about adult content is annoying but like in the PS2 era from which On the Stage originated, they gave two new routes to compensate it
 Essence+ is a shuffle release that came later that also added adult content to said routes
 Lets once again not sugar coat things; Shuffle is a game that's 12 years old, Essence+ is 7 years old
 Its not a stretch to believe at the very least if they are going to deny people adult content, to atleast give us Essence+'s level of routes and options
 So why give us every single mediocre nickel and dime version in between
These companies seem to live in a world where they think people do not research products and are unaware that stuff like Essence+ has existed for many years
 Which is frankly insulting if you think we're that stupid, it should have been the definitive release of shuffle cause its likely the only one steam might ever see
3) Weird localization choices
I am not going to go too heavy into this cause its barely a footnote for me, but it has annoyed some people so its worth atleast touching upon
 The basic idea of this is the mangagamer script was very well done and established a certain expectation to what things would be called, the YumeHeaven scripts make some completely uneccessary and often bizzare changes
 While I can personally survive these changes, its perfectly logical to why some people are very upset
 In the end Navel/YumeHeaven you should seriously step up your game because while this sold to people, it seriously was weaksauce and many wont be so eager to jump on the next thing you sell
Posted: 23 November, 2016
The short of this review is that the Steam release of Shuffle
 is plagued by various design issues, and is an inferior version of the game to the original Mangagamer release
 If you really enjoy Kareha and Mayumi, it might be worth picking it up
 Other than that, there isn't a reason to get this one
 Phsyical editions of the original Mangagamer Shuffle are still available on J-list, thankfully, so look to get one of those
If you're looking for a more detailed breakdown, read on
:: About the Steam Release ::This version of Shuffle
 is a port and translation of the PS2 All-Ages release called Shuffle
 on the stage
 The game has 2 new routes compared to the last English version
 It's a completely new translation by YumeHaven following Navel terminating their partership with Mangagamer
 You can't buy the 18+ edition of Shuffle
 anymore
 There's not a patch available or anything
 This also isn't the best and most complete version of the game: Shuffle
 Essence+ has 4 more routes than this version
 It's been out for about 7 years now, so people seem a bit annoyed that we're getting this version instead of that one
 Although I would've preferred Essence+ to be translated, I'm sure it just wasn't an option
 Maybe if the game sells well, we could see Essence+ released stand alone or as a DLC for this game
EDIT: Apparently this version of Shuffle drastically changes the dramatic parts of the original to be more kid friendly
 I would wager that it's not because of the western launch they did that though, it's probably just how the game was changed for it's PS2 release
 For that reason, I'm going to suggest buying the Mangagamer version instead of the Steam version if possible
 You wouldn't just be buying it for the H scenes, you would be buying it for the proper tension and drama
:: Functional Issues ::One of the biggest problems with this game is it's missing features
 Functions that you've probably come use to having are just up and missing with this game
 The original Shuffle runs in an engine dedicated to Visual Novels, and it definitely shows
 You have lots of options, the 'CTRL' key is the default skipping button, you can use your scroll wheel to view the text log, you can change the text speed from a turtle's pace to instant, the transitions are all smooth
 Using your noggin, you can probably guess why I'm talking about all the things the original release of Shuffle can do
 I mean, the title of this section is "Functional Issues", right
 Everything I just mentioned is straight up missing in the steam release of Shuffle
 Really
You can't skip unread text, and the only way to skip text is through the spacebar button
 It's also a toggle, which means there isn't a "push to skip" button
 If you try to skip to a certain line in text you've already read, you're liable to end up going right past it because you untoggled the skip function too late
 No problem, you might say
 I'll just return to that line using the text log
 Well
 You can't
 The original Shuffle release doesn't let you rollback the scene either, but this is a completely new version with a completely new engine
 Why wasn't this implemented
 Want to see the message history using the scroll wheel
 Too bad, hope you like hitting the "H" key
 Also, there isn't a way to hide the text box
 Yep, you're stuck with it
 Want to see the character art without the dialogue bothering you
 The only option is to open the right click menu
 Which dims the entire scene and draws a dull looking set of options in front of you, "Save", "Load", "Settings", "Save and Quit", and "Quit"
 The last two actually quit to the main menu, despite just being called "Quit"
 Let's talk about the "Settings" option though
You only have four options for in game volume control and text speed
 Four
 As mentioned earlier, none of those four options for the text speed are "Instant"
 Well
 That's pretty much it
 Thankfully, the settings do allow you to manually turn character voices off and on
 Oh, and it also has a kind of worthless resolution mode
 At first glace, you might think it's useful
 But it's not
 All it does is allow you to choose whether you want to have the sky themed border art
 If you set the game to one of the 4:3 options, like 800x600, then fullscreen it on a widescreen display, it'll scale properly and just have black borders instead
 So, the resolution options do basically nothing unless you want to use it in windowed mode
 Which is good, but if that's the case, why can't we just stretch the game window to the size we want
 It's not like the border art is real proper art, it's just a texture laid out over the unused portions of the screen
The one good thing I can say about this release is that it has controller support
 Definite kudos for that, every Visual Novel release should have controller support
 That one good thing does pretty much nothing to cover up the many, many issues this title has though
:: Translation ::This is one of those titles that don't use honorifics for whatever reason
 You can hear the characters say them, but they aren't shown in translation
 It's jarring
 There's no reason to be afraid of honorifics with a game like Shuffle
 The vast majority of the playerbase jumping into this title will know what all the honorifics mean
 Things like miso soup get mentiioned in the game without a proper explanation, so it's just baffling
 The problem is most exemplified in Kareha's route, where Tsubomi calls the main character "Rin Onii-san", but the game translates it as "Handsome"
 That's definitely wrong
 Even those of us completely unfamiliar with Japanese know that much
 "Big Bro Rin" doesn't sound natural in English at all, but it wouldn't be an issue to begin with if honorifics were used
 It's made even more confusing by the fact that at different points in the game both Kareha and Asa are referred to with "-Senpai"
 For future translations done by YumeHaven, I hope this will change
 Other than that, the translation is quite nice
 It likes to shy away from Japanese onomatopoeia though
 Another good example from Tsubomi is how her "Kyaa
"s are translated as "Eeek
"s
 Both of these words just feel too different
 It's a situation where keeping the original is better
 It's not like "Kyaa
" means anything, it's just the noise she's making
:: The Two New Routes ::Mayumi and Kareha's routes are nice, but they're short and lack conflict
 Mayumi's at least has some conflict, but it's nothing like you'd come to expect from the game if you've played the Mangagamer version
 Kareha's literally has no conflict
 So, if you're looking for drama or an emotional ride, you won't be getting it
 I'd suggest buying this one for around $10 on sale if you've played the original Shuffle and liked either Mayumi or Kareha
My uncomfirmed assumption is that the two new character routes are probably much improved in Essence+
 If I do ever get around to playing that version of the game, I'll update this review and point out any differences
:: Conclusion ::If you can buy the Mangagamer version, buy the Mangagamer version
 If you play that one and really like Mayumi and Kareha's characters, then good
 You've got taste
 Feel it out for yourself whether you want to spend the 20 dollars for both of their routes, because that's the only reason to get the steam version as things stand
 Best of luck to YumeHaven, and I'm hoping to see more and better releases from them in the future

I'm not very happy with this release of SHUFFLE
The only reason you should buy this version is to read the Mayumi and Kareha routes if they were a favorite of yours
 (Mayumi is mine btw)Now I don't know Steam's full policy on exposure, but I had been hoping that this re-release would be a bit of a best of both worlds
 Keeping the PS2 routes and the Essence+ routes while toning them down
 Instead of doing that, we get just the PS2 routes and the same riduclously bad censors that the PS2 version had
 This game doen't have to be E for everyone you know
 The censoring of the girls became too uneeded, almost making the game not make sense
 (I
E Primula's wet shirt, Mayumi's collision, Kaede's sewing scene) Though the Essence+ routes weren't great, why were they excluded
 If you're trying to make a ultimate release, why not keep all the add-ons
 The interface was also tuned down from the original game, making it just volume control basically
 I know not everyone has played SHUFFLE
 Essence+, but that version exceeds this one in every single way
tl;dr Find and buy the Mangagamer release of SHUFFLE
, It's a good VN
 Here's to hoping somebody translates the Essence+ version, it's superior

I wound not recomend this game to anyone as it is an all ages version
 There is a lot of content cut out and even a lot of content related the plot of each route
Posted: 11 January
It had the potential to be a great game but unfortunately due to content cuts, absurd censorship and several game breaking
bugs it has a lot to improve
 I loved what was there but what was missing was to big a part for it to be as good as it should have been
 Also several of the tags advertise content completely missing from the game
Edit most of the bugs have been fixed and the other one was due to a wrong setting
Posted: 22 November, 2016
I own the MG version of Shuffle
Since Mayumi didn't have a route there, I couldn't say no to this one even though I could have waited another few years for Essence to appear
I found out from the Discussions that this is a renamed version of a PS2 game called "Shuffle: On The Stage
"
This is an all-ages version of the game
That means that the mature content has been blotted out
Sometimes in a humorous fashion as scenes where the panty shots are hidden away are done in a way that you end up thinking that the heroine isn't wearing underwear
Then we get to the less humorous aspect of the censorship
I've just completed Asa's route
I like the extra scenes
And the basic idea is the same
 But then we find that the dark undertones have been toned down by 90% to make it child friendly
 I'll say this right now, they don't use a box cutter
They use a mystical necklace that sucks magic power
Even worse, the moments leading up to this scene lack the tension that was in the original
The character is just fine, you just need to fix a small problem
How small
Obviously it isn't life threatening if the one in question is up and about the next day
It was originally a serious problem
They were even hospitalized in the Anime
The cheery extra scenes hurt more than help in this regard
I was particularly impressed with how the CG is the exact same as the MG version despite the above changes
I thought it was losing magic, why is there blood
This game is All-Ages, but that means that the most powerful part of the scene has been defanged and you're left wanting as the scene's impact is inconsistent and feels too much like a joke to be taken seriously
I'm afraid to try out the other routes because of this
Gameplay:10 - 20 hours of gameplay depending on reading speed / degree of completion / usage of skip
Traditional visual novel setup where you have 1 common route with choices that branches into different character routes
Unlike Choose-your-own-adventure games, choices do not alter how the common route plays out aside from minor differences to maintain consistency
This means that you'll end up seeing the same scenes and choices on subsequent playthroughs despite making a completely different first choice on the common route
I should mention that certain choices will reveal hidden scenes where you may be given additional choices
These hidden scenes are key to unlocking certain heroine routes
As I said before though, during the common route your choices do not cause the plot to deviate, so when you find a hidden scene, it will return to the common route eventually
The key to finding a route is by picking the right combination of choices
Thankfully, for those choices where the end result isn't obvious, this novel does provide a clue after each important choice indicating which girl would end up the happiest
Just gather up as many moments with her as you can
Graphics:This game allows you to set a 1920x1080 resolution, but it's sort of a cop out
Unlike the title screen, the game itself has the traditional 4:3 aspect ratio of the original
The rest of the space is filled in with a cloud backdrop on the left and right side of the screen
Even though you don't get HD CG, I'm okay with this since you can fullscreen without getting distorted sprites on widescreen monitors
In the MG version, I had to either play windowed or tamper with my graphics card settings to keep the game's 4:3 aspect ratio
This visual novel isn't one of the recent ones, so you'll find that while it is voiced, you won't get the dynamic animation that you would find in NekoPara, Go Go Nippon, or Corona Blossom
Sound:In a recent patch, the music volume has been dialed down so that it doesn't drown out the voices
The voices still aren't as crisp and clear as I would like though
I'm not sure if it's because it's a port or the VA's are using a low quality microphone, but it feels like the characters are speaking to you from the other end of the room
Controls:You can use a gamepad to play
That's nice
Sorta, you can really only use it to advance and select choices
But it allows you to sit farther away from the computer while playing
Maybe even in a reclined pose
A recent patch has greatly improved the playability of the game
First, the skip key is the [Ctrl] button now
This may seem weird on the english speaking market, but for those that are familiar with Japanese Light Novels, this is the standard skip key
History can be accessed by scrolling up on your mouse wheel in addition to hitting the "H" key
The UI overlay can be hidden with the space key
The config screen of this PS2 port is limited compared to traditional PC VN's
 While you do get the standard stuff, a lot of the quality of life options that you would normally get are missing
 For instance, there is no option to skip read/unread messages when skipping
 And there isn't an option to continue playing voice when mouse clicked to end text layout
 Nor is there an option to lay out text instantly at fastest speed
The songs in the sound gallery now loop so you can keep your hands off if you want to hear a song again
Yay
Language:Japanese Voice
English text, no honorifics
Translation is okay
English is fluent and typos are uncommon
 I'm tempted to call Nerine's shortened-name, Rina, a typo though
Story:This part is currently incomplete since I am replaying the game
 I plan to look for significant differences between this version of the game and the original Shuffle
Most of the changes are generally to fit in the 2 new character routes
It makes me happy to see Mayumi with more screen time
Some scenes have been expanded and moved around
 For instance, observer reactions play a bigger part; it helps with the immersion because now we get glimpses of how the bystanders are reacting
Some of them are even voiced with choice lines like "she's like a doll
"
It's not just the bystanders, the main characters have more moments too
Certain scenes have been removed like that one with the crazy KKKaede fan and its followup
The "bodyguards" are given a brief mention in the text, but without the acting you aren't aware of their true danger
I kinda prefer how the original laid out the routes
In this version of the game, the common route sort of blends into the heroine routes
While you will unmistakably enter a heroine route, common route events will still occur inside of that route
In the original, this blending didn't happen, once you were on the heroine route the story completely changed
The reason why this even bothers me is because there is an event with Kareha that's basically bugged
 This common route event will still happen even when you are on a heroine's route, and if you pick the "right" choice, you will find yourself forced out of that heroine's route and into Kareha's
Conclusion:(6/10)- Those that haven't played the game are going to wonder what's so great about it as the serious moments have been turned into bad comedy
- Those that have played the MG version will be disgusted at the 4kids quality, it's-not-blood-it's-ketchup, censoring ruining the message
For the Mayumi and Kareha fans, still checking the Mayumi and Kareha routes to see if they're worth playing, but I wouldn't buy this to collect it
- With the new patch, in addition to the thoughtfulness of the screen resolution and gamepad input, the game has become comfortable to play

Ill start off by saying that i havnt played any of the other versions of this game (so cant comment on them)and that i got this with a random coupon and using steam cash for selling a card from a game I got for free (in short I got it for free) after coming home from the pub, so my expectations weren't that high
This is a multi path branching choice based VN following some pretty standard VN norms of the protagonist being put into a situation where he has a chance at a number of 'good looking gals'
+OK skeleton for the story to hang fromok art for the time of releasegood number of branches -UI is poor (shows this versions console roots)the story has obviously been butchered to fit into 'all ages' and not rewritten with any skill
There are worse VN's out there but I wouldn’t get this unless it was on a 50% (or greater) sale as this is a lazy attempt to try and cash in on the 'cute' market from the publisher
 The story has far to many fade to black/white screens and its obvious where huge chunks of the original story has been hacked out just to make it 'all ages' (probably from when in went over to the consoles)
 There is no skip forward ability which on a multi path vn means you are stuck clicking through long stretches of repeated material
 The protagonist is actually more believable than most you’ll find in other VN's and the girls paths are all fairly coherent (if you ignore the gaps in the story) and the supporting characters are good if a little over the top
Its a bit of a shame as I imagine this would have been a very good VN if its 'all ages' conversion had been handled with any skill or tact and if they had but some very basic functionality into the UI

Shuffle
 is a charming, quick to medium length traditional visual novel suited for newcomers and veterans of the genre
 While i'm no veteran I have played my fair share of the genre and found it to be a very pleasant experience
 I would consider myself a quick reader so logging 13 hours in completeing every route and every CG I would say is pretty decent for what I paid
 (Bought the game during a sale
) Of course everyone elses mileage may vary because of read speed and/or auto play
As one of the only ways (legally) to get the game now due to the fact Manga Gamer no longer sells the uncensored version on their site it is unfortunate that the version most accessible is not the 'complete' version
 However the experience isn't too badly hampered, due to the fact that this is ported from the PS2 version and is pretty polished
 And because it's the PS2 version Kareha's and Mayumi's route are also within the game bringing the heroine count to hefty 7, compared to the already healthy 5
And if you are desperate for the adult content for research and compltionist purposes you can find it online pretty easily

It's a good visual novel and the anime is good too 8/10
Posted: 30 January
this version of the game is alright
 but it isn't mature
 don't know why a mature tag is on this game lol
 the transitions from one scene to another seems to happen instantaniously so it feels like you acceidently skipped over something when you didn't so you end up reloading just to be sure nothing was skipped
 just an annoyance really
i recommend this game to teens and young adults
 otherwise just move along
Posted: 25 November, 2013
Don't judge this game by its combat system
 It's serviceable
 Ok
 Nothing at all fantastic
 Reminds me a bit of Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker but actually marginally fun
 But that's all just filler
 My recommendation is to level stealth and pistols because they're absurdly overpowered and you can get through the game very quickly with them
The real gameplay is the dialogue system and your interaction with characters
 It's really something else
 Every dialogue choice is timed and you have to have you options picked before the other character finishes speaking
 There are no awkward pauses between lines and it all flows like good dialogue in a film
 That might sound like you don't have control or you won't be able to react fast enough but that is not true
 Your options are presented in a succinct but clear way
 Usually they are just provided as a single-word description of your overall tone that allows you to quickly process your choices and decide how you want to respond
 Sometimes your choices don't have obvious consequences and how the player character acts may catch you off-guard, but those situations are very rare
But as important as your breath of choices in these encounters with characters are the consequences of them
 While the game follows a somewhat fixed revenge story your relationship with each character will change your experience of that story hugely
 There is a multi-layer conspiracy for you to uncover and if you do not play your cards right there will be parts of it and roles played by characters that you won't even realise you missed
 Everyone has secrets and your relationship with them will affect what you learn about them
And that is not to say you should buddy up with everyone
 Having characters hate you can be to your advantage
 A poor relationship with one character may actually endear you to someone they dislike
 Making them angry may cause them to make poor decisions that benefit you
There's a huge depth to the story and it really does react to everything you do
 Characters will reference your past decisions and attitudes and it will shape the details of the story you find yourself in
 Your choices matter
 Your relationships matter
 That is what Alpha Protocol is all about
Posted: 12 June, 2015
It's like Mass Effect meets James Bond
In lovely Obsidian tradition, the game has more bugs than an African Jungle and enough cut content to make a second game
All in all, it's pretty good
Posted: 21 December, 2014
Without a doubt the best modern spy game I've heard of
 I'm not a fan of wordiness, so here's the basic rundown, pluses and minuses and stuff
+ brilliant stealth system
 People notice gunshots (but not silenced ones), dead bodies, themselves being shot
 loads of stuff+ skill customization is wonderful
 By end-game of my stealth build I could walk into a room invisible, kill 5 people and walk out without anyone seeing me
 Leeroy Jenkins run: kick in the door, empty the clip, everyone's dead before the alarm's raised
+ boss fights were pretty good
 They all had features to make them unique, and it was fun to fight all of them except non-spiked Brayko+ dossiers were super useful, both as flavor-text and in-game
 I loved pausing before the end to read all the stuff I'd learned about everyone+ cutscenes were well-done
Posted: 31 October, 2014
I'll start off by saying this game was an unexpected gem
 Alpha Protocol is one of the best RPGs I have every played
 The premise of the game is original, the dialogue is superb, and the story kept me interested
 I felt that the characters were quite easy to get attached to after a few dialogues
 There is one major flaw this game has, and that is the combat and stealth systems
Combat and stealth, or just interacting with enemies in general, is extremely clunky in this game
 At times it is frustratingly bad (for example, shooting enemies from <20 ft away and missing with half the magazine), but in my opinion the excellent dialogue, story telling, and decision making all make up for it
 As other reviewers have said, another notable aspect of this game is that the decisions you make in this game actually change the way the story unfolds, unlike most games where they only change the ending
 I think this gives the game more than a little additional replay value
Other notes: the graphics are excellent compared to other games released around the same time
 The sounds are of high quality
 The voice acting is great, in my opinion
 The level design is rather simple, but it works
 The AI are pretty stupid, but that can be a pro or con depending on how you look at it
If you are looking for a game that is rich in story and is addictive, this is the game for you
 If you are looking for a combat oriented game with developed combat mechanics, you may want to try something else
 I have to take 1 off for the crappy gameplay, but this game still gets a 9/10 from me
Posted: 25 September, 2015
I usually make the main conclusion of the game in the first sentence
 But Alpha Protocol is so suave, that it needs personal and quite thorough preparation to make an appropriate statement
This game comes from the Obsidian studio, which is known for taking already acknowledged action-RPG systems, and then remaking them into much deeper, truthful RPG
 It scares many old fans of those previous games, but undoubtedly earns some new admirers from those who can see farther than one step ahead
 It was with Neverwinter Nights 2, Fallout New Vegas, Dungeon Siege III
Alpha Protocol was the first game released by Obsidian which was not a part of a big franchise
 It was made with limited resources, powerful publisher (who overhyped the project, but made it un-cool), and on the engine of Mass Effect
 While limited resources were not a problem to make an outstanding game, other two biases its fall in the release
People were expecting another Mass Effect, in cloak-and-dagger setting
 But Alpha Protocol had much less pathos and shooting, than in the beloved and iconized sci-fi world, and much more responsibility for every action, than everybody was expecting
 So for some time Alpha Protocol became a pariah in the world of the Mass Effect fanboys, who kept a majority in the gaming trends and patterns
I admire Mass Effect for huge and rich on details sci-fi universe
 I enjoyed playing ME games
 But even more I am enjoying some pen-and-paper games based on ME universe, but using different mechanics
 GURPS is good, Savage Worlds - even better
 I’m telling you, that mechanics in the ME games is far from desirable for the immerse RPG play
However guys from the Obsidian took it and turned into a quite decent and even bright thing
 They added a timer to dialogs (field agents supposed to think fast) and they added perks, events and consequences to almost every line we are speaking and every turn we are making in the game process
While Alpha Protocol is relatively short, it is so hard and intense in terms of character development, that many players just failed with good choices there, made a weak set of skills and were forced to leave the game unsatisfied
 Of course, they all made thumbs down reviews, and that drowned the game on the market
 Only now, after 5 years after release, the tide is finally turning
 The numbers of players who managed to played it like it was supposed to is growing, so the Metascore is slightly raising better
 You can see current state of minds just by look for combination of Phil Owen+Alpha Protocol (see commentary)
 Although I’m not totally agreed with that fella point of view, well, yeah, generally, Alpha Protocol IS one of the greatest RPG of the given time
It is a great RPG – if played right
 And how are you supposed to do that
 When making choices in that game, just make it like a responsible, adult man, who really can play in the cloak-and-dagger games
 As always, there are two main approaches, one silent, other is assault, and as a third option, you can try to mingle and twist (sometimes speaking saves much more bullets than stealth)
 But please
 Please, do think beforehand doing something
 Even when you have to think very fast, you still Need to Think, and not just picking lines and turns occasionally
Summarizing:Alpha Protocol is one of the best current-gen RPG I’ve played, I’ve paid for it twice, and I don’t think it was wasted
 Quite opposite, it is one of those rare titles in my book, which totally worth the money
As of gameplay, you got a skill tree and dynamics from Mass Effect, but greatly enhanced towards wagering a given role of a field agent of US secret service
 You hack computers, breaking locks and skulls, you mastering pistol and sniper rifle, but, the most significant, you collecting info on your opponents, and that info, used at the right time, is your strongest feature
As of bugs, so commonly commemorated as a game’s main fault… I must make a statement that I didn’t see any significant and game-breaking flaw by all 5 years I’ve known that game
 I’ve played it from its release, with quite a humble hardware, on the 4 different PC systems, and everything was working smoothly
 Always
 Well, AI of the opponents sometimes was performing some questionable tricks, but that’s not a bugs pattern
Overall mark is 9/10, and I’d really like to see some more stuff like this
 From Obsidian, or from some other inspired and gifted people – that’s irrelevant
 As long as it's at least that non-linear in choices and consequences, it's fine
Posted: 18 September, 2013
This game is highly underrated, the story is a lot of fun, the dialogue system is great, you can play in completely different ways, both in terms of the gameplay (stealth vs going in guns blazing) and in terms of the storyline
 Yes, this game worth picking up if you can get it
Posted: 30 August, 2014
Imagine, if you will, a combination of early Splinter Cell and Deus Ex: HRs little brother, with a drop of occasional Saints Row humor choices in your dialogue options - all presented in a janky but "holy-$h1t-this-is-fun" package
That's Alpha Protocol, a game where your actions and attitude actually impacts the story and peoples' reactions to you, for good or worse
 Yes, this is the game that actually DELIVERS on the promises of so many other RPG-likes
My first playthrough ended with me maxing out my stealth skill, enabling me to knife party my way through enemies as a ghostly apparition
 My dialogue choices consisted mostly of flirting when inappropriate, threatening with executions (sometimes before enforcing them), and punching people who I believed deserved it
I have 400+ games in my backlog, and all I can think about at the moment, is how I'm gonna play THIS game again next
Also, when in doubt (as I had to learn the hard way, and with a little help), remember that the answer to:-world hunger-environmental pollution-the financial crisis-your John Smith small p3n1s that needs 3 inches RIGHT NOW-space exploration-and a happy life in general
is Chain Shooting
So write that down for when you're gonna play Alpha Pro
Oh, who am I kidding, you're gonna play it right now, of course

Alpha Protocol is a single player action RPG game with branching story dialogue based on your choices that will affect the way your game progresses and ends
 The game has a modern spy movie setting ala James Bond/Mission Impossible
 There are dossiers to read through, webs of secrets to uncover, and enough cloak and daggery to make you question who’s side you really are on and who is playing who, typical spy stuff
 HOW IS THIS AN RPG
:This type of action RPG game has a single hero, third person camera
 You will earn level ups and have dozens of skills to choose from and have different weapons and gear to upgrade
 Depending on how you approach some missions you will have access to side quests within your current mission that could potentially benefit you afterwards in areas such as the black market for example
IS THIS A SANDBOX RPG
:The game is not a free roamer and is fairly straight forward to keep the story moving along, it is broken up into the main hubs of Saudi-Arabia, Rome, Moscow and Taipei
 However the order of what areas you decide to visit are entirely up to you
EXTENDED REPLAY VALUE
:Completed the game as the sneaky, non-lethal, silenced weapons, computer hacker, suave, smooth talker type
 Why not try playing as the shoot first ask questions later, shotgun toting, explosives expert, confrontational, hard headed type
 Or a mixture of both or something completely different
 The game has multiple dialogue choices and event outcomes depending on what type of play style you go with
 You will definitely get your money’s worth from Alpha Protocol if you decide to do multiple play throughs
Admittedly most of my time spent on Alpha Protocol was on the PS3 and I basically did a speed run for nostalgia’s sake on the PC/Steam version
 If this is your first time going through Alpha Protocol you are realistically looking at around 20+ hours give or take per go through
It’s too bad SEGA didn’t commission a sequel to Alpha Protocol due to poor initial sales showings, but that shouldn’t deter you from experiencing this gem of a game, very underrated
Posted: 5 June, 2015
ProsChoices influence present and future events in a significant mannerMass effect-like RPG elementsYou can be a spy like Archer (announcing to people you meet that you're a spy and trying to be "suave")ConsLevels are a bit linear which might be disappointing to people expecting a hardcore Stealth game
Some minigames might seem irritating to peopleStealth only builds suffer at Boss fights (not impossible though)No tactical turtlenecks 
Posted: 27 November, 2013
An amazing display of interactive storytelling
 The gameplay is a bit unrefined, but the experience is overall enjoyable as a tense James Bond-ish spy story
8/10
Posted: 13 June
Gorgeous atmosphere that stays with you long after you finish the game
 Mature story and consequences
 An unforgettable game that is in a category of its own
 Like it or hate it, you must try it out for yourself, since there is nothing quite like it out there
Posted: 19 January, 2014
I backed this game on Kickstarter very early on, basically after having read the words "turn based strategy" and "vikings" and had very high hopes for the project
During the first hour of play I was entusiastic and impressed with the artwork, the graphical style, the music and the combat system
 It runs well, I encountered no major bugs, and the story starts very intense and engrossing
Now, after nearing the end of my first (and, most likely, only) playthrough I can sum up my personal experience with a single sentence: I learned to *thoroughly* hate this game
I'm terribly sorry, I desperately wanted to like this, but with every tedious, frustrating and boring hour of gameplay I had to concede, that just about *every* design choice made by Stoic seems to go diametrically against my personal preferences
Trying to cast an objective vote, I'd rate it about 5 out of 10, because there are undoubtedly many things good about the game, but the essence of what it's about - having fun, being motivated and enjoying the time spent playing - simply doesn't happen
TBS is the very definition of a railroaded game
 More than that, it actually *feels* like more than half of the time I'm actually watching pointless, endlessly repeating nice backgrounds scrolling past, while nothing happens
 Events are scarce, and when they happen, they kill my motivation and the RPG aspect
 Because, frankly, I'm NOT making decisions
 I'm playing a random guessing game, in most cases with absolutely *no* clue on what the consequences of the 4 "choose your answer" alternatives *might* even be
 I hate playing a game where I don't even know the rules, and I hate winning every battle and then losing my heroes (and the associated investment
) to random dialogue events
The world map is like a bad joke on my expense, as it serves absolutely *no* function in the game but as a "choose your flavour text" library
 It feels like there's an entire aspect of the game simply never implemented here
Same goes for character development and resource management
 Both are oversimplified, shallow and simply feel completely unfinished
 Each character has one single item slot, and the items available are nothing special
 Abilities are pretty much predetermined, and dividing 10 points you *might* receive during 5 ranks isn't that big a deal towards diverity or individualization
There is one single resource for everything (renown) and one single sure way to acquire it (by killing enemies in combat)
 Sometimes you might draw a lucky card during the random dialogue guessing game and acquire some extra, but that's it
 As the resource is used to buy supplies, items *and* for leveling up your heroes, it comes down to either have your caravan starve or run around with level 1 heroes, despite them having earned several promotions on the battlefield
 That kills motivation on such an epic scale, and can't even begin to describe it
There are no side quests, no method to forage for food, trade, to gain extra renown or anything - remember, you are on one long, single track railway and never look left or right
 You will *never* feel in control of *anything* in this game
 For me, however, that is what gaming should be about
Even the combat system, one of the best parts otherwise, has several unnerving flaws that started bothering me in the long run:- You are forced to choose your team *and* the sequence in which they act *before* you know anything about the enemies you will face
 Why is there even a deployment phase at the begin of combat if all you do there is arrange the predetermined team on the board
 That placement will be void after one round of movement, a wrong party mix or suboptimal sequence will stay, however
- the way the two sides take turns is beyond silly
 If you face a single, strong opponent, that one will act 6 times for every ONCE your heroes do something, as it's always the *sides* that take turns
- one stat for hitpoints AND combat effectiveness basically means, that the battles are decided in the first round
 The side that starts taking hits is the side that will lose
 Always
 Without a way to regain strength, a single hit can de facto disable a hero
 The whole system is too simplistic, counter-intuitive and artificial
 Simple to understand, but never becomes fun for me
And another main grief is the complete absense of a save game feature
 Not because of technical problems, but simply because the designers want to forbid me to play the game any other way than to live with the random outcome of their nonsensical guessing games
 Sorry, folks, I'm 45 years old, have been playing games for 30 years and don't need *anyone* to tell me how to
 This arrogant patronizing annoys me to kingdom come
So, again, sorry Stoic for being so negative, but this game is so totally NOT my piece of cake
 Terrific art, great lore, good music and a stable game do NOT equal fun, I'm afraid
 Lots of bad design choices for me equal de-motivation, tedium, boredom and frustration
 Others might love this game, probably the majority
 But it's definitely 100% not for me - and the files were deleted after that completely silly, unfair and annoying final battle

It really pains me to do this because there are so many reasons to like this game
The problem is that The Banner Saga simply doesn't deliver what it promises
At the very beginning we are informed that at our decisions affect the game: THEY DON'T
 Despite the fact that they've created this vast and gorgeous world, steeped in lore and history, you can't even choose where to go
 You're firmly 'on-the-rails' for the entire game
 Occasionally, you get text based encounters where you get to make a decision, but having played Banner Saga a couple of times, I can tell you that most of these change nothing
 Sometimes one character or another dies, but it's trivial since they aren't really necessary anyway
At the very beginning we are treated to a beautiful animated cut-scene complete with voice acted dialogue, so you'd figure those would come up at key points in the game at least, right
 THEY DON'T
 Not even at the end
As the story develops, more and more layers are revealed: The gods are dead; the sun has stopped in the sky; there's a prophecy; there's tension and intrigue between characters and races, etc, etc
 NONE OF IT GOES ANYWHERE
 In a nut shell, the story is: survive until you get to the end boss - who has practically nothing to do with anything
The artwork is gorgeous, the concept (Viking Oregon Trail + Turn Based Strategy + Some RPG elements) is simple but it works
 But instead of using that simplicity to really open up the world, we're instead treated to a vast tableaux of untapped potential
 Maybe they're planning a sequel - and heck, I've put this many hours in already, I might even pick it up - but honestly, if a game leaves you feeling, "What, that's it
" It failed to deliver
EDIT: I DO NOT care that Banner Saga is part of a planned trilogy
 I WILL NOT base a review of a game on the potential of its sequel
 I think that would be a huge disservice to those choosing whether or not to spend money on THIS game

Despite always handing players a crummy hand, the consistent drawbacks in The Banner Saga are exhilarating, even if they are utterly exhausting as well
 While a sporadic bout of good news may flow through the caravan, the tone is clear
 It’s an arduous journey and one that will come with death at all times
 With an authentically illustrated ambience of harsh winters and closely followed characters, its story seen through tough conversations becomes that much more captivating
 Offering simple yet fully symbiotic combat options as an active counterpart to text, this game leaves little to be desired, except the will to survive

"A tale is but half told when only one person tells it
" - The Saga of Grettir the Strong, Chapter 46The gods are dead
 The sun never leaves the horizon, shining on boundless wastes of tundra
 The land is torn between men, giants known as varl and armored creatures known as dredge, neither carry any reason to trust each other
 A new day dawns, and the world is at the brink of turmoil, weary of old wars, always anticipating new wars; nearly void of hope
 In such a time, you take the role of leading a caravan across frozen wastes to its destiny
You play the parts of many characters, make their choices and endure the consequences while discovering the beautifully weaved tale of the realm
 Each and every character that you lead tell a story of their own in this Nordic, war-thorn saga
 Each choice that you make affects your chances of survival, and makes you approach one step closer to your destination
 The setting is incredibly rich, expected from any proper RPG game
 Every road, landmark, settlement, mountain or forest; every region depicted on the map contains its own local history
 The lore is complete and refreshing
To begin with, the game contains a diverse gameplay, bringing together elements of adventure, role-playing and strategy games
 The adventure elements are directly affecting the story, and the outcome of your choices twist and turn to present you alternative destinies
 Combats are turn-based in isometric maps, and gameplay is fairly easy to grasp
 Yet 'fairly easy to grasp' quickly turns into 'hard to master'
 You are able to level up your characters with renown, a kind of currency that you may gain through heroism either in adventure choices or by slaying your adversaries in battle field
 Alongside leveling, you are capable of gathering minor and major items to enhance your heroes furthermore
The Banner Saga presents a direct example for my reason to become a gamer: a story to be told
 The game satisfied all my expectations thoroughly
 I do not wish to present any spoilers, but it is safe to declare that the story of the realm is not finished in this game
 Good news is that The Banner Saga 2 is in development
 Cheers

Just want to give my early impressions
Not a full, formal review
The Banner Saga is a Kickstarter game and it's exactly what Kickstarter should be about: visionaries with bold ideas that probably wouldn't get funded through traditional means
And that's exactly how TBS feels; it's a game designed by visionaries who love every bit of their craft but that leads to some issues of its own I'll address later
First off, this is a gorgeous game
The art style combines the clear-line character art of Ivan Bilibin with the iconic backdrops of Eyvind Earle
Every piece of art from the intricately detailed world map to the rotoscoped animations is beautifully rendered
The world of TBS draws heavy inspiration from Norse mythology but there's quite a bit of detail and world building when I was expecting it to be very straightforward
While it is still a strategy game through and through, fans of RPGs will find plenty to like with the well defined characters and detailed world
Being a strategy game, combat is at the forefront but has some niggling issues
It's a very clean move-action system where character order is more important than arbitrary stats like speed
Being wholly turn based, action economy is the name of the game as you're forced to dominate the battlefield through superior placement of your units
Combat could be a bit more robust but normal difficulty is a decent challenge so far and there's "hard" for people wanting more of a challenge
Thankfully, battles are evenly spaced between story scenes so every individual battle feels special
Unfortunately, my biggest complaint of an otherwise fine system is the speed
Combat moves at a lethargic pace
There's no option to skip animations or speed combat and in a game where battles with as few as 4 enemies can take 10-15 minutes average, having a speed-up option is sorely missed
TBS is immensely pleasurable so far and I can only hope it remains consistent to the end
I'll update my thoughts as I go along

Mesmerizing & unforgettable // Recommended even at full price+ Top-shelf voice-acting (what little there is, unfortunately)+ Gorgeous environmental visuals; backdrops have clearly been painstakingly created+ Spectacular toon-inspired animations; work well in practice, & contrast well with the somber tone of the game+ Soundtrack is quite moving, & is implemented perfectly+ Rich in lore; the world map is a great place to read up on different regions and their history+ The need for balance of supplies outside of battle adds significant planning & depth to the meta game+ When the caravan is moving, the player is confronted with myriad choices (similar to Oregon Trail), most of which are difficult; one's decisions often have large ripples that deeply affect the course of the narrative+ Combat system is superb; simple & easy to learn, but rife with nuance that makes for a satisfying experience (& encourages practice & experimentation)+ Competent & well-delivered narrative; dialogue is uniformly well-written+ Does well to showcase adult themes & the gravity of difficult decisions+ The 'War' mechanic is well-handled, & adds another layer of depth & challenge to enemy encounters; choices made here will affect the enemy strength that you encounter, as well as casualties along your entire caravan+ Balance of morale & willpower, on & off the battlefield, will keep one on one's toes- Occasional, momentary drops in framerate during caravan marchesLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit

A nice game, really loved it
+ Great athmosphere
+ Beautiful
+ Interesting fights
+ Every choice has consequences
 Often huge, life-and-death consequences
But:- You don't really care about most characters
- There is a big gap in difficulty between all previous fights and the final boss
 Needing an archer with a specific set up for that fight only makes that harder

I have mixed opinions about The Banner Saga, but I'm still very happy to have played it
 Most of the time, when I find games to be surprisingly brief, it's generally to their benefit
 However, this is one title where I felt like it ended before it could really shine
 I'm appreciative that it didn't drag itself out, but at the same time it's always a bit jarring when the end credits sneak up on you
The Banner saga is some weird mesh of grid based strategy rpg (Fire Emblem, Tactics Ogre, FFT/A) and
the Oregon trail
 And Vikings (or something resembling Vikings)
 However, only the first part of that hybrid combination does the game feel polished, gameplay wise
 The game's most notable feature when it comes to the primary battle engagements is the Armor/Strength duality, as well as Willpower and Exertion mechanics
 In order to deal a lot of damage to most enemies, especially Dredge, you first have to spend time working down their armor instead of trying to outright lower their health to zero
 This is only a small wrinkle to the normal rpg standby, but it is implemented well enough to have two interesting results
 One, it creates some very real consequential moments where you've got a unit able to do decent armor or strength damage and you can't be certain whether you should really strip the armor down further or if you should take a chunk out of the enemy health so that they might be finished off sooner
 Secondly, it creates much needed class specialization where certain units are much more adept at stripping armor while others are better set finishing weakened foes
 The game then allows you to use some basic accessory-equipment to either further specialize (giving an armor-break boosting equipment to someone already well equiped to break armor) or to make certain units more versatile
 One thing that I suppose I wasn't used to is that the class-roles are specified and listed on the heroes pages, but they still don't seem as iron-clad or strict as those in games such as the Japanese srpgs I listed earlier (where the class given to a unit is much more defining)
 I couldn't tell you which units were which class off of the top of my head, only what each given unit was good at performing in battle
 I suppose it feels a bit more organic this way
 I feel like the willpower-exertion mechanics are the most important (and unique) mechanics of the battles
 Exertion allows you to add damage points to your strength hits, break down armor faster, and move further than normal
 Morale allows you to add willpower to units as you need it, and replenishes as you defeat enemies
 Since exertion determines how much willpower you can add to any action, it was the first thing I upgraded on any unit promotion
The battle animations and sound work is expecially great, and I generally love the look of this game
 The battle environments are a bit bland but that's not a real dealbreaker
 One thing that I never did gel with was the out-of-battle dialogues, usually set as continously reversing camera shots of the front facing portraits of the various characters
 The continuously changing perspective and lack of multiple emotive artworks for each character really made clicking through these dialogues to be a chore at times, and it was sometimes more difficult than it needed to be to determine who was entering and leaving the scene, and even who is all present at any given time
The in-between battle treks with the caravan were not super enjoyable
 I was given a unit count of clansmen, fighters, and varl but I didn't really know what this represented and only tried to keep the numbers high because that's what you're expected to do, right
 A handful of times the game would tell me that the enemy force was so large and my force was compartively large but I couldn't really tell what numbers the game was crunching underneath
 While other moments of open-ended choice and consecquence within these sections was enjoyable (do you help the random caravan you come accross, do you punish the drunk, do you demand goods from the traders if your supplies are low, etc), the various off-screen battle tactician moments (do you charge in, do you pull back, you have x forces against their y forces) seemed to be more random and less consequential
 In the last two chapters of the game, I had made a dumb mistake and lost most of my unit count but it didn't seem to matter at all
 That said, in general I enjoyed the challenge of the game
 I played through on Normal mode, and I even lost two battles (one of which I am sure you are supposed to lose :p ) but the game ended up allowing the journey to progress with those loses, which makes the prospect of a replay to see if I could either avoid or overcome though encounters to be somewhat appealing
 The last battle of the game took a few tries, but at the same time, I didn't realize it was the last battle
 It didn't really seem appropriately grandiose when considering some of the things introduced before that point that I thought I would be tackling
 I'm unsure how much the ending can change depending on your choices, so I might have to do some reading
I just wish the game was a little longer
 Some of the units in the game I felt like only saw 3-4 battles, and with the number of units you get in total (quite a few) and the frequency in which the become available and unavailable, and the low-map limit of who all you can bring into any given battle, I just felt like there were a few things I was unable to ever get to try
 While I had some units level up many times, but the end of the game I had some units only often enough to have promoted once
 But again, I suppose that allows for some variety in re-plays
Great art, but I wish there was more to the dialogue sections, retweaked caravan between battle-mechanics, some larger more interesting maps would be neat, and more chances to be able to bring units into battle which a lower frequency of units becoming unavailable
 Though not to any extreme extent, having some limitations on those sorts of things is a great way to force yourself to try out different strategies rather than just bringing your strongest units every time
Lastly, the overarching story and narrative were interesting enough, but sometimes it felt messy and cluttered
 You find yourself moving from one outpost to the next, each with exotics names, and never in one place for too long
 Yes, there's a fairly nice in game map that helps to try to put things into place mentally, but when the purpose of most encampments is to simply upgrade your units and merch and be on your way, there wasn't a lot of incentive to really keep track of much
 A large part of the game boils down to someone declaring that you need to leave place x and head to place y for reason z, and that's really all of the motivation I needed or wanted

I have to admit on first glance this game does not seem appealing due to many factors but after deciding to give the game a go I have to admit it is one of the most broad RPGs ive seen in a long time
To explain what I mean by broad, at the start of the game you chose to play one of roughly 8 classes and then build your character with combat skills and civil skills
For an example you can build a mercenary who is actually a lover not a fighter, an merchant who responds to denial with an axe to the face and many other combinations
One of my favourites is playing a grifter/con man and taking the skills impersonate, streetwise and persuasion
With that character I was roaming around town and conning people into thinking I was the messiah, a noble, a merchant lord, a soldier, an imperial envoy, some friendly stranger and pretty much anything I need to be
Your class and skills dictate how you need to play the game as you cannot be a little of everything, for example with my grifter if I ever went into combat I would die in 2 rounds since he was not well suited for combat
But if I dressed as a bandit, convinced the leader to parley, went to the lord of the area and told him about a possibility to kill 2 birds with one stone then went back to the bandit leader and convinced him to attack an enemy of the local lord getting both sides killed in the process to find the bandit leader still alive in the end begging for his money just to slit his throat makes up for the fact that my grifter couldnt actually fight
This game can be very cruel to people who are the usual goody-2-shoes, in fact the game hates that architype and out right punishes you with unwinnable fights, people backstabbing you every second until you are finally broken and ready to look after yourself and do what you have to do to survive
So if you enjoy Fallout (1 and 2) like games with tons of replayability and many ways to survive be it masquerading, lying, killing, poisoning, backstabbing, talking your way out of trouble or just plain paying other people to do your dirty work then I would highly recommend this game especially if you ever wanted to RP a social character and actually never have to fight anyone in the game

Early Access Review
I have to preface this review by saying that I LOVE this game, but chances are 80% of the current gaming population wont like The Age of Decadence
 As such its important for anyone interested in this game to have a good idea of what they are getting themselves in for - which is a proper hardcore RPG
Combat is turn based and initially very hard
 The creators have tried to recreate the real life danger of fighting and pretty much nailed it
 Your fledgling character is able to take on one opponent at the start of the game, but fighting multiple people will more than likely get you killed
 Luckily the game has multiple solutions to the problems you will face and combat is not the only path for your character
The game has a good solid story and there are plentiful dialog options which are linked to the social skills of your character
 This of course means that you could potentially play through the game as a smooth talking character with minimal combat skill
 The game doesn't hand hold you in terms of what you should put your skill points into, but common sense will get you through (eg if your playing a Thief character sneak, lock pick and disguise might be useful
)
There are multiple character backgrounds which modify the story including Loremaster, Thief, Assassin, Merchant and so on
 Some times the characters overlap at points in the story, so it can be interesting to see things play out from a different perspective
 Even though the game is not complete (at the time of this review) the different backgrounds give replayability to the game
Finally the setting is based of post roman collapse, which is a unique setting for this type of game
 Don't expect to see spells and magic flying around typical of fantasy RPGs, but there are wondrous items and locations which can be visited from a bygone era in the games lore
 Overall if your sick of "baby's first RPG" and are hungry for a solid learning curve and dangerous combat in a unique setting I recommend The Age of Decadence
(Note; At the time of writing there are a number of crash issues that the game is experiencing, hopefully everything will be ironed out for the final release)
Posted: 1 September, 2016
I don't normally review games but since Age of Decadence is a bit of a niche title then maybe this will help out
In short, AoD has been an awesome gaming experience for me and maybe it will be for you too
What you have to realize going in is that AoD has a learning curve -- even if you play a lot of RPGs -- because the philosophy behind it is unusual in today's market
It's not designed for your character to be good at everything all at once
Rather, your character is supposed to play a specific role in the style of classic RPGs
There's a basic dichotomy in play here, and it goes like this
Your character can be a good Fighter or a good Talker -- but not both
At least not on your first few runs
You may eventually be able to utilize both of these skillsets on a single character -- at least to some degree -- but not until you have a lot of experience with both the combat system and how choices & consequences work in the game world
Don't try to play a hybrid character in the beginning or you will fail spectacularly
Posted: 30 November, 2013
Early Access Review
In brief: AoD ditches many of the genre long established staples to focus on the roleplaying, and this it does amazingly well; there really is nothing quite like it out there
 The EA version is very much playable (there are less bugs than in many releases)
 The combat, which has been much the focus of attention due to its difficulty, is not awesome, but it gets the job done and it is optional
 ***Since for some reason Steam has decided to implement a character limit to user reviews (what's up with that Gabe
), you can read my whole review here: http:// http://steamcommunity
com/app/230070/discussions/0/666827315713399977/ , but below is a very long extract:AoD is a turn based cRPG set in a post-apocalyptic low magic/low tech world
 So naturally one might think that this is something like Fallout in a “fantasy” (as opposed to sci-fy) setting
 But it’s not and both games suffer from this comparison
 So, if it’s not Fallout in a low fantasy setting, then what is AoD
 The best way to approach this is by considering that cRPGs tend to be very long games, with the first playthrough taking at least 20-30 hours
 A first playthrough of AoD EA version, which according to the devs contains about 60% of the final content of the game, can take anywhere between an hour and 5 hours
 However, while in the typical cRPG you see about 80% of the content in the first playthrough, in AoD you see anywhere between 5% and 15%
 This has a huge impact on how you are meant to play the game, the importance of which cannot be understated
 It took me a long time to realize this, despite warnings from other players and the devs on the forum
 You are not meant to constantly save the game and load it when you die or when something goes wrong
 If you do this, paradoxically, the game becomes much more difficult and frustrating than it is, particularly when it comes to combat
 This is because you can’t compensate through luck “bad” playing character stats, as AoD gives very little margin to luck
 The problem is that at first it might seem exactly the opposite, because even though the to hit chances (expressed as a %) are low, you think “if I get a bit lucky with a couple of hits, I can pull this off”
 But the outcome is not decided by a few very lucky rolls: you have to be consistently better than your opponent (e
g
 not like in Fallout, where you can finish or disable an opponent with a single lucky shot)
 But, not realizing this at first, you save before a combat and reload when you fail, which you will do again and again
 I’ll return to the combat in AoD in more detail later
So how does the game play
 Essentially you move your PC around in a fully 3d isometric view
 Combat is never automatically triggered; it is always preceded by a dialogue window, more often than not giving you the chance to avoid it
 You can talk to NPCs, examine some objects in the environment, or very occasionally pick up “loot” on the map
 You don’t “hunt” for containers, checking every pixel for chests, drawers, bag, barrels, etc
 You don’t worry about enemies spotting you, you can’t “turn on” sneak, there are no traps, pool of poisonous green goo to avoid, etc
 The main view is, so to speak, just a convenient tool for showing how the world is and what is around you, allowing for some exploration and generally getting the character from one place to another
 You can also use a map for convenient quick travel, and many times in a dialogue you have the option to appear directly in the place you want to go to
 The meat of the game is in dialogues with NPCs, text adventures and combat
 As to the dialogues and the text adventures, their outcome depends a lot on PC stats, to a lesser degree on prior game choices and occasionally on equipment
 And they are very good
 Actually, they are so good that it is very rewarding to play a PC who doesn’t get into a single combat (yes, you can definitely play through the whole game without having any combat encounters at all)
 They are generally very well written (minor criticism: the swearing arsenal seems limited to the f word, which makes me miss Annah and Morte from Planescape Torment), the NPCs descriptions, motivations and actions are very solid and follow an iron logic action-consequence pattern, the PC has many different options when approaching them and more often than not they allow for a lot of roleplaying and expressing how your PC is
 The mechanics themselves are unremarkable, but what AoD manages to accomplish through them is brilliant
 A warning though: because the outcome of both dialogues and text adventures is largely determined by skill checks (e
g
 you must have a persuasion of 4 to convince an NPC) and as a player you have no way of knowing what level of skill you must have to pass it (it’s not shown in the text and you can’t possibly derive the exact number from the context), at first you might feel very frustrated that you don’t get the best outcome (or even fail, which in some cases means outright dying) because of something so silly and arbitrary
 But it’s part of the game design that every PC can only get the best outcome in some cases and that you die a lot
 Remember that each playthrough is relatively short; this is not Dragon Age where you invest 50 hours in building a PC
 AoD is meant to be replayed many-many times, and the story and the world come together as you replay the game following different paths and failing in many of them 
 I can’t stress this enough: you gain insight into the story, the NPCs and the setting when your PC fails/dies, thus losing is an integral part of playing AoD
As to combat, as I mentioned earlier, there is very little luck involved
 If you face an opponent against whom your stats and equipment compare unfavorably (not in absolute, but relative terms, i
e
 your stats and equipment don’t allow you to have an advantage over your opponent) you will lose
 Again and again and again
 The room for tactics in combat is also quite limited: there is positioning (counterintuitively, this usually means getting yourself into a corner where you are attacked by the fewest number of opponents at the same time), armor, quite a few different attacks (but ultimately not that different between them) and some variations between weapons of the same class and some auxiliary thingies you can use (like nets and alchemy bombs, but not much more, at least in the current version)
 Breaking it down, I think it would be fair to say that the outcome of combat depends mostly on the stats and equipment, somewhat on tactics, and very marginally on luck
 Personally, even though now I feel quite comfortable with combat in AoD (I better, after sinking so many hours into it) and I don’t find it too difficult or frustrating, I’m not thrilled by it
 It does get the job done and it’s important to realize that without a very serious investment in AI, the most practical way of making combat hard (as is part of the game design) is to make it dependent on stats and populating the world with opponents with high stats
 If tactics played a larger role, a human player would have a huge advantage over the AI controlled NPCs, which would go against the whole philosophy of the game
 Fortunately, you can play AoD without ever getting into combat
 To avoid it you just have to be cautious in your dialogues and text adventures, which means as a rule of thumb behaving as you would in a real life situation (e
g
 if you see some thugs, don’t approach them; if they ask you for money, give it to them)
 The best thing that can be said about combat in AoD is that it does succeed in making combat a very dangerous business that one should avoid unless very confident about his or her martial skills

Very much an old school rpg
 No quest markers, lots of (pretty good) dialogue, plenty of stuff to discover
 Its turn based combat is pretty darn brutal when you first start playing the game, you need to specialise and learn the system
 I can certainly see some people getting frustrated with it and giving up, but it's fairly satisfying once you get the hang of it
Of course, you can build an entirely non-combat character and get through the entire game without ever having to lift a weapon
 There's tons of skill and dialogue and reputation based options to use, but again you need to specialise
The game really does change depending on which faction you align with, so it's good for more than one playthrough
 It's certainly worth a buy if you like old turn based rpgs

You hear much talk lately about the cRPG revival and I’m fairly confident that The Age of Decadence will come to be counted favorably among that swell and deservingly so
 But I don’t think it's enough to just say that we have here another good revival title
 Though it's look and feel will be familiar to fans of the genre, The Age of Decadence strains so impressively against the reins of what we have come to expect from a game that it may just land us at the leading edge of new territory
Sure, all of the staples are here
 Nice isometric view graphics paint the adventure around you
check
 Stat and skill based character creation allowing for a nice variety of playstyles
check
 Compelling storyline with strong writing
check
 Immersive world lore
check
 A world crafted specifically for revealing it's secrets to you as it builds your character into a world saving hero and providing you with believable illusions of consequence
che……
no
 No
 The world reveals nothing to you for free
 You are not a hero or a special snowflake
 And you are not pampered by mere illusions of consequences to your choices
 You are served very real consequences
 And that’s a special thing
The Age of Decadence provides a wonderfully immersive world
 And it respects the player enough to not bend that world’s consequences in a way that favors our character
 It's a harsh place full of backstabbing, intrigue, and power plays
 And the game says, hey player, act as you want and I will show you what happens to a character like yours when they do those things
 If you play the role well you may find that you excel in your ventures
 Play the role poorly and you'll quickly discover that you’re just another subpar assassin or merchant that gets to die in the gutter like all of the other hack jobs out there whose aspirations outweighed their qualities
The decisions are tough
 Make an ally here, create an enemy there
 The narrative consequences that unfold due to your actions and choices are, to my knowledge,
unparalleled in gaming
 And Age of Decadence does something really fascinating
 You WILL NOT see all there is to see in one play through and that is because each faction/alliance playthrough is served it's on unique view into the story that is unfolding
 Honestly, I am not one to replay cRPGs but The Age of Decadence compels you to do so
 There’s almost a Butterfly Effect in that as you explore these parallel story lines you get to see just how consequential your actions were when you served that other factions interests
 There are many ways to play the game but however you play it, you'll want to stay true to that character concept
 If you’re a smooth talking merchant that’s avoided physical conflict your whole life honing your silver tongue, then exercise all of the caution that character would when things look like they could get physical
 The game isn’t going to coddle your poor decisions
 Get in the head of that character and respect the world around him or her in the same ways that they would
 Playing a talker, you will learn very little about how combat works
 Play a physical character and you will be playing a whole new game as you plumb the depths of the rewarding combat system
The Age of Decadence won’t be for everyone
 It's unforgiving nature will be a downer for some
 But if you like the idea of real choice and consequences, richly written dialogue and plot, and a gritty brutal setting
then you owe it to yourself to give it a try
 And there’s a demo, so try that first

I've had this game on my radar for a while and purchased during the last Steam sale
 Recommended for fans of the genre with some caveats (ergo, on sale)
 + Well written
really well written
 + Interesting new world story-wise, complete with history
 + Skill tree: you will need every skill point
 + Can go minimal combat without having to sneak/stealth
+ Combat is very challenging
 + Alchemy; not just a an add-on, but necessary to kill without strong combat skills/weapons/armor
 + At times I needed AoD or went through withdrawal
 + No grinding or fetch quests
- Graphics: weak to beging with; tiny character portraits removes immersion, makes it feel like a text adventure game
- Controls for navigation: frustrating moving around towns due to having to rotate, blocked by buildings, etc
 - Crafting: I couldn't get a schematic to craft anything I couldn't easily buy (crafting skill 6)- Cannot win the game unless certain skills at certain levels
 The game ended abruthly and was very unsatisfying; I didn't have enough skill points to overcome the lore/crafting failures needed to progress (lore 7, crafting 6, but even lore 8 insufficient; had I known this, I wouldn't have spent skill points on block or critical and probably not crossbow)
 - Music: monotonous, limited; the main town has a track about 20 seconds long that loops endlessly; nearly drove me mad
- Too chaste
 AoD world is full of mature content
but sexuality/senuality curiously missing
 7/10 Would kill the Crossbow Kid again

If you're up for a challenge and like text-driven narratives this might be one of the best cRPG-experiences in a long while
 While Wasteland 2, Pillars of Eternity and Divinity: Original Sin has played a big part in the resurrection of the cRPG-genre, Age of Decadence has long since carved out it's own path
 Make no mistake, this is a niche game that's sure to be overlooked by many
In Age of Decadence your actions will have, often dire, consequences
 Your choices DO matter and they will shape the story, characters and locations
 There's a sense of satisfaction in persuading one of your enemies to ambush a third common enemy, thus securing a location for one of your allies
 There's a feeling of dread when a dangerous situation is about to get out of hand and the only option left is to fight for your life
 There's a sense of accomplishment when you finally realize the use for an old artefact
 Such sensations are rarely present while playing modern RPG:s and it alone should be the reason to try out Age of Decadence
 Granted it's not the best looking game, neither is it particularly welcoming to new players
 Actually, even hardcore cRPG-players will have a hard time grasping how Age of Decadence is meant to be played
 If you think even for a second that your wealthy merchant will be able to talk his way out of an ambush in the slum district just because you've maxed out your charisma and persuasion skills you'll be sorely disappointed
Play this game as you would if you were actually an assassin, mercenary, loremaster, trader or diplomat and you are a lot more likely to succeed
 Of course you can still play as a tough merchant, but then you'll have to actually commit to that role
 Carrying all that cash in your pocket while visiting a dangerous part of town without (or with
) escort is usually a bad idea
Now, enjoy a well-written story with enough branching storylines to make your head spin
 And don't feel bad when you die in the first fight
 It's an achievement after all

Nice game, interesting lore, belivable characters
One tip : no matter what your mom told you, you can not be anything you want to, so spend points wisely, use real life logic and youl be fine (probably)

Roleplaying lives onThis game is probably the closest thing to playing a pen-and-paper RPG
 The creators have gone all in, giving us their sweat and blood (likely tears as well) in producing much more than a "story"
 They have created a complex ecosystem of choices and consequences, a web of influences, factions, characters, etc that react to each of your decision and readjusts, offering you unique challenges on each playthrough
It is well written, but nowadays decent writing is not hard to come by
 Good writers are a dime a dozen, as are good artists
 What makes AoD an exquisite work of art is how well designed it is
 I don't mean only the rulesystem, which I find fascinating, but especially how much thought there is into the interaction of skills and choices through the progress of the story, and how it evolves from beginning to end
 You can play as a fighter and choose among a variety of weapons, maneuvers, equipment, etc; but you can just talk your way through the whole game, and it still feels like playing, and not reading
 It is imperfect, true, some areas feel a little "sketchy", and in others there's the feeling the choices are not as versatile as they should be; but the achievement is nonetheless monumental, and I can't think of a game that compares in this regard, even remotely
 I played first as an assassin, and was blown away by the ending yet I knew I had missed most of what really happened
 I felt compelled to restart as a merchant with high Lore
 Suddenly the story I knew gained new angles and I learned more about why and how things were happening
 Soon enough I'll replay as a heavy armor praetor, and I'll try to be honorable this time
 although in this setting being "good" might prove to be a deadly challenge
 ;)I want to finish this review saying thanks to the developers for staying true to their vision
 I am sure there were times when they were tempted to do something more "accesible", yet they marched on with courage
 And they triumphed, and inspired thousands of passionate roleplayers, like me
 Gentlemen, thanks, for making me feel like I *roleplayed* an assassin, or a trader, not a mere combination of stats
 With developers like you, Roleplaying lives on

Early thoughts
Just finished chapter 3 out of 7 and I already spent about 9 hours or so, so each chapter should be around 3+ hours (and late chapter are longer)
 which is pretty lengthy I imagine if I will also include the branching paths/narratives and all
 The number of achievements (172 of them) says so too
 All dialogue is voiced
So far it's been interesting, engaging, and tense
 The scary parts (with the animation) sends me to chills
Aside from the supposedly many endings this game has, some decisions, relationships, and butterfly effect unlocks mini-events and romance routes
 You will also get to control and have point-of-view of multiple characters
 Heck, a chapter ending can have a character without plot-armor die
 Somewhat reminds me of Until Dawn
I hope more people will notice this game and pick it up
 Looking forward to play more and will give my final thoughts afterwards

"London Bridge is falling down
 falling down
 my fair lady
"The Letter is an episodic Visual Novel game, about a diverse group of people who are affected by a strange curse
 The game is full of
decisions the player can take to further the story, which immediatly reminds one of japanese horror classic "The Ring" - not at least because of the black haired ghost woman herself
 Besides this resemblance though the story has enough novelty, and most important a good cast of characters as well as a gripping presentation and atmosphere to make you want to play it through
The decisions mostly impact the relationships between the different characters, which in the end impacts the story as you play through it and finally will lead to different endings for each one, but also can lead to a quick and bloody ending sometimes
 This also can happen through some Quick Time Events, which are thankfully optional to play through
The characters are well enough defined and each of them is presented during their representative playthrough
 Regarding the Presentation one can only say that the backgrounds are nicely drawn as are the different faces and poses of the characters, which helps transporting their moods, beside the well done voice actors, who are doing a good job bringing their alter egos to live
 The atmospheric music rounds up an good impression and is especially during horror scenes very fitting (together with the grisly done ghost appearances)
Rounding this up "The Letter" has quite some achievements to get, the decisions really influence the game somewhat so more than one playthrough won´t get boring
 With around 15 to 20 hours for the intial playthrough you get your moneys worth here for sure
 Technically the game is well done too
 despite some missing audio at a few speeches and a few typos here and there
Conclusio: I am someone who get´s bored easily, but the Letter had me gripped enough to make me invest quite some hours into it to get my first endings
 not exactly those i was aiming for either, but the characters are rich enough that initial likes or dislikes even change during the game
 Also i very much enjoyed the thrill this game could provide, together with the voice actors, who really fit their characters (i especially liked the Police Chief/ Bartender speaker ;) )
So all in all i can really recommend The Letter to players who like a good VN or also Telltale Games
 or just a good ghost story
Point Scale: 8/10
Posted: 4 September
Do you enjoy VNs at all
 Buy it
Do you like long and branching stories
 Buy it
Do you like "horror"
 Buy it
Do you want high production value with full voices and animated sprites
 Buy It
The Letter is - quite simply - amazeballs
 At least, I think so
 Some notes about my experiences with the game thus far (I've finished it 3 times, and have plans for a couple more as I barely have 60% of the achievements) to follow:1
 From a gameplay standpoint, it's relatively basic VN-type stuff
Dialogue in a box at the bottom of the screen, you read it, and move on to the next
 All of the characters (including you) are fully voiced, with the exception of internal monologues and thoughts
 Also, the sprites are animated and quite pretty to look at
 Where I feel The Letter sets itself apart is the branching storylines
To begin, you play 7 different chapters, each from a different character's perspective
 Your choices in dialogue (and whether they live or die)carries over from one to the next, so a simple choice in Chapter 1 can have far reaching repercussions all the way in Chapter 7
 I both love this, and it drives me insane
 If you are a completionist, this one may take awhile - especially without a guide
 My first playthrough, I had one person in a coma, one die, and the rest live
 Then I tried one where everyone lives, and one where everyone dies
 Somehow, I managed to screw up that last one and one person still lived
 Some are much easier to kill than others
 There's also a relationship system, where dialogue choices increase or decrease their ties to one another
 This can mostly affect the Epilogues and the endings individuals and pairs receive
2
 The story itself
 While the "horror" elements are relatively soft, there is a solid "creepy" vibe to much of the game
There are a few mild jumpscares, but nothing too intense
 In fact, I think the strongest of these is actually the first time you click new game from the menu
 Other than that, the ghost's image and sound design are spot on
 My only real complaint is that there are times when the story feels like it stalls out a little with an over-lengthy internal struggle
 CGs are well placed and are more interactive
3
 QTEs
 While I understand the desire to add "gameplay" to a VN, these feel unnecessary and at times, frustrating to me
Thankfully, you are able to skip them (though you'll miss out on a few achievements)
 There are also settings to make them easy (though the number mashing one in the elevator with Ash is still annoying)
I'm sure there's more, but that's all I can think of as I hastily type this out
 I simply wanted to make sure I gave my thumbs up review for the game
 I've spent almost 40 hours in this VN and I'm sure I have at least 10 more to go
 This rivals The Fruit of Grisaia as my favorite VN, and I think people should know about this gem

The TL;DR version of this review is that The Letter is hands down THE best English Visual Novel produced to date
 My usual rating system for Visual Novels are: Story, Graphics, Audio, Gameplay and Characters
Story:This is a horror themed visual novel, and it has some of the best writing I've seen
 While the plot may not be the most intriguing ever, it is tightly woven in the sense that it covers - as far as I can see - everything that you may question about the game
 For example, there are 7 main characters in the game
 What if 2 characters die
 What if A, B and D dies specifically
 How will it affect the narration
 What kind of responses from the characters are expected
 You can try any combination you like, and you will notice that there are tidbits here and there in the narration that will fill in the gaps and enrich the experiences
 It is an amazing effort
Normally, ghost stories love confining characters to a single setting - just the mansion
 Just the hotel
 Cut off all communications for XXX lousy reasons
 - but no
 The ghost originates from the mansion and haunts the mansion in ways you dare not imagine, but it also hunts the characters over different places fluidly
 It is not bound to one place, and the characters aren't bound to one place (well on the larger scale everyone is bound on the city, planet Earth, the universe yada yada but you get my point)
 This makes for a very organic and realistic experience that is even better than most Japanese Visual Novels out there, since those games usually have locations that are so systematically defined it feels like there are only X amount of locations that exist in the whole general setting (i
e
 XXX City)
 The point is, the world does not feel small here
 You will be visiting various settings in the city such as a theater, a mansion, a hostel, an apartment, rooms, a police station, a library, a church, and office and so on
 The world is big
 It is not just X girls' houses / school / your house and the end, and that is great
Graphics:I'm honestly in awe at the graphics
 While I can't claim that it has the best damn graphics in the entire world, it has a unified color tone, excellent background and character sprites and CGs that are ALL ANIMATED
 And boy do they look lovely when animated
 The CGs especially are fantastic
 The beautiful CGs are beautiful, and the creepy CGs are downright terrifying
 It's like I'm watching a movie, but with the best shots framed at every second
 And did I mention the ghost
 The ghost is going to haunt you
 You're going shut your eyes in midnight, and ungodly and grosteque shapes will naturally float to your imagination and accompany you in your dreams
 It is a gorgeous experience
And the gore
 Oh, my god
 The gore
 I will never wipe the image of poor Isabella from my mind
 I personally love Marianne's because of how
 immoral it is
 Oh, sweet temptation of sins
This level of quality is going to spoil me
 This is already starting to make some Japanese animation graphics look LAME
 That's how good it is
Audio:First, before everything else related to audio, I must applaud the English VA
 How ironic that a Philipines produced Visual Novel has some of THE BEST English voiceacting I've ever heard
Posted: 29 July
"The Letter" is the best visual novel I've every played, and I'm not making statements like this lightly
 I think, the last time I wrote something like that, was in my review for "Danganronpa" and this game
 Oh, boy, this game offers so much more than I was expecting
What's great
Plot
 Simple, but interesting concept (remember those annoying chain letters
) gets turned into something incredibly complicated and engaging
 It was obviously inspired by Asian horror movies pale lady, long black hair all over her face, crawling around and making scary noises - yes, we've seen it a thousands of times, but it was done in truly outstanding way
 You have curse, you have hunted mansion, mysteries of the past, yadda, yadda, all those classic horror elements, but everything works perfectly, thus showing, that cliches aren't necessary a bad thing, as long as you use them to tell a compelling story
Characters
 There are seven main characters, each one with their own chapter, each with their own issues, interests and decisions, that will impact not only the main story, but their relationship with each other
 The best thing any story can do, is make you care about characters
 With horrors, it's especially important, since it makes everything much more engaging and tense
 I cared about every single one them - Becca, Ash, Belle, Zach, Hannah, Marianne, even Luke
Yes, Luke
 Guy, I literally hated during first four chapters, to then completely change my mind and consider him my favorite protagonist - that proves how good the writing for this game is
 Characters are complicated and even though I found some of their behaviors unrealistic, it was never breaking the immersion
Visuals
 Moving sprites
 Moving backgrounds
 Moving CGs
 I generally don't care that much about visual side of games, but here, art is not only incredible, but also adds so much to the atmosphere
 Whenever the monster shows up
 Wow
 I could feel like something is crawling on my skin
 Sounds
 This is literally the most important thing, when we talk about horror games
 "The Letter" has amazing sound design
 The music is great, it always fits the atmosphere of the scenes, and sounds, no matter if it we talk about frightening screams or gentle laughs, or some stuff going in the background, make this game incredibly immersive experience
 Also, it has voice acting
 I don't like to play visual novels with V/A, but I've turned it on during few scenes, and it's good
Fear
 Fear, just as humor, is very subjective thing
 Games like FNAF and dozens of "Fnaf wannabies" made a lot of people believe that jumpscares are just cheap horror tricks, with no substance
 I disagree with that - good jumpscare, in the right moment, is something that will make your skin crawl
 This game has jumpscares - great jumpscares, may I add
 It also has gore
 It has psychological horror
 It has pretty much everything you could expect from a title like this
 Whatever you enjoy, when it comes to horror, you won't be disappointed
Choices matters
 Finally
 Even those little ones, that affects how characters think about each other, how they react in certain situations, and so on
 But there are also big choices
 The one that affects who survive and who doesn't, how the story will go, and how will it end
 "The Letter" offers more branching paths than I've ever seen, with many endings and possibilities
 In short: If you like either good horror stories, or good visual novels, it's a must have
 It's absolutely worth the price, visuals are outstanding and pretty much set a new level for other games in that genre, the sound design is amazing, voice acting is good, plot is deep and engaging, with great characters and both darker and lighter moments
 Add to that, important choices and branching paths, and you have a nearly perfect game
 Or just perfect
 I think "The Letter" fully deserves this sort of praise

I am not one for horror games that rely solely on gore or jump scares, and I was rewarded with trying out this game
 The horror aspects in the game are genuinely terrifying and unique due to the addition of QTE
 I appreciated the settings option, however, that we are able to turn them off if need be and have the game be treated as simply a visual novel
The artwork and designs are awesome, and I usually cannot play a game if the artwork is super terrible, however at the price it is--it better have good artwork lol The way they are slightly
animated makes the horror aspects really jump out as well--sometimes literally
The voice acting is also wonderful
 I'm usually the kind of player who prefers Japanese voice acting simply because English voice acting is just usually terrible--but I was pleasantly surprised at how well the VA was executed
The story is really good so far
 I've played around with some of the branching story lines and I really enjoy how varied the endings can be
 It is definitely story rich and doesn't rely on just trying to scare you
 I'm genuinely curious about the story line and how everything will be resolved
 I know the bio states they were inspired by Japanese horror films and they truly hit that nail on the head
I cannot wait to to see the conclusions to the story, and maybe, just maybe, I can nut up and turn on the QTE again
 
 
 maybe

I don't like horror movies
I don't like jump scares
I don't like quicktime events
I LOVE The Letter
Obligatory "I've never written a review for a game on Steam before"
I happened upon The Letter on a casual browse through the Steam store
 The beautiful visuals, full English voice acting, and excellent animations made the game look really promising
 However, I also saw a tag
"Sexual Content"However, it was not accompanied by the all too common "Nudity" tag
 Those two are red flags for me
 After doing my research and discovering that The Letter is, in fact, not a hentai game, I bit the bullet
41 hours of gameplay later, and I can convincingly say that not only is "The Letter" the best visual novel I've ever read/watched/played/experienced (whatever the correct verb is), it's also among my favourite works of fiction of all time
 That includes movies, novels AND TV shows
The Great*Visuals are beautiful
 The CG scenes, animated sprites, backgrounds, everything is perfect
*Voice acting is top notch
 Really, fantastic job to everyone involved in the VA
*Characters are deep, VERY different, and multilayered
 Each have their own internal conflicts, perspectives, and personalities
 The first person voice of the game really nails it
*Choices that matter
 AND I MEAN MATTER
 There are nearly 200 achievements in the game, and even after 41 hours of gameplay, I still don't have them all
 I STILL HAVEN'T SEEN EVERY ENDING
 And, without spoiling anything, you can get endings that range from "feel-good" to "melancholic" to "truly horrific"
*The horror
 As someone who is not particularly a fan of jump scares, there was never a time I felt as though the game offered cheap thrills
 The real horror isn't even in these moments (although they certainly add to the tension); it's in what the experience does to the characters
*Music and sound
 Brilliant
 Not much to say other than spot on
*The writing
 Apart from some grammar mistakes, particularly involving "would" and "could" (specifically, the absence of them where appropriate), the writing is gripping, and written in the voice of each of the characters
 So strong is the writing that, even in the absence of all the other positives, this still would have made for a fantastic novel
*Visible branches
 Ever wanted to know exactly why your decisions mattered, or where something changed
 The game provides you with an entire tree which shows the paths you've taken previously, just in case you wanna try something different
 Why don't more games do this
The Less Great*Especially towards the latter parts of the game, there are missing audio clips, audio clips which play in the wrong place, missing words, repeated words, and other slight inconsistencies
 Yangyang Mobile are working hard to correct these errors, so hopefully they'll be fixed soon
*You can't name your save files, or delete them for that matter
 It's a minor thing, but given the amount of other conveniences they've included in the game, it really sticks out like a sore thumb
If you're looking for a visual novel with memorable characters, legitimate scares, great dialogue, a very branching narrative, choices that matter, awesome visuals, and fantastic music, you're asking for a lot in a game
But The Letter delivers
 
Posted: 15 August
Disclaimer: I'm one of the lucky guys who supported this project via Kickstarter from day 1 and was able to follow the awesome progression this novel made from an amateurish Unity mockup to the amazing package that was released here on Steam
 Only reading the updates was already worth the money and seeing them making their baby professional an unbelievably cool experience, so I cannot exclude being a little bit biased
 When I started with this novel, I was absolutely tired from VNs and planned to stop reading them altogether
 I just couldn't take the clichés anymore and felt like the target audience was limited on teenagers, which is just not the kind of stuff I enjoy anymore
 What I expected of this novel was a short little horror experience with its fair share of jumpscares and some amateurish story to let things move forward
 What it delivered, however, was pretty much the opposite in every regard
Although it is being advertised as a horror experience, the heart of the novel actually lies in its characters and "drama aspects", for the lack of a better term
 While the cast seems pretty uninteresting at first glance, your opinion of almost any character will probably change once you get to their chapter
 I was a bit sceptical if this "Every chapter is from a different perspective" concept would work, but it turned out to be exactly what the novel needed to emphasize its strengths
 Every perspective provides a very unique experience: All characters have different ways of thinking and therefore leading the narrative (some are very ego-centered, some can read people like books and act accordingly, etc
)
 Even if you hate characters first, you usually grow with their chapter for that reason
 Additionally, they all have some kind of personal conflict to deal with, leading to each chapter adding to the excitement instead of just driving things forward
 Apart from one chapter, I actually was never bored with this novel, which is not often the case
 And mostly, the characters get more and more interesting with time, especially Luke is ridiculously well-written and constantly surprises until the very end
 Since the characters are all in their mid twenties and working, the topics also tend to be about more adult themes, which is a refreshing experience after the 100th "High school boy gets into something with 8 girls wanting his d
direct attention"
 Be aware though that it tends to get very dark, as expected from the horror genre I guess
 Without spoilering too much, it will be about topics like rejection, self-hatred, not being able to move in any direction with your life, what to do in a relationship that seems to fall apart after many years, and so on
 If you are into these kind of dark topics and maybe enjoyed works like Saya no Uta, you are definitely in for a treat
 The writing turned out to be surprisingly profound surrounding these and can be quite intense if you have any personal experience with any topic
Another big plus is the level of detail: The devs really did not shy away from anything to make the VN as lively as possible and took quite some risks in doing so
 If there's anything in the background that can move, it will
 Sprites of the characters actively breath and move around, even smartphones will actively show the call-time
 Not to mention this VN is fully voiced in English with lip synchronization
 The voice acting is also really top-notch most of the time, although I felt like some actors didn't really find the right tone for more silent scenes and tend to overact a bit
 In the first prototype, these attempts seemed to backfire a bit and put it into an uncanny valley direction, but they stuck to their idea and made so many improvements that this feeling is completely gone
 This is probably the most lively novel I've seen so far (yes, even with a ghost - oh, the irony)
 On the down-side, the writing was left alone a little bit too much
 At the current stage, it's a little bit "from foreigners for foreigners" you could say
 If English is not your native language, chances are you will not have too many issues with it and just notice some mistakes here and there
 English natives seem to have a lot more issues with it, though
 The devs are focusing on improving the narrative now to correct that, but apparently this also includes voiced lines to an extend, so there will be a limit
 That does not mean the writing in itself is bad, though, it's just about grammar mostly
 Additionally, the main story is a little bit lacking
 The first endings you reach will probably be a big disappointment, and reaching other endings can at times be a bit tedious because the skipping takes a while and sometimes considered already-known texts to be new because they have some few additional lines
 There is a True Ending, however, that adds a lot to lead it to a nice "Make your own theories" direction and gives a more satisfying feeling
 However, it's absolutely not a mind-blowing experience in any way and the main story makes very slow progress
 So if you only want that out of a novel, this is not the one for you
 And ironically, I personally found the horror to be the worst aspect
 It's a typical "ghost girl" thing with all the typical scenes you can imagine and already know from movies
 Most of the time, the scenes are rather short and rely on jump scares
 There's no big buildup for a general creepy atmosphere or anything similar
 I'm personally only really scared if horror is done in a Silent Hill like way - playing with the unknown basically and making you uncomfortable with disharmonic music and art
 It just didn't work at all for me
tl;dr / verdict: This is for you if you enjoy psychological dramas in a darker direction, but not if you are looking for the next mind-blowing mystery
 Apart from a whole lot of grammar mistakes, the quality is top-notch and even a shining example for novels to come
 Not only does it not have to hide from professional works, it even outdoes most
 It might not be the perfect novel that will stick in your head for years due to lacking an excellent overarching plot, but Yangyang Mobile have shown that they certainly have the talent to do great VNs for an adult audience
Posted: 3 August
Now that I have finally gotten the True Ending (after many replays with various dead body counts) I totally recommend this visual novel :3Simply put it's a VN where almost every choice counts to shape the story you get with controling a different character on each chapter
 They can all live, they can all die, or you just kill some while others live
 Each choice is like a ripple effect that impacts the chapters especially the last 2 chapters either in small or big ways
There are Quick Time Events but you can skip them with TAB if you can't get past them
 Various epilouge endings revolving around the character's friendship and even some romantic endings
Posted: 27 July
One of the best (if not the best) visual novels I've ever played
 The story is so complex that I can't think of how many hours someone must play to see all of it
 The story, the way it is told, the voice acting, THE ART and THE LOVE creators put into this game is just
 I can't even describe in words how much of it there is
 All I can say is "Thank you Yangyang Mobile for making this game" and hope there will be more games like that in the future
 I recommend this game to all fans of horror games, books or movies, fans of visual novels and everybody who's looking for a good story
Posted: 8 June
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE VENTURING INTO 999
I refunded the game thinking they removed so much of the narrative but I was wrong, the game has now 2 different types of screens, the "ADV screen" and the "Novel screen"
 Make sure you switch to "Novel screen" as soon as you start playing and stay on that screen as the "ADV screen" only displays dialogue and NOTHING ELSE, if you stay on this screen you'll miss all the extra bits that can help to figure out certain details that allow you to find all the endings and figure out the entire story top to bottom
Happy gaming
EDIT: @Snivader pointed out my mistake, edited the review
Extra small tip to help you through your journey
 Take a notepad (or anything you can scribble down onto), and write down key dates / codes / people that you encounter through the game and keep them close while playing the entire trilogy
 I can guarantee you that your mind will be blown by the end of the trilogy (provided you can keep up with the weird events that go down in these games)
Posted: 24 March
First ImpressionsA lot of people who review now will have played it on the handheld, so I thought it may be useful for someone who had not had any experience with the game give their initial impressions of the game
What I think after 2 hours
If I had to use a phrase it would be "Believe the hype", I was told this was one of the best if not THE best VN there is and boy were they not wrong
 After the short space of time I have had with the game I had high expectations, I was worried it wouldn't stand up alongside say Danganronpa or Steins;Gate
 What struck me straight away was this is NOT just a VN, this is an old school point and click adventure game as well as a VN
 The puzzles are challenging and were a welcome surprise to someone who knew nothing about the gameplay
 The characters are interesting almost immediately and well introduced, a couple seem bland at the minute and typical VN trope characters but there is plenty of time for them to develop
 There appears to be multiple routes to get to multiple endings, which is great, I love that I can see what route I am on currently and I'm sure that will develop into some form of gameplay mechanic as it is unusual to show you exactly the kind of path you are on
 The voice acting is good without excelling, I'm sure I'll grow to love it but at the minute the protagonist is sort of "meh"
 A BIG surprise as well as the gameplay was the characters being animated during dialogues, I am SO used to the small movements or just the mouth movements, I loved it when the characters started moving
The story seems like it is going to be stellar, lots of initial mysteries straight off the bat, decent pacing straight away
 I'm hoping they can keep it up
One crash in two hours, it did not like me alt + tab out of the game to go and browse the internet, so be mindful of that, no auto-save so I lost a bit of gameplay, but no biggie, plenty of games hate that and its as much an issue with my set up as the game
Future of this reviewI'll edit this review when I've finished the game and give it a full proper run down, just thought I'd throw this up before the myriad of "I love this game" one liners got tossed up or the typical day 1 griefers who purposefully break the game and then decry the bugs they've found

An absolutely brilliant pair of games
Clever puzzles and insane twists aplenty keep both 999 and VLR engaging until the very end
Note: Absolutely play them in order (999 then VLR, then ZTD if you want to finish the trilogy)

Zero Escape: The Undiscounted Games 
Posted: 25 March
Pros+High Quality Port+3 great Story if you get this
Zero Escape Trilogy+Adventure and Novel Mode option available+Variety Of Choices that add depth to the story progression+Great voice acting for 999+3 great mysteries with plenty of clever twists(zero escape trilogy)+Story is just as mind-blowing and well-written +Decent 3D sprites and intricate levels+Great puzzles+Great plot twists, puzzling story, interesting charactersCons-Voice acting in 999 is hit-or-miss
-animations don’t hold up that well on 999 side of story-odd sounding voices- choices have no effect and random puzzle difficulty-Dated Graphic(might not meet everyone expectation,-small touch up on 999 which is a port from nintendo DSConclusionZero Escape Trilogy is a really solid compilation that do offer
great visual novel experience on PC 
 although the animation look a bit dated in 999, and upping the resolution on PC certainly didn’t reduce the roughness of their looks on the Background
999 is an
an old game, however, so that’s probably to be expected
 Sprite and Artwork are all gorgeous and crisp although the only downside that i can find on pc version is it is not even a FULL HD remake on the background and some part of animation
I was a huge fan of the Nintendo DS title 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors, so I naturally picked this Zero Escape Trilogy(pc) when I was able to(for collection purpose)
 Virtue's Last Reward delivers more of the same escape the room-based gameplay that was so awesome in the previous installment, and definitely delivers on that part
 However, I couldn't help but feel that the plot that was tied into these puzzles was weaker this time around
 Perhaps it was the author's desire to create a trilogy out of the series that led to Virtue's Last Reward being a less impactful installment
While Virtue's Last Reward is an interesting, mind bending game that will keep you guessing until the very end, it suffers from issues with the setting and writing that make most of the game very slow paced
 the series still boasts one of the most engaging and well-written stories in visual novel genre and for and newcomers who didn’t get a chance to play them on the 3DS or Vita would be remiss to pass it up now
Verdict: 4
5/5 [ 999 and Virtue’s Last Reward aren’t the most graphically impressive games around, but the series still boasts one of the most engaging and well-written stories
The Nonary Games does provide dual audio tracks though, so you could always swap to Japanese voices if you’d like
 The Flowchart could potentially spoil the experience by revealing the game’s flow and how many possible outcomes you can get from a decision, especially for newcomers
The Only problem i can found in this game is the choices mainly becomes an issue when you keep switching branches and are forced to play through nearly the same things over and over again
The soundtrack was composed of Shinji Hosoe and consists of ambient electronic music
 It does a good job of setting a tense scene, though there are no standout or truly memorable tracks
](note:I have already play both game on new 3DS/DS so this review is just for reference purpose)
Posted: 27 June
This game is actually a collection of 2 games ported from the Nintendo DS and 3DS respectively
A mash between visual novels and escape room point-and-click puzzles complete with branching stories and crazy characters
 Loved all of the first game but I felt the sequel was weaker than the first
 The endings to both games are amazing
Additional notes for weebs: - Japanese voice acting for novel sections is available in the options
- Miyuku Sawashiro

This was an hell of a ride, im so glad these where ported to pc, on steam, or i would never have played these two gems
 Do you like puzzles
Do you like an engaging story where every detail counts

Game cost45 dollars
 Digital root is 4+5 =9

Quick Port Overview for those looking to buy: Playable with Keyboard and Mouse, seems responsive Detailed resolution options only in fullscreen, more limited in Windowed (544p, 720p, 1080p on my 1080p-Monitor)
 But you can change to a custom resolution via the launcher
ini atMy Documents/My Games/Zero Escape The Nonary Games Borderless Windowed Option Simple graphic options menu, includes AA up to 16x and AF Audio output seems bugged, my headset is the output, which is connected to a PCIe-Soundcard, deactivitating via Windows doesn't work
 Workaround is to plug the speakers to the sound card, could be fixed in a patch as far as I can see On my RX 480/i5 6600k Desktop 999 runs perfectly smooth and fine without dips
 It was the same at first on my i5 2520M T420s, but for some reason it started to dip to 17 - 22 FPS within the second riddle
 I turned off AA and AF and it's running without the severe frame tanking
 Also, I can't see any difference in graphic fidelity with having those turned off
 So I guess it's a must-have option to turn off AA and AF if you have a lower end system
 The UI does not scale at all as it seems, the Save Screen is huge and is convoluted, will update when getting further into the game Menu options don't scroll with mouse wheel or with the movement of your mouse, only a click or using the arrow keys will change the highlighted menu button There are keyboard shortcuts for the various interactions in the game, but are not rebindable
 It's also completely playable only using the mouse so far
 It has only 30 save files, though that is more than enough for someone like me
 The game has native Steam Controller and Dualshock 4 support with the default profiles (thanks to Moskeeto) 999 and VLR don't have a "Close"-button, but you can quit out of the game via Right Click in the Main Menu or via the B-Button on XBOX (or equivalent) controller I forgot to note that both Virtues Last Reward and 999 have a options menu, where you can adjust seperate audio sliders like BGM, SFX and Voices
 You also have a sensitivity choice for the cursor (if using a Gamepad is something you'd want to do), as well as a option to enable skip text and a choice between Japanese and English voices
 I am using the Japanese voiceover and so far, besides the puzzle bits, it seems to be fully voiced with animations
 You can change between GamePad and Keyboard/Mouse on the fly, the only thing that the launcher option for the input device changes seems to be the shown input button ingame Game speed seems to be tied to framerate, so thats unfortunate
It seems alright besides the Audio issue
 Might want to wait for one or two patches

One of my favorite games from 2014, and probably my all time favorite detective game is this
 Crimes and Punishment is a blast to play
 The new engine offers breathtaking views and stunning textures, and the voice acting is fantastic
 You have to make moral choices in this game, which affects the story
The cases are much more interesting in this game then the previous Sherlock games, thanks to great mission variation
 Solve murders, investigate thefts and missing people
 "Will you follow the law or your moral
", is the question you have to go by on every case
Every case is smart and well thought out
 You always think you understand who did the crime, until it suddenly turns the other way around
 When you finally complete a case you feel satisfied though
 You will look around for a long time, just because you want to find every clue
 If you get stuck you can get hints, look in your journal and ask doctor Watson
I think this game is very underrated
 It's one of the most polished games released in 2014 and offers a great story with absolutely fantastic cases
 If you haven't picked this game up yet, please consider doing it
 I really hope Frogware will release more content for this game
 DLC, expansion or sequel, because I adore the game and would really wish for more great and exciting cases to solve
Crimes and Punishment gets a warm recommendation from me
Posted: 29 September, 2014
[SPOILER FREE]Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishment is a beautiful and impressive
adventure puzzle game starring a very popular detective
who players will enjoy playing as to solve crime and choosing
thier own choices in a case's outcome through deduction
First off, the graphics of the game use the unreal engine 3 and a step up for the series
The facial features of the characters such as pores, scars, and even the detail on the clothing
Not only is the character
detailed but so are the aesthetics and details put into each of the maps that the players will traverse to solve crimes, which gives it a it more immersion
The music is appropriate for the game and kicks in at the right moment though the rest of the time the game is pretty quiet to letting concentrate and could use more to bring immersion
 The voice acting is also decently done for most of the characters in the game and brings them to life in the game world
Players can
play the game with either a keyboard and mouse or with a game pad
 Both are configured well and didn't include key binding, which isn't too bad since there aren't many keys to press for this type
of game genre
 Players be able to play this game in first or 3rd person whichever choice you decide
The controls may feel a bit stiff but overall it is not too bad at all
Each of the maps in this game is really focused on the area where the crime appears
 You won't find yourself in unnecessary places or free roaming since it isn't that sort of game though it is something to suggest for a future sequel
 The game uses a fast travel system to travel around the map with a push of a button
 With a button click, players can
bring up a map and click on locations to travel where they need to go whenever you want
 With each loading screen, Sherlock in the cab where the interface can also be brought up for the
menu to look over the clues, evidence, and deduction while they wait
 The menu itself is very sleek and organized
The game play to Sherlock is to solve puzzles, gather evidence and to come up with deduction and solve crimes
 The puzzles range from ordinary lock puzzles where you match locks to complicated puzzles where you rebuild molds, combine chemicals or find clues to fix certain situation, compare notes, Extreme arm wrestling and lots more variety to keep the game intriguing
 There is a skip function for those that get frustrated or stuck at a puzzle but keep in mind that it is a puzzle game, and that self-satisfaction comes from solving by oneself
Sherlock is armed with an arsenal of tools to help him combine clues and solve puzzles
 Focus will help him see things that he will miss at times such as small marks and such
 Imagination is
when he gathers enough clues to solve a puzzle, he will be able to recreate the scenario in his mind to gather more clues and evidence and finally when he does get all this, he will be capable to go into deduction
 In deduction mode, Sherlock can look over his facts and evidence, draw a line between them and form bubbles and by doing so created deductions
 Sometimes there is only one deduction in a bubble but other times
 There will be two totals
 As players look through all these bubbles, they'll be able to draw and combine a conclusion to the case
 If the case is a contradiction, it will tell you between the bubbles
 If it combines there will be a larger bubble and there will be a choice to the entire
scenario
 Either the person is guilty/innocent or an alternative choice route opened will be up to players to decide by finding enough clues and evidence
The game introduces five case scenario total and may take a player 12-15 hours total to complete depending on how good they are at gathering clues and puzzles
 My opinion is that this is possibly the best puzzle/adventure game I have yet played
 I enjoyed it though some of my cons are that the disguise function wasn't used as greatly as I thought and that the game hopefully will be even frequently more expansive with the deduction system in the future because that felt like the real meat of the game to me personally
Pros+ The graphic details are beautiful
 You can see the details of the faces of characters, clothes, and the aesthetic to the background looks great with the Unreal 3 engine
+ The puzzles are brilliant+ The case themselves are very realistic
in a sense+ Brilliant story and cases
 Especially the third case Blood Bath
+ The voice acting is decently done
 Most of the characters sounded great
+ Deduction offers the players choices and replayability
 Multiple choices on how to punish a crime or finish it off with another outcome
+ Game lasts 12-15 hours Cons- Though beautiful the maps were decently sized and it felt too closed in especially with parts blocked off
 Hopefully we'll see even larger areas in the future
- Disguises weren't used as much in the game- There is a skip button that pops up everytime that just seems to invite players to push it
 Should be something you can turn off- The online feature should take in more stats instead of just who chooses the choice or discovering it

I took it upon myself to wait until I had received 100% of the achievements before making my review
Compared to The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, Frogwares and Focus Entertainment have come a VERY LONG WAY
 From astoundingly beautiful graphics, to great plotlines and endless solutions, I was in awe the entire time
 The one thing I loved the most was the way they improved on Sherlock Holmes's personality
 Compared to Testament, Holmes in Crimes and Punishments has a more gentle and chivalrous side to him, which is something definitely found in the books
 I'm an oldschool Sherlock Holmes fan, so this game was perfect
I am very excited to see possible sequels in the future

As a fan of adventure games i am always looking for new and entertaining adventure games to play
 I‘m very picky and not every adventure game will satisfy my needs
 I have stumbled on Sherlock Holmes Crimes and Punishment a while ago and added it to my wishlist
 I bought it on summer sale and i don‘t regret it
 I love the game
First thing what caughts
the eye is graphics
 It is rare for an adventure game to have a really good graphics
 Keep in mind that „technically good“ and „nice to the eye“ is different
 A drawn 2D graphics can look much better than technically more advanced 3D graphics with poor 3D models
 I remember when Broken Sword gone to 3D graphics, it looked awful, i was angry about that, i was disappointed that developers decided to go that way instead of just classical 2D graphics
 It was a trend at that time and it was a bad trend
 Sherlock Holmes Crimes and Punishment is one of those adventure games in full 3D where graphics looks really nice
 Character face models are amazing
 It lacks better animations like in Beyond two souls, Heavy rain or LA Noire, but i guess this game had much smaller budget, so it‘s really amazing what they had achieved in graphics department
 Environments looks great too
 You can take rally nice looking screenshots
 The environments are different and pretty detailed
 In short i don‘t have any complaints regarding graphics
The game consists from 6 chapters which are 2,5-3 hours long each
 The gameplay consists from exploring the crime scene, taking notice of every detail, gathering evidence and talking to the witnesses and victims
 After all these things are done you can start a deduction process where you must make connections between collected statements and evidence and get a conclusion
 There are few outcomes in every case, there‘re always few suspects and you can wrongly accuse a person of doing a crime and condemned him
 But most fun is to find out who‘s the real culprit is
 Even when you find him you can absolve him or make him guilty so that he would receive his punishment
 It‘s your moral choice at the end of the chapter
The game is not too hard but it‘s not easy either
 You can be stuck at some point not knowing what to do
 As always it‘s just some small thing you missed
 There are some puzzles in the game
 Each case has few of them
 I like that puzzles are all different and are pretty logical and not too complicated except for lock hacking puzzles
 They‘re in every case and sometimes you get more than one of it
 But you can skip the puzzles, it doesn‘t have any impact to the story or outcome
All in all i recommend this game to everyone who loves adventure games, you will not be disappointed
 This is one of those hidden gems (*cough* The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 *cough*) made by a small company which probably didn‘t pay back

This is the perfect Sherlock Holmes game
 In Crimes and Punishments, you have six cases to solve, and its completely up to you to deduce the facts, and bring about judgment
 Oh there is so much goodness where to start
 The game is gorgeous
 Victorian England never looked so good
 The amount of different places you get to visit is amazing, from beautiful mansions to seedy back alleys
 The voice acting is superb
 Also, the voice synch is perfect
 What I really love about this game is that after finishing a case, you can always come back when you want to do another case, without worrying if they are connected in any way
 Each case comes with so many different possibly outcomes, if you find the evidence and come to certain conclusions
 How you sentence who you believe is guilty also influences how the public sees you
 The in-game journal is wonderful in helping you keep track of who is involved in the case, what items can help you advance the case, or look back at a dialogue that may have a clue
 So the good stuff in a nutshell: The Look, the writing and the acting, the Game Mechanics, and the Stories of each Case
 The negatives: I can't find them
 This is a great game to start with if you are interested in the Sherlock Holmes franchise
 If you have already played through the catalog available of SH titles, I dare say you must play this because I think you'll find this to be arguably the best SH games to date

Very good game indeed, love the graphics, love the gameplay and love the logic of how puzzles and mysteries work
 AND it teaches you a ton of little science tricks along the way
 Definitely a good game
Posted: 8 August, 2015
"Be quiet Watson, I'm trying to concentrate
"As puzzle games go, Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is fairly tame
 As tedious as the achievement for reaching all conclusions is (if that matters), the game is worth the experience - well thought-out characters, realistic motivations and a chance to play at being the world's greatest detective
There are six individual cases, or chapters if you will, each with a unique crime for you to solve
 Gameplay involves first gathering the evidence in the form of point-and-click / exploration
 Suspects and other people are interviewed
 During the course of doing this, sometimes additional information about clues you find can only be discovered by researching Holmes' archive, or by conducting an experiment, or even by chemical analysis
 All of these actions combine to give you deductions, which take the form of facts floating around inside Holmes' brain, visualised by neurons firing between each other
The next part is what I find to be the most fun though
 Just having these facts floating around inside your head isn't enough
 You have to put them together
 For example: a person needs a certain Strength Requirement to wield a harpoon properly, also you know the victim was Pinned to the Wall
 Put them together, and you conclude the murderer must be physically strong
 Put enough of the facts together and you'll be able to conclude who the guilty party is
It comes as no surprise that there are various conclusions for each chapter
 Each of them makes its own kind of logical sense, and is fun to experiment with
 There is even a 'correct' answer to each of the cases - and the opportunity to check whether you have the right one or not is entirely optional, meaning nothing is given away without your wanting it
 The only problem I find with replaying for different endings is the necessity of starting the case over again from scratch - there is no option to simply replay your deductions from near the end of the case
 This unfortunately makes for a bit of a grind as some cases have numerous location changes - many of which are for as little as a single item - meaning you will grow bored of seeing the interior of Holmes's carriage very quickly
 One case has as many as six different endings
More on the gameplay
 I've already mentioned finding objects, interrogation, drawing deductions
 In addition, there is lockpicking (an interesting take on a concept rife in so many games today), imagination (a little-used idea that works well to break up other gameplay elements), and there are also conversation events whereby Sherlock catches people out in lies
 Leaving people gaping like fish and floundering for words is very enjoyable
The cast for voice-acting is excellent, although I think it is soured by Robinson's aussie accent
 There are two aussies in this game - while Lady Brackenstall sounds more genuine, Robinson sounds exaggerated, a bit too much like Steve Irwin for my liking
 Perhaps for the time-period (1890s) this is accurate, and perhaps it adds to his character, but I just found it too over-the-top
The visuals are mildly impressive
 While nothing stands out as particularly fantastic, the landscapes and rooms depicted are done well enough that you feel transported to late 19th Century England
 Typewriters and the general hubbub of Scotland Yard offices is one of the better sounds
In closing, I should point out that the game is inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, and that Crime and Punishment is a reference to Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel of the same title - giving the gamer the opportunity to find the right culprit, and to make the moral choice of condemning or absolving their actions
Posted: 26 September, 2015
Everything about this game is fantastic except for the arbitrary nature of the deduction system
 There will typically be at least three solutions with separate suspects and different means of having committed the crime
 The different clues which have been collected during the investigation must be arranged to form different deductions in order to single out the perpetrator
 The system is genius except for the fact, that the developers have failed to make some deductions more correct or coherent than others
 Thus you can never be sure your chosen solution - based on solid reasoning (what Sherlock Holmes is supposed to be all about
) - will be correct
 Even if you have taken all things into considerations and logically chosen the most likely explanation
 This have been incredibly frustrating and immersion breaking
 To further explain what I mean by the solution being arbitrary, I will provide the following observation:Any case in
"Crimes & Punishments" will have established means, motives and opportunities for all suspects, if you diligently have found all the different clues
 The problem as I see it is, that there should at least be some few things that makes one suspect more likely than the other, or deductions that stood out as far less sound, as they appeared to be in conflict with other circumstances like causality or the existence of contradictory evidence, but no
 All the solutions are equal in likelihood and reasoning, and as Sherlock Holmes we are bound to make a decision on who we would most wish to see having committed the crime or who we intuitively believe did the crime based on knowledge of crime cliches
 It seams the developers have constructed the clues, deductions and solutions in order to
fit the model of "means, motives and opportunities" as conditions in order to establish guilt as found in common law legal systems
 This still only provides a dissatisfying experience, as this doesn't prove the actual guilt of the suspect, which in turn today nor in Victorian era Britain were enough to lift the needed burden of prof of having committed a crime
 Establishing the presence of these three elements is not, in and of itself, sufficient to provide a conviction beyond reasonable doubt; the evidence must prove that an opportunity presented was indeed taken by the suspect and for the crime with which he or she is charged
 In "Crimes & Punishments" the different solutions are entirely equal in probability, and this is the prime weakness of the system: If all the suspects can be reasoned to be equally as likely the ones who committed the crime, then they are all equally as unlikely to be guilty, and in a court of law this would actually make providing a conviction impossible
 The conclusion simply
cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt
 It frustrates and saddens me, that the deduction system have been built in such a way as the solutions are wholly arbitrary and in total disconnect with the books of sir Arthur Conan Doyle
 Mainly because if you can ignore this, then the game is fantastic
 The atmosphere is fantastic and the locations and voice acting is great

This entry into Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes series is the biggest change since The Awakened
Frogwares' switch to the Unreal engine seems to have paid off, as this is by far their best looking SH game yet
The voice acting has also greatly improved, and together with improved character animations, C&P delivers a cinematic, high production value experience
The gameplay, on the other hand, is the simplest yet
 C&P plays a bit more like an interactive movie such as Heavy Rain or The Walking Dead than a typical adventure game
 But the experience is still rather enjoyable, and the change certainly makes C&P the most accessible title yet
 The game also seems to borrow the "observation text" from the BBC Sherlock mini-series, which is a nice touch
 I think there may be some inspiration taken from LA Noire as well
Although there are few puzzles to speak of, the most interesting feature is the "conclusion system"
 Even if you uncover all the clues (which is very easy to do), the player is able to deduce multiple conclusions
 Only one conclusion is "correct", but it isn't always obvious which that is
 The game requires you to pay attention and in some cases think rather carefully in order to come to the right conclusion
The game also appears to borrow from Telltale's TWD and Wolf Among Us in introducing episodic gameplay with a "moral choice" at the end of each case
 There are 6 cases total, each lasting roughly 2-3 hours
 In addition to deciding the conclusion of each case, you decide between two moral choices
 This doesn't seem to have much impact aside from showing you a different ending sequence
 Although saving is automatic, after finishing a particular case ending sequence, you can restart before you committed to the conclusion and moral choice
 This conveniently allows you to see all possible endings, if you so desire, in one playthrough
Although the episodic gameplay introduces more variety than previously seen, the individual cases are not quite as compelling as the storylines of previous titles
 Some cases are perhaps a bit too obvious, although there's still plenty of cleverness in the writing
As an ardent fan of Sherlock Holmes adaptations as well as the source material, I definitely recommend this title
It's also fairly easy to unlock 100% achievements
 This is possible to do in one playthrough, although doing so without a walkthrough would be difficult
 Unfortunately, most walkthroughs tend to spoil the plots of the cases
 It is possible to replay any case after completing the game, though

Good adventure with a great story and a great voice acting
 Devs really well made this little gem, little because the game is like 5 hours, the map is not that huge, it's a 2D indie with some interesting mystery facts
 It's totally worth to be played in my opinion, especially if you're into adventure games where there is a lot to read
 There aren't fights or weapons, just a radio that will help you through the game
 Only thing, you really need a good english because the dialogues are quick, you don't have much time to pick your replies
Said replies matter a lot during the game, you can get your friends to hate you because of your replies, also pick choices that will affect your experience, so pick wisely
and fast
Very reccomended
 8/10

Oh what a game
This game is something fresh and beautiful
 Mystery adventure with amazing story
You arrive at the island with your friends to drink and have fun, but strange things start happening
 You must explore the island, help your friends, find out whats happening and get out of the island
The game is purely story driven, there are no puzzles or anything
 You just walk, talk with your friends and exploring the map
 Maybe it sounds boring, but believe me you will be hooked up after 15 minutes of playing and will want to find out what's happening
 You can choose what to say to your friends and this will influence the ending of the game
 Choices matter in this game and you can get a totally different endings
 Also the game has really nice and surprising online integration, to not spoil the game i will not talk about it
The graphics are very simple but the game looks amazing
 This game is an example that you don't need amazing graphics to tell the story
 Of course it would be nice to have graphics like Beyond two souls, but it would require a huge budget and a few hour game wouldn't sell many copies for 60€
 Or developers could've chosen the cheaper way and made the game full 3D like Duke Grabowski or something like that, where character faces are emotionless and lip sync is horrible
 This would ruin the game completely
 So the simple graphics works perfectly for this game
The sound
 The sound is amazing
 A spectacular voice acting makes up for not seeing character faces and emotions
 It is probably one of the best voice acting i have ever heard
 And music is awesome, soundtrack helps to create that creepy, mysterious atmosphere
If you like story driven games and mystery, just get it without any thinking, you will like it

I'm gonna keep it short and sweet:This game is an underrated gem
Oxenfree is the love child of "Life is Strange" and "Stranger Things" (the Netflix series)
 It's a mix of time travel and 2 realities colliding (with one being much darker and gruesome than the other)
 So if you are interested in any of that and actual choice based elements, this is your cup of tea/coffee/hot chocolate or if you dont fancy that crap, your can of beer/pop
 Sod off if you like plain water, fizzy water still welcome
Jokes aside this is one of the games that I recommended to my friends the most, it has superb writing, gorgeous visuals, beautiful music and voice acting and an interesting storyline with choices that more or less make big differences
It also has replayability as there is a newgame+ option (which also adds some new choices and voice lines to the story) and there are multiple endings that you can get (albeit in the same concept with different meanings)
The voice acting is a huge thing in this game, you can hear emotions and valunrabilities in the character voices, as if it's really happening
Controls are great but there are a few places here and there that may frustrate you a little bit
 (and this is probably my only minus points for this game)I feel sad that so many people ended up skipping this game because the screenshots and trailers don't really represent the depth that this game has
 Believe me, it's worth your time and it is value for money
In any case, if you do grab it, I hope you enjoy it :)
Posted: 18 January, 2016
Get this
 Get this and play it, preferrably all in one go
 This is the first game in a while that kept me interested enough to complete it in one playthrough, albiet, I only completed one
storyline
 The plot is amazing, it is a mindfudge, it has great art, its just
 good
I originally got this as a palet cleanser, as something to play between some more in-depth games, but honestly, if I didn't have to work in the morning, I would continue playing this to get all the achievements available
 I should also mention, DONT LOOK UP PLAYTHROUGHS OR HINTS, this game is about playing on your own, about finding out about who you are a little more
 I know that doesnt make sense, but you'll understand once you play this
In short; if you like mystery, good artwork, building your own plot, deeper meanings behind things, being immersed in the story, and dont mind that youre not shooting, stabbing, or otherwise killing/maiming/destroying things, then play this
 Do it

Can you walk and talk at the same time
 If not, Oxenfree might not be the game for you because, for the majority of the game, that is all you will be doing
 If warning lights are currently flashing in your brain and the phrase “walking simulator” is on the tip of your tongue, hold on for just a moment and let me explain why this game is worth your time
 Yes, Oxenfree is a narrative driven experience in the same vein as any Telltale game and yes, the game has very few mechanics to speak of
 However, rather than using “walking simulator” to describe this game, I believe the label “conversation simulator” would be a much more appropriate choice, as this is the area where Oxenfree truly shines and sets itself apart from the rest of its genre
 On the surface, Oxenfree’s dialogue system is comparable to that of Mass Effect or similar titles; every time your character Alex speaks, you are presented with three dialogue choices that appear in different colored bubbles above her head
 I say three options, but there is actually a fourth: to not say anything at all (you can actually play through the entire game without speaking)
 Unlike in other games that allow dialogue choice, however, Oxenfree’s dialogue operates in near-real time; Alex will speak exactly when you tell her to, interrupting or talking over other characters
 This makes conversations flow naturally without unnatural pauses and provides that real life conversation pressure of not wanting to interrupt someone who’s talking but also wanting to get to get your 2 cents in before the conversation moves on
 However, a good dialogue system alone does not a great conversation simulator make
 What really sells Oxenfree’s dialogue is its flawless writing and voice acting
 Unlike Life Is Strange, where teenage characters are speaking lines obviously written by adults trying to immitate a vernacular outside of their experience, Oxenfree’s teens sound wholly natural
 Lines are delivered full of pauses, incomplete thoughts, “ums” and “ahs”, and the kind of grammatical errors caused by talking faster than your thoughts
 Sometimes lines will also just slowly die off or end mid-thought
 I’ve rarely seen dialgue written and delivered so realistically, especially for adolescent characters in a video game
In my opinion, the game is well worth your time just the points I’ve listed so far
 However, it would be unfair not to mention the rest of the game’s strengths
 Firstly, its atmosphere
 While Oxenfree may be marked as a horror game, I don’t think that label is appropriate here
 While there may be one or two scenes that startle, Oxenfree’s soundtrack, visual design, and story combine to form an eerie supernatural thriller that is tense and head-scratching, rather than scary
 And what a story it is
 While it may start slow, using a clichéd horror trope of a group of teens spending a night in a remote location, the story quickly picks up and sucks you in
 Characters are well rounded and detailed and the plot is paced well right up to its solid conclusion
If I had any criticisms to level agains the game, most would be related to the way you move around Oxenfree’s island setting
 Many areas of the game are proportioned to allow space for conversations to play out
 However, there are many cases where you have to backtrack the way you came without the luxury of a conversation to keep your mind off of the characters’ glacial movement speed
 I also encountered several conversation-related bugs that prevented me from progressing
 Although your choices subtley influence the course of the game
(there are no “Telltale will remember that
” cues), Oxenfree plays out largely the same over multiple playthroughs, giving it a lower replay value
 Due to this fact and its short, 3 hour runtime, you may rightly decide to invest your money elsewhere
 However, if you’re looking for a tight, well-delivered narrative experience that you can finish in an afternoon, Oxenfree might be just what you’re looking for

I love this game
 Like, I really love this game
The dialogue is organic and the voice acting is excellent - nothing the characters say feels forced or shoehorned in
 As for the characters themselves they are well rounded, likable and don’t fall into any of the typical teenager stereotypes - and it’s refreshing, to say the very least
The atmosphere is consistently creepy and oppressive, even during the lighter, more comedic moments - and the soundtrack and visual aesthetic add to it
 And when you find yourself alone, you really feel alone
 It’s hard to properly describe, but you’ll know what I mean the first time you get separated from your friends
My only complaint is that sometimes your companions will occasionally get stuck either on corners or in the middle of a stairwell, but it’s fixed on transitioning to a new area
I cannot recommend Oxenfree more
 This game is fascinating, terrifying and excellently written
 If you are on the fence about buying it, I urge you
 It’s well worth the price tag

Options are simple enough, with Subtitles (NOT the default), Disable Effects, Windowed or Full-screen, and a range of resolutions from 640x480 up to 1920x1080
I played the game entirely with my controller with no issues
Oxenfree is a compelling game for those who love dynamic story-games
Replayability is added to by having multiple endings and a variety of achievements
This is not a "I have no idea what to do next," kind of game with impossible puzzles and obtuse logic
It's all about the journey
The graphics are not what I'd call compelling, but coupled with the stellar soundtrack, voices, and story, they set the stage for an environmental journey that will keep you riveted throughout
You can see from the screenshots that the people are not super-detailed, and yet you can tell that the devs put some care into their mannerisms and movements
For instance, when walking down a steep incline, the characters will lean way back and have the kind of jerky steps one has when they're trying not to lose control of their descent
Little touches that add some realism and suck you deeper into the world they're created
Gameplay consists of 2
5D exploring, discovering secrets, and interactions with the people around you
You will generally have three options to choose from during conversations, and your choices absolutely matter
There are color-coded thought bubbles that show you which character is speaking, and if a face shows up in that bubble, it means that the character either feels closer to that person, or the opposite, depending on the situation
Along the way you will discover a compelling story with plenty of "What the HELL
" moments
The characters themselves have well-defined, believable personalities that are absolutely evocative of the teen years, from their mannerisms right down to their word choices and life decisions
This is not to say that they're annoyingly "angsty"
 just that the devs did a beautiful job capturing their individual personalities
The voice actors are masterful in their delivery, bringing them all even more to life
The soundtrack and sound effects range from beautiful to thought-provoking to downright creepy, and all of it atmospheric
There is one thing that I found semi-annoying about the game, and that is the loading screens
They're artfully placed in a manner that is reminiscent of the breaks producers add to their shows to allow commercial lead-ins, but I still would have been happier without them
I also enjoyed the first half of the game more than the second half, with the difference being more interaction with the unknown in the beginning, and more character-development in the latter parts
 but that could also be because I was off exploring and looking for secrets instead of progressing the story
There are 13 achievements to be had, and it will take multiple play-throughs to get them all
 The idea of playing again is OK by me, since there are multiple endings
I managed to get 5 achievements and the second-best ending during my play-through, but I'd like to see where else the story can take me
There are also five behind-the-scenes documentaries, but when I click to look at them, it just takes me to a loading screen, then back to the page you see upon entering the game
Not sure what's up with that *shrugs*If anything in this review sounds enticing to you, then I think that you'll love the game
Absolutely recommended

You know
when I had someone ask me, "Is this game worth the $20 price tag
", I had to sit there and wonder if I was just telling myself to like it because I bought it or if I really did enjoy myself
After finishing the game (yes, it may not be an extremely long title but I also missed some collectibles), I would say that this is a strong start for Night School Studio
It was hard to define this to that person when they asked if it was a puzzle game
While there are certain situations that test your ability to remember or pay attention, there are actually no real puzzles in it
Most of the time, you're walking through this dark and gloomy environment and conversing with the other kids
The game is more narrative than anything else, but I feel that's where it shines
Having to deal with the supernatural occurences on the island while working your charm to not have the other kids hate you really builds a great story and character progression
Add in the wonderful music and the fantastic 2D environment with 3D characters that actually feel right, you're given a game that helps prove that 2016 is off to a wonderful start
That being said, the game is not without it's flaws
First off, there's no audio sliders in the options
Not a big deal for me, but I know some would prefer quieter music to voice acting
While the voice acting is pretty great, there are audio issues as to when your character decides to answer over someone else
Sometimes you'd like to wait for the person to finish, but the choices you make in conversations don't neccesarily stay there for long, so your character just ends up interrupting sentences before they start or mid sentence
I also feel I encountered a visual bug in that something chose to not disappear, but I'm still unsure if that was the case
It just felt off during the scene because it was there and no one seemed to question why it was there
Also, the traveling may turn some people off of it
As I said prior, this game focuses on story moreso than action or game mechanics, so if conversations during your walk time isn't enough to peak your interest, you may find yourself not liking it
So maybe with that one massive piece of information about how it plays, the $20 may be too steep for some, but I recommend this title to anyone else who actually would enjoy story more than crazy gameplay
Beautiful art, outstanding music, terrifying moments, wonderful character building, well displayed teen drama
what more could you want from a game that is a "sit down in one sitting" type of title
If this is what we can expect from Night School Studio, I can't wait to see what else they can pull off

Oxenfree is one of those games that takes a genre of game in terms of play and art style and flips it on its head
 The use of radio as a plot device as well as a gameplay mechanic leads for some extremely creepy moments and my fondest expierences of this game so far have been when you know you need to tune the radio and something scary will happen, but you just don't want to and you're left sitting there freaking out
 Strongly recommend to anyone who enjoys character driven narrative and extremely creepy horror aspects

What a Beautiful Game, Really enjoyed it
you can't Find Much Games Focuses on the Storywhich is the type of games that i like :)anyway
 if you want to enjoy some good stories which your line choices matter in

Just finished Episode 1 of Lion's Song and it's pretty good
 Needed some time to get into the game and understand what the game wants from me and where the story is heading to
 You're playing as a music student who somehow fell in love with her professor
 little bit hard to relate myself to that role
 But once you get to the main purpose of the story and need to look for inspirations for your song it becomes quite appealing
 Last but not least because of the great soundtrack which you realy want to complete and listen to in total
Looking forward to playing the next episodes
by the way: it has one of the best and creative credits screens i've ever seen :) congrats to the team

There's a warmth and heart to this game, perhaps due to the wonderful artstyle, perhaps due to the stories that are so genuine and endearing

Just an excellent little piece of art
More like a point-and-click meditation, than an adventure game, as it does not even have an inventory
 But it is so stylish, being sepia-pixelated, so to say
 Reminds of games by Lucas Pope and even of those by Kan Gao or Tale of Tales
 It is very short - but then, it is free
 Besides, a lot of achievements make you wish to play the game for the second and the third time in order to find all the secrets and other ways for Welma to get inspired :)So, definitely recommended to all who appreciate games as kind of the arts
 Still, other episodes cost money, so they should better be at least twice as long
