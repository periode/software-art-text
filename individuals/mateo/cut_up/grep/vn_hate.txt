Characters will die whether you hate them or love them
I hate myself forever
 The only thing i hate about this game is the poor CV for certain supporting characters and not all the characters got their voice
 No matter how much they hate you, they will bury the hatchet
 Probably gonna get a lot of hate for this one - please note it's just my opinion
+ Memorable unique characters, you might love some of them you might hate the others but in the end they're all interesting which creates the connection between you and them
 So if you hate reading a lot of dialogues this might not be the perfect game for you
 Love or hate (most likely love), each one is visually ornate with personalities to match
 I can understand why someone would like it, and why others would hate it, personally I neither loved nor hated it, but I didn't enjoy it much
There's also an auto setting that just plays all the notes for you, in case you just can't make it through Fal's song or you decide you hate someone's song
