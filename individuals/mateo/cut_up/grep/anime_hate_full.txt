(Not a hate rant)
 And don't hate on all mentors
 Characters will die whether you hate them or love them
I hate myself forever
 The only thing i hate about this game is the poor CV for certain supporting characters and not all the characters got their voice
 I have worked hard since i left school at 17 and in the past 2 years i grinded my way into a nice promotion at a job where a lot of people hate or see as a dead end career wise
 I'd hate to see such potential shut down, and this game has a ton of potential
