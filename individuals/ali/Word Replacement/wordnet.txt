Original Paragraph
Tell me where you want to strike,
Whether its here or there,
You can really strike me everywhere,
But know this you wretched fool,
If it is big, it amounts to the suffering,
And if it is small, it is of how little you cared,
So you can have my body,
But you are always going to be scared of what is inside,
Because if you weren't,
You would strike me at the heart,
But you never had yours in the first place.

Tell me where you want to bang,
Whether its here or there,
You can really bang me everywhere,
But know this you wretched tomfool,

And if it is small, it is of how little you cared,
So you can rich person my dead body,
But you are always going to beryllium scared of what is inside,
Because if you weren't,
You would bang me at the sum,
But you never had yours in the first spot.
