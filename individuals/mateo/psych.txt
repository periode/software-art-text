												I really don't undertsand the approach they were going for
You make a game about the second world war, the deadliest conflict on planet Earth till this day, 60 million human beings died in some of the most painful and brutal ways possible
But you're too afraid to include swastikas and the segregation and sexism that existed at the time? I mean, you put WWII in your game's title, but I feel like Return to Castle Wolfenstein is more historicaly accurate
-Zero historical accuracy, which we were promised for at least the campaign
-Delevopers censoring the brutality, sexism, racism, and the symbology of this game
-The voice acting for the Germans in this game sounds like someone typed that trash into google translate and copied the audio wav
s and used them in the game
-The characters in the plot of the campaign are extremely boring and forgetable
-The function of weapons in this game is far from how they truly operate (feels like none of the deveoplers actually fired any of these weapons at a range prior to developing them in game)
-The multiplayer makes me want to kill myself, enough said
I usually make parody reviews, and try to make people laugh, but I feel like this really needs attention

												This game's title is a disgrace
When I saw the initial trailer,  I was actually pretty hyped and thought that this might be a good game
Well, it's the worst CoD I've ever played
And it's not even so because the gameplay is bad
It's just that this game pretends it's set in WWII, when it's not
First of all, please save me all "this is just a game" talk
If you call a game WWII, and say you'll try to keep it authentic, you do it
Not include stuff that's totally out of place
--> black female soldiers--> fighting for Wehrmacht--> in London--> wearing american helmets, because apparently the devs don't care about creating an even remotely authentic feelingWhy not make ACTUAL WW2 maps??? London?? USS Texas?? Why?? What was the thinking behind this? Were there too few locations to choose from? Jesus Christ, what's next? New York?When I was a kid, I learned a lot about history from games like Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2
Kids playing CoD WWII will spread false knowledge
This is the first CoD since MW3 I spent money on, and definitely the last
This franchise needs to die

												Definitely not worth full retail price
  CONS:  - Campaign levels are incredibly short
60 minutes and I had already completed 5 stages on hardened - Enemies are all deadshot, even behind cover at any difficulty (difficulty only changes the rate at which they shoot you with 100% accuracy)
Hell, they are even accurate when blindfiring from cover
- Because of how accurate enemies are at any range with any weapons, mounted weapons are really fustrating to use, especially madatory mounted weapon sections where you absolutely can't dismount the weapon you are forced to use
There's no cover, and you  can't take cover 
Worse still, the gun requires a somewhat lengthy reload after just 50 bullets (some uses a cooldown system)
- Characters are pretty forgettable in all honestly compared to something else like Brothers in Arms, COD 2, or even Company of Heroes Tales of Valor
-  Ally
Useless (can't shoot for sheet) and annoying
Screaming "MED PACK READY BRUH" "GOT YOUR AMMO BRUH" every few seconds
- Microtransactions on a full priced AAA game
Solely cosmetics or not, just NO
- Settings between SP, MP and Zombies   DO NOT   carry over between each
So you'll have to manually set all of them again (i
e if you fine tuned your SP settings, you gotta do the same for MP and Zombie)
It's a hassle
- Bugs & errors (e
g error 4128)
- Hackers everywhere
Reporting them doesn't seem to help either
 PRO/CON  - Can't complaion about the visuals
It's not bad, but its nothing to rave about either
I won't go into nitpicky details on ulgy textures, but as a whole, so long as you're not going out of your way looking (i
e zooming in at a particular rock) for it, the game looks and runs just fine
- QTE
Not a fan, but not totally adverse against it either
Some QTE sequence require you to move your mouse in a circle (kinda like telltales games I guess?) and there are some variety of different buttons to press, so its not just smash X button all the time
- HP regen, I don't like it, but at the same time i don't not like it
I'm confused, it does what it does, but it doesn't feel as "fluid" as something from say, Dying Light, S
T
A
L
K
E
R, Half Life and Halo
I'm guessing that the slow animation to heal is for balancing purposes (i
e you can't just heal in an instant) but then again, I have played game with healing animation and they don't feel as off as this
It's not bad, but its not  good  per se? Idk its hard to explain
- Enemy AI aren't exactly stupid as they know when to try to flush you out while flanking you and blindfire as you try to advance towards them, but they do really stupid things from time to time like throwing a bomb that bounced back and killed themselves or "taking cover" right infront of you (and the cover is facing the wrong way)
- For a game that prides itself alot on "historical accuraries", there are sure loads of jarring historical inaccuracies, even on the very first level alone
But I'm not really complaining since some of them are beneficial, like german units using weapons they weren't suppose to have (e
g " troops "Sten guns", historically speaking, german made ones were called the MP 3008, and it was avaliable ONLY for the Volksstrum, not the Wehrmacht or any branch of the military, even in desperate times
The MP 3008 was literally a really crap copy made in haste to arm fanatical civilians
)  PROS:  - Sound designs are pretty good
they feel heavy when they need to be and ambience have its moments of tranquil breaking into a furry of bullets and explosions
- Zombie and MP are okay (zombie is really good imo, had always wanted something similar to COD WoW zombies for a while now), nothing much to shine or bash on
Aside from the absolute bs that is the microtransaction (and how they've impliment that degrading patent it into COD WW2), it does what it does
Though I'll admit it is really weird seeing a negro nazi running around
- Amazing settings design for PC, wide variety with helpful screenshots to better explain what each settings does at what setting (i
e Texture at med, high, extra)
Something like what you'd see at geforce
com- You cannot truly just ADS and empty the entire mag in a single burst with laser accuracy (atleast in my experience)
There's a very noticable weapon spread at range even while going prone
Hipfire is pretty inaccurate aswell
- Auto presets for lefties
- Surprising range of weaponary- WW2 themed (like finally i suppose)TL;DR: It's fun, but the asking price is too high for the content avaliable (Get it for 30 USD or less)
If you're buying this solely for SP, don't bother (even with discount) its incredibly short and unmemorable
The set pieces don't even feel grand or pumped (like COD WoW Downfall  or COD2 Ponte de Hoc)
Now I really wish there was a "conditional thumbs up/down" system because I'm recommending this game, for its base game content value,  AT 30 USD OR LESS  (absolute max I'll say is 40$ and that's really pushing it)
Buying the full edition that comes with the season pass and bonus map is really ludicrous for the average joe earning average wages (also if I were a parent,unless wealthy af, dropping 60$ or more on a game that isn't that content filled would make me squint at best and straight up no to buying at worse
Adding microtransaction ontop of that doesn't help either)
Oh and microtransaction is still crap, regardless if you're opening a box in private or a box that appears from the sky for everyone to see
edit: some spellings and making it easier to read
edit2: added some extra details about how the microtransaction is earned/worksedit3:   welp hackers are everywhere
   Details about the microtransaction (as I understand)  Something I believe lots of people are interested in knowing about
I'll put it in bullet points so its easier to read- They're all cosmetics (as far as I know)
Emblems, gun skins, helmets, emotes, icon, etc etc
- You can earn lootboxes via the game's "orders" (functionally speaking, they're pretty much challenges)
- What are "orders"? At the HQ, there's a place (the game will guide you on this) where you can go and choose which orders to activate
They range anything from "kill 500 enemies" to "win a TDM match"
Now, each "orders" grants a different reward (e
g XP reward, lootboxes, rare lootboxes, crafting materials), you can see what reward are tied to each "orders"
They come in daily (24 hours) and weekly (7 days) cycle which will refresh and load new "orders"
Upon completing a challenge, you have to go manually redeem it (HQ or loadout section)
  IF YOU DON'T IT DOESN'T REGISTER AND YOU LOSE YOUR POTENTIAL REWARD WHEN IT REFRESHES NEXT CYCLE   (subject to change imo)
- Crafting materials? Yes, like Overwatch, you get crafting materials (armory cred) through various means (e
g dupes from boxes, challenges, hourly/daily "mail" which gives you some amount of free crafting materials) which you can use to buy stuff and rank/prestige perks this which lets you buy weapon/class upgrades stuff
You can  technically  buy your way to unlock every weapon, perk and streak specials) via lootbox free exp (each rank gives 1 rank point)- Everyone can see what you get if they're around you, and any  Epic  quality stuff that was unboxed in the HQ (you have to unbox it in the HQ as far as I'm aware of) will be announced on the bottom left as a text (e
g Unforseen Lemonquences has unboxed an Epic item!)- When you open a box, nobody can "steal" it (since its considered opened the moment you decide to open one in a sub menu)
But they  CAN  troll you by blocking your screen (standing between your character model and lootbox), thus preventing you from taking screenshots to showcase what you got
- Lastly, yes, you can use real money to buy these lootboxes

												I played Single Player mode for 15 hours


which only would have taken about 7 if my save games hadn't been deleted every time the game crashed
I played through the first five missions 4 separate times due to this
Not enjoyable
Historical and military accuracy were terrible
Russian sub-machine guns in Western Europe? PVTs continually calling a Tech Sergeant "Sir" without getting chewed out? Many, many German uniform screw-ups (all officers won the Iron Cross, apparently)
I'm not talking about black or female soldiers, but the rest is laughable
			
Posted: 3 November
												Absolute tat, totally different to the beta, which I enjoyed, historically inaccurate (PPSH used by germans on D-Day?) just definitely not what was promised from trailers, interviews or anything else developers said pre-launch
Just go and see if anyone is playing WaW rather than this
Requested refund after 1 day

												I


I don't know where to begin
 I wanted this game to be good, really I did
 I have played the Call of Duty franchise from its beginning to its terrible, terrible demise during the Black Flops series
 Campaign-No, you cannot skip the cutscenes
 You WILL have feels for these characters, you WILL (but probably not because they're all lacking depth)
*-All those awesome moments in the trailers?  That's all of them
 In the whole game, right there
-The missions?  I expected more
 D-Day, sweet!  Oh, it's over


okay, I guess I was done anyway
 Kinda missing COD2 here though


 A car chase, okay


pretty sure you've done this before, COD, but this works
 Sneaking around a German compound, sweet!  Finally something


oh he saw me?  Wearing this German uniform, he saw me and is apparently upset about this
 Meanwhile all of his buddies are having conversations without actually moving their mouths or talking, that's cool Activision, I'll go elsewhere to fulfill my attention to detail
 A flying mission, sweet
 DEFINITELY did this one in one of the earlier Call of Duty games, but hey, we're repeating everything, so why skip this one
-Physics
 Did we forget this was a thing?  I just watched a Stuka divebomb a tank and pull a 270 up in a matter of maybe 10 meters
 I can hop for days, and hop I will, because


MULTIPLAYER-If you're not hoping or dancing or dolphin diving, you're dead
 Forget what I said, you're already dead, but you respawned so, no, wait, you're dead again
 Because the guns that you have are outmatched by his custom-pro-mod-why-the-hell-is-this-even-in-this-game-gun
-Okay, I'm a huge fan of games that people die when you shoot them, maybe I'll give Hardcore a try


 M1Garand shot, center mass, no kill, he returns fire with a pistol, instant kill at 20 meters
-Kill cam
 Watch it, watch the muzzle of the weapons jump, but the bullets go straight
 Just watch it
-All gripes and complaints aside, this game is an AMAZING


airsoft simulator
ZOMBIES-look awesome, now we know where all the dev's time went
**-It's Nazi zombies


did you expect differently?  There's some new zeds, bombs and fire and stuff
 1 map, hope you like it
-Honestly thought it was good my first run through
 Prologue was cool, read reviews about it being more linear and adventure-y, but once you've opened all the gates, it's a circle map with the old tried and true tactics every game
 Not my flavor, but a solid improvement still
Here's to getting TBagged by that black female German with an American helmet using a Russian PPSH in Gibraltar
*Edit:  You can, apparently, skip the cutscenes
 Lesson to be learned - do not remap your keys, no matter how bad you want them to make sense
 You'll miss things like skipping cutscenes and not getting stabbed repeatedly by that one German nobody wanted to shoot
**Edit2:  MORE INFO ON ZOMBIESTLDR:  Game looks great, plays like a Burger King toy, feels like a hot-and-steamy on a history book, has zombies

												Very short, alot of qtes and on rails sequences, cliche as hell story
Game is very good looking though, and runs at around 100fps on my 1060 on high settings
Same same call of duty multiplayer, certainly not worth full price, pick it up when it hits $20 or less for a bit of fun
			
Posted: 3 November
WARNING- I mean -CARIFICATION!A lot of people are commenting on my short playtime for this game
Some are claiming that its impossible to evaluate all the game's elements in just under two hours- which is true
I did not play every single multiplayer game mode and map or every single campaign mission
I only played some
However, its certainly possible to get a feel for a game by trying out a few things and not all
That's what demos do
And especially in games like CoD, if two or three multiplayer game types and maps are bad, the rest will probably be uneventful and boring as well
And if not, well, its certainly not worth paying $60 for that one game mode and/or map that's fun to play, is it?Onward to the Review!I played the first campaign mission, "D-Day", which was pretty cool in and of itself
It set the tone very well
As someone who loves history, it was a very somber experience launching off the boats and onto the beaches of Normandy
Granted, the campaign is not exactly historically accurate, but the opening still serves as a somber reminder of the hell on earth that was World War II
At least it did for me (I appreciate history)
But then I played mutliplayer


The game claims to have returned to the CoD roots
I can honestly tell you objectively, from an unbiased perspective, this is false
Of course, there's no space jumping and wall running, but it truly feels like Black Ops 3 with a World War 2 skin; which I suppose is fine for many people who liked Black Ops 3
I liked it, but I don't like a World War 2 version of it
I suppose I may have been expecting something drastically different, since I remember World At War being dramatically different than the CoDs that came after it
But either way, I did not enjoy the multiplayer experience
Allow me to explain: Multiplayer 1) The map design was fairly bad
I mean, the maps were dang beautiful to the eyes, but hideous and disgusting to the gameplay experience
Plus, there's only 8 maps
2) There's a new social space which is kind of


not really necessary, I guess? There's not really a point of it
Just some place you can hang out with people and


watch them gamble their real world currencies for a chance at winning a chance to obtain good-for-nothing and worthless items
3) The customization is rather poor, which is something I've heard many people say so far
Many complained about this in the beta, but it seems they didn't really listen to the feedback in this regard
4) As mentioned above, there's loot boxes in this game
That should be no surprise; as soon as Activision heard about this cancerous money-making scheme, they immediately jumped on board
I hate microtransactions in the loot box form, as does the majority of the gaming community
Gambling real world, hard-earned money for a chance at winning some worthless cosmetic or game-unbalancing weapons and cheats is disgusting and, quite frankly, immature for a studio of this stature
Loot boxes in free-to-play game models make sense
Loot boxes in a $60, supposedly fully finished retail game is absolutely unacceptable and ruins the already unbalanced gameplay of modern Call of Duty games even further
Zombies Now there's the Zombies mode, which was actually very well done
I applaud the designers behind this iteration of Zombies
Its not perfect, but its very exciting and brings back that stressful experience we all came to know and love in World At War and the original Black Ops
As much as I loved it, its certainly not worth buying the game for
I could never justify purchasing a $60 video game solely for the horde mode it offers
If the Campaign was much longer and there were more than two Zombies maps at launch, I    might    consider it
I'm not really going to talk much about Zombies, because its essentially the same model as its always been, but darker and with more grit
I will go over a few things, though
1) The Zombies are more animated, and less


undead, if you can believe that
When I say animated, that's not necessarily a bad thing
I'm not talking about a cartoonish appearance
They're far from that
But they seem like more than just mindless undead humans
They're more, "lively", if you will
Which is


not really a zombie
They also speak
Not English of course, but German
Which is also quite strange
But its not like these things are too much in your face
For most people, including myself, it doesn't break the experience
2) This is still very much Zombies
Its just not "Nazi Zombies" from World At War, which is what many of us wanted this to be
There's still perks, easter eggs, etc
Really nothing has changed gameplay-wise
Many of the perks are generally the same but with new icons and names
Some are new, though
I'll leave those for you to discover yourself if you decide to purchase this anyway
But please, save your money
Campaign  Normally the Campaign is the first thing I do in any first person shooter
I play games not for the multiplayer experience (although I most certainly do get my money's worth on the multiplayer modes), but I mainly purchase games for the single player stories they offer
This game certainly does well in it's singleplayer mode
The campaign is (generally for the most part) nearly an accurate representation of how dark and horrible the worst conflict in human history actually was
In fact, it surpasses Battlefield 1 largely when it comes to the "War Is Hell" mood that both games tried to set
Battlefield 1, which I enjoy far more than this game, did a horrible job at realizing the realities and tragedies of war, making its stories about being a fantastical War Hero performing stunts that were sometimes even near superhuman, whereas this game does it very well, for the most part
Its no Private Ryan, but it comes close
Summary Call of Duty: World War II is a fair attempt to recreate the World War II experience for Call of Duty, however, it fails to shake off the dust of the previous Sci-fi games, which had lead to the series' downfall
Its still extremely reminiscent of the latest games like Black Ops 3 and Infinite Warfare, and fails to return to the roots as it claims
Its almost as if this game's multiplayer experience is Black Ops 3 with boosting disabled and a WW2 appearance, with nothing else changed
While the Campaign and Zombies modes are certainly very interesting and would be entertaining to play for hours on end, they too fall short of being worthy of the $60 price tag
The Campaign is fun and interesting, but very, very short
The Zombies mode is great, but its not worth buying the game just for Zombies right now
If you loved Black Ops 3 or Infinite Warfare, you'll probably love this, but if you're thinking this game returns to its roots and is reminiscent of World At War or the first three CoD games, think again
This most certainly does not return to the roots of the franchise despite the claims, and thus, I do not recommend this game
Do not spend your hard-earned money on this quite yet
Have patience and wait for either a sale, or wait until there's more content
Unforunately, though, the latter will be very irritating, since you'll have to purchase the Season Pass to get the later content, which furthers my point as to why this game is not worth it
			
Posted: 5 November
												So, I was previously writing a review with a very positive rating
After reviewing my own review and also purchasing a copy of this game for the playstation 4 (please note my steam copy was a gift and I already fullfilled my ps4 preorder long before this) I will be rating this game negatively
I implore you read my full review as some of the issues that lead me to the negative rating may very well be opinionated
This is also mostly a review of the game itself, I will discuss PC specific topics towards the bottom
May Contain Campaign Spoilers
CampaignPros*Very well crafted, lots of nice scripted events that make the world feel alive
*Removes the overdone health regen system for a more dynamic squad system
*Has some very nice memorable moments making this a very enjoyable campaign
*Has segments of some of the greatest battles of WW2 with near photorealistic graphics
*Heroic events can be pretty intense in higher difficulty levels
*Engine overhaul allowed for mild level destruction which can be awesome during certain missions such as the tank one
Cons*Very cliche, overdone story
The tension between your squad mates is very predicable and you don't ever get enough screen time with any one member to actually form an emotional attachment to
*Relatively short, looking through my achievements I did it in about 6 hours and I didn't really rush it
*There are only 2 sections in which you aren't doing generic soldier combat, would have been nice to get another tank or plane mission
*I had a hard time getting immersed into the world when there was a major lack of attention to detail, an example being swastikas feeling insanely forced as if they were never planned to be in the game before the backlash
*After your squad medic is captured you no longer have access to a substantial amount of health packs, this can make the game insanely tedious while playing at higher difficulty levels
*Only real reason to complete the campaign is a simple helmet you receive in multiplayer
MultiplayerPros*Familiar Call of Duty gunplay, if you enjoy this like I do you will feel right at home
*Nice maps, while this is subjective, I found the maps themselves were fun to play, in certain situations (more info in the cons)*The inclusion of MWRs quartermaster system
*Supply drops are currently not able to be purchasable with real world money, and are obtained through game time and numerous challenges which ensure you get plenty of them sometimes (More info in the cons)*Some of the most iconic guns of ww2*War is a very underrated and unpopulated game mode
Cons*The headquarters, the headquarters is akin to the tower in destiny
In this game it absolutely does not fit
Many features that would fit just fine in its own menu are only accessible through the HQ
Meaning if I wanted to something simple like changing my emblem I would need to load up the whole entire HQ, run across the place, and access yet another menu
As of the writing of this review the HQ also consistently fails to load you into a lobby with other places making it just this empty area with nothing of interest to do
It just seems like an afterthought and only exist to sell people on supply drops
*Gun Balance is very poor and the gun roster contains few unique weapons
All but one sniper rifle are bolt action that kill from the chest up, 3 smgs that are high fire rate short range weapons, and 3 smgs are slow firing ones meant for medium range
Most of the ARs besides the M1 and SGT contain too few bullets and have damage profiles to similar to these two to actually be of use
There are only 4 shotguns, a decent pump action, a weak double barrel shotgun another weak double barrel, and a weak semi automatic
Most of the LMGs fire to slow, contain way too few bullets, and slow your player down so much it would be stupid to not just use an AR
Only 3 pistols, 2 of which have the same damage profile and the other being a machine pistol with insane recoil and 10 bullets
*Supply drops make a return in this game
As of the writing of the review this game does NOT contain any supply drops with weapons that alter gameplay
However, there are several bugs with them
Supply drops are constantly disappearing
(I have earned 7 and only been able to open 2) The developers took a step back and removed the “recently obtained” menu making it hard to find what you actually own
Sadly, unlike MWR the game does not contain any camos in supply drops
Pistol grips are what has replaced MWR camos for the bulk items in supply drops, they are very uninteresting and can only be used on 2 weapons
Like in MWR, once you collect a full “set” of quartermaster items, you earn a special item, usually a reskin of a weapon
However, it is obvious some of them were overlooked and special attention was paid to others
Some of the SMGs have full weapon overhauls and look fantastic while others look almost the exact same with their stock modified, which you don't even see in game
*Spawns are god awful
I have always been a lucky person and never had issues with spawns in previous call of duty titles, so if you thought those were bad you are in for a bad time here
You will constantly spawn within earshot of another player even on some of the larger maps
In smaller maps it is possible for an enemy to spawn directly beside you
*While the maps themselves are good when played properly, good luck finding a game where people play properly
With call of dutys return to boots on the ground combat, comes the flood of players who will prone in odd doorways, sit in the back of the map not contributing to the team, and flank you from BEHIND YOUR OWN SPAWN
Power positions on most maps have to many entrances to make them worth defending and add in poor spawn systems it can make for an unpleasant experience for the majority of your time
*The way penetration damage is handled is very different in this game
I do not have the 100% direct from the code numbers, but I have had situations where the M1 Garand (a 2 shot kill weapon) took 6 shots to kill through a thin sheet of metal
*Flinch is back and worse than ever, nothing is more infuriating than either getting your gun kicked up so high you miss every bullet, or causing another player to flinch giving them a free accidental headshot
*Map count is the smallest a cod game has shipped with
The base game contains 9 basic multiplayer maps and 3 unique maps for the war game mode
This brings the total map count up to 9 maps, but seeing how 3 of them are only accessible in a single game mode with little replayability it is mildly disheartening
*Despite cods recent addition of more 60hz dedicated servers, the way the game is coded to handle latency means you will still be dying around corners that you were fully behind on your own screen
*Some real attention to detail would be nice, clan tags on your weapon that look like they are written in comic sans is a prime example
*If you can think of a bug that's been in every call of duty release up until now, your gonna be in familiar territory
Launch servers still suck, certain challenges are bugged, the new item indicator is still bugged, certain maps fail to load on PC sometimes and so on
Due to steam character limits my zombies and PC related sections was removed, you can view them here https://pastebin

												This is basically a 1:1 port of the PS4 game, with all patches, DLCs and add-ons (which all add their impressive share of post-main story content)
SAO:HR follows a different continuity from the anime's canon
See below
What I likeThe combat system is reactive, and actually gets better with time
There is a lot of content, even and especially once you clear the main story
It's in English AND it's voiced
I am a simple man
You can party with and customize pretty much everybody, and you can influence a character's AI and actions through the feelings system
The cast is great and well-rounded
What I don't likeThe PC port is passable
I hope you have a controller
See a port review below
The game might seem too easy until you finish the main story
It gets much harder when you hit Warriors of the Sky and Abyss of the Shrine Maiden
There's a lot of information, sometimes dumped all on you at once (especially post-main story)
Fortunately, the game provides a means to re-read the tutorials as much as you want
It's a MMO-like: there's only one save, and most events aren't replayable (some of them are)
It's not as bad on PC since you can copy-paste your save directory, but still
At some points, the translated text is completely replaced without keeping the original intent and meaning, failing at both translation and localization
It's still better than what we got in Hollow Fragment
The affinity/affection system is a chore, as in all Aquria games before
Exacerbated by the translation: the english text sometimes invites you to say Yes when you should have, in fact, said No
Regarding the portPC key bindings aren't ideal; this game was made and is still made for controllers
You're going to be very frustrated if you use a keyboard
Borderless window resolution is locked, and windowed mode manages not to work with Borderless Gaming
Full screen works as expected, however
Performance is okay
Loading times are abysmal (same as PS4, really), but I haven't tried on a SSD yet
Gameverse continuity detailsSAO: Hollow Realization is a sequel to Infinity Moment, Hollow Fragment and Lost Song, all of which follow a different continuity from the anime series, and aren't ported to PC at time of writing
There are a lot of new characters and differences, including:Kirito did not defeat Heathcliff on floor 75 and abort SAO early: Heathcliff was defeated on floor 100 as the final boss, like he initially planned
(Infinity Moment)Leafa, Sinon, Yuuki all join the SAO death game, for various reasons
(Infinity Moment, Hollow Fragment)Strea, a MHCP like Yui, joins the gang after having her own arc
(Infinity Moment)Philia, a self-proclaimed trasure hunter stuck in a closed-off dimension of SAO, met and was subsequently freed by Kirito
(Hollow Fragment)Rain and Seven, idols in real life and in-game respectively, join the team
In ALO, Rain saved Seven after Seven attempted to absorb everybody else, posing as the final boss
(Lost Song)Hollow Realization also includes other characters that are technically part of the SAO universe, but not portrayed in the anime:Kizmel, a NPC close to Asuna and Kirito, from SAO: Progressive (manga and LN)Argo, an intel expert
She's briefly seen in the anime, but has a somewhat larger role in the games
Alice and Eugeo, characters from Project Alicization, which follow the SAO light novel canon after Mother's Rosario
Anime adaptation (SAO S3) in 2018
The SAO arc was covered in Infinity Moment and Hollow Fragment, and the ALO arc in Lost Song
The GGO arc did not happen yet but will in SAO: Fatal Bullet (2018), which follows this continuity
Most of Sinon's backstory was already covered in Sinon's quests, howerer
Closing wordsConsole-exclusive ports are getting less and less bad, but there is still a ways to go
It's nice to see Japanese console developers trying to get on the PC scene, but when it comes to port quality, BNEI/NBGI and partners are still lagging behind other publishers like Square-Enix
SAO:HR is by no means a triple A, and does have a substantial amount of fanservice, but it has way too much work and content behind it for me to classify it as a bad or fanservice-only game
I recommend it to people who:like the SAO universedon't mind heavy-handed fanservicelike visual novels or VN-style events, because there are a lot of thoseThe game has a fully-featured multiplayer mode, with PVP duels and mission/combat cooperation, which I will not review since I have no friends the game can be played solo in its entirety
Review revisions and erratumI originally posted that controllers do not work outside Big Picture mode
That was false
It does however need to be properly configured within Steam

This is only true for the Warriors of the Sky part
Warriors of the Sky was a game update that leads to Abyss of the Shrine Maiden, and Abyss of the Shrine Maiden is a DLC that is properly voiced

+ / positive / things i like*Character Creation - Create your own Avatar Solid design variety Eyes in different colours (optional)Hairstyles from Asuna , Leafa , Silica , Sinon , Yuuki - but you can't change color for these ones(You can see that the characters are mostly defined by their hairstyle/color +- Boobies)*Character Edit anytime in your room with all settings like in the beginning, even gender / name*Short nice Story Recap for Aincrad and Alfheim (optional)*VN-Style Cutscenes , fully voiced, skipable , hideable text (hold RB)*Main Story so far interesting but not mind-blowing, you should like the SAO-World*Loads of Sidestorys / Events*Few Dialogues even made me smile*Every piece of EQ is visible / Outfits can be worn over it*A Tailor to change the outfit of NPC , even a few shop-NPC (all friends)*Monsters / Avatars looking pretty neat*Solid Monster / Avatar variety*Map-design looks good*Texture / Animations look great (for a Port)*Beautiful Sky / Background*Visuals for status effects*Visuals when casting de/buffs/heal - simple but ok*Nice SAO-disappaering / shattering Effect*HUD looks like FF XIV*Fully customizable pallets / sets / skill-item-command Assignments*Seperated pallet-assignments for every weapon type, so no need for rearranging *Pretty fluent menu navigation / world is still active and you can move*60FPS*BGM is awesome*Fully adjustable volume for BGM , BGM (voice-over) , Voice , Effects , Effects (voice-over) *Jap Dub (-only)Combat is fluent / smooth , fast paced, profounded and just awesome , including:9 Weapon types Combo Attack , Sword Skills , buffs / debuffs , heals , potionsCombo Attacks can end in a Sword Skill of your choiceSword-Skill-ChainsAP based Sword-Skills (no cooldown)Team Skill-Connect / Combo AttackStatus-Effects like Paralysis , Bleeding ,

												After already 30 hours of gameplay non stop + streaming it, this is what I'm about to say
First of all, I'm a huge fan of bandai namco jrpg games
Mostly been a huge fan of tales and god eater games and some other naruto game that are hack'n'slash one
I haven't bought any SAO games in my vita, so I only try AW vs SAO and SAO:HR on steam
Pros :- I love how every SAO game aren't 100% the same mechanism with the other SAO games
The game isn't like the previous one that is available on steam, is not like an hack'n'slash only, but they try to make like some kind of a MMO game
- The feel of being like playing with real players
Since they try to create something that ressemble like a real MMO, is pretty impressive that you feel like you're in one even thought you're just playing the singleplayer for the story
If you get into the game+story like I do, you can threat other npc players as if they were real players
You'll see many in town, and also in area, you'll see them fight in group
Of course is not perfect, you can't really choose a topic you want to talk to since they are just AI
But you can interact with them, and while interacting with them more and more, you can create some kind of bond like a real MMO, that's how you make friend
- Big and interesting story, like many of bandai namco games such as the tales series, god eater, and even other SAO, you can guarantee that you'll have tons of hours before completing the story (unless you skip the dialogue)- Good amount of customization for your character, some people will say there isn't enough, but I find it pretty cool
Plus, your clothes change depending on the armor you put
Sadly sometimes you will feel that the armor name just don't fit on how it look xD
- Japanese voice, I know there is a huge debate in the anime about dub vs sub, both have their advantage, and everyone can have their own preference
In my case, I love the japanese voicing more, which you have here
Is not like many JRPG that you just read


read



read



with some few sound like : "ah", "eh", "oh"
But you actually hear the character speak, which is something I really enjoy from the tales and god eater games
Since I'm not a big reader, just listening to the voice/reaction and reading the translate, it feel like watching an anime in subs, way more enjoyable then just reading
- Amazing map, as expected from bandai namco games
Map pretty detail for a JRPG
Of course is not comparable to many shooter game that require high graphic such as destiny 2 that just came out with amazing view/map, but for a JRPG, I'd say is pretty amazing
The details on a rock or jumping between branch, you don't feel like much invisible wall
Of course there will be some invisble wall, like an island surrounded by water, they won't let you start walking on water or swimming for 1 hours non stop
If you play AW vs SAO, you'll see that the map is gigantic, amazing flight range, you can fly anywhere in one area, the only invisible wall are like the edge of an area
While in many other game even in some online MMO, you'll feel invisible wall while trying to jump on a rock where your character jump higher then the height of the rock


but you'll slide straight down @
@


which doesn't happen in SAO:HR, where you can jump on every rock, even the one stick on wall as long as your jump is higher then the rock height
Cons :- Not for players that will just skip the story
If you don't care about the story happening in SAO:HR and just want to play the game and kill monster
I probably won't suggest this game for you
Unlike AW vs SAO where the flight system is something really impressive and smooth compare to many other games, in this game, it will be your average killing mobs and visiting place where you can do in many other MMO or other games
- Not being use to control (since I suppose most people will be using a controller to play this game), the control can be pretty weird at first due to it not being your average hack'n'slash jrpg, but they try to make some kind of MMO
I use a controller to play this game, and usually MMO are being play with a keyboard and mouse on keyboard
Some that play MMO with a controller might be more at ease when they first start this game
On keyboard you have a lots of button which you can set all kind of skills, while on a controller you have to hold button (which is not new) to do some kind of skill, but mostly the select button open you a bar of hotkey
Now this is where it get a bit rough
In some JRPG game, we use select a lots in the middle of a battle of course, like god eater where you need to use select to use healing or bullet change
But in this game, since an MMO usually have a lots of skill, mostly when you advance on class, in here you can have all kind of skill, and there isn't enough button on a controller, so you might be force to press select for other skill + buff + potion
- Create your kirito
The cool thing about most of bandai namco JRPG, is that there is voice with the character instead of just reading and hearing some few sound from your character
The problem here is that, unlike AW vs SAO where you actually see the story of Kirito and his friends, and you can control any premade character, in this game you will be able to custom your character (which should be a pro)
The thing is you will be kirito, that mean you will be the hero of the story of course
I'm a girl, so I created a girl character, but in the story, your character will be speaking as kirito, so you'll have a man voice which can be kinda weird xD
- Bad translate, if you understand at least a few decent word in japanese, you'll notice there is many mistake in the translate, including grammar or some few typo
Question I've receive that isn't part of my pros and con:Q : Is the game worth the price?A : I'd say yes, I heard the game deluxe edition was 80$ when it first came out, of course is cheaper now since this game been 1 year old
I always buy most of bandai game in full price, mostly because I'm a huge fan and I would love to see more of their game being imported in the western
It really depend on you if you want to buy it in full price or on sales, afterall steam sale happen pretty often
I buy it full price to support the compagny, and because how big the game is compare to many other games, you can see that they put tons of work into it
Q : Would you recommend this game for someone that never try a JRPG?A : Probably not SAO : HR to start with due to the fight mechanism being really different then many JRPG, I'll probably suggest to start with the tales one, or AW vs SAO, due to the flight system being really smooth and easy to control even while fighting
Q : If we don't like the anime, will we enjoy the game?A : To be fair, is kinda a hard question, I wouldn't say : because you don't like SAO you won't like any other thing related to SAO
Just like god eater, I started from the game, I was a huge huge huge, a REALLY big fan of god eater, I'm also greatfull I got the chance to meet the creator of god eater as well (THANK YOU BANDAI), but the anime


The anime wasn't as enjoyable as I expected
I loved the character in the game, and I loved the small anime special "God eater prologue" that came before God eater the anime
For SAO, it might be the same thing, just like people loving the VN but hating the anime (but that mostly due to poor adaptation)
If you love JRPG game, but dislike the anime, you can always try the SAO games, there no harm, except only harming your wallet depending when you buy it
But I find the game more enjoyable due to me liking the anime + movie + character
But SAO game are mostly story focus, unlike naruto fighting game, you don't need to watch naruto to enjoy playing a naruto fighting game
You'll probably put more time into the story in SAO games, so if you didn't enjoy the anime/LN, there is a huge chance you might not like the story in the game as well

Posted: 29 October
												After some hours of playing I am ready to write my review
Some may dislike the game mainly because it's SAO


I do agree that if you don't like SAO to some degree you might not enjoy it AS much
The game runs fairly well; I have terrible specs for now generation's games and I can play this game perfectly fine
My primary specs are: I3 Core, GTX 645, 6GB Ram
I am running the game at 40fps (I haven't touched the settings since installed)Assuming most people reading this have way better specs than me since I've had my pc for like 7 years, you should be able to run the game well if that is one of the reasons you are reading reviews
The story is quite fascinating and it's not a game you can complete within a couple of hours which makes it enjoyable to grind
There are apparently a lot of people having issues with using controllers so that there is a con
I am using keyboard
The character creation isn't really good since it's very limited but I managed to create a fairly easy char that resembles Kiyotaka from COTE
(I'm going to update my review after further progession and understanding)

												Guys, the "exit" button has disappeared, I don't know what to do =\\\

												Sword Art Online : Hollow Realization Deluxe editionComes with the season pass and all DLC
Character creation, create the avatar of kirito, even if its male or female
You can change the name, hair, eyes etc
Huge world to explore, fanservice, Lots of quests, Boss raid battles, All in a singleplayer experience
Enough skills to unlock to keep you bussy or  hours, enough armors to find, weapons to try etc
There is co-op and pvp
You can replay almost every quest
60+fps, looks good, plays like a Jrpg, VN style conversations
If you have controller problems -> go to steam Big picture mode and select controller configuration
Check all the boxes from ps4 to xbox input -> restart steam
and voila, controller will now work
Its a great game for Jrpg/MMO style gamepley/Sao fans
It has a little bit of everything, and i really like the world that is crafted so far
Enjoy the game, LINK START !Sorry for the bad english

												Pros:+Solid port runs 4k 60fps (even in town which was locked only to 30fps on console) +Great story and full of side events represented in visual novel style+Nice Soundtracks+Many things to do +Combat is greatCons:- Controller configuration problemOverall:9
5/10Update:After playing 60h+End game content is big and it has it's own storyi noticed some bugs in game like:-Your character get stuck sometimes and cannot move (Seriously? you'll be forced to exit)-The game does freeze during loading or when you switch back to the game after using another app			
Posted: 6 November
												First of all, I'm a fan of the SAO stories (Read the books and watched the anime), however, this is the first game I've played of the series (Mostly because I don't own any consoles atm)
The story is similar but it does goes on a tangent and follows it's own series of events
The story in the books/anime has many faults in terms of game mechanics, being a gamer myself it annoys me once I get out of the 'let's enjoy this story' and into 'game mode'
This game has some really good things, and some really bad ones
Just like the story in the books, it leads me to believe that whoever designed it is not a gamer themselves
Good Aspects1
The world
They made a very believable MMO setting with NPCs acting like players would in the field and in town
2
Unique NPCs
You'll see them in town and in the field
You can befriend them and eventually take them with you to the field or date them, etc
3
Quest Board
A good way of making Col (Currency) and getting some extra XP
Hunting quests, boss quests, mob drops quests (which come mostly from the Unique NPCs and help towards befriending them)
3
The Sword Art system
The active abilities are fun to combine in combat to use your combos and enhance your own playstyle
Use a weapon (sword, dagger, axe, etc
) to raise your skill level with it, which will give you access to new arts and buffs that you can learn by spending skill points
4
Multiplayer
Is very simplistic
Play with friends or strangers to grind for gear or levels
Grivances1
NPC quests
They are monotonous once you start getting a lot of them
You pick them and then have to confirm every single one of them, even if they are 150+
Is very annoying
QoL (Quality of Life) would be to have a way to pick them and turn them in in-bulk
2
Buffs/Debuff Skills
I rather have smaller buffs or debuffs turned into passive skills or reactive skills
Than having to buff myself every 30 seconds
And also they become completely useless towards end game
As passives/reactives they wouldn't become as useless
3
Controls
Gamepads don't work well at the moment
At least I couldn't get mine to work
It took me a few hours, but I got used to using mouse + keyboard
I don't think I'll use a gamepad even if they fix the issues at this point
Another thing, with so many keys, there is no need for toggle keys
It should be Optional, not enforced
4
Difficulty
It starts good and challenging, but it doesn't scale well
I got to a point around lvl 20+ when I could one shot trash that should be my level, world bosses (the lvl95 and above) were beaten with ease, and Zone Boses were done in under a minute
I went into the multiplayer at around lvl 30+ on Nightmare difficulty


they should rename it 'Stroll through the Park' difficulty
Bosses do decent damage, they just need to be more spongey
Overall is a fun game, even with the grivances I have with it
However, it also is a niche game
Is not for everyone
I'm not done with it, I'll continue until I finish it

												My bf and I purchased this game with the intention of playing it multiplayer, only to be extremely disappointed that the multiplayer is only for fighting boss battles, not actually playing the game
The story is also pretty uninspired and just feels like their only goal is to beat you over the head with nostalgia
They really just need to make SAO into a real MMO

												No season pass, no day 1 dlc? No microtransactions to exploit the crafting and level up system


wat?			
Posted: 12 October
												Do you like Resident Evil?Do you like Silent Hill?Do you like Alan Wake?Do you overall like 3rd person atmospheric survival horror?Did you play and enjoy the first game?If your answer to any of the aforementioned questions is 'yes', then stop what you're doing right now and buy this game! Let the horror and weirdness galore begin!FULL REVIEW SUMMARY:Now, that I'm almost 80 hours into the game (and still not entirely done yet), I want to share my final thoughts on this incredible experience
Obviously, it's one of the best games I've played this year and there were a lot of good games
Now, I'm not good at categorizing reviews, so I'm going to summarize my thoughts as best as I can
First of all, it's inevitable to compare it to the first game and I personally have mixed feelings here
There were a lot of great things in the first game that are absent in the second, but the second added some needed spice, especially for NG+, which immensely improved the replayability, which was very weird in TEW with the chapter selection nonsense
Right now, I'm attempting the classic mode and it's a total adrenaline rush! I know people loved the AKUMU mode in TEW, but it was a bit too much for me to handle, while classic mode is much more manageable
I feel like if you're a diehard fan of the first TEW and RE4, you might be slightly disappointed, since the game ends up feeling way more mature and closer to RE7, minus the 1st person aspect, which to me was a huge plus
As a side note, I liked RE7, but kept asking myself "why is it in 1st person?", I really hope they'll be back to the classic 3rd person view in the future
Otherwise, the gameplay felt great! You got your green gel, but in addition, there's now a crafting system, which really added the much needed variety that the first game lacked
Both gun play and stealth feel great, mostly letting you decide how you want to approach certain situations
At first, I wasn't on board with the open world sections of the game, but I eventually warmed up to them and now can't even imagine the game without them! The non open world areas are on a whole different level though, as they are stunning, confusing, horrifying and yet brilliant, as expected from the ingeniously twisted Shinji Mikami!The enemies and especially the villains were great, not as iconic as the first, but still fascinating on their own
The story is great, while not being a direct continuation per se, but instead expends on a substory from the prequel
I've seen people debate on whether they should play the prequel and I say absolutely! While not being as great, at least in my opinion, there are too many references during the sequel, especially some throwbacks to the incredible DLC, that it might get a bit confusing as to what really happened in Beacon
Again, I highly suggest playing both, if you want the complete story experience, preferably playing both back to back
To wrap it up, I cannot recommend this game enough, as it will sadly be overshadowed by many other great games coming out this Broketober
If you love 3rd person psychological survival horror, it's a must buy!

												The true survival horror returned!*Short Version of Review*+ Graphics! Stem engine is pretty cool!+ Open area gameplay it's deeper than the first game+ Whole new upgrade and progression system+ Now this game have side quest and main quest like an RPG game- This game might be hard for some people- Some movement glitch on Seb and enemy you will see them turn around to the circle for sometimes
My score 9/10This is better than the first game and a lot of new things
And harder than the first game
If you asking for real survival horror this is your place
*Long Version*Alright after i cooked this game around 4 hours i should say The Evil Within 2 is really really better than the first game
This is dark and deeper than the first game
And so many new shape of gameplay like- Now this time The evil Within 2 is a open area
This mean you can go anywhere or find some supplies and do some side quest before you rush to the main quest
- New progression system
Just not only use green gel for upgrade your weapon
But this time you can upgrade ability like an RPG Game and so many weapon upgrade for the better journey
- A lot of new weapon- AI looks smart than the first game a lot- New enemy type
Some enemy you can't kill them with a 1 sneak hit
this make the gameharder and more challenging
And so many things new in this game
And this time The Evil within 2 is looks like Survival horror than the first game
Because you have to face a lot of enemy with a little ammo
You have to be better man on the first game
Because enemy you've kill they not drop ammo anymore but you just got gunpower for crafting
That's why this game has be improved stealth system
And you will ending this game or not
It's all up to you
Like an RPG game if you explore a lot your character will strong and you got a lot of supplies for use
But if you go on with only story quest
you will feel the pain because your character is so weak your weapon is so low damage
I gotta say this is really survival horror than the first one
Because you can't kill every enemy anymore but you have to choose your way for run or sneak kill on them Or just run away and go on your business
And with new progression system this is really make The evil within 2 have fun more than first game
			
Posted: 13 October
												I'll keep it simple and to the point
The Evil Within 2 is Resident Evil 7 meets The Last of Us
It combines the third person action/stealth of one with the item conservation and "horror" of Resident Evil
The game encourages exploration and good aim and minimal use of resources
A light RPG/crafting system gives an incentive to take risks
And it's got a hot nurse
			
Posted: 15 October
												To me this is the peak, the cream dela cream when it comes to a pure singleplayer experience
A weak beginning that only draws you in deeper and further, a plot that grows on your spine like the undead that stands behind your back as you read this
This is a snapshot in how to make a game without cutting content out for DLC, season passes or loot boxes, something that scares me (more then this game) we won't be seeing much of in the future
If you still care about games that gives you chills, want to support creators visions in this media then buy this game, buy it and remember this game when you are playing Resident Evil 14 and think to yourself "where did it all go wrong"
11/10 - What Mass Effect 2 was to the trilogy and a killer GOTY contender
			
Posted: 14 October
												Didn't expect it to beat the first game but it did by a mile
Difficulty has increased, the story got even more twisted, enemies are more interesting, free roam, side quests
Everything that I liked in the first game seems to be amplified in EW2 so, can definitely recommend
			
Posted: 21 October
 I created this world, you cannot keep me here
  The Evil Within 2 fixes many things from the first installment but some of the things I liked was also gone
 You are  Leon  Sebastian, trying to find a girl in a town where everything went wrong and must use everything at your disposal to get to her


if you are playing on classic mode difficulty, that is
The game is not that hard to be honest, even in nightmare difficulty after you upgraded some abilities and guns
If you are familiar to action-adventure genre, this game won't challenge you much
The design of the monsters that appear in the town are good enough for me, but it's the boss designs that I'm underwhelmed with
In the first game, every boss was unique and some of them even had their own little backstory
They were memorable
In this one, the antagonists are unique and do have their backstory which is great but they lost their creepiness
Only the chainsaw lady freak and the ''obscura'' is what I liked in terms of looks
Also, the final boss is better than the final boss of the first game but is still bad
 Shoot the glowing parts, really?  The semi-open world style areas are not a bad addition in my opinion but I can understand if some players don't like it
It's a good thing the developers didn't just make the whole game resolve around in the same big area
There is variety, as you progress you start to visit different linear and semi-open areas
The environment design is nice and detailed, it is not boring to look at
Now, onto the good parts :) + Controls are much better! You don't automatically stand up when you aim anymore, don't have to stand still while using syringes, can reload while sprinting and stealth is much more polished with the addition of stealth upgrades for Sebastian
+ Upgrades are separated into two parts and the addition of crafting! No more using green gels for upgrading guns
Instead, you have to collect weapon parts to upgrade your guns
Another new addition is high-grade weapon parts and red gel, you use these two items to unlock the next tier in upgrades, these are found or given to you as you progress in the story
This system prevents you from upgrading to the top tier from the very start so you don't get overpowered in one category
Also, you can craft ammunition in workbenches using less crafting items or on the run using more items
+ Better voice acting! I admit the lines can be cheesy at times but still Sebastian is not dull and actually has a personality
+ The story! A father who feels guilty and trying to find his own daughter story is as generic as it sounds but what makes the story interesting is the involvement of mobius and STEM
I also would like to thank the developers for answering most of the questions that were asked in the first game and not forgetting the events of it AND building up on it
But I still have 2 questions: 1
 How did Sebastian and his team went into the STEM in the first game and why?  2
 WHERE IS MY BOY JOSEPH!? + You don't find the story interesting? It is still fun to play!+ A polished game overall!  If you were a fan of the first game: + Tatiana!+ That part after you reach Theodore! + That feeling I got when I opened last projector slide ;_; and after I talked to kidman about it!In the end, I think this is a solid sequel
Thank you Tango Gameworks! and thank you for reading! :)

												As someone who really disliked the first game, I had a lot of fun with the sequel
Combining open world gameplay with more linear environments, allowing for stealth or combat against enemies and catering to both casual and hardcore survival horror fans
The Evil Within 2 tells a pretty interesting story about a guy stuck in a nightmarish world trying to make sense of things and just rescue his daughter
It's scary at times, action packed but always pretty polished
New Game Plus mode allows high replayability and there's plenty of unlockables and collectibles for completionists
With an I7, GTX 1080 and 16gb ram I've had no peformance issues either and the game looks stellar most of the time
If you didn't enjoy the original game maybe wait until it's on sale, but otherwise I'd say check it out

												>Observer_ is the latest game from the developers behind Layers of Fear
Set in a dystopian cyberpunk world, you play as Dan Lazarski, a neural detective known as an Observer
With your augmentations, you can hack into peoples minds to solve crimes all while reliving some of their biggest fears and nightmares
One rainy night you get a call from your estranged son, seemingly in danger and asking for help
Once you trace that call to a decrepit apartment complex in the slums of Krakow, your investigation begins
This game hit me just like Soma did
I wasn't sure what to expect at first, but the environment immediately grabbed my attention and before long, i was immersed completely in the world and its characters
With a mix of Blade Runner, Midgar from Final Fantasy 7, the movie Brazil and the developers own unique touch, the gritty look, feel and atmosphere of Observer are pretty much perfect
We're talking Rapture/Arkham Asylum/Tallon IV (Metroid Prime), level of detail and quality here
While most of the game takes place in and around a single apartment complex, its size and labyrinth like layout are deceiving
I was often reminded of how Stanley Kubrick purposely built the hotel in The Shining to be confusing and off-putting
You constantly feel a sense of unease at the multitude of tight hallways with rooms that are so close, or at such odd places, they couldn't possibly fit inside the building
While the observing (hacking minds) parts are interesting, thrilling and a nice change of pace, the true star of the show in my opinion is the incredibly realized "real world" aspect of the game
Whether you're going door to door learning about the residents, or finding rooms that are open/unlockable and searching them for clues, or simply just exploring this steamy, crumbling, wire-strewn slum, each aspect is immensely enjoyable and rewarding
I would love to see a sequel someday focused purely on these things
The gameplay strikes a nice balance between a walking simulator and a more action orientated title
While you can't jump (something i always miss when it's left out of a game), you can kneel, run, interact/pick up certain items and open things like drawers and cabinets
You can also use two different scanning devices (think of Metroid Prime's scanning ability) to search for clues or learn more about important objects
Although most of the apartments can't be entered, the majority do have someone to talk to inside them, whom you interact with by using a video device located on the door
You can ask/answer different questions which will give you different responses from the tenants (adding to the replay factor of the game)
At first i didn't know if this would get old/boring after awhile, but because the personalities from room to room were so different and entertaining, by the end i was like an addict running around to each door again just make sure i hadn't missed one
Add on top of that the gruff voice-over work of Rutger Hauer (the actor that played Roy Batty in Blade Runner!) and you have one of the highlights of the game
When it comes to the horror aspect, just like with Layers of Fear, the developers chose to use more psychological means than just jump scares (although there a few of those thrown in for good measure)
This is most apparent when you've hacked into a persons brain, where it can genuinely feel like you're in a bad nightmare
Once you make it through one of these segments, you definitely feel a sense of relief since most of these people have some pretty dark places in their minds
And even when you aren’t in someone else's thoughts, you can still find yourself in some disturbing situations like where you have to make a decision to end a life (which in this case, might be the better choice), or safe a life, or just walk away and not deal with it yourself, since neither option is a particularly good one
There are also few chase/hide sequences as well, but nothing too bad once you realize where to hide and what path to take
Graphically, Observer is a joy to behold
The art direction is so dang good, even simple hallways looked like expensive movie sets
Sometimes you'd have slick Matrix like computer code running all over the walls, while other times it would just be filth (this has some of the grossest bathrooms i've ever seen), dangling wires and computer parts
Regardless of where you are in the game though, there’s always something interesting to look at or examine and because each room/area has a unique look or layout you're always excited to see what's around the next corner or doorway
The lighting, texture work and effects are really well done too, adding another layer of polish to the presentation
I especially like the heat/light rays coming from the lights behind windows
The graphics menu has a decent amount of options although there are two things i think people would like to see added
One is a FOV adjustment since it feels a bit low and is only made worse by the claustrophobic design of the building, and the other is a way to turn off the Chromatic Aberration (which i turned off in the 
ini config files)
Hopefully they'll consider these options for upcoming patches
The music, like everything else, is top notch, mixing dark and dreary segments with more futuristic sci-fi pieces and has a very cinematic tone overall
As you can probably tell by now, i really loved Observer
I played through it twice, one right after the other (it should take around 8-10 hours to beat), even though i knew most of the story's twists and turns
I think that speaks to the compelling nature of the world Bloober Team has created
If you're a fan the cyberpunk aesthetic and/or psychological horror, this is probably a must play
But even if you're not the biggest fan of either of those things, you might still want to look into this one, since it just might change your mind
Highly highly recommended
Thanks to Bloober Team for the review copy

												I


don't even know what I don't know
I just got finished beating the game in ~9 hours in one sitting
To be fair, I could have finished it faster but I explored and attempted to do side missions and achievement based things
That being said


WTF did I just play? I finished the game feeling immensely satisfied, but left with more questions than I could even possibly think of answers for
My mind has never felt so royally scrambled after playing a game before
The story itself gives you just enough to follow along and piece together the complexity of it if you REALLY take the time to focus and decipher the situation and all the subtle twists
On the surface it's easy to follow, but each area has SO much more to it
Even without understanding the nuanced undertones to the journey, the story itself leaves you feeling breathless
This is one of those games that I feel MUST be played a second time to even remotely begin to understand all the details that are easily missed or not understood the first time around
And the great thing about this game


I'm left feeling as though I actually *want* to play through it again
This was a HUGE win for Bloober Team
____ Overall, 9/10 rating!Graphics are incredible and gorgeous throughout
Story is


out of this world
As someone who does research in Psychology, this was


wow
Game Engine was very smooth and didn't have any issues with controls or functionality
ONLY reason the game isn't 10/10 is because there were a few areas that didn't seem wholly optimized
Experienced a couple spots where framerate went from 60's to mid-high 20's
I feel, given this is such a newly released game, that this will probably be addressed in future patches
If that's the case, I'll amend my review as necessary
But again, I cannot recommend this game more! I still am just left with an utter sense of astonishment and "Wow!" If I had the time, I'd start a second playthrough right now
			
Posted: 25 October
												The game is really good, but it's too buggy
I encountered two game breaking bugs so far
The support was really friendly in resolving the first by sending me a savegame from after the bug
Of course, this lost some of my achievement and side progress, but that's fine
Shortly thereafter, another game breaking bug appeared and all the support could tell me is that I should restart the whole game
What's the guarantee that everything would work when I get to that point again? It's just not fun like this
I'll have to give it a "no", because it's just unreliably playable at this point

 Bite-sized review Mind matters Review in 30 seconds There is no denying that visually and audibly ">Observer_" is a tour de force
Incredibly stylized, with some of the prettiest and most striking graphics you will see all year, not to mention one hell of a harrowing soundscape, playing ">Observer_" often feels at times like one is being violently assaulted in a dark alley by a dangerous entity
">Observer_" starts out as a cyberpunk thriller set in an futuristic apartment block where a detective, Daniel Lazarski (Rutger Hauer), is summoned by his own son - who it appears is in some kind of mortal danger -  but gradually becomes bone-chillingly more patricidal the further into its labyrinth of broken memories you venture where past, present and future collide in such a way that it would make M
Night Shyamalan turn green with envy
While not perfect (it takes a bit too long to get going and therefore might lose some of its audience) but once the game kicks in proper you had better make sure you are strapped in tight
Absolutely hair-raising stuff and next to "Resident Evil 7" one of 2017's crowning chillers
One word to sum up the experience Mind-bending Performance/Bug related incidents Some slight FPS dips but for the majority ">Observer_" runs really well
  Similar to games "Resident Evil 7"; "Layers of Fear"; "SOMA""; "Narcosis" Suitable for Suitable for teens and up and those with a strong stomaches
At times ">Observer_" gets all "Alien: Isolation"-like scary
Position in my games of 2017 cleared list 7th favorite

												If you enjoy Bladerunner and other cyberpunk movies/games alike, this is the game for you
Pros:- Amazing voiceacting (Rutger Hauer being in this is beyond cool)- Great atmosphere - Intriguing story- Very unique- Incredible original soundtrack- Fantastic Visuals Cons:- Confusing at times- Could be boring if you don't enjoy heavy narrative- No combat could be a con for many people, didn't really affect the game for meThis isn't my type of game at all, but I enjoyed my entire playthrough :)Hope this review was helpful :D

												I'll say right off the bat that this game has insane atmosphere and detalization
From what I can tell, the horror of this game is not about the jumpscares
It's about psychology
This game tells you the story about people's scars through masterful surrealistic visuals and amazing dialogues which brought to my mind some famous movie directors known for their artistic vision that is quite uneasy for the general public
Not to mention that you're playing as a Rutger Hauer himself, which is pretty symbolic for me as a Blade Runner fan who enjoyed his performance as Roy Batty
Sounds and music of this game match the overwhelming tone of a dystopian world just wonderfully
But if you're not a fan of slow paced games, observer might not be for you

IntroductionI wanted to finish Observer’s story in its entirety, similarly to my review method for Layers of Fear
Not only are these two linked through a few common themes, but they’re both the skilled work of Bloober Team SA
This developer made the perfect transition from fairly superficial arcade titles towards atmospheric video games, more suited for an educated and mature audience
Spelled as “>observer_”, it’s an obvious reference to programming and command inputs among other things
I would never regard this game as being boring, as some of the negative reviews on Steam pointed out, but I have to agree that Observer is in dire need of optimization and glitch fixing
As long you don’t expect instant action, all will be well
It’s a detective tale with an even slower burn than L
A
Noire, but just as exciting!StoryRarely do I write about a video game whose sources of inspiration are drawn from numerous works of literature, movies and even other games
In Observer’s case, the strongest influence comes from 1982’s Blade Runner (a Sci-Fi masterpiece I highly recommend watching) and this can be noticed by the character likeness and voice acting provided by the Dutch actor Rutger Hauer which played the main antagonist’s role in the aforementioned film
Tables have turned and in Observer, Rutger gives life to Detective Daniel Lazarski, arguably the only character in the game which doesn’t have any hidden intentions or motivations
And that is truly ironic since our detective is a titlular Observer
A mix between a Blade Runner (given his interrogation methods) and a cyborg, who’s constantly dependent on a self-injecting substance, in order for his implants to work flawlessly
Just by that last sentence, the Synchrozine subplot can be seen as shout-out to Deus Ex’s Neuropozyne or the Prozium II injections from the 2002 dystopian movie, Equilibrium
It’s evident that we’re dealing with a bleak dystopia in Observer as well, only that instead of a Big Brother (Orwell’s “1984” is present in-game as several easter eggs) or a Tyrell Corporation, the all-seeing digital tyrant is Chiron Incorporated
The game’s action takes place in Kraków, 2084
The Fifth Polish Republic is an abstract yet still oppressive regime whose leaders are never mentioned and they carry little importance to our story
This is in fact a neo-noir tale detailing the struggles of a classic anti-hero cop with a dysfunctional family
The trope doesn’t go all the way though and Lazarski is driven by a strong desire to reunite with his distant son
On a rainy night, Adam finally calls his father
He needs help
What might have given the impression that the level structure is open (Daniel is seen inside his Matriarch AI-assisted squad car, in Observer’s first few minutes of gameplay), turns out that in a same manner as Layers of Fear, players shall get to thoroughly explore a closed albeit highly detailed environment
In our case, a run-down tenement block
A glimpse into a society which is controlled on all levels by a corporation which has CCTV cameras, hidden microphones, informants and death squads everywhere
A devastating war from the past and the still lingering threat of a debilitating plague are the perfect excuses for Chiron to exert its twisted power over all aspects of life
That includes its own employees (Observers, as well) which are kept on the same short leash as the “Class-C Citizens” from the apartments which Lazarski is currently investigating
GraphicsObserver features some state of the art visual assets, courtesy of the Unreal Engine 4
What it shouldn’t have contained though, are the severe frame rate drops experienced on most resolutions I tested, from 1080p to 4K
I ended up settling for 2K since I wanted the screenshots to feature the right amount of details for them to be used as desktop backgrounds
Took close to 200 screens and more than half of them were subsequently linked onto my Steam account
I like the game, especially from its graphical perspective
It fits the story like a glove and many of its visual glitches are a game design choice
The bugs may not be game-breaking, yet I fell through the floor on a couple of occasions and had to restart from the previous autosave point
Fortunately, the game progress gets saved fairly often and it can be triggered by moving from a room to another, sometimes
The frame rate dips are my main concern with Observer
I’ll explain why, without having to boast my system specifications
They are high-end and I keep all my drivers updated along with properly maintained hardware
No highly detailed UE4 games I tested so far on Steam (and there must have been at least a dozen) would drop from 60fps to 30 or less, WITHIN THE SAME ROOM
This is a clear red flag for unoptimization and it happened on a resolution of 2560x1440
When I tried running Observer on 3840x2160, I could expect even 10fps in the troublesome circumstances I already mentioned
The developer needs to fix this ASAP and I can only hope that an update or two will provide the much needed stability
Observer looks amazing, but it doesn’t sport lush jungles and intense gunfights to warrant the digital punishment it currently renders onto my GPU
By contrast, the Unity-powered Layers of Fear ran maxed out@4K, never dropping below 45fps on my PC
I know, we’re comparing apples to oranges but my point is, perhaps Bloober Team should have stuck with Unity Engine 5 instead of Unreal Engine 4 which always represents more trouble than it’s worth
AudioAlong with Hauer’s excellent voice acting, the other characters also sound convincing and the soundtrack was an adequate collection of futuristic instrumentals that would shift towards more classical sounds, during some illusions or interrogation sequences
As for the script itself, there are more than a few swears thrown around by either Lazarski or the NPCs he interacts with
It’s part of the good cop/bad cop routine, right? Still, the detective seems like a troubled mind and he occasionally slips off another one of his monologues
As much as I’d like to share with you the clip for “tears in the rain”, a touching soliloquy by Rutger near Blade Runner’s ending, I’ll let you see the entire movie first without spoiling anything
Gameplay, Verdict, Summary & Rating are below in the Comment Section

												This


is a tough review to write
The game has hundreds of points of exceeding brilliance
The game is frequently a battle with the level layout and the UI, trying to figure what's desired of the player next
(especially in the "dream" bits)The game explores topics in ways that haven't been adequately covered in years
(think: puree Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner, and William Gibson books; add salt and rat poison to taste)The game has an autosave system, and at least one point-of-no-return w/o a clear warning of the same
If you're looking to feel like you've mainlined Noir and cyberpunk-based drain cleaner
 If you're looking to feel confused and bewildered most of the time
 If you want to wade neck-deep in poverty, despair, and black humor
 Then get it
(on sale, natch)Otherwise, just wait for some poor b@stard to make a Let's Play, and laugh as they proceed to lose their minds
TL;DR: I have no way to reduce this one to a number which will do my feelings justice
 I really liked it, but I'm still not sure if I hate it too

												I have never seen so many interesting "scare mechanics" in one game before
The whole game plays like you are walking through a haunted house, and it is GREAT
Every time you walk into a new room, you never know what to expect
Bear in mind however, this game is VERY dark, and I'm not talking about brightness settings
Some themes in this game can be very disturbing
A very short but very good horror game with a dark and interesting storyline
Highly Recommended
			
Posted: 1 May, 2016
												I picked up Layers of Fear after I noticed it had come out of early access
I refuse to buy games in early access anymore, so I just add them to my wish lish and wait for them to be "finished"
I am posting this review after I played and beat the game
Layers of fear is kind of an interactive story, puzzle, survival horror kind of game
You play as an artist returning home to work on his opus magnum
At what first appears to be a basic jaunt around his home, quickly turns into a psychological horror, the house appears to be (possibly) haunted as the layouts change, you are confronted by visions of your dead wife and other various paranormal-esc situations
Along the way, you'll collect notes and other memorabilia within the house that offers quick glimpses into the painter's past life, his family and even the state of his mental health
The game isn't as "scary" as other games of this nature may be and in fact, you are put in several situations in which you can avoid confrontation entirely if so desired
As far as I am aware, there isn't really a way to die in the traditional sense, which is nice, because the game is set up in a way that you won't have to restart entire chapters of a mistake you may have made
The writing for the story is farily good, I'd say much better then games such as Penumbra
It's a fairly unqiue and engaging story that made me want to continue playing just to find out a little bit more
The puzzles are (generally) not too hard and there was very few moments I was actually stuck
Unfortunately the game doesn't help you in any real sense, besides some hints scattered about the game and as a result some of the more obscure puzzles can leave players scratching their head
While I did enjoy the time I spent with the game, there are issues with it that I feel inclined to inform people of
For starters, when you first start playing the game, it's fun and fascinating to explore the artist's big, beautiful house
The problem is that very early in the game, the exploration aspect of the game is all but removed, Instead the game becomes somewhat of an "on-rails" adventure game, instead of walking freely through the house, instead you'll be traversing hallways and single rooms
9 out of 10 times, as you enter one room, the door will close and lock behind you, denying any sort of back tracking in the game
This can become an issue, because the game feels as if it were meant to be explored and it was just a concept that was throw to the side
On occasion you may be given the opportunity to travel off the beaten path, but it is almost always just for a moment and it usually results in a dead end or locked door
The missing exploration concept bothers me, because I have always loved horror books, games and movies that involved big, old, beautiful mansions
Another problem that I had with the game is it never really changes scenery too much
A large majority of the game just looks the same
Expect to see a lot of dark, dingy rooms, broken walls and floors and broken furniture
Also expect to see the same art, furniture and random junk over and over and over again
This becomes an even bigger issue when the game starts to begin recycling rooms
Finally, the last problem I had with the game was the story
Remember earlier when I said they had a good story? They do, the problem stems from the fact that there's a lot of information presented for players to process and it's never really tied together or explained in any real sort of meaningful way
While I enjoyed the game while I played it, after I beat it, I felt very dissatisfied because I really didn't learn all that much and the game doesn't really make a good attempt at helping you understand
I have questions, no one appears to have answers and frankly, I am no really into the entire "fan theory community" in which the developers of a game simply don't inform or release information to players, instead they just wait to see if someone gets it "right"
For me, it just seems like a really lazy form of writing and I tend to get high aggravated with it
Don't get me wrong, I love reading long books, I like guessing at the story, or the plots or even coming up with theories as I enjoy whatever book/movie/game I am playing
But I expect the writers to eventually tie down and explain what is going on in a clear, concise and satisfying way
If you like games of this nature, if you have enjoyed games like 'A Machine for Pigs' and 'Penumbra', you'll enjoy this game a lot
If you like psychological horror, you'll appreciate this game
I can without hesitation recommend this game to horror fans, even given the rough spots of the game
			
Posted: 9 June
												This is a game that genuinely tried to scare me by throwing a bunch of garlic in my general direction
THE BAD Here's how the plot of this kind of games is structured
1
You launch the title
2
You know that everything that happens around you is a visual metaphor for one of the following (because it always is): you being dead you dying right now you being an, ahem, bad person your family/children/loved one being dead your family/children/loved one dying right now your family/children/loved one being, ahem, bad people you having killed someone you having killed yourself you planning to kill yourself you being in denial about a traumatizing memory trying to resurface3
You then play the game, eliminating the wrong options and thus arriving at which inevitable MINDBLOWING AND UNEXPECTED twist this particular one features
(In case you're curious, in LoF's case it's a combination of  3, 4, 6, and 9
)What I'm trying to say is, the plot of Layers of Fear is so horribly cliche and delivered in such a stilted, overwritten, and unnatural way that it actively hurts the game
The story of a Super Tortured Artist living with a Super Tragic-slash-Insane Wife (who is also a person of art, a musician) in a Super Posh Mansion is one that would fit on fanfiction
net, not in a game with a price tag
The worst part is, the writer of the game that is supposedly about art seems to know very little about it, which is why all plot points, letters, and discussions of art remain incompetently vague, afraid to go into specifics
We keep reading how the main character's art became bad, but—how? Why? Did his linework become weak? The use of colors, blurry and muted? The composition, skewed? Did he become repetitive and second-hand? What was the context of his creations?For a game supposedly about art, Layers of Fear has surprisingly little to say on the subject, if anything at all
THE GOODFortunately, the rest of the game is good—great even
Keep in mind that this is a walking simulator with mild optional puzzles (either skippable or impossible to fail)
However, among walking simulators, this is definitely the most visually impressive and robust I've played
It tried very hard to reinvent something as simple as walking—often successfully
For the most part you will follow a linear path along a corridor of rooms
Each room is a carefully-crafted separate experience that does its best to be surprising while still using an extremely limited number of mechanics
Sometimes you need to find an item in a drawer
Or walk past a painting
Or, say, look up
Or turn around twice, with the room changing behind your back
Or maybe just move along unobstructed
And then something surreal happens
It also thows original challenges at you, like instructing the player not to look back and then playing an intriguing/scary sound behind them
It's not too complex, but it's hard not to respect the thought that went into turning Layers of Fear into something more engaging and interactive than a common walking simulator
THE PRETTYThe horrors are of the common screamer variety—you won't find subtlety or taste here
However, there was a particular type of screamer that I really liked, and that was huge paintings sometimes appearing behind your back
They do nothing, they don't even move—but unnatural size and proximity definitely make them uncanny in a not-so-overused way
And yes, the paintings are beautiful, as are the rest of the designs
All in all, I would recommend Layers of Fear to fellow lovers of the genre—especially those who are ready to look past the cliches and enjoy this beautiful and oftentimes inventive game for what it is

Early Access Review
								This is a great horror game:1
It's not build up on jump scares, there are some jump scares, but not to the point where it gets annoying
2
The graphics is very very decent3
The controls are okish, but could be awkward sometimes4
The music and sound effect


OMG!5
The way the atmosphere and sense of horror builds up gets scarier and scarier as you play
Man, this is some true horror6
You can actually get killed7
The story is good and very rewarding as you reveal it

Early Access Review
								Being a huge fan of horror games, I absolutely had to pick up Layers of Fear
As described it as a “psychedelic horror” game, as you play a painter who is feverishly attempting to complete a true masterpiece, while going mad in the process
“Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter
” ~ Oscar Wilde The game mechanics are incredibly refreshing, as there was no specific villain you were trying to escape from, for the most part, which meant that the 'environment' was what you needed to fear, including several jump scares along your way
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=519450951Atmospherically, Layers of Fear is astounding from the moment you enter the house you will be exploring
Rain is falling heavily outside, with occasional bursts of thunder crackling behind you
The entire game is influenced by art and décor from previous centuries, particularly the architecture and design of the 19th century, and the visuals are very well tied together with this theme
What also worth mentioning is the incredibly alluring and chilling soundtrack during the gameplay, that gives you the emotions the situation pulls you in
https://www

com/watch?v=7sB_6mk-XTwI’d recommend the game to anyone who enjoys horror games as a genre, particularly if you don’t mind games where you can’t defend yourself and it’s all about you, the antagonist, and the spooky atmosphere
Despite the game 'still' being in Early Access, what IS available to play is deeply engaging, if in need of a little polish here and there
The game relies heavily on its ability to set you on edge, so if you’re the type with nerves of steel you likely won’t get too much out of it
To horror fans, however? I wholeheartedly recommend Layers of Fear to you!9/10

Early Access Review
								This is a keeper
I don't usually play scary game's unless they're top-notch in terms of overall quality and production, and this game is one of them
A high quality horror/thriller game that I really hate myself for playing and continually playing
So far an hour in and screw me, screw this game, but love the quality in the controls, gameplay, features and voice acting
https://www
youtube
com/watch?v=MpweuoNAgdQThe graphics are really great and beautiful alongside the atmosphere being really tense and immersive
The level of quality in this game and the attention to detail can be put just below P
T
if not alongside it
The voice acting is just lovely and the dialogue that it has in relation to what you see in the game alongside to what you interact with that's story specific is really awesome to read
And speaking of story, from what I understand so far it's pitting crazy with crazy and I love it
If you're wondering about jump-scares, there are in the game but within the realm of confusion and mystery the game has so I appreciate it more so than the usual crap in other scary games
Still playing it and will continue to hate myself as I continue to play it
I whole-heartily recommend this game because of the combination of the high quality production in every aspect, the low price point and the amount of crazy in it in terms of features and story
Update: So I finished it, the "early access version" in about 2 hours, but damn was it fun
Yes, a horror game that I had "fun" in, and even though I mentioned that I hate myself for/while playing it, I wanted more
The game is just a joy and I don't mind if the price goes up if they add more and more crazy and content to it
To re-confirm what I said, I love the game because it's high quality and has a lot of crazy trips in it, and it's definitely worth the purchase

Early Access Review
THIS GAME IS TERRIFYING!To be completely honest, I was nearly scared into a coma by this game
Layers of Fear offers a truly immersive horror experience
The story takes you on a tour through the mind of a madman
As you progress, you find clues that give you details about life of the character before he went crazy
I actually had chills during certain areas of the game
The environment is constantly changing around you, and you never know what is waiting for you at the next turn
I would definitely suggest picking this game up while it is in EA (Early Access)
I was left hanging because the game is unfinished
The cool thing about being a part of this game while it is in EA is that the game is constantly changing
You can help the developers iron out the kinks and help make this game better
Plus, you get the game much cheaper than people who will purchase the full game when it is released
I cannot wait to see where the developers take this story! Even though it is unfinished, I consider this game a horror masterpiece!+Story+Jumpscares+Immersive environment+Visuals+Creepiness+Early access offers a chance to help the developers make the game better+Early access means you get the game at a cheaper price-Cleaning urine from my chair-Feelings of dread-Nightmares-Uncontrollable cryingIf you have any questions about the game, post a comment here and I will answer it!One of the jumpscares you could encounterhttps://www

												My five-year-old daughter likes to scare me occasionally, sneaking into my room while I’m busy brushing my teeth and screaming as loud as her distressingly-powerful lungs will let her
It’s jarring and unpleasant but I laugh it off because she’s just trying to be funny, and more importantly she doesn’t do it that often
If she screamed in my face every morning and afternoon and evening it would quickly reach tiresome and cruise straight on to aggravating
My five-year-old daughter understands this, but for some reason the people behind Layers of Fear do not, despite crafting an otherwise beautiful and fascinating game to house their cheap jumpscares
The game opens with very little explanation, you alone in a palatial Victorian mansion stuffed full of art supplies
It soon becomes clear that you are a painter, a husband, and a father, and these aspects of your life do not coexist peacefully
You are compelled to complete your greatest work, but there are demons pulling at you every step of the way and the further you get in the closer to home they hit
As you battle through the twisted mansion to achieve your goal, the true nature of your painter avatar is made shockingly clear
In gameplay terms, this is a walking simulator
You wander the halls of your mansion, free to open drawers and cabinets in search of collectibles or rare discoveries like keys, ever onward towards your goal
Every chapter starts in your studio and takes you through a seemingly random assortment of nightmarish halls and chambers
There are points where your path will branch in subtle ways but it always ends in the same place, a dramatic setpiece that reveals key events in your character’s past and supplies him with one of the necessary pieces of his masterpiece
I don’t use the term “walking simulator” derisively, in fact I rather enjoy these guided tours of nightmare mindscapes
Layers of Fear is near the top of the pile in aesthetic, at least, with an impressive amount of detail on every wall fixture, desk drawer, and pile of rubble
The many halls of the manor are distinct enough to be memorable, and setpieces often use huge numbers of small objects like checkers or books to give locations a tactile, lived-in feel
It’s a wonderfully dreary place topped off with some incredible effects like melting furniture and paint flows that make you feel right at home in a twisted projection of reality
There’s plenty to marvel at as you explore the vast mansion, but you’ll be scouting around under a permanent air of dread
This is a horror game after all, and all those magical details are designed to make you feel as fraught and threatened as possible
Flickering lights, broken doors, scrabbling in the walls, melting paintings, and darker things still will accost you as you slip further into the madhouse
The atmosphere reaches a number of feverishly oppressive peaks, always capped off with a shock like hurtling books or slamming doors or screaming ghosts
And honestly, that’s where the game loses me
It doesn’t just lose me, it actively drives me away in a huff because as much as I love the atmosphere, I DESPISE the jumpscares
I’m a jumpy person and I don’t care much for big shocks like screamers, but I’ll tolerate ones in games like SOMA and Oxenfree because they’re infrequent and earned
Layers of Fear, in stark contrast, ends almost every single one of their building spooks with a loud noise and jarring visual
There’s hardly any break between them, as scares usually come only three or four rooms apart
What’s worse is that they’re often telegraphed, too… anytime a door locks behind you or the next one doesn’t open immediately, you’re in Scarytown for the duration
Combined with the ultimately linear nature of the game, this sucks a ton of the fun out of an otherwise promising horror game and turns it into a cheap carnival ride
Walk 10 steps, watch a screamer
Walk another 20, get books thrown at you
Turn the corner, a window bangs
It becomes utterly perfunctory, yet keeps trying harder and harder to shock you by getting louder and more audacious
By the end Layers of Fear feels like a game that was designed to be moody and atmospheric, and then was harangued endlessly for not being scary enough until it was completely over-tuned
The cheap jumpscares are so much more annoying because they’re not even necessary, yet they persist and fight ever harder to shock you
That should tell you everything you need to know to decide on this one yourself, but if you’re in the mood for spoilers I’m going to talk about the story a bit
I don’t normally dabble in spoilers but by the end I was so fed up with the main character that I simply couldn’t manage my ire anymore
Your dude is a tortured artist who is obsessed with his work, obsessed with professional validation, and obsessed enough to neglect his family to literal death
Ostensibly this is a story about redemption but you’ll soon find he’s so irredeemable that you’ll almost wish his demons would just kill him
I actually did that in the later chapters where his dead wife is wandering around, I would run him right into her cold, fatal embrace because after everything I had seen and heard from him he deserved nothing more
Seriously, to complete his masterwork he’s searching for pieces of his family, tanned skin and blood vials and an actual eyeball, to paint with
The man turned his wife and daughter into art supplies and we’re supposed to believe his soul can be saved? Really?Ultimately, Layers of Fear is a horror game with an incredibly promising base and a painfully inept structure built upon it
The technology and artistry on display is undeniable, the game looks amazing and has a talent for surprising and impressing
But instead of using that talent to build a compelling story and atmosphere, the game settles for cheap, mindless scares and a story that simply doesn’t work
I won’t deny that I enjoyed admiring the squalor of the mansion and rifling through dressers for clues, but the knowledge that another dumb room with a dumb screaming scare was coming up always filled me with the wrong kind of dread
When I finished the game I felt such relief, not at the conclusion of a compelling story or at the accomplishment of a goal, but at the fact that I would never have to play this wretched thing again

Early Access Review
								I'm going to start this right off the bat by saying this is by far one of the best horror games I've ever played
I cannot get enough of it
It's a bit slow paced at first, but it builds you up for all that's to come - and does an amazing job at that thus far
The graphics are phenomenal, the game is absolutely stunning
It does need a bit of optimizing, but that's understandable at early access
The voice acting is amazing, the attention to detail, the music and sounds, everything is just superb
It all came together so nicely and the developers can only make it better from here on out
Now I, and most people, have come accross a bug in which a room just goes pitch black - causing you to go back to the menu and then back to the game
A bit of a drawback, but can be fixed nonetheless
This game outshines most games and I just cannot recommend it enough
If you're an avid horror fan looking to add something new to your library, this is it
10/10 buy this game naow
EDIT: My goodness, this game just gets better and better with every update
Layers of Fear is incredibly unpredictable and because everything just comes together so nicely, you're constantly on alert; I have yet to come across a game that does that so smoothly and efficiently as this one
You're in for one hell of a ride if you get this game
			
Posted: 13 June
												Let me say something before anything else



This game was honestly amazing and mind blowing
I love playing games like this and this is a great example why
The story is very deep and in a way, you really do care about it
I dont want to write a whole review about the game because you simply need to just play it
If you really want, you could refund the game and get your money back, but in my eyes, this game went above and beyond and it stays in my library so I can play it again
			
Posted: 23 June
												This is one of those games that is filled with artistic value and an intriguing story
I found myself drawn in quite quickly and even though it was a very short game, it didnt feel that way as I progressed
I believe it was created by people who truly love storytelling and the industry arts
You move through a house full of secrets and memories while enjoying varied gameplay mechanics and pieces of the story behind the Finch family
+ Fully narrated with voice over which I love in a game like this
+ Beautiful art design
+ A story that makes you think deeply
+ I felt the value was present from start to finish
+ Game mechanics are fun and intuitive
There was no hassle or break in immersion
- A little short- A little pricey (I felt it was worth it by the end though)I would highly recommend this to my friends
Well done devs!

												It's hard to find words to describe this game
It's gobsmacking
There are very few games that make me stop just to put a hand to my mouth and ssay "Oh my God"
But this is one of them
The story was incredible, and I found myself playing it all in one sitting
It's quite short, but don't let that put you off
It's the perfect length for what it is, any longer, it would have dragged on, any shorter, it would have seem rushed
It's perfect, and I have nothing negative to say
Just play it

												What the hell is this game, you may ask?Let me try to answer this the following way
It is something special, so it deserves an unusual approach:-	First person exploration, story driven, surreal and weird… -	Brilliant alternative gameplay concept and ideas… (play an interactive comic, control several animals, etc
)-	Breathtakingly beautiful, detailed setting/graphics… (exception: the sky isn’t done well)-	Excellent music, sound, narration and story


-	Duration: 3 hours to get 100% (…couldn’t stop playing till I got 100%


)Impressions: It is so creative, intense, disturbing, touching and wonderful how you experience things in this game
You will be confronted with death, a lot
Each of the deaths are done interestingly, and often take you by surprise, and it's a game about loss, heartache, and happiness
It's a rollercoaster, but well handled
Never experienced something like this before! 10/10 (personal opinion, as this is my favorite genre)			
Posted: 19 July
												An interesting game- This game is like a set of stories in a main history , the main character is Edith Finch  
A girl who comes back to her old house in the state of Washington in the US  to try to research the strange histories that happened in the house to her family members 
 - As i said it  is like a set of stories because every bedroom has an interesting history that catches you   about what happened with the the owner of the bedroom as  main character of the small history  
- The gameplay is easy and simple , walk Interact with the environment  and explore 
- The graphics are really beautiful and same is  the soundtrack 
- The only bad is this game is short but it  is worth 
 - I recommend this game

												Life is shortLove your family more10/10			
Posted: 1 May
												What Remains of Edith Finch tells the story of Finch family
You play as Edith returning to her old house and finding out what exactly happened to everyone
The game tells the stories in a beautifully fantastic way and I'd say it is a piece of art
Playing this gave me quite a lot of feels, because it is sad and heartbreaking as you slowly learn more of the family
Finishing it doesn't take very long, from 2h+ depending on the player
All you mostly do is walk around and exploring objects, aka one of those "walking simulators"
Those who love story rich experiences I recommend to play this and see what remains of Edith, but for some the price might be too high considering that it's not a very long game and might not have much replay value (again depends on each player)
I think though, that it doesn't matter because WRoEF is such a good game
			
Posted: 24 May
												What Remains Of Edith Finch is a fantastic game
Yes, it's one of those walking simulators
But it is also one of those games, that will keep you thinking afterwards about what you just experienced for quite a while
It is unique, creative, beautiful
I see it easily at the very top of the genre together with games like Firewatch, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and others
At times it is sad, at others it is delightful
Often it's both at the same time
When it is at its peak, it very effectively mixes the strong, melancholic narrative with gameplay in a way, that at its core reminds me of Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons
It's these moments that are the strongest ones
It may just be a linear walking simulator, but the fact that you are in control, that you have to execute the motions of the character right before fate takes its course, shows how effective games can be be in transmitting emotions to the player
Maybe in some cases more so than movies
9/10			
Posted: 16 May
												I'm writing this in tears right now
 The entire game is a slow-motion up and down of emotions
 The writing and the narration delivery are some of the best in a game
 By the end, I was so spent, I cried, and I'm not afraid to admit that
 This is a very beautiful game
 The house is so perfect
I literally felt as if I was in a house well-lived in by many generations
 The amount of interactions with objects was perfect, and mouse motion needed to interact with and move things was intuitive
 The small details of people's lives left in a house were perfectly done
 Every story of a family member was done differently, and they immersed me in each one
 You become invested in this family's history and touching stories which bring a smile, a laugh, or a tear
 This is well worth the money
 You can't judge this one on length, rather evaluate it on content

												Having 42 hours on record and 100% achievements on this game, I think I can provide a useful review
This is a great game and excels at what it was made for
That said, it is not for everybody
Thus, I shall be listing what to and what not to expect from it
What to expect:- Survival horror: there is no fighting (on your part), running and hiding is the aim of the game
- Jump scares: yes, it's a survival HORROR for a reason
Keep a spare pair of underwear available when you are playing this game
- Explicit and dark: violence, gore, vulgar language, some nudity and sexually related incidents all play a part in creating the dark, horrifying atmosphere of Outlast
- Interesting storyline and background information: The storyline has a bit of a twist in the tale, things aren't exactly as you expected them to be
Also, with all the notes and documents one collects in this game, one gets a decent amount of background information which helps with the atmosphere of the game, develops the plot (and player understanding thereof) and gives the player insight as to the nature of the silent protagonist, as well as some of the antagonists you'll be facing
What not to expect:- Hours of replay value: your first playthrough will probably be about 5-6 hours and the DLC about 1-2 hours
As the game progression is always the same, there is little reason to play it again (with the exception of wanting to get achievements)
- Competitiveness: There is no form of multiplayer or leaderboards of any kind
- Something suitable for children (you should have picked that up by now)- Sunshine and roses- Clean underwear- Being able to sleep at night (slightly exaggerated)I absolutely loved this game and highly recommend it to anyone that is a fan of the horror genre, whether it be movies or games
I hope the information listed will help you in your decision of whether or not to purchase this game
Happy Gaming!

												This was probably the most fun I've had playing a horror game in a good while, which surprised me because I really wasn't expecting much out of this one
Jump scares are definitely not the only things that will give you the chills, this game has strong atmosphere, and lurking around to avoid being seen by enemies can be some of the creepiest parts of the game, and can be terrifying when you're being chased
The game also has enough meat to it to put all of it's mechanics to good use without ever feeling underplayed or gimmicky
I also feel that the game does a good job of making you care about the main character's well being, he goes through so much crap in this game that it makes it all the more motivating to keep going and see what happens next
I wont say more, overall I highly recommend this to horror fans, it's pretty awesome

This isn't a game
It's a nightmare

Posted: 31 October, 2014
												Let's get one thing straight: I am not a fan of horror
I'm a giant wuss, a man baby that screams at every jump scare and closes his eyes when things get too gruesome
It's a genre that is quite frankly too much for me and one I tend to avoid for the betterment of my own sanity
All the same horror fascinates me
I'm intrigued by why anyone would voluntarily choose to experience something designed to terrify them, compelled by the different ways horror can be effective, and find myself continuously drawn to horror games especially it's the most difficult to do well and as a result the most interesting and impressive when it's done right
Outlast might not be the absolute pinnacle of interactive horror, but it's certainly close and an impressive bar for other developers to shoot for
It knows how to not only startle you, but to petrify you in fear from the force of the terrors within it
It's vile and grotesque beyond question, perhaps the most disturbing game I've ever witnessed that is still making me cringe as I recall some of its most horrific moments
It does all this however in a way that's oddly, even scarily compelling, almost as if some dark part of you wants to see how far the developers are willing to take it or if there is ever any light at the end of a perpetually dark tunnel
Outlast achieves much of this through an incredibly dense and oppressive atmosphere, and a deep understanding of its own mechanics
Your helpless in Outlast, forced to sneak and hide from enemies that can often see and hear you much better than you can them, but the game never becomes frustrating or tedious do to an almost constant supply of hiding places, or the ability to outrun your pursuers should you be spotted
This doesn't mean it's an easy game, or one you can casually run through without worrying over enemies, but it places you into situations you can't handle and never feels punishing the way too many horror games have a tendency to when they rely so heavily on trial and error
This is thanks in part also to how well Outlast cements you into its world
There's never a moment where you feel like anything more than a helpless journalist with a camera, and this vulnerability and immersion is one of the most important factors in why this is such a terrifying game
Every stumble, heavy breathe, cut and bruise, and nervous peek of your character is presented in a way that makes you really feel as if you're inhabiting your character
He might be a blank slate in every other respect, but when you step into his shoes the real world seems to melt away as you traverse an almost literal hell on earth
Everything in Outlast becomes secondary to scaring the living daylights out of you almost the second you grab your camera and step out of your car unprepared for what awaits you inside Mount Massive Asylum, and it's because it's so effective at this goal that it's easier to forgive some of its less polished aspects
A general lack of direction and inability to recall your objectives means it's easy to get lost running in circles, even more so with the nearly impenetrable darkness around you that often hides doors and pathways, and without any map to speak of even just retracing your own steps to try and rule out where you haven't been becomes a challenge that at times removed me from the experience as I was forced to resort to a guide just to progress
The narrative as well, for as interesting is it is when you can see it cohesively laid out on paper, is told in such a way as to be all to often jumbled and convoluted past the point of anything intelligible if you aren't paying incredibly close attention to every line of dialogue and document picked up
Even then, it switches gears often enough as to seem almost intentionally written in such a way as to keep you constantly in the dark, guessing at the few threads that are thrown at you what it all might mean
There's a reluctance to commit traced throughout the entirety of Outlast, as if it's concerned about spending too much time on one character of story moment lest you begin to assume it's the main focus of the game
The end result is something that's consistently intriguing but rarely satisfying
The most disappointing part of the experience though is the final chapter, which jumps the shark not only in terms of narrative, but also its setting which loses almost all of the terror of the areas that preceded it and closes the game out on a rather odd note
I didn't dislike it because of the ending, so much as I did what it did to the game as a whole, which up until that point had been nothing but consistently excellent
But it should be taken as rather large praise that despite Outlast's very present issues, they rarely become more than a minor disappointment or anything you have time to think about with how intense and stressful just surviving in this asylum is
Developer Red Barrel doesn't know how to craft a narrative or direct the player particularly well, but they understand acutely how to do first person survival horror to a degree that deserves commendation
If you have any interest in horror of the most unsettling and macabre nature, Outlast deserves your time
As someone that appreciates horror for what it is more than what it does to me, Outlast succeeded in ways that truly surprised me, and now has me hesitantly interested in discovering more of the genre I've tried so hard to stay away from

												Amazing game!!! i would say the game is worth around 10-15€The gameplay and the atmosphere, graphics, soundtrack everything were astounding
There is a lot to this game when it comes to artistic meeting, it says quite a a few things without saying anything at all, leaving everything up to visual story telling and making connections,  it's a dark, twisted, wierd and wonderfull bit of indie game art and storytelling

An amazing game that builds on what made LIMBO greatSummary at the end - for the easily persuadedOverall Impression:INSIDE is another great game from Playdead[playdead
com]
While it has no direct connection to LIMBO except that it comes from the same studio, you immediately get the sense that this game is based on LIMBO
The fluidity of your character´s movement, the subte yet beautiful background and the sounds that match the action perfectly - all these staples of LIMBO are artistically reinvigorated in INSIDE
Without spoiling anything, INSIDE has a creepy atmosphere that is complemented by simplistic, yet stunning visuals and sounds that give an eerie feeling
Storywise, it leaves almost everything up to interpretation, which I percieve to be a good thing because it doesn´t spoon feed you
There is no notable dialogue
No tutorial
No help
You´re thrown into the game without even so much as a main menu
And that´s great because it´s unique
However, this game does have some cons, as any indie game does (otherwise it would be mainstream)
It is fairly short - at a relaxed pace, I played it through in four hours
For the price of €11
99 (-40% on sale), thats more money per hour than most other games
Especially when we consider that there is a lack of replayability in this game - once you´ve played it you know the solutions to the puzzles and can (maybe) come back to it a few months, if not years, later
But if, like me, you don´t measure games by cost per hour but rather by entertainment value, you´ll be impressed
That said, I do recommend getting INSIDE on sale rather than full price, or waiting for the price to drop over time, because €20 is pretty steep
Another negative is the ending
MINOR SPOILER AHEAD In my opinion, the ending is pretty unsatisfying and leaves a lot of questions unanswered
It leaves much up to imagination, which could be considered a good thing as I said before, but in the case of the ending it lacks clarity
Pros:Simplistic yet stunning visualsFiiting, creepy soundsAtmosphere of uncertainty that inspires player´s imaginationAppeals wonderfully to LIMBO fansYou aren´t spoon-fedCons:High price per hour (if purchased at €20 and not on sale)Lack of replayabilityEnding - see minor spoiler aboveSummaryINSIDE is an indie game with beauty and is artistically executed
While it lacks replay incentification or price value (at the current €20), it doesn´t spoon-feed you and instead inspires your imagination
If you liked LIMBO, you´ll love this
Final verdict: 8
5/10 - Buy on sale or after price drops

4/10* First of all, I strongly recommend INSIDE for people who would like to experience a very atmospheric and meaningful designed game
INSIDE is all about paying attention to all kind of details and events that you will encounter during the journey in the game
- The sound effects and well designed graphics perfectly fit the general dark atmosphere of INSIDE
- There are no instructions, no explanations, no story telling, no dialogues and absolutly lots of meanings in this game
It's not just about puzzles and getting yourself to the next step, if you pay attention to whatever happens around you; the sounds, voices, movements, light affects and the ideas, you will actually know that INSIDE has a very deep meanings
* I enjoyed INSIDE although it's a short game that took me nearly 5 hours to 100% finish the game along with its achivements, taking into concediration that I normally had to repeat some parts where I died few times before solving the puzzle and moving on
* For me I got INSIDE on the Summer Sale 2017, and I recommend buying the game on sale
PLEASE NOTE: The coming parts, along with my screenshots includes spoilers !! SPOILER ALLERT	 After completing the game, you might start wondering about what does all of this mess means
Well it differs from one player to another but for me I think that INSIDE is all about mind manipulating and enslaving poor and weak people
That can go as a general idea, but for the idea that is a little bit more obvious, the main character of INSIDE is this little boy who came from the poor or similarly, the low class of people
somehow this little boy managed to escape and not being captured by the scouters who appears at the beginning of the game
these scouters work for a huge orgnization that targets the low class people of the society as they are considered as worthless creatures regardless their role in the society, capturing them and using them as lab rats under the supervision of the company's or orgnization's scientists
Performing new tests and experiments directly on these enslaved people which will lead into so many mutations and transformations
One experiment after another (The Company) have reached to a point in where they can control the minds of the enslaved ones which will result in controlling their actions
This is the new trade that gains the capitalists huge profits by offering this mind control to the high class people of the world so they can use the enslaved mind controlled people as machines at their service
	 Back to the little boy, as I mentioned he managed to escape from being captured by the scouters, and then he tries to find his way out of all of this
But, on the way his concepts changed as he experienced the role of the mind controller
Now, he aims to free out all of the other people who have been captured and been put and used in the experiements of The Company
During this journey some concepts can be noticed as they describe the little boy's thoughts changing such as: the little tiny chicks at the beginning of the game, if you pay attention, after blowing them towards the box none of them dies yet one of them starts to walk slower than others and apperantly seems weaker
The mind whipped bodies that the little boy controls using the mind controling helmet are another example; in the part of the game where you need to gather 19 of them to open the huge metal door, you can realize that the last one of them is a dead body
And the other group of the mind whipped or controlled people who provides help in the elevator, you can actually realize that this group includes individuals that lost an arm, a leg or even a head
All of these details are pointing to one direction: the change of heart and mind of the little boy
 How? the little boy now knows that working in a group and for the benefit of the majority, a sacrifice is a must
The little chick, the dead one and the lost organs ! as he reaches the big dome that he knows later on that it is actually a big tank, he manages to dive in and be close to a big, sticky, organic blob that is made of organs and people, body parts, legs, arms and even heads ! all in one big strange manipulated formation ! these are the people of his class in this society, could be his friends, or even family ! so he now believes that he must sacrifice him self for the benefit of the majority as he tries to unplug the mind controlling healmets he gets sucked into the blob and then try to lead it to its freedom and its way out of this place
The blob causes chaeos and huge losses inside The Company while on its way out and finally rests on a shore with some sun light away from The Company


The little boy managed to save the currently captured people, but who knows what rich and powerful people can do again !	At the end thats my opinion, and as I said other people may have different thoughts about all of this
The game is amazing and worth buying it

Posted: 6 March
Disturbed
Speechless
Wholeheartedly in awe
That's how I'm feeling after full playtrough
It was few years back, when I began depressing journey with Limbo
Back then it was for me much more discouraging because of the puzzles, that my brain just couldn't handle; but I was in Love with the tone, visualisation, and playing it - until I reached the end - and to this day, Limbo is game that I will, with pleasure, recommend till the end of time
After five long years Playdead[playdead
com] came up with their second tittle - INSIDE
Let me tell you right away - waiting this long was worth it!INSIDE is showcase what someones devotion to games, great artistic vision, trust in player base and brilliant mind can come up with, in this crowded gaming world
From start it wasn't for me possible to look at this game, and be bored, or be disinterested; because with every frame comes new thing to discover
I was trying to keep away from spoilers, as much as I could
I succeeded
You playing as little kid; running from people, beasts; timing your jumps so you wouldn't end as splatter in dark alley, and being careful while swimming in the dark; trying to grasp control over you life, and life of others
You run forward where mystery of this world is hiding, and along the way figure out your purpose in this dark and twisted story
What is happening here is disturbing, weird, confusing, and if the ending won't leave you with sense of "What the F*, just happened!", I seriously don't know what will
This story works perfectly, and when credits starts to roll, that is the point where your interest will spike even higher, cause you want to know more 


also there is alternative ending, which digs even deeper
Story (despite how much I enjoyed it) is sidetracked by astonishing visuals and overall aesthetics
INSIDE looks spectacular
Foreground and background seamlessly coming together at the center where the action lies
Work with lighting and shadow in just incredible, and the level of detail that is made because of this, is just top level
Everything on screen is set as indented, just to give us this eerie feeling, sense of hopelessness and misfortune behind every corner
When you add to this mix great ambience sound, with on point sound design - result should leave you entirely at awe
Controls are smooth, and on point
I didn't experience any issues whatsoever while playing with controller
My biggest fear were puzzles
After Limbo, I was really cautious
Why? Let's just say, there were moments I rage quit a lot
Not with INSIDE
Yes, I admit, there were few instances of me getting annoyed and discouraged, but if it was up to five times I'm already exaggerating
So on this front, I was satisfied with myself that I could get thru, with only smallest possible help of guides (just a couple - I swear to God, I don't believe in)
Also it was so satisfying for me, to pat my own back for job well done, when I figured something out (yes, I'm one of those people - dumb)
I won't shy away from statement, that INSIDE could easily be pinnacle of gaming in my personal experience
This is art that should be celebrated by playing it, and afterwards recommended it to others, so they can too experience this game
I agree; story might not suit everyone (ending is probably even worse in this manner), but from technical stand point and playability this comes to very top
Thank you Playdead for this game, and whoever you are reading this, and still didn't play INSIDE just do it!Grade: A+

												Inside is a really great game and I don't really want to give anything away with a review, so I will just summarize;-The graphics and sound are just stunningly well done-The gameplay is smooth, fun and controls great-It builds an excellent atmosphere with uniquely eery storytelling-Has puzzles and mechanics that are clever while not becoming tiresomeThere are some totally unique things about this game that you will want to have experienced yourself, It's really something amazing
I highly recommend
Easily one of my favorite gaming experiences of all time
Great job developers

												I see people complaining how short this game is
Personally, I'd rather play 3-5 hours of perfection than 50+ of repetitive, unoriginal crap
The atmosphere and design are like nothing I've ever seen in a platform styled game
To be honest, you're doing INSIDE a disservice by considering it a platformer
The puzzles are challenging, yet not frustrating, and the ending leaves you with chills
TIP: (minor spoiler) Make sure you collect all of the orbs for the secret ending
This game is a genuine masterpiece

Well, its obvious where the Limbo developer's have been putting in their time
INSIDE is brimming with atmosphere, feelings, and attention to detail
I mean it doesn't take more than 10 minute to see how meticulously hand-crafted and polished this title is
The only question in my mind, really, is if its worth the debatably steep asking price
For me? Oh sure, you bet
You aren't going to get 20 hours (likely closer to 3-5), but damn, you will get an experience
While I enjoyed Limbo, I thought INSIDE was overall much better
Essentially, this is a walking/experience simulator with medium-level puzzles
And I don't mean 'walking simulator' in a derogatory way - its great fun
I should note that this game is rather dark, triggering some moderate level anxiety at moments
Definately scary at times, too
Pros:+Definately some of the most attention-to-details I've seen in a game
What points it loses for overall length, it definately gains in being one of the highest of quality experiences
+Sounds and music are outstanding
+The feelings are real, with this one
You will definatley go through a range of emotions
+'Storyline' is quite original, albeit abstract
Don't expect to walk away understanding everything
+Thankfully, the puzzles aren't super difficult
This is more focused on the experience, which I appreciated
+The scope of the rooms and areas were just magnificient
+Controller support is great
Cons:-Definately expensive, although they arguably earned their money
The devil is in the details
Those animations are obviously all custom
-Some moments verged on being too anxiety ridden/scary for me
Thankfully I pushed through and it worked out well, though
-While there was a range of environments, I would have liked to see less 'Portal factory' and more perhaps outside
Its fine, and I'm being slightly picky, but there it is
For any indie game enthusiast, this is a must have
Now with that being said, I'm sure if you wait, it will be on a half-price sale sooner than later
Either way, make sure you play through this game some time in 2016

												I've found that as I get older, it gets harder and harder to actually be good at games
I guess as I age, I lose the quick reflexes that allowed me to triumph in so many games in my youth
But this game, this game with the incentive of shooting off a girl's clothing



this game has brought back my competitive edge
I find myself totally focused, totally in the zone, using every ounce of my attention span and relexes to beat each level at 100% so that I can witness each girl bereft of clothing
But what's more, by incentivising my play with the prospect of seeing anime girls naked, I've noticed that my reflexes and hand-eye coodination have evolved
My lizard brain, in an effort to obtain sexual gratification, has heightened my abilities to near god-like perfection
I see everything
I'm one with the game
My brain knows what to do before it even happens
I never knew the desire to see naked anime girls could push me so far
I'm a better, stronger man for it
Thank you, game
Thank you for making me better

Offers an alternative mode
The soundtracks are indeed fitting into situations that players are confronting with at the spot
ConSome achievments requires you to grind a lot
The character's audio speaking is somehow irritating

												"But I watched the anime, I don't need to play this, right?"Let-Let me stop you right there
The anime is trash*, plain and simple, but this


this is another matter entirely
Danganronpa answers the age old question of "What happens if you let a mechanical bear with a despair fetish capture a bunch of highschool students with extreme proficiency in one field and force them to kill each other?"The answer, of course, is one of the most incredible visual novel experiences I've ever had
Danganronpa takes everything up to 11, shows you what it would look like if you went to 12, and then skips straight to 15
Everything about it is enthralling and horrifying all at once
I lost a lot of sleep thinking about this game
Do yourself a favor and just sit down and play it straight through
Don't read anything else about it
Don't risk ruining the experience for yourself, because hot damn is it an experience
Everything after like the first 30 minutes is a game changing spoiler
I can come up with about 11037 more reasons why this game is great, but I'll spare you my ramblings
Just


just play it
*This is called comedic hyperbole
Please read my edits
EDIT 1: In response to some of the comments on this review, let me expand my discussion on the anime a bit
The anime is a direct adaption of only the most essential elements of the plot of the original PSP game
The result is next to nothing as far as character development, and the suspense and thrill of solving the crimes is completely eliminated by the investigation/courtroom montages that sort of just


exposit, with little of interest otherwise
I have absolutely nothing against the adaption as its own work or even against anime in general
It's just that when compared to the extremely detailed characterization every single character gets in the game and the satisfaction of actually having to solve all the crimes yourself, the anime falls flat
In short, the anime is definitely not a substitute for actually playing the game
I hope this helps!EDIT 2: Well


yes, if you've watched the anime you'll have the plot spoiled for you
However, like I said, you still only know the gist of how each crime happened
You still have to actually do all the legwork to prove it, which is still a lot of fun in and of itself
At least I think so
Plus, there character events and bonus scenes that can't be seen by just watching the anime
So if you have any attatchment to the characters, then yes, I do think there is value in playing the game
If you just wanted the plot, well


you got it

Once you get spoiled there's no going back

												SPOILER FREE REVIEW -- [I have beaten this on Vita]Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a deceptive, mystery-driven variety adventure title with visual novel, horror and romance elements
Sounds like a mouthful? But this game manages to split these elements proportionally to make them enjoyable and add fuel to the evolving, amazing, storyline that will haunt you for years to come
Originally a PSP title, with multiple ports for years to come, the PC version is more akin to a straight-up port than a HD remake
Which is fine, and understandable, because it isn't the games' aesthetics which make it one of the best adventure games I've ever played; but its story, characters and setting
Again, spoiler-free, but you play as Makoto Naegi, an average high school boy finding himself trapped in a mysterious building one day with other students; aptly nicknamed given their personality and fashion
Not long in, there's been a murder and you are put in charge with finding out who murdered said person, by learning about the other characters, finding clues and going into a trial with them ala Ace Attorney
Speaking of - I feel Danganronpa is a strong franchise which can be compared to the Ace Attorney series as there are identical gameplay elements and quirky design choices
Moving on though, general gameplay consists of room-to-room movement, talking to characters in visual novel-esque, with their beautifully drawn portraits to keep you distracted from the text
During the trials, there are well-placed, reasonable and sensical QTEs that tie-in with how both the story and gameplay present themselves up until that point
Your quick fingers, your own intuition and feelings for the characters will make you feel confident, or weasel out of wanting to press those button propmpts
Anyway, for me personally, one of the best portions of the game is its atmosphere: its forboding, compelling, repressive and tense building was mostly on my part because of the direction the game goes
It


isn't your typical raincoat detective story, there's nicely used humour, a strange but loveable villain which is introduced early, whacky, bizarre, creative yet at the same time, reverse-stereotypical characters
But what did it for me


was the way the game progresses, what happens when each new day passes


what your consequence is for not finding the murderer quick enough
All the dread, mystery and tension is added as layers of fear, heh
At one point, I felt legitamately frightened to continue, but I did anyway knowing what would happen next was going to blow my mind
I can't say enough good things about this game, BUY IT
BUY IT NOW
It will be one of the best adventure games you'll play, there is something for everybody in this game, big and small
This game is a masterpiece

												On the surface, this game is just a big bunch of stereotypes put together
However, this turns out to be one of its biggest strengths
The game strikes a good balance between rolling with the tropes and subverting them, constantly leading you into an 'obvious' conclusion and then pulling the rug from underneath you
Then, as soon as you start accounting for this, the game once again switches gears to keep you guessing
I encountered quite a few unexpected plot twists during my first playthrough of the PSP fan translation a few years back, which was a pleasant surprise given the predictable nature of most video game stories
While the story is still pretty fun even if you do know what's going to happen, if you are currently unspoiled, I suggest you try and keep it that way
Stay away from forums, don't look online for fan art and for God's sake do not listen to the soundtrack until you finish the game (I managed to spoil myself by reading the tracklist during my first playthrough)
In terms of replayability, I consider the game to be worth at least two playthroughs: there is a lot of clever foreshadowing that you will simply not get on your first playthrough hidden throughout the game and focussing your gift-giving and free time activities on different characters will reward you with additional backstory for them
As such, I'd say the current asking price is very fair, even for a six-year old port
Aside from buying the game based on its merits, if you are at all interested in seeing similar games get ported from Sony's ill-fated handhelds to Steam, buying Dangan Ronpa is a good signal to companies like Spike Chunsoft that there is, in fact, a market for them
It's unfortunate for Sony, but thanks to Spike Chunsoft, I won't have to consider buying a Vita (TV) anymore to play the second installment of this series and I sincerly hope that other hidden gems will eventually make their way to Steam as well

												Think of Ace Attorney, but full of fast paced and action oriented arguments
As a person that finished it on the PSP (through unconventional methods) I am very satisfied that it's on steam so I don't have to feel guilty!Also it's another game that is full of spoilers, so Googling is very, very risky
Wanna search up your favorite character but without spoilers? Good luck

												There are a fair number of horror games out there
Many of them, to be candid, are fairly bad if not downright awful
The issue being that a lot of the time games in this genre seem to want to follow a set list
There is somewhat a rigid rulebook on how horror games are meant to be, but these rules aren’t supposed to be one hundred percent abided by
Developers can and should, for the most part, make up the rules and experiment as much as they want
At the end of the day I find that it’s the somewhat unique games that capture people’s attention
Now I’m not saying Detention is unique, I mean let’s face it what is unique nowadays? However it does like to throw in its own little rulebook
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The summary of the plot is; you start off the game as a male student named Wei who falls asleep in class
Hours later he wakes up alone in a dark and obviously quite spooky school
After sometime  exploring he comes across a girl sitting asleep on the school stage
He wakes her up and things start really kicking off
A lot of weird stuff starts happening around the school and creatures called Lingered start appearing
These seem to be undead students and teachers and are the first enemies you come across
They’re slow creatures which, like the rest of the enemies in the game, seem to have a hunger for anything that breathes
Luckily there’s a useful mechanic that can help with that
By clicking the right mouse button, or whichever button it’s been mapped to, Wei or Ray will hold their breath
This allows for you to scamper on past the Lingered without them attacking, however you will have to catch your breath if you hold for too long
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Detention plays out as a point and click horror game where you will need to solve puzzles in order to progress
Some of the puzzles can be fairly straight forward, for example using an umbrella to fetch a key from a ventilation shaft
But others require a bit of thought to them
One example was where I had to look at three clock faces
Two had hands and the one in the middle didn’t
There was then three pictures, each with a bloody symbol on them
These symbols represented the clock hands and once I’d adjusted the clocks to the correct times the door that was previously locked opened
Some puzzles do require certain items to complete them
These items aren’t too difficult to come across, you just need to be a little bit observant
The puzzles themselves don’t feel too tedious or pointless
There’s always a valid reason to complete them and most of the time it’s to move the story forward
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Graphics wise I’d say detention has an unusual but very well done art style
It’s clear the artist took a lot of time to add in as much detail as possible to give the game a sense of reality
Each area is well drawn, with clear distinctions from the odd dark world, with it’s grainy overly, to the creepy school at night
The characters and enemies are defined too
With Wei and Ray wearing very white school uniforms and the enemies seemingly very dark and shadowy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In conclusion I think Detention is horror game that tries to break the mould of the genres standards
But does it? Yes and no
There are a few things that really shine for me in Detention
The story is pretty complex but welcome, as I know of many horror games that have little to no story at all
Also I like the various stealth mechanics that are introduced for the number of enemies you have to face
It does throw in the odd jumpscare here and there, but I mean what horror games doesn’t
It’s got puzzles of varying difficulties and an eerie soundtrack that fits the game’s quite chilling atmosphere
All in all if you love horror games and want something a little different than the norm then I’d suggest giving Detention a go
And even if you don’t want it for the horror aspect, it’s full of puzzles to test your wits too
Good Day!

												Holy heck this is a good one
Good enough for me to post a review even!From start to end, I was left in awe
The characters are interesting, the story is told beautifully, the art is unique (in a good way), and the music/sounds were done masterfully
The only real complaints I had were that a majority of the signs posted throughout the world weren't translated (however, ALL notes and signs essential to the story are translated)
It doesn't rely on jump-scares but pure atmospheric horror (granted there is like maybe two jump-scares but they're done so well I can't even be mad)
What I also adored about this game is it's "puzzles
" They weren't complicated but they were done in such a way that makes this game unique
I highly recommend this game

												Disclaimer: I am a supporter since this game's beta phase but only playtested its Traditional Chinese version
I bought the game from Steam again and tried it out in English setting so as to write this review in English
I think Detention nailed it with interweaving its background setting and the foreground story that's being played out
In a seemingly simple and short (2-hour play time) 2D horror format, it presents a whole lot unique Taiwanese cultural elements to the player, while unraveling what's this not-so-horror horror story is about
Writing is really good, and fortunately the English translation is also good enough
There are soooo many things in game you just can't find a direct translation into English or other languages, but they somehow pulled it through, which is pretty impressive
What's really a shame to me IMHO is that there are also many detailed environmental clues in the visuals that just couldn't be totally translated
These won't hinder your understanding to the plot itself, or to feel the emotions that the game wants you to feel, but surely there's going to be something missing if you don't read Traditional Chinese
Gameplay wise, the game does have some survival elements in the former half of the game, and puzzles throughout the game, but difficulty should not be a problem
If you are into short narrative games that give you a movie-like experience this is definitely for you too
Visually the game may not be "stunning" in a high production value sense, but all the props and closeup interaction views are all designed meticulously
I would praise the team that they put their resources into where it mattered the most and it paid off well
Audio on the other hand, is sooooo good
I doubt you can find other 2D narrative games that really rivals with Detention's audio design and music composing
Finally, my friendly warning would be don't come to the game to expect truly gory or extremely scary stuff -- if you watched the game's release trailer just once I don't think you can somehow miss the point
But of course I won't go into what the story really is about, but prepare your tissue ready
It's probably one of the few horror games that's going to make you cry of sorrow but not horror
Definitely recommended

												Detention follows a unique arc in horror that not many other titles manage to trace
It starts in a perfectly grounded place, with familiar characters and real-world concerns
From there it spirals off into a fantastic journey of bizarre horrors and vivid, dreamlike imagery
At the tail end of this, it comes right back to a grounded conclusion somehow enhanced by the weirdness endured on the way there
It’s a deeply-affecting game because of this, one that wields its symbolism and purpose with a confident hand
The game opens in the shoes of Wei, a high school student in 1960s Taiwan
After falling asleep in class he awakens to find himself trapped in the school during a typhoon, his only companion being an upper-classman named Ray
Mysterious events are set in motion that put them in peril, including the road into town washing away and a strange presence stalking the halls
As the story turns darker their relevance to the lives of these two students is laid bare, along with the reason for their isolation and the effect it has on their lives
There are some VERY heavy overtones here, ones that resonate powerfully in the real world
Citizens of Taiwan in the 1960s lived under martial law, a brutal regime that allowed only limted speech and political ideology
Anyone who resisted was not long for this world, a threat that extended even to students
A cornerstone of Detention’s horror is set in this terrifying reality, where instructors and authorities are constantly watching for dissident thought to excise
Simply reading the wrong book could mean vanishing into the night with a bag over your head, and to me there are few ideas in horror more horrifying than that
Detention brings this world to the player as a stark reality, where students and teachers alike are fearful and suspicious of each other with threat of death hanging over them all
It takes a terrible toll on them, and the psychological damage is a major focus of this title
It’s expressed through a great deal of striking imagery, much of it steeped in Chinese folklore
You’ll encounter religion in the shrines and talismans set about, mythology in the strange creatures you encounter and how you escape them, and culture in solving puzzles containing unique concepts like spirit money
For those of us unfamiliar with the culture it provides a unique sort of immersion, since we can’t be sure how some of the more esoteric elements fit with reality
I wish I could explain the story more directly but it would be a crime to spoil any part of it, considering how gripping it is
The tale is told through a lot of shifting environments akin to Silent Hill, where familiar locations like classrooms and auditoriums become bastions of symbolic horrors
The further into the game you get the less grounded in reality these places become, yet this happens because they symbolize events in the real world more closely
You’ll learn plenty about one character’s broken home from a network of nightmare rooms filled with ghosts and needles and connected by a cursed radio
The intensity of the experience builds as you creep closer to the truth, and the closing revelations hit hard enough on a purely human level to make a major payoff
The gameplay that gets you there is some basic pointing and clicking from a purely side-scrolling perspective
Items and points of interest are highlighted with a question mark when you draw near, so wandering the full extent of a room is sure to reveal everything of note
Puzzles here are plenty unique owing to the cultural influence, but are never confusing and have logical solutions
There’s not much challenge to the game aside from learning how the enemies work, since there’s a very different way of dealing with them than what you’re used to
There’s a curve to it but dying helpfully sends you to a special place with a strange NPC who advises you on what you did wrong
Topping this package off with vivid, finely-animated graphics and some wonderfully horrifying sound design makes it a near-perfect entry in the genre
The only complaint I can level against it is a common one for quality titles, that being a lack of content to enjoy
Detention shouldn’t take you much more than two hours to complete, with no branching paths and only two endings which depend on answers given in the final area
There’s also an issue of consistency, as the game is split into four parts but the content of each varies pretty wildly in terms of threats and tone
This isn’t really a complaint but more of a warning that if you like something about an early part, it may not return later
Detention did almost everything I could ask of a psychological horror game
It gave me interesting characters, it gave them depth, it threatened them with a horrifying concept, and it explored all aspects of that horror
If it were longer it might be my new pinnacle of the genre, but for what it is it’s still an impressive piece with the power to rattle anyone
The strange and intense symbolism gives way to fears that anyone, anywhere could have, reflected through events that really took place in the past
It’s a brilliant, terrifying, heartbreaking game that succeeds at everything it sets out to do, and deserves major recognition for it

												This is one of the best narrative experiences I've ever seen in a video game, and possibly in any medium
It seems like a standard point-and-click horror game, but behind its gameplay lies a brilliantly subtle twisted form of storytelling comparable to Silent Hill 2
It's fairly short and isn't groundbreaking, but the hours I spent playing this game were absolutely unforgettable
If you like when horror doesn't spook or startle you, but slowly digs at your emotions and leaves you with nothing left to say, I cannot recommend this game enough

												TLDR: If you look only for an horror game, look elsewhere, if you are in for an experience and like to reflect on things, this gem is for you
First of all, there are a couple of things that have to be said:1
-The game is labeled and marketed as an horror game, but this is only done on the first part of the game, if horror is all that you're looking for, it migh dissapoint you, if you're interested in other generes you genuilly have to go  for it
2
-This is sort of point and click combined to a side scroller to some degree, you can't play it with a controller, and don't need a keyboard, the game is played entirely with the mouse
Now that that has been cleared, this is genuinely a gem of a game, it goes from horror, to traumatic, to surreal, to introspective, to reflective, but to really get the grasp of what the game has to offer is best if you actually reflect on everything that you read and see, and try to get the meaning of everything that you see, even on what's on the background, literally everything  has a meaning, yes, you can still just rush through the game, but you'll loose on the experience
You might notice that all the reviews a have short play time, that's because the game is relatively short, it took me 3
4 hours and I took my time, but still is long enough to give you an experience and not become tedious, and actually gives you a sense of closure at the end

												I picked this game up without any prior knowledge of it
The visuals looked interested, like a cross of old Silent Hill games and The Cat Lady, also it was cheap so I bought it
I have to say it didn't turn out to be what I expected, but I still liked the game
Looking at the screenshots, you'd be under the impression that the game is a point and click horror game about some kids stuck in a haunted school, but that's just the first quarter of the game
The later chapters dwell much more deeper than such a simplistic plot
I want to say more about the game but I'm afraid I'll be giving out spoilers and I really request you to experience the story first hand
It might be a little convoluting to get so pay attention to every little detail in the game
Regarding the game's length, I clocked in 4
4 hours and I believe I experienced the game in it's entierity
I wouldn't call it short though, any longer would have made the story feel stretched out
Overall, a great game
I wish there were more games like these which dealt in old asian folklore and history

												Overall better cast than the first game
But it has a few problems that DR1 didn't have, which to me was what made the game fun in the first place
DR1 spoilers:  All of them seem capable of killing which I couldn't say about the first game where it was obvious that weedman, the giant and donut girl wasn't a threat to you
DR2 spoilers:   However unlike the first game where Kirigiri, Byakuya and other characters were arguing during the trial and bringing up interesting points
DR2 has a lack of persuasive characters
There's effectively just Nagito (who argues in your favor half the time anyway) and Chiaki
The other characters never challenges you in a convincing way

												(No spoilers)Let me preface this review by saying that you shouldn't play Danganronpa 2 without playing the first game
Danganronpa is a mystery series, so you'd want to play the games in release order for maximum effect
That said, DR1 and DR2 pair together very nicely so you should try to get both of them if you can afford it
Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is an excellent followup to DR1 that excels the original in almost every respect
Memorable characters, a soundtrack worth shelling money for, a unique/bizarre gameworld and story, and to top it all off, the PC port is pretty great
I can't think of any reason *not* to recommend DR2 if you even remotely enjoyed the first game

												Thank god for developers like Frictional Games, that are willing to take the risk and time to explore more complex themes and ideas
SOMA isn't perfect, but once the screen fades to black for the last time it makes up for any deficit
It sets an impossible standard for most indie developers
This was not the game I was expecting
If, like me, you have only glimpsed some early build trailers, then the design has clearly changed
Placed underwater, amongst the remains of humanity, you must come to grips with almost a century of change, and ultimately redefine the term human
Talking robots, mechanized humans and corrupted marine life all play their role in convincing you that something has gone horribly wrong
Frictional maintain a number of elements from their previous outings, including physics based puzzles
Almost any object can be grabbed, dropped and thrown; levers can be pulled; wheels can be twisted; doors pulled or pushed open
The concept lends a welcome tactile nature to the story which, sadly, falls back on a familiar trope: your all alone, EXCEPT for a voice to guide you
While you identify the owner of the voice, and ultimately take on their objective as your own, it still feels like a commitment to revealing the story through environment and atmosphere would have strengthened the isolation, making searching out information a puzzle in itself
The look and setting of SOMA will bring obvious comparisons to Bioshock, but it's tenuous link at best
Skulking through the confined, industrialized corridors of Pathos II feels far removed from the Art Deco inspired, living spaces afforded to Rapture
No guns and plasmids, only exploring and hiding
Worth a special mention is the sound design, music and voice acting
Certain games lend themselves to headphones more than others, and you would be doing a disservice not to use them in this case
The effect is universally excellent in creating a sense of place, whether the groan of stressed metal or the muted, calm of the seafloor
Previous Frictional releases have relied on enemies to provide constant tension and scares, leaving you cowering in darkened corners
SOMA's mechanized enemies don't appear as frequently, and tend to be solo when they do, but I personally found them to be frustrating
My main issue was their completely random nature
In one example I was left with the enemy blocking my only way forward, unresponsive to sound or light, and refusing to budge until I ran at it, died and restarted past that point
While they are fitting to the story and environment, I couldn't help but feel they may not have been necessary, and instead the developer felt pressured to include them
There are some other issues, I experienced, that may or may not concern others
Loading times are looooong (up there with The Witcher 3), with intermittent loading occuring at strange intervals
Pacing is slower in the first half than the more compelling second
Objectives are not marked which leads to wandering and backtracking trying to find items and puzzles to solve
The best test of the success of an idea is how it stays with you afterward
Like Life Is Strange, SOMA has remained with me since finishing, debating the choices I made and trying to reconcile the events into chronological order
It's Frictional's best story yet, offering a rich message that never takes away from the terror of playing
In fact, that message questioning what it means to be human, is SOMA's most terrifying element
The game isn't perfect, none are, but if an amazing story, wrapped in an absorbing atmosphere and sprinkled with puzzles is your thing, then it's an easy choice

												Like a lot of players, I wanted to put my claws on SOMA for quite some time now
Yesterday I launched the game and finished it in one session
It took me ___exactly 10___ hours to finish it
A night has passed and I think I can share my thoughts now:GOOD ASPECTSWhen you look back to Penumbra and Amnesia games, SOMA offers an enormous evolution visually speaking
The underwater world is very nicely done, whether it's in the ocean or in the facilities
A labyrinth area reminded me of a map near the end of Penumbra BP
The story is all about sci-fi and psychological themes about life, death and continuity
It takes its importance within the game and I must say I enjoyed it more than I expected to
The monsters you'll have the pleasure to meet have different behaviors and attacks, which is better than just the classic "I patrol, I see/hear you, I search you, I run at you"
Nice designs
Ambiance in the levels is often close to some areas in Doom 3, Bioshock and even Dead Space, level design speaking
A nice thing
The voices! Voiiiices!! Very nice addition!Sound effects are well processed, you can feel the hard work here
Choices & actions can be hard to make at different times!If you suffer from claustrophobia, the more you progress in the game, the deeper you'll get in the ocean and it's a great feeling! Is it?Modding tools included!The ending!!NOT-SO-GOOD ASPECTSTextures are sometimes very low: is it a bug or not? Will it be corrected? We'll see, after all, game just came out
Optimization problems: SOMA worked without ANY problem for me but I see that some people have poor FPS problems on decent configurations, so this will be improved and patched soon of course
Puzzles a bit simple
No classic inventory
This will annoy some players for sure, personally it did not
Monsters are easy to avoid/escape if you're accustomed to Penumbra/Amnesia games
Game is too easy


well it's focused on story


so I guess it's ok?Less horror


but it has its stressful moments
The ending!!To conclude, you don't need to be a fan of previous Frictional Games works to play SOMA
This game is an ambitious turn for its creators and I believe it is a successful one, good job!Visually, it's lovely
The SOMA universe & story are pretty fine
If you are a fan of Bioshock and other games I named earlier here, you should give it a try, you'll like the ambience
Mandatory recommendation to the lovers of the genre!

												Soma was a truly incredible experience for me
From start to finish it kept my attention, and constantly made me think
Think about the story, about the characters, the situation, and most importantly, about what it means to be human
It’s a very appealing theme for a video game that I haven’t seen in games before (although I do realize there have been many films/books made about the topic)
Made by Frictional games, the same developers of Amnesia the Dark Descent, I had high expectations for pretty much everything
They didn’t let me down
The new HPL 3 Engine looks amazing, and gave me some of the most atmospheric moments I’ve ever had in gaming
The sound design is top notch, and the voice actors are definitely worth commending
Although there aren’t many characters in the game, those that do feature, pull off incredible performances
Although the game had several scary moments, I personally found one part towards the end of the game absolutely terrifying
It’s safe to say that I really enjoyed the pacing of the game and how everything became particularly more intense as I progressed
Probably the only criticism I can make is the length of the game, which I felt was a bit short
A lot of reviewers criticized the puzzles, but I personally enjoyed them all for the most part
Soma is definitely worth playing if you enjoy survival horror
But even if you’re new to survival horror, I’m certain you’ll find this game worthwhile

												Honestly, SOMA is one of the best games I've ever played
When playing non-multiplayer games I tend to completely immerse myself in the game world, forget my real surroundings
That's why I have never played a horror game and did not intend to ever touch one - I can't handle that stress
But then Frictional Games announced SOMA
Being a big enthusiast of the concept of Artificial Consciousness, the themes Frictional showed off two years ago got me very, very interested in the game to the point I kinda ignored it's a horror game the best I could
Now, that the game's finally released, I couldn't ignore it being a horror game anymore
What's worse: forcing myself to actually play a horror game for the first time in my life even though I don't like them; or not experiencing the game based on my favorite themes in person that I waited two years for
It took a great bit of struggle, and it was by far the most terrifying experience I've ever had, but I played SOMA from start to finish the way it was meant to be played (alone at night etc), and god I'm glad I forced myself through it
Even though I developed unreasonable expectations over the time prior to launch, they were all met
I wasn't disappointed, in fact, I was surprised at how great the experience was (apart from the horror)
I really enjoyed the atmosphere, I loved the world it's set in (there are so many awesome things about Pathos-II it's unbelievable), and, most importantly, I was amazed by the story
I still keep coming back to SOMA, keep thinking about it
I even decided to replay the first few parts recently because I love being in Pathos-II so much
In my opinion, the way SOMA ended does allow a further continuation of the story, and I really hope Frictional does something with it
I need more SOMA
TLDR: WAU that was good

												I just finished Austin Jorgenson's LISA and can say that, without a doubt, it is among the strongest indie RPGs I have ever played
I was hooked on the world of LISA with the slight taste given by the prequel, LISA: The First, which had me eagerly awaiting this title
The developer cites Mother as a key influence and that shows, but even more than the abstract game OFF, LISA has taken the wacky humor and surreal style of Mother into a dark and very adult place
Dingaling is able to take simple, old school pixels and work them into truly disturbing imagery
Lately, we have been inundated with post-apocalyptic settings that are xeroxed and re-sampled at will: zombies, plague, fallout and bad weather
All of those settings, done to death, are fairly grim, but none of them can even touch the misery suggested by LISA
Here we have a world where women are extinct and the surviving men, seeing no future for humanity, have transformed the society into a sort of prison yard where hopelessness is drowned in drugs and alcohol, and memories seem uniformly sad
The main protagonist, Brad, is driven by a past filled with abuse and grief, and literally sets himself against the will of the entire world
The player will be forced to make tough decisions in this game and to eventually think about and judge the outcome
Even as we laugh at sight gags and endless pro wrestling references, one cannot ignore the uneasy slithering quality of LISA
My greatest hope is that the game does well and Dingaling games develops more titles where the heart of the game is a great story, not the ability to snipe someone in multiplayer
Bravo!

												A tale of a broken man in a land of perverts and Joy
Crude,Rude, and lewd
Lisa stars a man who's been broken for many years, incapable of forgiven himself for the loss of his sister long ago, both beaten and abused by their father
Brad Armstrong grew up protecting his friends and teaching karate in his dojo
Envied by his friends, hated by his father and deeply traumatized by the loss of his sister Lisa Armstrong he soon resorted to painkillers to forget and wipe away his regrets
The world erased in a white flash, everything changed and everything destroyed
Mankind had its females seemingly removed from existance and the world crumbled into a inhospitable place, mutants, gangs, perverts, murderers and psychopaths rule the world now
In the middle of this is Brad who'd become addicted to Joy a new drug in this destroyed world now using it to kill his past
One day when taking a hit of Joy a baby all of a sudden appears in his arms, not only that but a female one
Brad taking this child to his friends rejects the idea of giving her up for a better living to the local gang leader Rando, Instead he sees this child, now named Buddy as a secound chance
As his daughter or maybe just a means to put his past to rest
Wether its either is up to the player since not all of the cards are on the table
The only thing known is that you will suffer and your actions will cause suffering
All in all Lisa is a strong RPG, the roster is amazing, the story is blank enough to allow speculation
The soundtrack is unique and amazing
The art style is off the walls and the whole world is a perverted joke and will have you cringing and creeped out by its warpedness
The game is a clear shoutout to Mother and Earthbound and Mad Max so old school gamers and RPG lovers with adore this game
However due to its limited side scrolling the map can be confusing at times, cliffs can easily be jumped off of to your death, bugs and glitches do occur, enemies can permanantly kill allies and the amount of status effects can be confusing
Its probably one of my most favorite games on steam right now and in existance, The story made me feel for Brad and Buddy aswell as making me feel the weight of losing an arm or a party member to one bad move or choice on my part
You will feel hurt playing this but in the end the game does what it wanted to, to make you feel
Honestly whats a good game? One that makes you feel for what its created
Wether you on purposely play as a selfesh person or a selfless one, or something in between you will feel like you made a impact in this broken and beautifull world

												Holy crap
Powerful
This game explores some serious life issues: Abuse
The pain of childhood, and of parenthood
Manhood and womanhood
Strength
Loss
This game had me near crying at several points
The story is freaking powerful
It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times
And the gameplay? It's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it
This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e
g
, sleeping can be dangerous)
Battles are challenging
Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered
I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes
The game doesn't hold your hand
There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier
You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments
Characters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences
There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision
Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it
You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose
Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done
All the options sucked
But I can't help asking myself, "Did I make the right choice?" Highly recommended

												I'm not going to extensively rate the aspects of this game, it's just--After playing for almost 10 hours, it's still not over, yet the gameplay or atmosphere don't feel stale
The world of the game is relatively big, but it feels enormous due to the amount of things you can do
I don't understand
How can a cheap RPGmaker game achieve that? How much time hard work was poured into it? It's mind-boggling
Almost every joke is placed with surgical precision into the story, providing fresh and morbid experience for the player
Art is the perfect tie-in, amplifying the tone of this game to suit the narrative
And, most of all, the gameplay feels smooth
Smooooth
Without doubt, it draws inspiration from Mother games
I'd call it "LISA: "Earthboud" for crude and rude adults
" And I like it
			
Posted: 14 January, 2015
												This might literally be the coolest game I've ever played, and possibly the best game that I've played in the last 10 years
Though, I might be the wrong person to ask though as Earthbound is my favorite game, and this game is obviously heavily Earthbound inspired
Stylistically and comedy wise anyway
The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game
The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered
I did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours
For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright
The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog
I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet
Anyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it
You won't regret it

												Lisa tells the story of Brad, a broken man, forsaken by hope, who relies on self-medication to forget his haunting past
The setting is a post-apocalyptic wasteland, where women no longer exist and porn magazines replace money
Lust has made monsters of the men that have survived
You will encounter characters that will fight relentlessly or kill themselves before your eyes
Soaked with despair, this world varies from being horrid to hilarious
Death is ever-present and you can lose your companions permanently or sacrifice parts of yourself to spare their lives
Do you deserve your arm anyway?The story begins when the protagonist Brad finds an infant girl, and is given the chance to right his wrongs and spare her the pain he suffered
Keeping her isolated, although she represents the future for a world that has none
Lisa tells an eventful, compelling story that will make you laugh, aggravate you, and quite often leave you disturbed
I enjoyed every moment of it and recommend it to everyone that shares a fascination for games that explore the cruel depths of the human mind

												If you've just gone through a bad breakup, lost a loved one, had a pet die, or are otherwise in a bad place, this is what you need to do:1) Set aside 15-ish hours of your life where you won't be disturbed
2) prepare some light, bland meals and drinks for those 15 hours
3) Play LISA
No breaks
No interruptions
No contact with the outside world for any reason
It isn't going to make anything feel better, if anything it'll make you feel worse
But as you feel the inside of your soul rusting and peeling, you may find some shreds of catharsis
There are jokes, placed like a breadcrumb trail, to keep you holding on just so long to see what is going to happen to the sad, sad man you're spending your time with
At some point you may hit a wall and consider giving up
Don't
I played through the first 3-ish acts of this game, and then put it down for a year, and it still punched me in the gut when I went and finished it
I can't imagine how unpleasant it'll be to play it straight through
But why am I telling you to play a game that makes you feel awful? Very simple: for the same reason that a cultured individual should watch Irreversible, or Come and See, or Magnolia or Requiem for a Dream, or read Exquisite Corpse or Funeral RItes
Because it's a stunning, beautiful piece of art, and sometimes, it's healthy to expose yourself to complicated, unpleasant, scary feelings
You will come out the other side purged
Once you're done1) Have a shower2) Make some tea3) Call your parents and tell them you love themThe only game that made me feel worse than LISA was probably Demonophobia, and I stopped playing that after twenty minutes when I realised that people were supposed to be getting off on it

												I'm just at the beginning of the game but I must say that it already has more than impressed me
The art style is just beautiful and I just happen to really like the concept of this game
It is cute but at the same time disturbing and cruel, dealing with serious and complex topics like mental illness, psychological and physical abuse an murder
Additionally, this is full of pretty weird and morbid creatures that reminds me of Tim Burton's work
It is clearly visible that this game was made with a lot of care and love
As far as I understood, Killmonday barely consists of two members who created this little gem all by themselves
This leaves me even more impressed and you can clearly tell the difference by the personal effort they put in it in comparision to big game developers who create games in mass production
So if you like point and click adventures that are not AAA-title-polished but have their very own beautiful style and if you have strong nerves to deal with the twisted themes in this game, I can only recommend you to buy this game and help Killmonday sell this game well so we can look forward to many new interesting games from them in the future!

It's been a very long time since I've enjoyed a game quite this thoroughly

												Very polished game
Fran has different animations when she says something, and it's not random
Her animation reflects the mood of the dialogue
Consider that each interactable object/character also has 3 different dialogue to trigger
I have never seen this level of detail in other point and click games
Also pleasantly surprised by the length of the game
My first playthrough took 15 hours
Great art direction

This game is the most amazing game I have ever had the chance to play
I am not a person who usually plays games like this, I donated to the greenlight project of this game becuase I thought the usage of different things were very intresting
But I went into this game having average expectations, I expected getting a game that was maybe 2-3 hours long, with an average story and average gameplay, but god was I wrong
Fran Bow is absolutely amazing and really boogles with your mind, hard puzzles,weird questions and answers that makes you question your own ideas of how things are, disturbing pictures that makes you wonder how you would have reacted if you were in Fran's spot
I know many people with mental illnesses and after this game I have so much more respect for them, I already knew they had it hard, but thinking that this is what some people have in their head (probably in a milder form tho) really makes me amazed
I love this game, I love the story, I love the characters (All of them, they are so creative), I really love Fran and Mr
Midnight, I love the puzzles, the music, the animations
I just love everything with this game, except for one thing
That it had an end
I really hope there'll be more Fran Bow in the future, but that's probably having high expectations
I rate this game 10/10 if it was possible to give it more I would most definitely do so

												Do yourself a favor and pick up this game
After backing this game on indiegogo, and seeing it go over the estimate release by a year, I thought this game was going to feel rushed halfway through and just overall be bad; but I was blown away
There is never a slow point in this game, it always manages to get under your skin and makes you feel uncomfortable
Natalia and Isak crafted such a wonderful game and deserve a massive recognition for their work after putting 2 years of their lives into crafting such a great point and click adventure game!

The horrorFinally another horror adventure game
If you liked the Cat lady you definitely should play this one
It's sick and twisted
You play as the little girl named Fran, who's parents were killed and her kitty ran away
Fran awakes in the mental hospital and you must help her to find her lost kitty
On your journey you will encounter some strange creatures and travel to some strange worlds
And of course there's gore and disturbing images everywhere
The game plays as the standard point&click adventure game
You collect some items, combine them, find the use for them and talk to characters for clues
The puzzles are not very easy, but not too hard either, most of them are logical, unlike in some other games
Also the game involves a few mini games, which i don't like personally
I think there's no need for them
The graphics are perfect
It captures the mood just perfectly
The game has no voiceovers
But maybe it's for the best
The atmopshere and music makes up for it
By the way i think this song would've have been great for a soundtrack: https://www

												Playtime: 6
5 hoursI was very excited to finally play this game
Although I had a fun time with it, I'd give it about a 50/50
OverviewThe player takes on the role of Fran Bow, a young girl who experienced a tragic incident and was sent to the mental hospital
I really enjoyed the mechanic of taking your pills, that allows you to see another world which is gruesome and psychologically twisted
Switching and interacting between the two worlds allows you to affect things you otherwise wouldn't be able to, for example you could open a door unnoticed in the "bloody world" and pass through on the normal world
Gameplay & Art designFran Bow is a pretty standard point and click game, the player may move around and interact with the environment
The inventory system is easy and smooth to use
As mentioned before, there is a mechanic of switching between "worlds" or how Fran can see different layer(s) of reality when she takes her pills, which I really enjoyed
The art style is one of the best parts of Fran Bow
Everything is unique and detailed, which really brought the gloomy and dark atmosphere of Fran Bow's worlds to life
The environments especially stood out, and made entering every new area a pleasure to explore
Thoughts on storyI have mixed feelings about the story
Not going to spoil anything, but it started out strong in the beginning and kind of went all over the place near the end, finally just petering out
I wouldn't say I got very emotionally invested in the end
My favorite part was an area where you're stuck in a house of two strangers, and it was the art and atmosphere it created that made it memorable
The art style definitely made a longer lasting impression and carried the story, almost
ConclusionI did enjoy this game, and have nothing but praise for the art style and atmosphere
However the plot didn't feel tight, and at times it felt like as a player my motivation was slipping away
It was like one of those movies that you'd watch once and never again, nor really remember after a couple of weeks
I'd say play it if you have it in your library anyway (Steam hoarders rejoice), or if you feel like playing a point and click game to kill time
Having played it, I personally wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it

												Mad Father is a Wolf Editor Horror Game (think of it similar to an RPG Maker Horror Game) which originally released in 2012 (and was translated into English in 2013)
This Steam release marks a rework of the game with an overall nicer layer of polish & some new content
I've only dabbled in the Steam release a bit at the time of writing to compare some early game differences, but I had played the game & gotten every ending back with the freeware version
I'll start off this review with a general review of the game itself, followed then a mention of some of the new content & early game differences
-----GENERAL REVIEW:-----The game follows the story of Aya Drevis, a young 11-year old girl who lives in an expansive mansion with her father, Alfred, & their maid, Maria
Aya is aware that her father does somewhat cruel experiments with a chainsaw to people in their mansion basement, but she still loves her father all the same
She has seen his good traits and love he gives to her as his daughter
However, one night she awakens to some odd sounds, & finds shambling corpses and other strange beings wandering the mansion with murderous intent
A curse has been put upon the mansion from the countless people Aya's father has slaughtered, & now the dead walk among them seeking revenge on the Drevis family
The only way to escape now & save your dad is to lay these spirits to rest, either through forgiveness or force
Mad Father gained a strong cult following for good reason, it has a number of creative & interesting varied scenarios despite its simple nature, ranging from puzzles, to light stealth, story, exploration, minigames, & backed with good gothic atmosphere with just a hint of the fantastical
While the main setting of the game is a Mansion, you quickly begin to descend in it, finding surreal labyrinths with intricate detail & interesting elements to each room
Some play a role in gameplay, others are simply interesting to look at
As you explore you'll come to face a number of challenges & entities who want you and your dad dead
You must find a way to put the spirits at rest, & make your way to your father deep in his underground labs
Along the way there is a colorful cast of odd characters you learn more about, & a number of side-quests off the beaten path you can partake in (they're optional to complete the game, but needed to get the true ending, though of note is the whole mansion is explorable even at the end of the game, you can go all the way back to the starting room of the game from the final room of the game)
While the story isn't surprising, it is well-told and full of charisma
Aya is a likable protagonist and her relationship with her twisted father is interesting, & the members of the core cast and their interconnecting relationships are just as interesting (if not more so)
The journey is engaging all the way through if you're into these 2D RPG-Horrors, & will easily give you a good 3-6 hours of playtime (depending on how much you explore, how many endings you go for, do 'optional' stuff or not, etc)
It has a charm to it simply due to its tone, a mixture of a Victorian-styled setting & characters combined with a more modern twisted sci-fi mad scientist doctor via our father and the gruesome undead experiments of his, forging a sort of scientifically twisted vs supernaturally malicious scenario
It's an interesting contrast that creeps its way into various aspects of the game I just find wholly fascinating
I will mention while the game has some good atmosphere, it isn't all that scary, nor is it trying to be
There is the occasional moment or scene, but the game aims more to unsettle you as a mood-piece with a central interconnected narrative and attract you with elements of intrigue, abstractness, & feeling to set a tone than to startle or even shock you
This said, some of the scenes are rather tense and creepy
If you're into the scene of 2D Horror games that came from the like of Wolf Editor and RPG Maker, this one is definitely worth checking out if you haven't before
-----FOR THOSE WHO'VE PLAYED BEFORE:-----But then for those who have played it before, you may ask yourselves, "What's new here? What makes this worth $5 compared to the previously free version?"The first thing you'll probably notice as you play is the graphics have been updated in almost every room of the game
Some rooms have been changed drastically with completely new layouts & details; they hardly resemble the rooms from the original
Others just have nice new touches that help bring them more alive & add character
In the mansion at the beginning there wasn't a room I encountered that hadn't seen some sort of overhaul, and the touches look very nice! Along with the new spritework, there is also a few new pictures that pop up during cutscenes to give more life to them & the previous pictures have been revamped to look much nicer
Also has new enemy sprites, better sprite animation & details, more detailed death scenes, & other touch-ups
For an example of the graphical difference, here's a comparison of Aya's Room: Aya's Room (Original Game): https://66

pngAnd so far, most rooms have been drastically redone like this
The game had to get rid of things it couldn't use for commercially, with the element that stands out the most being the music
Most of the original OST is present, but there are a few new original music tracks in this version of Mad Father in-place of the few unusable songs they had
I've only heard a couple new songs thus far, but I like them! They fit the game nicely & don't feel out of place
I may even like them more than the originals
The game also has some new ease of use elements
Aya now will have exclamations pop over her head when near things she can interact with or investigate
Items glitter now to stand-out, so you don't have to observe everything just to find key items hidden in shelves or the like, & the hit-detection feels much better & smoother than before
The UI/Menu is completely reworked, & the QTEs the game previously had have a new gameplay style where instead of rapidly pressing a button, you now must press a series of buttons before time runs out (with an improved UI element as well)
While I can't speak in full length as I haven't quite beaten the new version of the game, there are some new dialogue & scenes in the game
There is some changes to the layout of the locations as I said before, some new areas as a result
The dev has also said there's some new optional side-stories to uncover, new scenes, & some of the gems have been relocated
There's also a new "IF" option on the title screen, which is unlocked once you get the True Ending (not sure what it is, tho)
Game also comes with the Steam features of Trading Cards & achievements (which there's a 27 of)
Some may not find the new all that new, but it's made revisiting this game a joy for me so far, and as I loved the original I don't mind putting down some money for a revamped version with some new paint & some additional content to support future endeavors
-----OVERALL:-----While some may want to stick to the free version for its 'freeness', I think this version of Mad Father is an overall improvement which will be the best way to experience the game for either new players or fans of the original
Maybe not the huge expansion some may have hoped for, but the much more detailed & realized world along with the various additions, changes, & fixes all feel in-line with the vision of the original game while in my opinion steadily improving on it
Mad Father had a cult audience & will find new fans
If these type of games interest you, I do think is wholly worth checking out

												Took me a while to play this because there were some critical bugs during release day, but the devs worked hard to fix everything up
Now, this is the premium version of Mad Father which is not just a straight re-release of the free version, but an upgraded one (in many ways, I'm told)
Better graphics, better level design, better everything
It's a really tight experience without any filler and with an interesting story, so any fans of RPGMaker-type horror games will find this a highly enjoyable experience
You can also increase the game's window size, so don't worry if you're running a high-resolution display
This is a feature that is not exactly common for these types of games, but this game has got you covered
I'm looking forward to future games from the dev!

												The description on its Steam page is actually you need to know before you start playing the game
The whole gameplay is just as interesting as my first impression of it when I first saw the title and the capsule art
It's so fun and immersive that I didn't even notice I've been playing this for over seven hours already
Mad Father is about a crazy family
You play the role of Aya Drevis, a ten year old daughter of a mad scientist
Despite being aware of her father's inhumane hobby, Aya still loves and respects him
The story begins at midnight of her mother's death anniversary who, according to her father, died of an illness
While attempting to sleep, she heard her father scream for help, and she is determined to come to his rescue
However, the further she goes, the more she learns about her father's nature
There's not much to say about the story
It is fairly straightforward and even predictable
That's not to say that the story wasn't good
In fact, knowing how it unfolds adds to the excitement because the gameplay is almost the story in and of itself
Every character is very likeable except the father, although the father still has a reasonable motive behind his actions
There's no other word to describe him other than 'Mad', which stays true to the title of the game
While the gameplay is a masterpiece, the selling point of this game is the art
I must say that it was what made me want to get this game in the first place, and it didn't let me down
The game was an eyecandy until the end despite the dark and gore theme
The music was also very ambient
I honestly did not notice the background music, and that's a good thing
That means it was a part of story
Overall, This is one of the games where the story, gameplay, art, and music all work together seamlessly
I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to everyone regardless of your taste in games
Besides, who doesn't want to be a little girl whose weapon of choice is a chainsaw?

												This game's been available for a few years for free, but it was easily worth a price tag all along
I'm very glad to be able to support the developers after all this time
It's a short-but-sweet, but nonetheless excellent, story driven adventure puzzler of sorts
A real gem for anyone that is a fan of horror or slashers

												One of the most enjoyable RPG games I've played in a while
Though the jump scares weren't anything to sneeze at, the music and atmosphere that it brought really brought the game together as a horror RPG
I adore the sprite animations, and I really enjoyed the 'If' Ending because it was refreshing to step into another character's shoes, if only for a brief moment
This game has fantastic replay value and the achievements are manageable for even the less seasoned players
I got so frustrated my first play through when I ruined my chances of a True Ending because I didn't properly explore, but it was so fun starting over again to guarantee the ending that I wanted to experience
Overall, it's a well made, beautifully atmospheric game that's very afforrdable to play if you're really not sure about the style!

This



one messed up game





but that isn't necessarily a bad thing
Yet another gem on Steam that unfortunately many would let slip by
Personally, I couldn't recommend it enough, due to the resonable pricetag for all what its worth as an experience
The game, had one of the most original and unique plots I've ever come across in a top down RPG game
I personally was so engaged and moved by the storyline that I just couldn't find the leeway on leaving the game half way through without having curiousity lingering in my mind
Consequently, I managed to finish the entire game in straight 5-7 hours, collecting all the achievements whilst emphasizing on the comprehension of dialogue and minor details to get the perfect grasp on what the game had offered and truly, it was worth it
By the end of the game, my experience regarding the game was unsettling due to the disturbing plot and the many twists that it had as per the progression in game but regardless of that, they were part of the escapade which was, dare I say, amusing
Mad Father, as the title goes by is a psychological horror that offers exceptional soundtracks for every scenario in the game, an atmospheric top down level design, minor puzzles, simple controls and grotesque material / content in compliance with an innovative yet captivating plot
It comprises of multiple endings for which the choice is to be made at the very end of the game for the subsequent ending
Final summation
A fine indie rpg,  purely a bang for the buck, twisted yet fascinating

												This is one of the games I bought without hesitating and thinking if it's worth it
I remember playing free version about 3 years ago and I enjoyed the story and all the spooky moments, so I was pretty happy to see that it's been remastered and made it to steam
And to be honest this version is way better than the original, not only visually, but because it got some additions to the storyline
If you enjoy horror rpgmaker games that have beautiful graphics and a nice story with some plot twists, then you'll certainly enjoy this game
Storyline is quite short and takes a couple of hours to run through, but it's certainly worth it's price

												Games don't scare me
Movies don't scare me
In fact, short of being dropped in the middle of the ocean or singing in public, there's not much I'm bothered by


except Amnesia
Why? Because in this game, I am powerless
I cannot fight back
Games like Doom, Resident Evil, Dead Space, etc
; They fail to send chills up my spine and make me squeal like a child because they made the mistake of giving me an arsenal of weapons and badass personality traits
Are Isaac Clarke and Claire Redfield afraid? Sure, and I don't blame them
But I'm not, because I look awesome and I can materialize various tools of immenent destruction
Those creepers waiting to pop-out from behind the corner aren't trying to scare me, they're sacrificing themselves to the God of Death! Amnesia, though


My tools are the world's worst lantern and a number of closets to hide in! I couldn't fight if my life depended on it, and it most certainly does
Well done, Amnesia; I haven't looked over my shoulder this much since I was 12

												The original indie horror game that started it all
If you are in need of a good scare with an incredibly creepy setting, and actual storyline, this is the game for you
I cannot stress enough how fantastically horrifying it is
This is mostly done through the constant needs to push forward to avoid the darkness chasing you, but the knowledge that ahead lies horrible monsters
You're sort of stuck in the middle and it leaves you with a sense of helplessness that I've never experienced before

I especially recommend playing this before going to sleep as it will ensure a good night's sleep for you! The overall atmosphere of this game is very cheerful and bright
The maps are filled with great landscapes, ingenious architecture, and friendly creatures and characters
In my opinion it's exciting and constant entertainment for all ages and genders
A great game in every aspect and 100% worth the money! The only con is that a character known as 'brute' is sometimes very naughty

Amnesia: still the ruling king of horror gamesHorror games are a special genre
What scares one person to hell, could make somebody else just raise an eyebrow, or even come across as comical to yet another gamer
Opinions on what makes a good horror game do vary accordingly, but amidst all these discussions, there's one game that stands out: Amnesia: The Dark Descent
Almost everybody who has played this game, concedes that it is exceptionally scary, and thus succeeds wonderfully as a horror game
The first of the two Amnesia games, it was released just five years ago, in september 2010
It's not the first horror game by its developer, Frictional Games, who earlier made the Penumbra games, but it's certainly the title that made Frictional Games famous
With the hype around the upcoming release of Soma, yet another Frictional title, playing through their best known horror game yet only seemed appropriate, and long overdue
Actually I started this game already three times earlier this year, every time not finding the courage to move on after the first hour or so, out of pure fear
I only play this kind of games when it's dark outside, using headphones, in order to let them develop their full scaring potential, but with Amnesia: The Dark Descent this kind of approach just looked impossible
The past couple of weeks I finally found the courage to persevere (in complete darkness), but I was only able to play the game in small pieces, only half an hour or so on end, after which I literally had to recover
This may seem like exaggerated, but it's not
This game is by far the scariest I've ever played
Playing as Daniel, you have to re-discover who you are and what you're doing in a medieval castle somewhere deep in the German woods
As the game progresses, the story poses more and more questions, and only at the very end did all the pieces come together for me
But it's not the story itself that's particularly scary
It's the way the game puts the player in an extremely vulnerable position, without any means of defense (no swords or guns in this one!) and only some tinderboxes and a lantern as a means to progress through the increasingly unsettling surroundings
The game is by far the darkest I've ever played
Darkness is actually transformed into one of the game's defining elements: when standing in darkness, Daniel slowly but surely turns mad, and the only way to counter this is either to light some candles with the tinderboxes, or to light your lantern
Since lantern oil is quite scarce, I found myself constantly trying to save it as much as possible
There is a constant looming danger in the form of monsters, who are seldomly to been seen but impose terror upon the player by sound or just by thought
For when a monster finds you, it's almost surely instant death
The game manages to strike the perfect balance between slowly progressing episodes where I was fumbling around in the dark, hiding for monsters and looking for clues or letters, and some scenes where the only option was: run!It's hard to describe in words exactly why this game got so deep under my skin, though, because it terrified me on an even deeper level that has nothing to do with graphics or game mechanics
I think the theme of man turning into a monster even worse than any monster imagineable struck a resonating chord inside me
I found myself screaming out loud at times, mostly out of utter disgust at what was happening
The game had a very unsettling effect on my, and probably that's why it took me several tries to play and finish it
It's a masterpiece in its genre, yet to be trumped
Very highly recommended, but not for the faint of heart, nor for heart patients

												Disclaimer: I survivor main
I play games for fun, not for competition, so the DBD community doesn't really get to me
If I get a bad killer that face camps, oh well
I die and move on to the next game
If I get a good killer who finds me immediately, hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops), and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with), then no biggie
Next game please~I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face
And while that is a legitimate strategy, it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion
As a killer (a horrible one), I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud
' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours
Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you don't pip up - there is always the next game :)That being said, this game is crazy fun
Don't let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game
Grab it, have fun with it, and ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ;) And don't fixate too much on the ranking process unless you're absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine - just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!), and even then, recognize that there are jerks who play this game, like any other game, and have fun while you compete!

												"The Game" itself is really awesome and has a ton of potential, but unfortunately "The Systems" around the game NEED SERIOUS WORK
The Rank System is too difficult and counter intuitive to the game itself, at times
Winning too fast and totally dominating the match can Rank you down
Being too good at the game can Rank you down
You need to play "to farm" instead of "play to win" most of the time
It's not a very enjoyable experience to play Ranked in this game
The Options/Settings have nothing for keybinds, sensitivity settings, and has lackluster resolution/graphic settings
The Lobby/Matchmaking System completely sucks
No way to Dynamic Queue with friends, it matches people-up with WILDLY different MMR/Skill-levels, and Queue-Dodgers do not get time-outs that should increase with each lobby that is dodged
People are constantly queue-dodging lobbies, which makes starting an actual match and playing the game a nightmare at times
The Disconnect/Network System does not auto-reconnecting players back to a game when they disconnected, even if they log-back-in within less than a minute
Also, disconnected player's character models disappear from the game world, instead of being left in the game to be interacted with, like how League of Legends does it
There is also a ton of lag in-game some times while other games are amazing with no lag
It can be wildly different between matches, and you never know what you're going to get
Rage-Quitters do not get punished right now, which is a real problem
They need to get time-outs for joining new games that should increase the duration for every game that they disconnect from and they should also lose Rank points, while the players that are left in their game matches need to get Bloodpoints rewarded for the disconnected player who they cannot farm from anymore
The Anti-Cheat/Exploit Systems ARE NOT WORKING and there are obvious cheaters/exploiters in the game
People with Prestige and Level 50, with 4 Ultra Rare Perks, but only have 5 hours of game time played is an impossibility
Behaviour Interactive's Competitive Esports Team needs to start taking a stance against cheaters, right now, as it's only going to get increasingly worse as more cheats/exploits are discovered
The Server System is non-existent
This game should have been a Client-Server architecture, but instead they went with P2P and saving Player Data on the Client
This is a HORRIBLE idea, which is just asking for cheating/exploiting/lag-switching
The game should have had dedicated servers, where our Player Data lives at, and where matches take place on
Dedicated servers would have made the game experience WAY BETTER
What a huge missed opportunity
The Company itself (Behaviour Interactive) has been super bad with their Community Managers and Esports Team, when it comes to communicating and addressing issues with the community and competitive players on the Steam forums
Their Competitive Esports Team needs to start actively revoking game licenses and banning cheaters from the game, naming and shaming them on their official website (like Blizzard does), and also posting in regards to what is and what is not acceptable play within the game, so everyone who plays Ranked matches has a baseline of what they should and should not do within a said Ranked match
Again, the game itself is good and has potential, but the systems that surround the game are really beyond freaking horrible and too frustrating to make for an enjoyable experience at the moment

												Out of all the reviews I wrote, This one is probably the most serious one I wrote
For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game, You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah, its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game
But you don't have to talk to the community either
Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing
Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor, The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though
Mostly just to say GG for Good Game
As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked
I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more
Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself
But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks, Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave
After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG
So I give this game a 8/10
I wonder if anyone actually read this review, I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do
So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!

												Dead by Daylight is an amazing assymetrical survival horror game
I will provide a pro/con list, and then rebuttle the most common negative claims against the game
 Pros * Developers are active within the community* Lots of progression and levelling to give you a reason to keep coming back* Survivor perks from DLC are accessible to those without DLC, only requiring extra effort
* Game is, despite what some players may say, balanced
* Allows teamplay with minimal communication* Lots of tension, and some required decision making* Long lifetime, game produced 1 year ago, and still supports an average of 8,000-10,000 players per day
 Cons * Decent amount of the community is toxic, but welcome to the internet* Peer to Peer connection (If the killer's internet is bad, your ping/connection will be bad)* There are a fair amount of bugs/glitches in the game, but none are entirely game breaking
 Rebuttles One popular claim is that the game is horrible due to it's toxic community
My main contention here is that the game does not permit voice chat, and instead provides you with two emote options
One to point, and one to wave
Some survivors will tbag on the other side of objects just to aggravate/annoy the killer, but that isn't really a viable issue to hate the game for
Overall the coommunity is no reason to hate the game, and it isn't even that severe
A second, extremely popular complaint, is that camping a surviver that is on the hook as the killer is overpowered and should be removed somehow (which would be incredibly complicated to do from a development standpoint)
The issue with this complaint is that the only time when camping is affective is when all of the survivors commit their time playing to attempting to save the survivor on the hook
If instead, the survivors chose to work on generators, statistically they could each get over 1 generator done before the player on the hook died
This would allow the players to complete enough generators to escape with only 1, or if unlucky 2


survivors being sacrificed
The issue is not with the game, it is yet again an issue with the failure of players to adapt
Another claim is that the new killer, The Huntress, is absolutely unbalanced
The reason for a lot of complaint is that The Huntress is the first ranged killer in the game
Is she overpowered though? Not at all
I have played against an incredibly large amount of killers choosing to play The Huntress, especially seeing as it was released just one day before I made this review, and have won the vast majority of the matches
The Huntress was placed into the game to allow for both far more variation in gameplay, and to shake up the "meta", forcing players to adapt
The issue with that is, however, a lot of players do not wish to spend time adapting, and instead resort to despising the developers
I appreciate their attempts to add far more variation and effort into the game
One key detail that people who complain about the new killer fail to mention very often, is that the new killer can be heard from much further away, allowing for the survivor to react quicker, and hide appropriately
Although some may say that the sound of the killer's humming is quiet, in a game such as Dead by Daylight, sound is everything
You should be prepared to commit your attention entirely to the game during a match
If you do not, then your failures are not a result of the development team
Many players also complain about the lack of voice communication, because they do not feel as if your current implemented communication methods, pointing and waving, are effective enough
However, as seen with Friday the 13th: The Game, you will absolutely ruin any hopes of immersion and tarnish the horror aesthetic when you enable voice chat, which results in players blasting loud shrek theme songs through their microphones, or yelling the entire game so that you, again, can not pay as much attention too the actual game
A reply to my claim might say that you could simply permit blocking players so that you may not hear them
However, if as you said, the community is toxic, how many players do you honestly think you will not have to block? Even if you don't have too block people in a game, the killer would suffer tremendously from that communication
It is for this reason that a majority of people playing killer in the game recognize that survive with friends (swf) is even nearing overpowered
This is because the implementation of a survivor queueing system allows for survivors to communicate more, and better counter the killer during a game
If there is a great deal of hate towards a smaller system such as swf which even slightly allows voice communication, the development team should surely know better than to implement a full voice communications system for players
And they do, so I commend them for their resilience with putting up with the community's failure to fully think out their complaints
I may update this review if I either recall more additions I wished to add, or other issues are brought to my attention
TL;DR: People who complain about this game's issues, and quit the game due to them, do not fully understand the implications of either changing the matter, or just what they are talking about
This gameis great and worth a buy, and a popular complaint about the toxic community can explain away a great deal of people's poor reviews

												Absolutely love the game, but ofcourse there are flaws
Not gonna say its the community or "OP" killers, but a major glitch in the system
The whole reason i decided to write this review is to warn new players of a game ruining glitch, and how to fix it
Today my data, 58 hours of gameplay, was completely reset
While playing, i got a connection error, then a message saying "The season has ended"
When i went to check out my characters, THEY WERE ALL LEVEL ONE
now, to save yourself from this utterly horrible and game ruining experience (which i know will lead to you leaving a pretty bad review of the game), here's a fix!STEP 1: Go to the location of your steam data, then your Dead by Daylight save
(Which in my case is OS (C:)\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\129389900\381210\remote\ProfileSaves)STEP 2: Copy the file located within ProfileSaves to a safe location
(I leave it directly on my desktop)OPTIONAL STEP 3: Make a Shortcut to your ProfileSaves folder and place on desktop for easy access
STEP 4: Update your save (copy save and replace) everytime you close the game
If you dont do this, you could lose hours of progress like i did today
(I lost about 4 hours of progress)Good luck to you noobies, and have fun
Because this game is amazing!

												Many times a second game in a series doesn't live up to expectations set by the first - this is definitely NOT the case with The Room 2
While I'm not finished with it yet, it is just as good as the first! I highly recommend picking this and the first one up if you love good, solid, logic puzzle games
And I suspect I'll be revisiting them in the future for another playthrough

												The Room 1 was absolutely brilliant
The Room 2 builds upon that foundation with slightly less frustrating puzzle design (no painstakingly tiny hidden switches, better hint system) and better graphics as well as atmosphere
The Room is a game series as unique as it is awesome and beautiful
A true masterpiece and due to the suberb art design, it deserves to become a timeless classic for years to come

Another fantastic remaster of a great gameLike its predecessor, The Room Two is an immersive first-person puzzler of the Myst-like variety where you follow a trail of clues and tamper with eldritch mechanisms
Failure to solve a puzzle doesn't mean you don't get it, it just means you've not looked everywhere for clues
The game is about the same length and difficulty as The Room 1, but the environments are bigger and more detailed, which is a nice touch
Where the first game has you focus on a central setpiece, moving around it to examine every detail, this game incorporates several such setpieces in each level and allows you to move freely between them (Perfect for roomscale VR, eh devs?)
That doesn't mean you can solve them in any order, however, as they are usually interconnected with eachother
This leads to a minor issue where sometimes you're not sure what has changed since you're looking another way, but this only happens once or twice and is mostly avoided by the camera moving automatically to focus on what changed
While I think the controls probably feel better with a touch device, using a mouse works perfectly well
All in all, a brilliant title made gorgeous on PC
And it has nothing to do with the movie, stop asking

Posted: 24 April
Who am I:Hi there! My name is Claire, I am 26 years old and from Denmark
I have over 20 years of gaming experience
 I do all achievements for the game before I review it
So my review truly reflects a 100% completion of the game
However it is still my subjective opinion of the game
Hope you enjoy!Gameplay:You generally solve puzzles by using your mouse to interact with the objects you come across
It has a very Amnesia feel to it where you flip you mouse up to flip open a boxor slide your mouse to the side to move something out of the way
It makes you feel more engaged with the puzzles, and I liked that a lot
You solve puzzles of increasing difficulty, which at the beginning are very easy but as you progress through the rooms they end up being quite complex
The puzzles are varied, ranging from finding hidden objects to aligning seemingly random things to form something i
e a word of a symbol
If you are stuck on a part the game will automatically prompt you with hints, although these can be turned off for more of a challenge
All the puzzles have multiple stages to them, and seeing the whole room evolve as you solve more stages of the puzzle is quite addictive
Every stage has a distinct feel to them, although all the stages have a mysterious and dark theme  to them
Story:You are a seemingly unknown character trying to uncover the mysteries of the rooms you find yourself in
The story is set in the 1800's based on the environments, butyou seem to be able to travel in time, as not all the rooms seem to be from the same time period
The notes you find throughout the game confirms this aswell
From what I gathered from the cryptic letters and messages lying around on each level
The story is about you uncovering a deep mystery that has been hidden away forcenturies
From time to time you will come across these red symbols which has almost a demonic undertone to it
It makes you wonder what kind of deeper power or mystery you are uncovering and it helps build up a mystery surrounding the puzzles
I will say the ending is pretty ungratifying and the story really is quite irrelevant and left quite a lot to be desired
Ultimately it didn't really matter to me, butif you're hugely into storylines then The Room Two is not for you
Graphics:The objects of The Room Two and the puzzles are beautifully integrated
As an example you will solve puzzles on a model ship where everything from the ships cannons to the deck is created with an impressive attention to detail
On another level you will fix a broken crossbow to later use in the puzzles on that level
You get the impression that the developers really had a great time making these puzzles as beautiful and realistic as possible and I am very impressed with the naturalistic artstyle and the overall quality of the various objects you interact with
However with that said, the surrounding area in the various puzzlerooms are not very impressive and are often just blackened out areas where you can't really see much
The texture quality of the non-interactive areas are also not very impressive often very crudely designed and with low polygon numbers
You could make the argument that the low quality backgrounds and the very dark areas surrounding the interactive areas makes it easier for the player to know what he/she can interact with
I would've preferred all of the levels to be of the same graphical fidelity, especially considering how few rooms The Room Two actually has (6 rooms, with 1 being obnoxiously short
)Not much customization graphically, the only being resolution and a handful of graphic presets
Sound:There is very little music in The Room Two, which I personally think is a great decision
I felt much more immersed into the various rooms and their puzzles when all I couldhear was the ambience from the background and the beautiful sounds when you turn a key or place a weight on a counter-scale
The background ambience is very good and it helps solidify what kind of area you're in
You'll hear the ocean and the wood twisting and turning when on the boat level, andyou'll hear faint echoes and rocks falling when you're in the tomb/cave levels
At the end of most levels, you would be presented with a final puzzle relating to the story of the game, and in this puzzle random flashes followed with a loud almost demonicsound pops up
I personally found the flashing noise quite obnoxious, and it broke my immersion with the game
I couldn't figure out if it was an attempt to make the game a little scary or why it was put in there
Price:The Room Two is very cheap, only about 5 euro when not on sale
It took me around 3 hours to complete the game, and although the game doesn't really have any replayabilityfor the low price they are charging you get quite a few hours worth of entertainment
Conclusion:If you are into dark mysteries, puzzles and an immersive atmosphere, then you should pick up The Room Two
It's nothing revolutionary, but it delivers solid entertainmentfor about 2-3 hours at a low price
On a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is unplayable and 10 is a masterpiece, I will give The Room Two a 6 out of 10

												'The Room 2' is just as good as 'The Room'
If you played the first game, all you may want to know is that 'The Room 2' is more of the same
Yay! The only differences are: environments are more varied and there is a little more story (but only a little)
'The Room' and 'The Room 2' are the best puzzle games I have ever played and I've been playing them since the 1990s
It's puzzling in its most basic form
There is almost no story being told
Chapter after chapter, you just tackle one big puzzle
In order to solve each puzzle, a number of tasks need to be performed, ranging from solving mini-puzzles to spotting hidden compartments in the puzzle and coming up with a logical way to open them
Solving the puzzles feels exciting and rewarding, and it's just a lot of fun
I think a large part of the reason is that in 'The Room' and 'The Room 2', the puzzles feel very 'physical', as opposed to just seeing a board of some form in front of you like in most other puzzle games
It almost feels like you could reach out and touch the puzzles and solve them that way
To conclude, a few short additional notes that may help you decide whether to buy 'The Room' and 'The Room 2' if you're still not sure:- both games are short: about 3 to 4 hours each, so you may want to buy them when they're on sale, although I think the quality of both games certainly justifies their full price
- they're not very difficult: for me the games were just challenging enough but if you're the sadistic kind of puzzler who only likes being challenged to the point of migraine, you will not find that here
On the contrary, there is a hint system in the game so if you feel stumped at any time, you can click a button to give you some pointers
- the Steam Achievements are the most basic: one achievement for completing each chapter of the games
I would recommend this game to everyone, not just to people who like playing puzzle games
It's really that good

												What made The Room so good in it's great formula of mystery and puzzle solving is back yet again for an outstanding sequel! If you're unfamiliar with the series, The Room firstly came out on mobile platforms, and was then fully remastered for PC
The original Room was released back in 2014 and The Room 2 released in 2016
The game's quite simplistic in it's concept
You have a safe, a box, or just a lock, and the player is supposed to open it
To do so you're gonna have to solve all of the sub-puzzles before cracking the big one
While I do get frustrated a lot of times in puzzle games, I feel the difficulty for The Room games isn't too hard but also not too easy, it's perfectly balanced and is able to be satisfactory throughout the entirety of the game
It lasts about 3
5 hours total if you don't rush through it, just like the first one
While some people may not like the short length, I think a short game fits the genre better than a longer one
There are 6 chapters in this sequel, one of them lasts a minute and another one is a tutorial, so in the end we have 4 chapters with challenging rooms to crack
I was quite surprised by the creepy atmosphere in The Room Two, it certainly felt darker than the first game while the main objective is pretty much the same between the two
However, there's a slight difference in this installment, instead of being focused on just one safe or table, now there are multiple places in the room to explore, so moving around with the mouse is possible now
The port is really well made but I did have some slight annoyances
Sometimes I wanted to move a drawer and the game decided to move the camera instead
Also, it should be possible to type on the typewriter with the keyboard
It's nothing game breaking or too frustrating, just little details I'd like to point out
The Room Three is already out on mobile, but I do hope it is ported to the PC just like the first two games have been
This is two of my favorite mystery/puzzle games of all time and having to pick between which one is the best is a tough call, they stand on equal ground in terms of quality, challenge and entertainment, two phenomenal games I'd recommend anyone to check them out, even if you're not into point & click / puzzle games
9/10			
Posted: 23 July
												In my opinion "The Room" series is the best of the simplistic puzzle games or ones that you can play with one hand
This is of course excluding games with full controls like Portal, Myst, or The Witness
The ambient noise as well as the sound each switch, cog, & lever make set the mood perfectly
The torches, lamps, & candles all light each room as I would expect them to in real life
Plus this time the puzzles encompass the whole room & not just one puzzle box like it's predecessor making you think just that little bit more
Story is a little naff but I came here to solve puzzles primarily so this is forgivable
Replay-ability is also at a zero as you will already know all the answers to the puzzles
Apart from these factors I would still pay full asking price just on the intricacy of the puzzles & level design
The Room & The Room Two give me hope that games CAN be ported properly
They're fun to play on your own or with your girlfriend and/or kids
They make you think for once instead of shoot and/or kill aimlessly & I will most definitely be purchasing their third game whenever they decide to port it across to PC

												This is a good game
Want to see any pros? Read any other review
I'll list cons just to help you make the decision:* There are no high-quality puzzles that you actually have to solve with pen and paper
Nothing is more complicated than "monkey see, monkey do", and in the majority of the cases it's even simplier than that
If you want a real challenge, this is not the right game
* A lot of things you have to do are too random and make no sense whatsoever
This is a big downgrade from The Room 1, where most interactions were a lot more "explainable" ("because this is a big puzzle box with hidden compartments", etc
)* Your greatest enemy is your monitor's brightness setting
Thankfully, you can adjust the brightness of the game in the options menu
* Sometimes game uses creepy flashes for the atmosphere
Not quite as bad as real jumpscares, but if you are sensitive to such things (or you are playing with an easy-to-scare kid), beware, and play in a well-lit room
In my opinion, this was completely unnecessary for a puzzle game without a real horror element
* Some parts are just tedious and annoying
There are quite a few "puzzles" that will make you repeat the solution several times, probably just to make the game a little bit longer
* Despite everything, the game is super short
I guess it can take longer than 2 hours if you just got stuck and don't want to use hints, but it's not something good, because most likely that means that you missed a tiny barely-visible thingie somewhere, and you will just sit in frustration till you'll finally notice it
Other than that, this game is quite nice, and it totally worth the price if you just want a short nice atmospheric mystery experience

												I won't go on and on with this one, but let me just say that before Frictional Games' Amnesia: The Dark Descent became synonymous with fear, they were perfecting their craft with the Penumbra series
Black Plague is the second of their three-part Penumbra series, but in this man's humble opinion it tops even their most successful of games
Yes, I said it
It's better than Amnesia
Now before you get to the hate let me just say that I adore Amnesia
It introduced me, as it did so many others, to Frictional Games' work
But once I finished it up I wanted more
I was lucky enough to see this package come up during one of Steam's classic Halloween sales and decided to snag it
For some reason or another, I started Black Plague first, and I couldn't have made a better choice
This game has it all
From the atmosphere that breathed down my neck, tingling my spine and darkening my thoughts to the gameplay immersing me into the world, this game hits all the right notes
But this one does what I hope Soma (Frictional Games' next title) will do again - make a great story
I won't spoil anything, but let me just say don't let the atypical setting of a mental asylum fool you
It's much more than that, and giving this game enough of your time to find out why is well worth the investment
I highly recommend this game

												My recommendation: Buy it
Pros and Cons:+ Great, creepy atmosphere+ Interesting puzzles+ Good story- Small variety of enemies- Simple AITo avoid any spoilers, I'll just say that the game starts right where the Penumbra: Overture ended
You still play as Philip, in his search for his father and the truth behind the mysterious events in the Greenland mine
While the game preserves most of the features from the first episode - like exploration, puzzle solving and stealth - the combat system has been completely removed
Personally, I think that the lack of ability to fight back makes the game a lot more tense, especially because of the very creepy enemy design
However, enemy variety is still quite poor, but for one there is a lot less of them than in the first episode, and I've never felt that enemies were there just for the sake of it
The plot really develops in this episode, it's well written and interesting
There is a lot more interaction with characters, and some of them may even "grow" on you (pun intended), and the whole setting is much more twisted than it was in its predecessor
Voice acting and dialogues are also much better, while sound assets, musical score and graphical capabilities remain pretty much on par with Overture
There is also a lot more variety in level design and in the overall environments
While it's not that important, it's worth mentioning that the AI is still fairly simple, and that it's not particularly difficult to lose pursuing enemies
In general, it's a great sequel, especially in it's story
While it's scarier than Overture, it doesn't rely on jump scares, but on it's fantastic atmosphere
Definitely play it if you like horror games, but make sure to play Overture first for the complete experience

												This is the kind of game you'll have to play with a pair of headphones and no source of light because only then you'll experience its true power
The game's overall story is deep, unpredictable and intriguing, making it very interesting, which is a big plus for a horror game
(It even has a few emotional moments!) Even though at the beginning there is a short recap of the events that took place in Overture, I highly recommend playing the first game first in order to have a full understanding of the story
(You can only buy the package containing both games, so why not give it a try?)Both games are similar in terms of gameplay, but Black Plague improves a lot on about every aspect of the first game, making it more solid
There is no direct way of fighting with the enemies in this installment, so the combat system, which, in my opinion, wasn't that awful, should no longer be a problem for those who complained about it
Another important aspect of the game are puzzles: being the second episode, Black Plague is also filled with intelligent puzzles that require reading (in-game "notes") and thinking, but this time they are just a little easier than those found in Overture
The graphics may be a little outdated, but there's nothing to worry about because it doesn't break the immersion; they are decent and have successfully created a terrifying atmosphere that will constantly make you scared of the unknown
(For that to work at its full potential, I recommend lowering the gamma a bit, until you can't see anything in places without any source of light
) With its impressive sound design and voice acting (at least for a low-budget game), the developers managed to create their own world filled with few, but believable characters
For such a low price, I can recommend the Penumbra games without a doubt! This package is a must-have for every horror enthusiast, as it delivers a frightening experience!

												The sequel to Overture, Black Plague further tells the story of Philip which eventually comes to an end
In fact, it turns out, this is not the final episode (as Requiem includes further chapters) but for me it seemed like the final chapter of his adventure
The story now continues and tells us much, much more
Running and hiding is even more frequent and from this episode we can clearly see the couple of places that inspired Frictional Games to make Amnesia
The game is also somewhat longer
Since this is an essential part of a great survival horror trilogy, look for discount on the trilogy pack (if there's any) so that all episodes can be purchased at once
The story and gameplay are both well worth the ride!

												I can totally recommend this game to all horror fans(that arent searching for action horror) and everyone that liked the predecessor
Thick atmosphere, creepy experience
Good and clever puzzles without being too hard, but more challenging than in Amnesia
You can tell some good thought went into the puzzle design
The unkillable enemies arent as annoying as I expected, you can handle them with a bit effort or run from then in most cases
Story is also intriguing, finally you can make something out of it, more clear than  in the first part
Furthermore, really appreciate the way the story is told: Reading notes, checking logs etc
Very fitting for a game like that
Graphics arent too hot, especially for today standards, but you cant really say it aged bad
Enemy animations look a bit clunky, but overall the whole thing works for an atmospheric horror game like this
Afaik there is no way for steam to get German language for all the text, which might be an issue for some people

												Back before PopCap was bought by EA and the company saw the detriments that the very move brings, they made the most awesome "casual" games that somehow intrigued both casual and hardcore gamers alike
PopCap's major successes include Bejeweled, Peggle, and Plants Vs
Zombies, but through playing all of their games for the past twelve years, Insaniquarium is by far my personal favorite, and in my opinion, the most original, creative, and fun
This game is part simulation, part "management", part tycoon, part action, and all sorts of


well, insanity
You are put in charge of an aquarium, where you can buy goldish, carnivorous fish, and many other types of creatures that you grow and make money off of
(First win of the game: goldfish poop money!) You use this money for upgrades (upgrade the food to make the fish grow faster and get hungry less often, buy carnivorous fish that poop diamonds but eat little goldfish, etc
)
You have access to dozens of unlockable aquarium pets throughout the game that help you in various ways, and you choose which three you'd like to bring to any level
Oh, but I haven't mentioned the aliens
That's right, folks, aliens are so jealous of your awesometacular aquarium that they'll attack, and throughout the campaign the aliens get fiercer (and sometimes come in multiples!)
Aliens will eat your fish, but not if you kill them first with a laser gun that you can also upgrade


with the money your fish poop, of course
Not only does this game have a great campaign that will keep you busy over the course of quite a few hours, but it also presents new challenges to the player along the way, in the forms of various alien types, different fish you have to figure out how to make profitable, etc
Not only that, but throughout playing you'll unlock sea shells that serve as currency for a "Pet Aquarium", where you can purchase fish (among other things) for a relaxing sim aquarium
These fish are essentially the same species from the game, but they come in a large variety of color combinations and sometimes even have special skills (some hilarious, some useful, etc
)
What's even better? The selection of fish in the store is randomized and changed daily, meaning you'll come across some really awesome fish one day that you might not see for awhile again, so you can save your shells and get rarities or even just cool looking fish to add to you aquarium
You can collect quite a few, and you can even name them
You also have access to their "interests" screen, where you can learn more about your fish
Does Gill like to take walks in the park? How long have you owned little Floater? You can see all that and more
Insaniquarium is a perfect example of PopCap at their finest
Sure, the game is "casual", but it offers you so many options and it has so much detail that many developers wouldn't have added in (like telling you your fish's interests, for example)
If you are a fan of PopCap's earlier work, buy this
If you are a fan of simulation or tycoon games, buy this
If you are looking for a game with a sense of humor to pass a few hours, buy this
This is PopCap's best effort, and will forever be a classic

												This game is just as fun to me as it used to be back in 2003 on realArcade
10/10			
Posted: 22 June, 2014
												Quite possibly the best game ever created
The level of strategy required to play this game is nearly incomprehensible; I found myself having to have a piece of paper nearby just to draw out budget plans, and that's not even touching the complex combat system
When combat occurs, there's a sharp balance you have to hold between managing aggression and doing damage; less attacks per second to keep an important character safe, or more to finish him off but maybe propel the alien into your school? It's very difficult to the point that survival horror comes to mind as a genre
The budgeting system is intense
Allocating funds between fish and weapons borders on art instead of strategy
Don't walk into this game expecting a casual experience
Without spoiling too much, I'll say that the upgrade mechanics are also amazing
While it's usually linear improvement, expect stellar new graphics and sounds along with your stat buffs
There are upgrades for fish, weapons, food, and more that I won't mention
The soundtrack in this game is absolutely killer
Seriously
It's amazing
You could sleep to the calm tracks, but I can personally vouch that when PopCap wants to build suspense, they build it
They then deliver
Hard
The enemies you'll be fighting in this game are, as previously mentioned, no joke
Those linear upgrades I mentioned are less upgrades and more a scrabble to keep up with the standard of ten steps behind the enemy
Good luck accomplishing even that
And believe me
You'll be pounded with sick beats the whole time
The cast in this game is great
Deep, dark, thoughtful lines and lovable characters, models, and animations make this game truly beautiful and unforgettable
Every death is truly a tragedy
The end credits are mostly comic relief (literally the first you'll see in the entire game), so they lack a bit in the way of factual information
Through my own research, I've found a few of the character actors:1
The dolphin's sounds were ripped directly from a Soviet nuclear submarine
2
One of the "hidden" special characters' grunts are from Sylvester Stallone's first role ever
I'm not sure they attained the proper licensing, but it looks like the beginnings of the lawsuit were swept under the rug
3
The guppies sound like a plethora of different actors, but is actually just Bill Murray pretending to be hundreds of other actors
4
The final boss is voiced by Bill Murray acting as himself
5
The last one I could figure out was the carnivores' bite sounds are the exact same sound as the dog bites in CoD: Ghosts
I'm not sure how that happened, but I promise that if you compare them they're exactly the same
The last thing I'd like to touch on is the amazing graphical expertise that the art department at PopCap has
Genuinely soothing and peaceful graphics put you into a calm state right along with the soundtrack; that is, until and alien shows up and the advanced gore engine tosses guppy shreds all over your tank
The shading effects are also amazing
Shadows are affected by laser blasts and temporal warp shifts (TWSs as known ingame), and you can almost see the reflection in a guppy's eye as her beloved little sister is strewn halfway across the tank by the razor-sharp teeth of an extraterrestrial
When it needs to build suspense, it acknowledges the hardware shortcomings of the time and leaves a lot to the imagination; however, I promise you that when that suspense finally culminates, you'll wish they'd left a little more to be imagined
This game definitely isn't for casuals or noobs
I'm not trying to be offensive, but I promise that it'll stomp you into the ground over and over, and its version of a reprieve is stepping back long enough to pull on a pair of steel-toes
The only tip I can give is to avoid indecision because I promise that if you falter for even a second, it'll destroy your guppies so fast that your economy will be irreparably tanked
And if you ever try to turn tail and run, you shouldn't be surprised to find some boot laces dangling from your nose
At least you can take comfort in the fact that the biggest inconvenience you gave the AI was having to dislodge its heel from your colon

Product received for free
 Target Audience:   Danganronpa/Story Driven Fans, or surprisingly, Puzzle enthusaists  Summary:  Let me get this out of the way: if you haven't played Danganronpa 1 and 2 at this point: well you should probably do that before you play Ultra Despair Girls
It's not that you can't get anything out of this game if you play it alone: but it's SO much better after playing the first two games
And those two games are fantastic
While Ultra Despair Girls tries to spice things up with a new gameplay style, it's the iconic and fascinating story is the reason that you should pick up the game
The spin off takes the story in a new direction but not only keeps a lot of the themes from the original, but adds a more character relationship driven angle with Toko and Komaru which really REALLY works
The angle with the kids takes the series to new creepy depths, and if you were concerned that the game who pull punches with the new characters involved: you'd be dead wrong
It can be down right disturbing at times in the right way, causing you to shudder in your seat
The gameplay however doesn't do as well
The basic shooting doesn't play to its own strengths, as the generic gameplay and lack of AI complexity keeps it from being interesting
It's got a bunch of tools, but it doesn't use them well in the main gameplay
Frankly, its the worst part of the game
When it switches to a more puzzle like format: that's where it starts to get a lot better: as thinking about how you use each bullet to kill all the Monokuma's at once
It's all a case of wasted potential, as the tools here could have been used to really work in a Survival Horror type setting
The presentation is pretty good (for a vita port), and the port itself is great performance wise,  although has some options missing that I would want
The voice work is good, and the music work is great despite being all over the place genre wise
Overall, Danganronpa series fans have to pick up this game because well, the story is worth it
And if you aren't a fan of the series as of yet, even though it's not the best way to get into it, it can do the job for someone who ABSOLUTELY NEEDS action gameplay
Video Review:  https://www
youtube
com/watch?v=muDSpdQX0tE Lists: Positives: The Story keeps the themes of the original series, but takes them in a new interesting direction with more traditional dystopian/survival elements
They kept the lore in tact without going completely off the rails
This feels like a Danganronpa story
The Star of the show is the relationship and complexity that develops between Toko and Komaru
They play off each other well, and the growth of both characters is fascinating to watch
The world is built on in a lot of good ways, and does a good job of bridging several of the holes in the plot up to this point
 Pushes your uncomfortable meter in good ways
Can legimately get under your skin and make you wonder if the villians/heroes are justified
Kudos to the writing
 The kids characters
All of them are rather well done
 Very clever references to the original game, and makes fans who pay attention really appreciate the tight narrative here
 The tools for the gameplay have interesting concepts, and if they were assembled better, it would make for some good gameplay
(More on this later)  Character design and artwork is still superb, doing well in giving little details about the characters while still having a style to it
 60 FPS will drops every so often, but not more then 4/5 frames
Does support up to 4K in Fullscreen (although really, you're not going to notice it that much) All controllers are supported that I tried
Including a default configuration for the Steam controller!Negatives: The standard shooting is rather repetitive and doesn't do well in constructing interesting scenarios to keep the player entertained
 The enemy AI is pretty gosh darn horrible
Will constantly run into walls, and is able to be easily exploited
This added to your speed makes even the hardest difficulty



a reasonable cake walk
 The 3D models don't do well in complementing the emotional elements of the story
The Animation/3D cutscenes conflict with each other
 Note, my main machine could not play via the keyboard/mouse controls due to …

something causing the game to auto rotate the camera and not allow me to use the virtual directions
The thing is, this problem was not seen on a second machine, and seems to be some directx/other issue
Keep it in mind as you may have to refund the game if you run into this problem
 Some of the deaths this time around don't have that much of an impact due to the format chosen here
 The strength of Toko almost undoes Komaru's character at times
Side characters sorta get overlooked from the “good” side
Don't like the split of options here with the launcher and the in game options
Missing bindable keys, which for a third person shooter, is sorta a big feature to miss

												I finished the game at 100%
See last section for the final conclusions:Very early review of the game
First of all: DONT PLAY THIS GAME BEFORE DANGANRONPA 1 OR SUPER DANGANRONPA 2, because it will sure spoil the story
About the port:For now I have only played the prologue, but the game looks very good and has not any performance issues
You can clearly see how everything in game has been remastered for higher resolutions; the only thing that is a bit lacking are the 3D cutscenes which still seem a bit bad, although in my opinion that is not an issue because they are good enough
I have not tested the keyboard+mouse control, but given that the game is a third-person shooter, it sure will feel better, I migh even change later, although you can use the a controller without any problems
UPDATE: I have been playing with Keyboard+Mouse and I prefer it over controller
The only downside is that there are not customizable keybindings, althought the default ones are pretty good
About graphical options, in my opinion the game has enough
You can customize in the launcher of the game if you want to display it borderless window or fullscreen along with other graphical options like antialiasing
Something I noticed is the lack of V-sync option on Fullscreen mode, but I didnt see any tearing so its okay
About the game itself:This game does not follow the same pattern as the two ones before (simply because the author wanted to make something different lol) and instead of a trial-murder-puzzle game, is a fps with some hack-and-slash
Even so, the game keeps the Danganronpa feeling and I think its worth a play if you are fan of the series
Storywise is not very important, but give details about what happened between the first and second game and introduces some characters that are then shown in the Danganronpa 3 animation, which ends the Hope's Peak Academy Arc, so if you like the universe absolutely play this
Final conclusions:The game is fine
Recommended if you like the Danganronpa Universe and dont expect nothing like DR1 and SDR2
The port is fine overall, I havent find any bugs nor performance issues
The only con I can say is that its a little easy with keyboard+mouse simply because aiming to the weak point of the enemies is very simple

												A word of warning going into this game, whether you're a Danganronpa fan or not: a lot of the subject matter in this game is WAY darker compared to the first two Danganronpa games, and is pretty dark to average person
You may be saying "Wait, it gets darker than just straight up cold-blooded murder like in the other games?" Yes it does
It's not a deterrant of the game, just a word of warning so that those who play it know what they're getting into
That being said, it's a really solid game
Great storytelling, great characters, a nice blend of serious, bone-chilling semi-horror and almost 4th-wall breaking silliness
It's absurdIt's (somewhat) scary (in a cartoonish kind of way)It's fanservice-y at timesIt's Danganronpa!Hope to see you aboard Kazutaka Kodaka's Wild Ride!			
Posted: 27 June
												An incredibly solid third-person shooter / puzzle game filled to the brim with all the things I love about Danganronpa and more
I highly recommend the keyboard + mouse controls, because the mouselook camera is fantastic and makes the game incredibly satisfying
Also, Genocide Jack has no qualms showing off her panties mid-fight, so that's a plus
			
Posted: 1 July
												If you haven't played Danganronpa 1 and 2 yet, do not play this game
Saying that, if you're a fan of the Danganronpa story or puzzles, you'll enjoy Danganronpa Another Episode
			
Posted: 27 June
												After all this time for a PC port was it worth the wait?Yes!This is definitly worth it to anyone having enjoyed danganronpa before and while the shooting isn't spectaculair danganronpa plays to its strengths with its writing and atmosphere while forming a connection between the first 2 games
I do advise that while having played the previous games isn't required, it will add so much more to your experience if you did and they are definitly worth checking out
			
Posted: 29 July
												Score: 6
5/10Time to 100%: 20 hoursOne just for the fans
PROS:Story - Amongst the Danganronpa series this game has easily the darkest of the storylines, for reasons such as torture, betrayal, murder, sexual abuse and all for the most part involving children no less
It is a pleasure (or displeasure?) to play thorugh if only to see how things turn out for the characters involved and its the primary reason to play through this game
Characters- The characters in the game - specifically the bad guys - are fascinating individuals in their own right
They're full of different neurosis and demented backgrounds
Their history is unravlled through their breakdowns and from books scattered throughout the game shedding some light on why they are just so f'ed up
There's also the appearance of a very special someone
CONS: Gameplay- It's pretty basic third-person shooter fare with substandard level designs with poor looking graphics
Although in all fairness, this is a port of a PS Vita game so just bare that in mind
It's also extremely easy as most enemies in the game will die in one shot if you hit them in the right place, even on the hardest difficulty
Other Characters - So in the pros I had mentioned that the BAD guys are the interesting characters
That's because for the most part the good guys, namely the two main characters are not interesting AT ALL
Let's start with Toko
I never liked her in the first game and I still don't like her now
She's whiny, neurotic, annoying and insulting pretty much all the time and while they try to give her some kind of character development it falls far too short as she's still just as irritating as she's always been
Then there's the main character who is so bland and boring that they constantly make jokes about this fact again and again
We get it, you're normal and boring, okay great
So in conclusion, play this for the great story and certain characters if you're a fan of the series
As it is worthy of a playthrough and fills in some of the gaps between the first and the second game
And need a fix before Danganronpa 3 comes out!			
Posted: 27 June
												Make sure you've played the rest of the Danganronpa series before playing this
Otherwise, you'll get unwanted spoilers (and it also might not make as much sense)
Technically this game takes place between Danganronpa 1 & 2, but it all feels more fluid if you save this one for last imo
Keep in mind that this game is very different than the other two
It's more of a puzzle/FPS so it's more interactive in terms of gameplay
There are no trials, and the flow of the story is more fast paced
It's still a solid game with solid mechanics and helps round out the story from the other games
			
Posted: 28 June
												As with many spinn-offs this game is made first and foremost for fans of original serie, it heavy relys on player to be familiar with at least first game
So to put it out of the way1) People unfamiliar with Danganronpa games, don't buy it
Or buy a bundle with all 3 games
2) People who played Danganronpa games: if you like those games and want to know more about lore, charecters and whatnots, buy it
3) Hardcore fan? Absolutely must have for you
Plot:Player takes controll of Komaru Naegi (sister of Makoto) and fanfavorite Toko (aka Genosider Se)
Another Episode takes place between 1 and 2 games, and follows events prior to second one
Without too much spoilers; the story itself is the strongest side of this game -- shouldn't come as a surprise
Nice twists, great addition to first game, likeble charecters, humor and drama


Danganronpa!Gameplay:For the majority of the game you will play as Komaru armed with hacking gun (looks like megaphone) and in her case game pretty much is a mediocre TPS: sure game tries to keep you entertained, tosses new enemies now and then and hacking gun have a variety of diffrent ammo -- 8 types to be precise,  each more effective against certan enemies (for example knockback will swat shields from hands of monokumas with said shields, dance will make monokumas dance -- but use it against siren one and every enemy in vicinity will gather around him etc)
The second charecter is Toko Fukawa, you can switch to her and play as Genosider Se for a short periods (she doesn't have health instead it's battery


Think of her as your super mode), slice and dice Monokumas with signature sccisors, use extremely fun blood lust moves, take it back and relax for a while
Still gameplay is very weak, enemies are slow, fragile and come in small groups (on max difficulty I expereinced exactly zero challenge from them)
So yeah a mediocre TPS with boring slasher tossed inbetween
Oh right there are also chalenges and puzzles!  Again not a bad way to keep player entetained, does bring variety, and developers tried their best to make those puzzles and chalenges diffrent, but to be honest those puzzles and challenges will became a chore somewhere around third Chapter


They are easy


One or two may have an intresting concept and fun solution, but majority is kindergarten level
Still, guss it wouldn't be Danganronpa without a little mind excercise now and then
OST and sound: As always Danganronpa provides a good music and decent sound design
English dub still sucks -- switch to Japanese as soon as you can (to do that press C on keyboard\Y on controller on difficulty chose screen)
Overall not much to say
In conclusion
It is a game for fans of serie, don't buy unless you played previous games, buy if you are a fan or simply a person who is intrested in this universe
Sure gampelay is not the strongest side of game, but story, charecters and mystery will sure keep you on your toes till the end

com/watch?v=N4nyZkwycEoTaking control of a lone astronaut, you explore Theseus, a derelict space station
The Swapper immediately brings to mind Super Metroid with it's open map design and emphasis on isolation
The human inhabitants of Theseus have mostly perished and it's up to you to put the pieces together
The space station is filed with sentient rocks that leave you with cryptic messages as you pass by them and, together with crew logs, provide much of the narrative; tantalizing you with little details that must be put together like a puzzle
It's a tale the wanders off in the direction of the metaphysical and philosophical, meditating on what constitutes a sense of self, what exactly the soul means to the individual and and how individuals fit into the rest of society
The esoteric narrative and heavy sense of  isolation and dread will have you mulling over the events of The Swapper long after it concludes
The puzzle gimmick employed by The Swapper comes in the form of a gun that allows your character to clone themself
Up to four clones can be made and these clones mimic your every move
In addition the gun can beam your consciousness into these clones and  allow you to take direct control of them
Additional puzzle elements like blue lights that prohibit the creation of clones where their light is cast, red lights that prevent you from taking control of clones and gravity switches that will have you walking on the ceiling all further complicate the proceedings
Your clones must be used to trip switches and reach far away ledges, they are empty vessels that are to used and disposed of and the sight of their lifeless husks collapsing after long falls becomes a frequent occurrence throughout the course of The Swapper
The goal is to our the character that you directly control in contact with orbs that allow you to open doors and progress
These simple gameplay mechanics tie in closely to The Swapper's narrative themes meaning the narrative events never drift too far off into the back of your mind
Few games are able to do this so well
Puzzle start off very easy as you learn to navigate your environment and are introduced to clever new ways to solve problems within the game world
Much like Portal, The Swapper religiously sticks to it's core mechanics
You don't get any new abilities or skills as the game progresses, instead new obstacles bring new challenges that occasionally elicit head scratching and pensive stares
The first three quarters of the game's three to five hours are really a breeze but the final few puzzles can really put your puzzle solving skills to the test
While the challenge is certainly welcome, this spike in challenge has a habit of disrupting the pacing
Your brisk jaunts between memory stations for more information slow to a crawl near the final area potentially becoming agonizing as the game's mind benders thwart your best attempts to crack them
The Swapper wouldn't be nearly as engaging if it weren't for it's distinct visual style
Everything in the game was originally molded out of clay by the team at Facepalm studios and in addition to complimenting the narrative themes it looks wonderfully alien and unique among it's contemporaries
Fantastic lighting effects also dress up the stylized art and drive the lonely desperate mood home
Seeing the dark, desolate corridors of Theseus illuminated by a beam from your flashlight as the ambient soundtrack hums in the background can be profoundly melancholy
The measured tempo of the soundtrack never leaves you with a sense of urgency and instead slowly and beautifully builds a hopeless and lonely tone befitting a game that is largely devoid of other characters
			
Posted: 2 January, 2014
												This is a puzzle game unlike any other
The clay animations are really well done and the whole concept of creating clones to solve puzzles, is a really neat idea
Add in the ability to swap between these clones and things become very interesting
You'll get about 5-7 hours out of this game depending on how good you are with the puzzles
They are varied and challenging in the later stages as you become more comfortable with the gameplay
The atmosphere is really moody, with a full spectrum of white light to pitch darkness
They really do a good job to make you feel like you're in space and completely isolated
The Swapper is a genre defining leap for puzzle platformers
The developers have shown originality and passion, which are the first two things I look for in any game
			
Posted: 1 September, 2015
												The Swapper is a puzzle platform game that was originally released on PC in 2013, and has since been ported to PS3, PS4, Vita, Wii U and the Xbox One
You play the role of a female explorer who finds themselves on an abandoned research station, early into the game you discover the ability to create clones of yourself
This ability is what the game focuses on from then onward
The gameplay in Swapper is absolutely stellar, we see all too many puzzle platformers release on Steam on an almost daily basis that don't really do anything new and innovating, The Swapper blows this theroy out of the water though
The goal in this game is to find orbs scattered around the space station in order to open doors and activate teleporters to progress further
There is some aspect of metroidvania style games in that you do have to backtrack quite a bit too
The cloning ability is what really makes this game standout, you can spawn four clones at any one time, and you also gain the ability to swap control over each of them too
The clones follow every action that the character makes, so running, jumping, interacting with objects (even if there is nothing there to interact with)
This ability allows you to complete plentiful puzzles, opening doors, flipping switches and collecting orbs
The main element which will end up killing the player, as well as the clones, would be gravity
You will soon find that you can barely fall from any sort of distance as it will kill you
You can save yourself by creating a clone just before you hit the floor and teleporting to it though which is a trick you really need to get a hang of very early on
 You can also do this to scale walls and tunnels too
To add a little bit more challenge into the mix, the game also introduces different light sources which prevent you from doing specific actions such as preventing clones from being spawned in the lighted area, blocking the swap ability, or just plainly stopping you doing anything all together
The game presents you with a bare structure of a story line, and you are pretty much left to work it out on your own
There are plenty of snippets of story and plot to be found in the game through terminal computers if you want to delve deeper into it
The Swapper is a gorgeous looking game, playing anything on a 4k resolution should look good, but this game just looks almost photo realistic
 The lighting is perfectly done, adding so much atmosphere into each room you enter
The animation of the main character is also done very well too
As with all puzzle games, I wasn't able to figure out most of the puzzles and had to revert to a walkthrough; after reading the walkthrough there are still points in the game which are skill based, so no matter whether you know how to complete something, you still need to execute a certain level of skill to complete it
I was able to complete The Swapper in just under seven hours, if you were to do it without a guide, you are looking at about a ten hour playthrough
The game does have ten achievements, which are not related to the main story line at all
They are merely hidden computer terminals that you can try to find throughout the game
This may add a little bit of replay value, however if you aren't into achievement hunting, there isn't any reason to play this game through again for a second time
The Swapper had no technical issues at all
The game ran perfectly well on all higher resolutions, at a constant 60FPS
The options menu is rather limited, but this game is in effect a 2D side scroller so you can't really expect too much from the technical side of things
In conclusion, I have to say The Swapper is one of the best puzzle games on Steam to date; and should be played by everyone to experience this masterpiece
This is a showcase of how indie games should be produced and how quickly they can rise to being an extremely popular hit

												The Swapper is a platformer puzzle game with excellent atmosphere using unique visuals, clever puzzles and having only a few minor problems
The graphics have a distinctive look due to the developer's choice of claymation style and the careful use of lighting
 The game feels at times lonely, but not hostile; the player doesn't have to combat roaming creatures like in a Metroidvania game
 Mostly the game consists of exploring the Thesus V space station which is layed out in a clear and thoughful manner
Puzzles are the meat of the game which are solved by cloning yourself and swapping places with the clones
 All clones move in unison with you which forces careful placement and planning to solve each puzzle room
 The last batch of puzzles in the game are deviously clever and had me stumped for hours
 But if I can finish the game without help so can you
There were a few things in the game I didn't care for such as  the sentient beings comment boxes overlaying the entire screen and obscuring the view; only momentary, but annoying
 Also, despite finding several hidden console rooms I unlocked no achievements, and this seems to be a problem for a few other players
I can safely recommend The Swapper to anyone that likes to solve puzzles or wants to explore a non-combative environment at a relaxing pace

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: The Swapper Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi  My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 3-5 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados REVIEWThe Swapper is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative
 The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion
 It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat
 If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you
The entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience
The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest
Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love
The gameplay and the puzzles are far from bad, but they also are nothing special
 As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting
Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry
 That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes
The graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game
But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of The Swapper to life
The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery
If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone)
 The Swapper is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience
It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative

												The Swapper (Puzzle-Adventure)You might have noticed that I did not add 'Platformer' to the genre of the game, despite having this listed as one
 I just can't think of this game as a platfomer
There are no death traps, no enemies to avoid, no coins or baubles to collect


it's simply an adventure game that happens to have some platforms in it
Let me get some of the technical stuff out of the way before I continue
The game is configured to work with both PS and X-360 controllers, if you wish to use one
 You can adjust the sensitivity of both the controller and the mouse, if you're using the keyboard, through the Options menu
 There you can also adjust the screen resolution -- from 640x480 up to 1920x1080 -- the volume, Windowed or Full-screen, etc
 I highly recommend making sure the subtitles are ON whilst you're there -- There is an aspect of the story that I totally would have missed if I'd not had the subtitles on
 If you want to adjust the keyboard settings, it's on the bottom right of the Options screen
So how does the gameplay work?  Well, I can't elaborate on that too much without giving things away, but I will give you what I can without adding spoilers
I do want to mention that there are hidden areas with extra story (via terminals,) which I knew nothing about until I finished the game
 Also, please note that you will get to the point that you realize you are going to have to have Godlike reflexes and tracking abilities to be able to progress in the game


Until you realize that there is a way to slow everything down to a crawl, which will allow you the time you need to get things done
 Incredibly helpful, not to mention necessary, since I don't think *anyone* can react that quickly! Back to the topic at hand, which is the gameplay
 You hold a "swapping" device in your hands that has two abilities: First is the duplicate function
 What this does is create exact replicas of you, and your replica(s) will mimic every move you make
 You can have up to four duplicates at any given time
 If they "die" you can create another to take its place, and when your duplicates touch you, they disappear, allowing you to make another
 Second is the "swapping" beam
 Zap any of your replicas with this beam to have your consciousness transferred to that body
 The swapping beam has one more function, and I mention it only because I got completely stuck, having NO idea you could do this:  If you are in freefall, you can use the beam to "push" yourself through space
The game progresses through a series of puzzles based upon these abilities
 There are obstacles in that the swapping device reacts differently around colored lights
 For instance, you can create a duplicate within red light, but your swapping beam is completely blocked by the red
 The opposite holds true within blue light, and so on
There is one puzzle that requires your bodies to be in exactly the right places (only one that is fiddly that way), one puzzle requires really good timing, and just one had me completely stumped to the point I had to come back to it the next day
 Solving the rest of the puzzles ranged from deceptively easy to, "YES!!  that felt SO good!!"You might think by reading the above that this is just a puzzle game, but no -- this is a true adventure at heart, and so deeply environmental that it really feels as if you're problem-solving like you would any day in real life
 The devs have achieved this immersion through various ways, which I will describe below
The music sets the tone so beautifully, so perfectly, that you don't really notice it at first
 Never distracting, I was more than once surprised to realize that not only was it was there, that it was lovely to listen to, as well
 "Lovely?" you ask, "In an atmospheric psychological horror?"  To that I say, "Absolutely!"  Just go with it, you'll see what I mean when you play
 The voices are done incredibly well, never feeling stilted or out-of-place
And that brings me to the story, that which binds the whole game together in this richly-woven tapestry
 The story progresses in multiple ways
 You will occasionally hear voices ( :O 


No, not that kind of "hearing voices"!) as you progress through the game, and, as mentioned, they are very well done
 Next up are the terminals, which give you snippets of conversations and orders from the command of this place you're in
 Lastly you have the thoughts of


something(s), which I will not give away
When I first saw the graphics, I thought they looked blurry


fuzzy, even
 It's amazing how differently you perceive things when you're actually playing the game yourself, and not just looking at screenshots or a video
 Suffice to say that the graphics contribute to the overall feeling of the game
 Somehow, The Swapper reminds me of John Carpenter's The Thing
 No, there's no parasitic life form trying to assimilate and/or mutilate you, but those feelings


 Cold
 Alone
 Uneasy
 It is all of these and more
This is truly a must-play game for anyone who enjoys a deeply environmental game with a powerful tale to tell


a tale whose full implications I have yet to digest
 Better yet, this is a game that can be enjoyed even more upon subsequent play-throughs


And that is something I will be even more happy to do now that I know I missed some of the content my first time through
Highly recommended!

												The Swapper is an ingenious little puzzle game with a unique gameplay mechanic and eerie plotline that blend together very well
The puzzles all center around a cloning mechanic, where the device the player wields is able project up to 4 clones and also transfer consciousness of the player between them
Certain light wavelengths interfere with the device to add to puzzle complexity (for example, red light blocks transferring the mind of the player to a clone)
The puzzles range from obvious to abstract, with the simplest puzzles at the start of the game
However, later puzzles vary massively in how difficult they are (depending on the player)
Some puzzles may seem obvious to one individual, but will require a lot of trial & error for other players
There was one puzzle in particular that had me stumped for a long time, but upon completing it I realised it was actually quite simple and that many players would probably breeze past it quickly
TS starts with the player finding themself on a seemingly abandoned space station and very slowly introduces a plot which the player can entirely ignore if they see fit
The narrative is interwoven in the game through a few small scenes voiced by a mysterious other astronaut, some terminals with logs to read, and through messages conveyed to the player by rock samples scattered around the station
Quite like Dark Souls, it is up to the player to investigate the story and piece it together, and you are rewarding with a rather intriguing one if you bother
The creepy atmosphere of this game is realised through some quite clever visual and audio tricks
The graphics alone are not very impressive, but the way lighting is used cleverly hides the imperfections and creates a very unique art-style which I adored
The soundtrack comes and goes but always leaves you feeling isolated and alone
Whenever the silence was punctured by speech of the other astronaut, I found I immediately stopped whatever I was doing to lap up all of the audio I could just to find a little solace in the company of someone other than the empty clones
It is the interplay between the art-style, the audio, and the clone mechanic that makes the atmosphere of this game so incredible
If all this wasn't enough, I thought the one single choice you have to make in the entire game was probably one of the most poignant moments in any game I have played
It was incredibly difficult to make and left me with a real lasting impression and that feeling in the pit of my stomach that made me wonder whether the decision was the right one or not
Be warned: this game is meant to be played through in big chunks, shown by an ending that has so much impact if you have been following the plot and really immersing yourself
If you play this game in small portions then the atmosphere, plot and impact will probably not hit as hard
Strap-up, blast off, and lose your sanity amongst the talking rubble and deathly-silent human clones

												"Rusty Lake: Roots" is an entertaining (and cheap!) collection of "locked room" style puzzles that involves not only looking for objects, but also figuring out puzzles and the occasional math equation
The game's imagery (actually, the Rusty Lake series as a whole) might seem a tad weird and convoluted, but in more of an entertaining "Twin Peaks-esque" way than "this is going to give me nightmares"
Aside from looks, the only other thing that I think might turn people away from this game is the length; it'll vary depending on one's problem-solving skills, of course, but expect it to be short, with the only 'replayability' once you solve the final puzzle being the new (as of this Review's posting) Achievements
With that said, personally, I thought the experience lasted just as long as it needed to in order to make a good impression on me
I enjoyed this game's atmosphere, and its ability to present a twisted story without heaps of dialogue
 And in the end, not only do I recommend others giving this a try, I also hope that this won't be the last we see of Rusty Lake

												An amazing little masterpiece! Stylish, puzzling, and creepy, just like all other 'Cube escape' games you can play for free
Only this one is much, much longer (and it is about two times bigger than 'Rusty Lake Hotel'), but still rather very cheap
The only drawback is that the authors cannot put the achievements into Flash engine for some reason
Still, can't recommend it high enough!

												The studio Rusty Lake never fails to deliver
I have played all their games in the past year and I am very happy that they made the big step to steam and purchaseable games
Rusty Lake: Roots is the second game available on steam and it is amazing
At first it seems a bit too easy, but don't worry, this is just to get you started
The puzzles get trickier and more complex
Rusty Lake delivered again! A studio that aims serve their customers well (they fixed a bug within 4 hours after publishing), that offers their games for a very reasonable price, and a studio that obviously loves their creations
I am absolutey amazed by their creative and hard work and I am looking forward to the next adventure!If you like Roots, there's another game on Steam called "Rusty Lake Hotel"
I highly recommend you play this

												Possibly the best simple point & click game I've played
The devs show substantial improvements from their first release, RL: Hotel, and I look forward to seeing more titles set in this universe or otherwise
Fantastic puzzlesDisturbing, engaging & downright good storytelling
More than enough content here to justify price Challenging and worthwhile post-game features
I sincerely hope to see more Rusty Lake in the future

												In a world of half finished games, there are gems like this one out there
They've been making great games for a while and this is no exception
If you like them they also have a bunch of flash games out as well
There's a reason it's so highly rated
It's a point and click puzzling solving, and it has a great story with out having a ton of dialogoue or reading required

												I wasn’t expecting a whole lot after Rusty Lake Hotel
As interesting as the premise and setting were, the strange little puzzle box rooms of irritating brain-teasers didn’t give me much hope
That made it all the more surprising when Rusty Lake: Roots appeared to take all the lessons I had hoped they would from the prior game
It’s not a perfect genesis of the series, but the improvement is so dramatic I think it makes Rusty Lake Hotel a stronger recommendation by association
The year is 1860 and James Vanderboom has just inherited a house from his late uncle
Arriving in the spring, he finds a seed and a note with instructions to plant and tend to it as he looks after the estate
From this humble beginning blooms the tale of the cursed Vanderboom family, tracing the lives of three generations of unfortunate souls
As their lives take their tragic turns, the story weaves everything back to that original seed and their unifying curse, and ultimately one of the dark secrets of Rusty Lake
Much like the previous game, Roots is heavily steeped in the macabre
None of the people whom you guide through these stories will meet kind ends, and many will suffer significant agonies before their lives are allowed to end
It’s not as gory or gormless as its precursor though, and does a much better job of living up to the macabre label
Most of the horror here comes from witnessing the inevitable, from seeing a scene build to an obvious tragedy and being powerless to stop it
Some of the best plotlines here involve lost children or love triangles that give the sinister events a more grounded base
The drama unfolds in short vignettes, arranged chronologically along the lifelines of the players in question
These vignettes are single scrollable scenes which contain a handful of puzzles to solve in the course of reaching a generally obvious result
It might be as charming as getting a gentleman to propose to a lady, as painful as sending a young man off to war, or as nefarious as dropping a young boy down a well
Scenes should take about 10-15 minutes to complete, during which you’ll uncover more clues to the overarching mystery and perhaps a few hints as to the nature of Rusty Lake itself
The big improvement here for me is the quality of the puzzles, which are all far more sensical and thematically consistent than those in Hotel
Having single scenes focused around a central puzzle or puzzles helps limit potential flailing and allows each puzzle to do more in service to the story
I only found myself stumped in a few places, and this time I didn’t feel like it was because the puzzles were badly designed
Everything had a purpose and a logic to it, and that gave the game a more cohesive feel overall
The only aspect I found weaker this time was the ending, unfortunately enough
By the third generation of characters it should be clear what the ultimate goal of the game is, and when you reach the end it just kinda happens and then fades to black
There’s no real revelation aside from the immediate result of your actions, and it falls a lot flatter than the insane reveals at the end of Hotel
I did play through the New Game+ style continuation to see the secret ending and while I liked that one more, it still didn’t do much to satisfy my curiosities
While there are obviously links between Rusty Lake Hotel and Roots, they’re minor enough that you wouldn’t miss much by skipping Hotel
It’s unfortunate the story doesn’t take more advantage of the otherworldly weirdness of its predecessor but Roots is a strong enough game to stand on its own and command your attention for a few hours
The disturbing scenes and thematic puzzles do an excellent job of gripping the player as they uncover the secrets of this sad family, and only fail to completely pay off at the very end
As long as you’re not expecting something mind-blowing in the conclusion, though, this one definitely succeeds where Rusty Lake Hotel stumbled

												If you're looking for a game with brain-burning, story-based puzzles, this is not the game for you
However, if you like "room escape" type games, this is a very good one
The puzzles are clear (you may not know WHY you're doing something, but WHAT you have to do is easy to decipher) and varied, ranging from moving sliders and pushing buttons to some simple logic problems; the game overall is on the "easy" side
However, I think the main puzzle the game is really  putting together the pieces of the story, and that's where the game shines: its eerie atmosphere, macabre humour, and interesting (and non-explicit) narrative that had me finish it all in one sitting
I think this game is an improvement over Rusty Lake Hotel (which also has its positivies), and I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this dev in the future!

												Super twisted horror story
 Has a nice indie feel about it
Be prepared to do lots of puzzles of sorts
I wouldn't say it's a hard game the puzzles are challenging enough to keep you interested but also not to the point where you just want to break the screen
Loved the eeriness of it all
Would recommend for people who enjoy puzzles and like twisted stories

												Pony Island is an interesting game
Levels are a bit repetitive at first
Eventually you get powerups
After that, it gets more interesting
Some of the levels get pretty tricky
Early on, all you can do is jump
Hovering is added a bit later
Enemies come at you every few seconds
Left mouse button to jump over obstacles
Push enemies away with right mouse button
Make it to the flagpole and you can advance
Every so often you get a "Puzzle Break"It's kind of like a programming puzzle
A butterfly is trying to get to its house
Moving arrows around defines a route
The butterfly follows the arrows
Reach the house to advance
Anybody can learn this game
Please give it a try
Play it right now

												I can't review this game without spoilering, so here is just a recommendation for it
Sorry, folks!I enjoyed it, but found it in parts a bit difficult
It's a great mix of brain-teaser and dexterity game, embedded in a plot you unveil during the game
You will spend a great deal of the game playing an increasingly difficult series of levels where you must jump over obstacles and shoot enemies in a 2D setting, going automatically from left to right
So if you enjoyed the Bit
Trip
Runner games you will enjoy this
Length of the game: 2-4 hours for 100 percent
Recommended: When on sale for 2
50€ or less

												Look, I've played my fair share of retro 2D style, pixel graphics-esque indie horror games like Lone Survivor, The Final Station, Claire, Uncanny Valley, Home, Reveal the Deep, Settled, The Last Door, etc
Distraint… doesn’t live up to the “Overwhelmingly Positive” review
I have no qualms about the graphics, sound, atmosphere, or puzzles—they were decent
My issue with this game was THE PLOT
The plot was laughably cliché, the characters were one-dimensional caricatures with no emotional depth, and the symbolism was heavyfisted
Stories that focus on the protagonist’s guilt and horrific manifestations of said guilt actually require the protagonist to have actually DONE something guilt-worthy
Like killing their wife
Stealing from an elderly couple in order to survive only to find that they have died of starvation the next day
… Working for the IRS doesn’t constitute as a soul-crushingly guilty action
It’s a JOB
If my landlord kicks me out because I can’t pay the rent, is he a morally-deprived landlord? Hell no, it’s just business
Same logic applies in this game
Just because Price is the harbinger of bad news doesn’t mean he has to shoulder the personal burden of evicting the residents out of their apartments to the point where blood-smeared elephants are chasing him through endless hallways
The moral of this game is that GREED = BAD
Yet Price wasn’t greedy—he was trying to make a decent living
He’s clearly very poor, judging from the decrepit state of his apartment from the ruined kitchen to the leaks in his ceiling
His parents are dead, despite the fact Price is in his 20-30’s
He’s an underdog, trying to survive in a tough world—and he immediately gets lambasted for pursuing the most unpopular career known to mankind
Sorry, but someone has to do it

What goes around comes around


Indie horror market was rich in production for the last couple of years, and DISTRAINT was among its presents to us lucky horror gamers
As being Jesse Makkonen's second game so far - yup, a one man made wonder here - it's been completed in 3 months as a challenge
With this astounding time and labor limit, I must say that the result is praiseworthy
The game is short, strikingly disturbing and symbolic with a plot so ordinary, you'd wonder how it came to be found worthy enough to tell as a story
Yet, this simplicity bears the beauty of it all
I personally enjoyed every second of it, and would gladly recommend taking on this 2 hours journey, if you enjoy horror settings and subconscious symbolisms
The name of the game comes to be quite self-explanatory actually
You play as a young and ambitious man named Price, who has been trying to gain partnership from a famous company
He is not a bad guy really, but he bears the burden of choosing one of the least favorable career paths known to humanity: poor little Price is a sequestrator, and he is responsible of seizing people's properties when they cannot pay their debts
As the game starts, our first task is to distrain an old lady's home
Since Mrs
Goodwin's husband is long dead, and she doesn't have much favorable assets in the pragmatic sense, a heartbreaking end awaits her, and poor little Price is tasked with arranging that end
The moment he delivers the news, his guilt begins to take root and this guilt starts to manifest as strikingly gruesome hallucinations
As the game progresses, Price realizes that he indeed sold his humanity rather cheap
Now this game has been somewhat criticized in the community, that collecting debts shouldn't be considered evil since it’s just a job, you know, not the mother of all evil
Thus, business shouldn't be the cause of guilt and a crippled conscience
Right? Now, this is an ethical debate and it is the exact kind of question this game wishes for you to ask yourselves
This context of business is the perfect cover for the proverbial elephant in the room: - which you'll literally encounter more than once in the game - if a deed could be pragmatically indorsed and lawfully justified at the same time, the substance of the action or its end result doesn't reach our conscience
Business is business nonetheless
The narrative and symbolism within the game are quite basic, simplistic even
Yet, they criticize this specific self-justification very successfully
If an action is deemed just, it doesn't also necessarily be considered good or kind
For a 2D scroller horror adventure, character and environment design within the game are really well elaborated
There is a certain sense of desolateness in all places, a neglect and a darkness
Subtle symbolisms of small sceneries are well-woven
Cute, bubble headed character designs used in especially gory displays throughout the game really startle you
As another huge display quality, both the soundtrack and the sound effects are masterfully arranged and utilized to enhance the atmosphere furthermore, even inducing a couple jump scares
The game pace is a mostly low growing adventure, with simple puzzles and a couple of timing actions with no actual threat to you character at all
The whole experience wraps up within 2 hours, and casual Twin Peaks references are a nice bonus
Now that DISTRAINT 2 is already announced to come for this winter, I can sincerely recommend this short experience for a silent night
It might be considered a bit expensive for the full price, with this short of a completion time, so the next sale would be as grand as any to try
I congratulate Jessi Makkonen to go under this feat and present us the subconscious of poor little Price

												First off, I wanna say, props to Jesse for putting this together in 3 months
 It's obvious a lot of work went into the game, and it's awesome that he was able to get it completed
 This game is, artistically, beautiful
 I absolutely HATE retro graphic, 2D side scrollers, but this one really changed my mind
 The music and sound effects were amazing, the characters were well drawn and had neat swaying motions
 The game looks nice
 But it does not play nice
 No, no
 This game is slow and a snooze-fest
 The 'puzzles' aren't puzzles
 You walk from point A to point B to point C, back to point B, and then maybe over to point D
 There isn't really a whole lot of logic involved in these puzzles
 The hitboxes for selection can also be wonky at times, so you can easily skip over certain action items
 Act 3, I had to actually use a guide, since there is no map/point of reference to where you've been
 You just wander aimlessly and go down a memory checklist, hoping you are going in the correct direction
 Price also moves at a snail's pace
 It's fine at first, because you get to see the art, but during segments like I have described above, it makes the game about twice as long as it needs to be (my playtime was idle, I spent an hour 15 actually playing)
 It just gets dull, and the story needs to move along
 The writing is absolutely horrendous
 The other negative reviewers hit the nail on the head
 The story reads like an edgy highschooler's emo diary
 It's trying to make some deep statement against 'the man' and how debt collection is somehow inherently evil (???)
 Isn't it just as evil to NOT pay your debts?  Yea, moral relativism is a pain, I know
 Also, it seems that Jesse couldn't decide on a tone for the game
 Price goes from "I'm so sorry madam


" and "I'm an evil whippersnapper" to "[Expletive]!" "[Expletive]!" "[Expletive]!" at random times
 It is just all over the place
 There are weird drug-induced mushroom castles one moment and blood covered walls the next
 I did like the creepy ambiance that the game provided though, I am not a big horror buff, so I did jump a few times
 All this said, the game was 99 cents, and it WAS an experience
 I do not believe that it is a good game, by any definition of the word, and the Overwhelmingly Positive review is mind boggling to me
 If you wanna blow an hour and play a poorly written, yet pretty game, then DISTRAINT is for you
 I do not regret purchasing it
 However, I do not feel like I would recommend it
Edit:  Removed unnecessary vitriol towards people who did enjoy the game

												DISTRAINT+ Stylish pixel art graphics whose perpetual darkness mask their simplicity
+ Varied soundtrack is highly atmospheric
+ Compelling premise of self-destructive regrets
-  Lacks cohesive integration of real and surreal elements
-  Quite short
A modest but oddly compelling adventure steeped in perpetual darkness, the surreal side-scrolling Distraint is a low-cost exploration of the high price of selling one’s soul

												Looking at the Distraint Steam page, it looks like a cute little horror game that maybe has some cute scares worth checking out, so that's what I did
What I experienced was a blood-pumping, dark, thrilling, serious-themed game that surely caught me off-guard until it's ending
In Distraint, you play as a young man called Mr
Price, who has been promised a job promotion, but first he has to kick some people out of their houses due to the lack of rent payment (because that's his job)
This is the whole concept of Distraint
Sounds simple and not engaging at all? It may be, until we realize that the game is not just about kicking people out of their houses, it's about the guilt of Mr
Price for ruining the lives of other people, just for his wage at the end of the month
Taking a trip through Mr
Price's mind resulted in what can be one of my favorite horror titles in recent years
The bobble head looking characters with little arms and legs do make you judge the game prematurely and they do take a bit of time to get used to
I didn't even care about it when I got engaged into the story, it's really a good one
I absolutely love the retro look of the game, which reminded me of other indie horror titles like Home, Claire and Lone Survivor
Like those games, the gameplay is fairly simple
You explore 2D environments, you find an item, and you put the item where it should be or give it to someone
It's pretty much a stripped down Point & Click game focusing mainly on story with no difficult puzzles, only quick and simple ones
The visuals aren't definitely what made this game so good
Story elements aside, it was the sound effects and soundtrack
My goodness, I can't praise the audio in this game enough
It's what got me anxious of what was on the other side of the doorways
The most atmospheric and tense sections of the game always had the help of an engaging soundtrack
The camera even zooms in and out sometimes automatically to make you feel tense and insecure, since you do not know what's behind you at all
It's one of those games where most story elements don't make sense at all, but as you progress the bigger picture starts to reveal itself before you, and suddenly everything makes sense
The writing and story as I've mentioned is superb, and it's safe to say Distraint has one of the darkest endings I've experienced in video games yet
Players can complete the game in just 2 hours, so paying 5€ may cause hesitation, but it is definitely a good price
I got it in a bundle and it was totally worth the price I paid
At last but not least, quick shout out to the developer for having a great taste in music as shown in the credits! 8

												this game has something to tell to us, so listen			
Posted: 20 April
												Distraint is a very solid Horror Adventure game that one can complete in about 2 hours
I'll list some positives and negatives
Pros - Great atmosphere
Good choice of music and sound effects
A pretty well realised story
Cons - A few grammar mistakes I noticed
Nothing too drastic but I saw at least 3 that made me pause and go


did I read that wrong, or


no it just is wrong
It's a lil on the short side but then again I think it doesn't overstay its welcome
Maybe it's just me but the anti-capitalist theme felt a bit heavy-handed
It was very clearly the point of the story but to have the main character be named Price, the lovely lady be called Goodwin and one of your bosses be named Moore
Like we get it, it's about greed! Some dialogue gave me that same impression too
But hey, I guess it really cared to get its point across
Besides, I imagine the dev speaks English as a second language as he's Finnish, so I can definitely excuse a bit of heavy-handedness
It just made me laugh a bit when I feel like it was meant to be tense or impactful
Anyway, very high quality game especially considering it's a one-man team
Props to Jesse Makkonen, I see him respond to the community and he seems like a great dude
Keep making games!I give Distraint a 7
5/10

												DISTRAINT is actually surprisingly good, like no joke I'm surprised by how good it is
In DISTRAINT you play as Price, he works for a company which deals with real estate and you evict people from their homes when they can't pay the price to live there
As the game goes on you lose your sanity and the world around you becomes more twisted as the game goes on
DISTRAINT isn't a jump scare fest and relies more on psychology to freak you out
It does that with freaky imagery, fantastic atmosphere and a really intriguing story to boot
DISTRAINT at it's core is an adventure game
You can't actually die in this game all you do is explore and solve puzzles and some of them are quite smart, but there is one puzzle I dislike and that's the drug one in the last section of the game
The pixel art style is absolutely amazing, everything looks detailed and most of the environments are absolutely beautiful
It's one of my favorite aspects of this game
The games audio is also incredibly well designed, it helps build atmosphere in some sections of the game and in general it's absolutely fantastic
Now I do have some negative aspects I'd like to address:One of the main things I really disliked was some of the item placements, which it took quite some time getting, because they're placed in some really bizarre locations
Some of the puzzles are kind of confusing as well, especially in the final chapters of the game
The game's puzzles up till the final chapter are sort of easy, but the chapter in the hospital had the probably the worst puzzle design
But the drug puzzle takes the cake as the worst puzzle, as the layout of the map and the entire puzzle is quite frustrating, but you understand it soon enough
The game is also short
It's possible to finish the game a 100% with every achievement in 2 hours
After the first playthrough there's no replay value whatsoever as the game only has one ending
Overall DISTRAINT is actually a really surprising game
It succeeds as a horror game and freaked me out and kept me intrigued to keep playing to see how the entire wraps up
Even with a few bad puzzles I loved my time with this game, not to mention I got this game for free, but I would have gladly bought it
I also can't wait for DISTRAINT 2 this year
So if you like horror games check this game out
Final Rating:8/10Pros:+ Intriguing Plot+ Great Art Style+ Amazing sound designCons:- The last few puzzles are poorly designed- ShortCheck out this review over at https://www

												Horror, blood, elephant, 2D pixel's graphic and a cup of cofee
Money rule the world and feelings are buried under the ground
But, only with money, you will be never fully happy and you will never give a true sense to your life



This short story is more than a game
This is actually a full morale lesson for everyone that will play this game in the correct way
Don't buy this game if you want just to have fun or relax, buy this game because you really want it and you are really intrested in the hidden messages inside of it; because with this game you will learn again to:- Keep a promise- Think twice about your decisions- Don't be greedy- Money don't give you happiness and completeness in this worldThe game is a 2D based "adventure" where you play the role of a worker for a expropriations agency
The gameplay itself is pretty much linear with several puzzles in all the situations
There will be only one way to play but I really suggest to play this game twice not only for the hidden achivements but to understand better the story itself
The choice of the music is really sweet and helps a lot to transmit feelings to the player
It will even give you the chills during the "horror" parts
Graphically don't expect a lot of "sweet effects" but the choice of the colors and the "noir" style gives a quite good look to the narration
You can play this game both with keyboard or a 360 XboX controller
In the end: for being a game made from a single person with the help of his wife this is a quite amazing experience
Again, as I said in the beginning, do not buy this game if you are simply looking for fun or you will never fully enjoy this game

For any potential Customer out there, look for Reviews that don't focus on the ending - which will be hard given the Majority of negative Reviews focus on it
It's controversial given the fact that it can be interpret in many ways and many people missed some clues/hints, making them think the wrong thing
I mentioned it before because I am legit annoyed at the fact that people review a game badly because they didnt like the ending
PRO- Most of the Characters are well written
- The game is always 2 steps ahead of you
- No seriously the amount of Plot-twists will change the way you think about cases
- Art + Music is p gud
NEUTRAL- It is not recommended to play the game as the first Danganronpa Game as it references the first one heavily, and the second one more lightly - However it wont stop your enjoyment of the game for around 90% of it
If you are looking for an order on how to approach the series, I'd recommend: DR1 -> DR2 -> DR3(Anime) -> DRV3
- The game can hook you pretty badly
What this means is that it's time consuming, and, if you dont have enough self-control, might start feeling like a chore to play
If you start investigating, you dont wanna end because you dont wanna leave on a cliffhanger - then you cant end on the trial itself, because you wanna know who done it
That's how you spend 4-5 hours in a session
- It reuses the Danganronpa formular
As expected
Some people find that annoying or boring while others don't mind it
This only affects you if this isnt your first rodeo
CONS- The price
The game is excellent, however 60 Bucks for it are kinda on the limit for me
The game has an average time of around 40~ Hours to complete + has content that you MIGHT wanna check-out after that
- The port isn't the greatest
The Team is patching the Issues slowly, however there are still some problems - like Fullscreen being problematic, sometimes inputs not being registered or slight FPS drops
Overall the Game is fantastic, and Id go so far as to rate it the best in the entire Series
It ironed out some kinks and issues of the last few and had new fantastic twists to go with it

												You should play the two first games (Trigger Happy Havoc and Danganronpa 2) before playing this because this game contains major spoilers for the first two games
If you've enjoyed the first two games, then you should like this new installment for the most part
Gameplay is the same - people get murdered, you investigate crime scenes, and solve them in a class trial
Now as for the overall story, I won't mention any plot details, it's better you go into this game blind and judge for yourself
However in my opinion, although I enjoyed this game, the 1st Danganronpa (Trigger Happy Havoc) is still the best overall
P
S
If you're playing on Steam/PC and using a keyboard/mouse, make sure you launch the Configuration Tool to select the keyboard layout before launching the main game (you can't switch in-game)

												+ Awesome opening to draw you in+ Nice art-style+ Touching Story+ Free- Short- Easy to get stuckIt is a nice click & puzzle game which was translated
It is short however the length comes from how quickly you search the forums when stuck or if to give your brain a challenge
Some puzzles are hard, others are easy to figure out, I was stuck at first until I found out your bottom menu affected what happens when you click certain things when other items are conencted, this may turn people off but it is easy to get used to
However this makes it a game breaker as if you are easily annoyed then you will most likely rage-quit after each new step
It is free, give it a go
The story is nice once you understand it but could not help but see Len as the main dude here

"I only grant wishes
The outcomes are none of my concern
"The little mermaid had to pay the price, and so does Iva
It's a story about two close siblings (perhaps even too close, I can't surely tell)
You play the brother with torn up memories and your mission in this little game is to dig them up
Whether or not they're to your liking, you have to remember in order to progress
The puzzles aren't easy, you have to collect clues and combine them
There's a right amount of horror, I got flashbacks from "Mad Father" and "Ib"
It's a short little game with a good artwork
Worth to give it a play, imho

												Great music!Good graphic!The story is


well, the final achievement will tell the feeling

Posted: 25 December, 2016
												PRICE is a short puzzle game that drags you in from the start
You can't help but come up with your own theories about the story as it is slowly unveiled through each clue and item found
The ending, which is a perfect example of the writing principle of "show, don't tell", doesn't disappoint; and rather than relying on jumpscares and the like, the horror element is built through creepy ambience and the mysterious story
The lovely art and swift animations add even more to an already excellent game, and though the English translation presents a few grammar issues at times, it's nothing that may disrupt your experience
Definitely recommend it

												Wow
I only finished this in about an hour and it's free
Had a little difficulty solving maybe like one or two puzzles, but the music, art, and story are just amazing
I really feel for this game
Now that I've completed both parts of the game, I wouldn't mind doing it again just to hear the story again
Granted, I could just look it up on youtube, but where is the fun in that? I definitely recommend it if you're the type to be into heartfelt stories
			
Posted: 15 July
												Easy 100% and honestly not bad at all!Thumbs up to devs!!!			
Posted: 16 September, 2016
												The music is pretty nice and the art and the story are okay
The real issue with this game lies with the puzzles wherein it fails in almost every aspect
1) You have to click on objects in order to discover new items
But some objects have more points which can be clicked on
This, however, you cannot see
For example the fireplace
You think you interacted with the object but in truth it has another hidden thing
2) Item usage is very unnatural
You always have an item from your inventory selected
You can inspect an object
But if you suspect there are other things you can do with it, you just have to cycle through your inventory
It would have been better you just select and item from your inventory and click on the object like in normal point and click adventures
3) Certain objects only become interactable after a certain event (like with the closet)
It doesn't really make any sense
4) Certain puzzles (and clues) are too far fetched
For example, it's illogical you cannot combine the key
Instead you have to combine some (weird) clues before you can use the key
I would say the puzzle aspect is pretty mediocre
Because this is the core of the game I cannot recommend it

												PRICE uses puzzle and adventure game mechanics to piece together a short story that doesn’t outstay its welcome
This is split into piecing together memories and using items on objects
This short free to play game excels in its gothic, creepy and ominous feel through the artwork, sound and story
You know that that something isn’t quite right…
The artwork is good with an anime influence that looks more handrawn or classically styled
I suggest you take your time with all the information you are given to put together this compelling story
The music and sound is also a very notable The opening theme tune for the game is very catchy and the haunting singing, classical sounding pieces and appropriate sound effects are fitting choices
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=774536854Some of this playtime is from being away
I also personally experienced technical issues with this game
I encountered scripting errors, freezing and black screens but I felt that this game was worth completing
After another install I finally managed played the whole game through with no issues
After completing this I felt that that some of this game might be obtuse for players who aren’t so familiar with adventure/puzzle mechanics and thinking
I checked the hub and there is guides available if you are stuck
Despite my two issues this is a great, quality free to play game
All the achievements are straight forward if you just play through the whole game naturally and complete it

Though there are some new interesting gameplay improvements (some slightly more in-depth building and combat) that fit the Telltale format nicely

												TellTale have really done it now! I'm really satisfied on how TellTale have done season two! Season one was good, but I love how TellTale have actually taken their time to perfect this game
Totally recommend this game if you haven't played the first season of Minecraft Story Mode
			
Posted: 28 August
												UPDATE FOR EPISODE 3 RELEASE:Okay, yeah
This is the first time I've encountered a choice in a Telltale game and had to sit there for a few minutes and really think about it
The intensity just keeps ramping up here! I really enjoy the writing in this season a lot more compared to the first
The first season was a good character building chapter to enjoy, but now that all the characters are fleshed out, they can be thrown around into all sorts of scenarios
It's only getting better! Love it
---Original review below---Only played the first two episodes so far and I'm thoroughly enjoying it
Love the new combat system and the cinematic choice mechanics that have been added
Crowd Play is also pretty fun!Only problems I can say is that I miss the original voice actor for Olivia, it's almost as if they didn't even try to get someone that sounded similar at all
And the voice animations seems kinda janky at times
But back to the good stuff, the new characters are awesome and I have to say, the antagonist of this is the best one yet! Really excited to ride this story out
If you're a fan of the first one, be willing to accept a little change
			
Posted: 2 August
												Great improvements on the first game with a slightly altered UI during selection, fighting requires more strategy now that you have limited stamina, and can roll and such

I recommend Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two to anyone who enjoys serious fantasy stories that feature funny, memorable characters
Excuse me for having an opinion, but I really enjoyed Season Two so far
I realize there are many people who would rather play a different Season Two, but this is the sequel Telltale chose and it deserves proper criticism
I assume anyone interested in buying this game already knows what Season One was like, so I base my review on improvements upon the original game and how enjoyable I feel it is
TL;DR huge improvements
Improved visualsImproved audioImproved battle systemBetter balance between comedy and plotThe general quality of animations has been improved greatly, haven't noticed anything as stiff as Axel from Season 1
The camera work and scene transitions are better now, didn't notice any sound being cut off unless I hurried up the scene
Better voice actors have been hired for a few (main) characters
I don't know if choices make a big difference in future episodes, but there are definitely still alternate routes within the same episode
One thing I really liked in Season 1 was the addition of proper dynamic battle controls
Unfortunately they were pretty basic and barely ever used
They have been improved in Season 2 however:They are used more frequently
You must predict what your opponent's next move is going to be and time your defense right
Evade the attack by either backing away or dodging to the side, depending on what's required of you to do
There's even a fun boss fight at the end of episode 1 where you need to get a bit creative
I definitely want to see more of this
Another thing I appreciate is the balance between comedy and plot
Season 1's emotional balance had some problems, Reuben's death being the most infamous example
This changed in Season 2
While there are of course still hilarious scenes (like fighting your way through Stella's) and I love the humor, the mood can turn serious in a heart beat, and in a good way
I'm talking about your relationship with Petra and Jack Morrison here
Jesse and their friends don't have petty arguments anymore, either
If they do argue, it's either lighthearted or serious, but never annoying
Excuse me for having an opinion, but I really enjoyed Season Two so far
I hope Telltale keeps up the quality in future episodes

												Resident Evil 7 is the fantastic entry in the legendary franchise that's been around for the past 21 years
To be more specific, Resident Evil 7 is the franchise's return to its survival horror roots, but rather than sticking to the typical third person view, it's first person
Though this isn't the first time this was done in the overall franchise, it is the first and successful attempt with a main franchise entry
Despite being an old school Resident Evil fan, I must say the use of FPV was a brilliant move by the game's creators due to the fact that it leads to better immersion and an overall heightened sense of fear when playing through the game
In Resident Evil 7 you mainly play as Ethan Winters, an average joe looking for his missing wife in a derelict Louisiana mansion
In searching for his wife, Ethan stumbles upon a family of murderous psychopaths and other ghastly monstrosities that he never would've expected to deal with
In attempting to escape in one piece, he discovers what caused this hellish situation to come about
What's great about Resident Evil 7 is that it doesn't shy away from showcasing its gruesomeness, everything is intensely graphic and up close right from the start
Resident Evil 7 is a highly detailed game, just about everything you see is lifelike, interactive, and in general well done
To be more specific, for a short period of time you are granted the use of an axe and swinging it against certain objects will lead to it being momentarily stuck
Another instance that showcases great attention to detail is during the numerous fierce moments of combat encountered in the game
It's not surprising at all to shoot at an enemy and see blood/guts fly around, but seeing these fluids/matter splatter onto your weapon/arm and stay there for a brief period of time, that was truly eye opening
Even something as simple as the main character resting his hands on a wall/pillar near him during gameplay reveals the attention to detail found in this game
It may be a silly thing to bring up, but I also love the fact that despite the FPV you are able to see so much of Ethan
It isn't always noticeable, but there are moments in the game where you can see Ethan's feet, legs, and torso
I bring this up because it's a pet peeve of mine to play an FPS that doesn't show anything at all as you're walking or standing, it's limiting and robs you of total immersion
I'm not totally sure, but if I had to guess as to why this was done, it was for the benefit of PSVR users
Besides that, the extra body parts that are seen can be used to convey body language that isn't always utilized in an FPV game
There were many moments in this game where dim or even no lighting was used to manipulate the player's emotions
As you play through this game you eventually reach a point where you're ready for anything, especially when walking through a dark area
I found myself in many situations where I'd walk slowly anticipating an enemy to strike, but nothing happened at all
I guess you can say that the fear/expectation of something was just as frightening if not more frightening than the actual enemy encounters
It was when I least expected it that enemies would strike and it was a great way for the creators of this game to keep you in a constant state of discomfort/fear
Resident Evil 7 didn't just stick to jump scares to frighten the player, it was done in very calculated ways
For example, it was a normal occurrence in this game to be overwhelmed by enemies and you'd have to run away to be able to safely reload your weapon, but this wasn't always possible
In one instance I was confidently running towards an open door because I knew I'd encounter no enemies, having already been through there, but as I approached the door an enemy jumped out of nowhere
Despite being initially frightened by the sudden appearance of this enemy, I later realized that this brief interaction was well done
In its game design Resident Evil 7 has numerous features from the classic Resident Evil games that series veterans will immediately notice
Initially, the areas in Resident Evil 7 feel really distant from one another, but as you advance through the game, shortcuts will reveal just how overlapping these areas are
Another throwback Resident Evil feature is the use of item boxes and having to juggle what you carry or even having to waste bullets just to make space
Despite being an overall hassle, the inclusion of the item box/item juggling is certain to bring back fond memories
Despite having immensely enjoyed Resident Evil 7, I wouldn't say it's a perfect game
I've previously mentioned that this game is well done, but that's not 100% true
It's nice that there are numerous puzzles in this game, but a few of them are lazily used more than once and they're generally not that challenging
Resident Evil veterans will easily go through these puzzles, the series has offered more of a challenge in the past
Besides that, there are also moments of stagnation in this game
Though this could also be said of the highly praised Resident Evil 1, the main house feels a bit empty for long stretches of time and during these moments you are mainly hunting for items from room to room
I was eventually bored of this and wanted something to happen
I really enjoyed the combat in Resident Evil 7 and it offered a great deal of variety with the weapons that were offered
From the game's beginning you'll mainly use a handgun plus a knife, but as the game progresses you'll eventually get to use a magnum, a flamethrower,  a shotgun, a grenade launcher, remote bombs, and a machine gun
The weapons variety is a good asset in this game because it offers different playstyles so if for some reason you dislike one weapon, you can always rely on another
 For the most part, the combat/boss battles in Resident Evil 7 are neither easy nor hard, but challenging in an entertaining way
You generally know what to do when it comes to defeating one of the few bosses in this game, but that doesn't prevent you from dying
You can easily expect to die once or twice per boss battles until you learn their patterns/weaknesses, it's not that big of a deal
This is mostly attributed to having to be very precise with your aiming in hectic situations
The enemies in Resident Evil 7 were designed in such a way that being shot in specific parts of the body will lead to certain reactions
As a result, you'll mainly want to dish out as many headshots as possible, but it isn't always doable
Maybe it's because I played this game with an Xbox 360 controller, but this was highly noticeable with one of the many handguns used in this game
The recoil was a hassle to deal with at times because after every shot you had to readjust your aim to maximize the damage you dealt
 Though the combat was fun, at times it also got to be a bit repetitive
The main enemies in this game are visually well designed and there are three variants, but at one point it got old fighting the same looking enemies over and over again
At the same time, I feel as if the main humanoid enemy wasn't too original, I was constantly reminded of previously used enemies from other Resident Evil games
At least with the classic Resident Evil games the zombie models offered a decent amount of variety and there was much more to deal with as you progressed through the game
 Overall, I truly enjoyed Resident 7
The story was good and it goes beyond what it initially appears to be, but towards the end it felt hastily thrown together and a bit disjointed
It was a great entry in a series that has lost its way over the years and I appreciated that
It wasn't a perfect game, but what it offered was highly entertaining
I give Resident Evil 7 a 4
75/5 and I highly recommend it

												My god

Capcom did it
They saved the franchise
I'm honestly shocked
When the first teaser dropped I thought for sure this would just be a P
T
copy which I was sort of okay with
Turns out I was wrong
This is a classic Resident Evil game
Like, RE1 classic
Complete with puzzle solving, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, and tense stressful boss encounters
The game brings back the storage box system even! I can't stress enough how amazing this game is as a long time RE fan
If you're one too, do yourself a favor and pull the trigger on this one
Best game since RE4



May even be better
			
Posted: 31 May
												PROS:-Good balance between dangerous areas to move through and safe areas where you can focus on other goals-This is especially important for me because I'm terrible at getting around enemies (I can't play Outlast) but games with almost no real danger can get boring quickly
This game is PERFECT
-Good story
Good pacing
Made me want to figure out what the hell's going on
-Nothing repetitive-The illusion of choice
Cruel reality
-The first horror game I ever bought was Amnesia; The Dark Descent and ever since I've been waiting for something to match it
This might actually be better
CONS: -I honestly don't know
-You can't jump

												Resident Evil 7 didn't lie about it "returning to the roots"
The aura of the original Resident Evil is everywhere in this game, plus it doesn't shine away from the classic fans pondering with reenactment of some memorable moments from the first game
First of all - this is a game
Not a walking simulator, as some people thought it would be
It's 100% a game and the gameplay is wonderful
Gunplay is very satisfying
Resources are incredibly limited (played on the Madhouse right away) and enemies are fast and can catch up to you even if you are running
Since this is a "classic" RE - killing is optional unless it's a boss
You can run and dodge past everything
Even on the Madhouse
On the other hand - you can try and kill everything in sight as well, as long as you are precise with your shots and utilize the knife when needed (once again, just like the classics)
The knife
Oh the knife
Because of how limited the ammo is - I spent a lot of time dodging the enemies and stabbing them with the knife
Unlike classics, here it's actually useful while still being vastly inferior to the guns (hello 4-6 with overpowered melee)
What I also liked is the "dodging"
No, there's no dodge mechanic a la RE3
It's all done by moving and crouching (also there's a block)
But attacks of the enemies are telegraphed perfectly, so you can always dodge out of their way if you pay attention and it feels really good to dodge a devastating attack not by pressing a promt that appears on the screen or performing an I-frames move, but by doing it yourself with the controls that are used constantly outside of combat as well
Also fantastic bosses, but I'll keep quiet about them
I really-really enjoyed gameplay in this game
Design wise this game shines as well
As this is a classic RE - a lot of backtracking is to be expected, but it's implemented so perfectly that you don't even feel like it's a backtracking
There's constantly something new in the old locations
They change their looks
Enemies appear / disappear
With newfound keys you can get a whole different perspective at navigating trough the locations
If to talk about aesthetics - enemies are very frightening and disgusting
I jumped at several occasions from the combination of their looks and how they move
Graphical fidelity is also outstanding, but all female characters gave me uncanny valley feeling
Male characters looked great, so I don't know why is that
The "scare" factor
This game is frightening, but not all the time
The "horror" genre it delivers constantly shifts in tone
It can be at times atmospheric and fill you with dread
Or it can turn into a b style slasher movie with lots of gore and other disgusting factors like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre from which the game obviously took a lot of inspiration for some scenes and designs
The game also often tries to light itself up with ridiculous factor
There are several scenes that should be scary, but they are purposfully presented in such way that you start laughing and having fun
Also some of the enemies are blatanly playing with you for their own amusement
Shock factor is done really great here
But when the game wants to be dark - it delivers
Some performances by the actors and associated scenes forced me to take a short break
I'm still not entirely "happy" that I watched the "Happy Birthday" videotape
About tapes - before the release I thought that they would be a big deal and I also heard that we would be able to do some things in the tapes that would change the present, but there's no such thing
There's very little amount of tapes (four) and all but one are completely optional
They give some insight on the characters and past events
Some of them would make more sense after the ending, but they are not as big of a deal as I was led to believe
Just if the tapes were a factor for anyone out there
They are neat little things, but the emphasis is on "little"
Story is great and nicely ties everything together
It also rewards those who paid close attention, because a lot of stuff can be figured out with deduction and memory
Since none of the Resident Evil games ever had any sort of good story - I would go as far as saying this is the best RE game story-wise
They were all B-movies before, and this one is true to that, but still tries to be something more, which it manages to pull off
Performance
The game is wonderfully optimized
My rig is - GTX 780, i7-3770, 12 GB of RAM
I use a normal HDD and played in 1080p with all settings being at max except for Shadows (they were at High, while the max is Very High)
I also used SSAO instead of HBAO+ and Shadow Cache was turned off
Resolution scale 1
0
The biggest hit out of those three settings is the Shadow Cache
Whlist turning it on the game dipped from 60FPS to ~30
With Shadow Cache off, but other two settings at max I was able to maintain constant 60 fps until I got out of the "prologue", where there started to be drops at some room transitions to 50 fps (but it quickly got back to 60 after the "loading" was done)
It wasn't too bad, but I got tired from it quickly and turned the above mentioned two settings down as well, and was able to maintain a stable 60 fps for the duration of the game
Now for the biggest turn off and probably the only "big" minus of this game - playtime
I clocked in a bit over thirteen hours for my first playtrough
But
This is Steam playtime
I was playing on the Madhouse difficulty and died a lot
The screen at the end of the game showed me the total of nine hours and twenty two minutes
That's 43 restarts and almost four hours of lost progress
I explored a fair bit
I know I still missed stuff
I got 25 out of 33 coins
Half of the bobble-heads and left several chests unopened because I didn't find enough lock-picks
I did, however, read all notes in the game
I would say my exploration total was pretty good and I've seen most of what the game can offer
There is, however, a decision late in the game which I presume changes the second to last chapter drastically
Or not
Now that I've cleared it - it doesn't change squat
Three cutscenes are different
One additional fight, but the chapter itself is the same
I honestly expected more


If you are the type who plays games on easy
Doesn't explore for the items, read the documents and generally just rushes trough the game - I would say that the first playtrough for someone like that it would take around five or six hours for the first playtrough
So, there you have it
The biggest minus of this game
Playtime for the first timers can be anywhere in range from 5 to 15 hours, depending on the difficulty and ability of the one who plays
Just a quick word about Madhouse - they give you enough tapes
I felt like it was a perfect balance of saves, just like the first Resident Evil
There are autosaves though
They are rare
I think I noticed about seven of them troughout the entire game, and they are placed


weirdly
Like there's only two before the boss fights, while with others you have to rely on your own saves
One of them was incredibly strange because it happened at the transition from one of the save rooms (I'm glad I didn't use the tape right away and opened the door first!)
So yeah
I don't think they take away from the challenge factor, because of how weridly they are spread out
And they are at fixed places
Because when I noticed an auto save at one moment I loaded up a previous save and went doing some hard side-stuff, that would have required me to save manually after anyway
P
S
It was a fantastic experience and I'm glad that I have bought this game
I wish it was longer, but what there is is incredible
I seriously doubt that the upcoming free DLC or Season Pass would have much playtime
Oh well, I already bought the Deluxe and will just wait and see

												No guy saying "Resident Evil 7" when you hit "New Game" is the downside to this game
			
Posted: 23 January
												Despite the shift to first person this definitely feels like a classic Resident Evil game
The puzzles and the pacing of the combat in this game fit right along side the early RE games
It's a strange but very pleasant surprise to see my favorite series changing with the times yet still retaining its spooky identity

												Outlast 2 is good, but not great
I feel Outlast 2 was trying to reinvent itself, so not to ruin the first Outlast experience
Where they succeeded in some areas, they failed in others
The graphics, sound and new environment are great, but sadly the story is a let down
It's abstract way of tying in the first game is disappointing
The new AI is very unforgiving and certainly much harder than the first game
This can be a good thing for a challenge, but I think new comers and even seasoned veterans of the first game, will tire of dying over and over
Some spots in the game are made so you do die, just to show off some "violent death scene"
Personally the tension is lost, when you are just getting angry from dying so much and are stuck facing the same annoying monster
I found Outlast 1 had similiar issues in maybe a couple of spots, but Outlast 2 has a lot more of these areas where it becomes mundane and boring
The other main issue is the fact that this seems a much more of a run to each area and not really enjoying your surrounds as much as the first game
There seems to be less to do (i
e
puzzles or objectives) and you basically just run from area to area, sometimes being chased, sometimes not
I did enjoy the open area map and certainly there was some tense moments but the scares were not as good as Outlast 1
It seems Red Barrels was trying to distance itself from the first game, to try out new ideas and new art design, which is fine and there is plenty of good art and typical Outlast violence and gore
But overall it lacks what the original did so well
I am hoping they do release a DLC for Outlast 2, to try and sum up the story, as it did end quite dramatically and personally I feel there is a lot of unanswered questions, more so than the first game
 I am happy to give this a positive review for what the game is and I did have a good time playing it, but I would certainly wait for a 50% sale, as it is not worth full price
I'll give this 3 out of 5 Beers

												Very scary
So far i spent more time looking at the pause menu than actually playing the game
10/10 would pause again :D			
Posted: 20 June
												TL:DR: If you liked the first outlast for it's stealth sections this game probably isn't for you
Too much running around
I'll start by mentioning what is good about this game and then delve into the reason why I would not recommend it
This game is absolutely beautiful with an interesting soundtrack and amazing attention to detail
They did an amazing job when setting this game up to be a proper successor to the first Outlast game
From the moment you start playing the atmosphere hits you upside the head from the subtle music queues to the dreary setting, everything is perfectly in place to make you feel that excellent sense of dread
Unfortunately I didn't get this feeling from this game
Where the first Outlast game had a constant sense of nervousness and uncertainty, this game replaces with mainly frustration
Your sense of fear and dread fades early on and if you're anything like me you'll get annoyed fast
There was a much larger emphasis placed on stealth in the first game and although there were some improvements made to the stealth system in Outlast 2 there were far too many scripted events where your character gets discovered and you have to run
This is also combined with unclear paths or small exits that are easy to miss, so I got frustrated easily while playing this game and never actually got to finish it
There is so much running in this game that I often just stopped playing because I was feeling physically tired because it would sometimes take me 15 minutes to find the one small window that I needed to jump through or crawl under
Unfortunately as a player and in real life too I'm not good at looking for things unless I at least have an idea of what I'm looking for so there were some points where I wasn't able to progress unless I looked up a playthrough to find the small hole in the corner of the screen that I had to find while being chased by an incredibly fast enemy or a horde of incredibly slow enemies
This issue with the running around may not sound like much but in a horror game building up your atmosphere is key to that psychological horror that this series is known for
If you spend 60% of your time running in circles that initial adrenaline from getting discovered falls hard and your body responds as such by getting tired and you, the player, feeling apathetic
In a good horror game you're normally catching your breath at times like these but in this game I would stop getting scared and just be running at this point so I was tired, not scared, and still running; I couldn't find whatever exit I was looking for and getting very annoyed
The reason the first Outlast succeeds where this one fails is the sequences where you have to run are organically created
The player may fail and get spotted by an enemy which will prompt them to run
The fear that has been building up releases at this point as the music picks up which causes the player to get more frightened and leads to a short chase sequence where the player either gets away or dies, both resulting in the player getting to catch their breath and think about their situation
Take Alien Isolation as another example
The player has to get out of a situation that is unwinnable
You're sneaking around a ship with a killer alien on board
If you don't hide well, you die hard
The best horror game doesn't just create an atmosphere
It creates an environment where the player works themselves up
When a horror game is set up well the player will be the one causing themselves the most fear
I would not recommend this game if you liked the first Outlast, but if you like running A LOT then this game should be fine for you
			
Posted: 25 April
												Outlast 2 is a brilliant horror game and nearly the perfect sequel
It builds upon the distressing original, adding more diversity and jumbling the pieces so the rules aren't as transparent
Running and hiding is still a massive part of the experience, but it is less rigid because of natural hiding spaces and smarter world design
It is a much longer game than its predecessor, yet packed with variety to keep the scares fresh
With interludes like a school nightmare and a water rafting trip from hell, the stress levels never drop for long
This raw delivery of horror, relying on just a few basic hooks, is notable because it maintains such frightening stability
With Outlast 2, Red Barrels have created a new standard of horror that is so distressing that you may not want to come up for air

								i have been following the game since they announced it
i have also played the closed beta for it and loved it
I know that this is an early access and there are still going to be bugs and in the future there are going to be patches and tweaks in the game but it is a work in progress and i will gladly support the team that made this game posible

Early Access Review
								Having played the first 2 hours and followed this game closely through it's development, I can honestly say the game has some great qualities about it compared to some of the other survival horror games you may see today
First off we actually have an intriguing story that makes you want to delve into the games lore a little more
Normally I would't do this however based on my interest being piqued by the story, I have felt compelled to seek out more and more about the Felton's as I have progressed through
Secondly we have a different type of combat not usually seen in survival horror games
Diversion & defense
If caught you can use a bladed object to stab at the antagonist so that he lets you go to tend to his wounds
Diversion see's you throw an object at the stalker to slow him down giving you enough breathing room to escape & hide
Objects are plentiful as are hiding places
I think what people need to remember is this game is still is early access and yes there are bugs and some things need improving here and there, however, this is where we come in
Instead of leaving a negative review or telling people to stay away, we should be feeding back what it is we would like to see
Yes this game isn't for everyone but it will certainly appease horror genre fans and survival fans alike, especially those who like a good story
One thing I will also add is I believe the minimum specs are a little to high as I have this thing installed on 3 seperate devices, one of which is below the minimum specs & on 720p low I achieve over 60fps
Not everyone's cup of tea I know however I wanted to see how optimised this game is for early access and it runs very well

								So while Remothered isent perfect, it IS really good
A lot of work was put into this and it shows, good long story telling cut scenes
Good atmosphere through the game, And some tricky puzzles
Most of the gameplay is stressful chase scenes and hiding if you fail to use the stealthy approach
It is possible to avoid any encounter if you take your time stealthing around, but Running is so tempting to get around the house
There are many diversion items in the game you can use to your advantage, and defense items aswell if you do get caught
The AI is pretty easy to learn and get around, but too hard would be frustrating
Overall i enjoyed this Early access a lot, and i cant wait for the story to continue, so i can play some more
Fan of horror this is a must have in your library

Early Access Review
								Wow is all I can say, I have not felt this kind of atmosphere since the first time I played Clocktower on the PS
The graphics are subpurb and it runs dead smooth on ultra, constant 80fps, the story so far is amazing with lots of tid bits that you pick up on from the enviorment, it also delves into medical conditons and other things that involve lots of details
Another thing that makes it relatible to Clocktower  is the sense of dread, saves are limited and are not in every part of the house meaning you must plan your routes to escape and plan to visit saves frequently unless you can predict every event
Only thing that may need improvment is the movement controls and the animations


they seem to be kinda clunky and the animations sometimes seem funny
But you can tell that it is a nod to the horror of Clocktower and even some elements of Resident Evil with the crafting system and the ability to use items defensively! I do recommend the game for the price

								This is a very good game!Its creepy, its got good music and a creepy atmosphere, the story is very intriguing and the gameplay is great
Now what you must undertsand is that this RIGHT NOW is Early Access which means :bugs, glitches etc etcThe bugs i experienced were nothing severe There is only one thing i can say that i didnt really like about the game and this is just me nitpickingIts the sound, sometimes im in a room and i hear Dr
Felton or the other stalkers like they are right next to the door but actually they are far away
I am overjoyed that this game was finally released
If you like horror games get this game its fun BUT if you are a Clock Tower fan YOU HAVE TO GET THIS GAME
All in all i highly recommend this game

								I LOVE THIS GAME!!! Seriously, i beated whats available to play so far and i really dont regret it! I can tell this game is in my top horror games ever
Im a fan of Silent Hill, the old resident evils, outlast and layers of fear
Remothered has everything i love about horror into it
The music is perfect, the atmosphere is awesome, the voices are great (specially the enemy`s) the cutscenes and animations are great as well
I love the ``puzzles`` and theres no map which makes it even better
Of course its early access so i expected bugs and glitches but the only big issue ive had so far was huge lag after a certain cutscene, and the sound from the killer either above you or below you always sounds like hes on the same floor as you
nothing game breaking
The game is not 100% finished like they said and i CANNOT wait to see the rest of it
Buy this game if you like hide and seek with a good intriguing story
9/10 for me so far

Early Access Review
								If you are looking for a pure stealth game that involves less combat and more crouching, then this is the game for you
It's not that much scary, but it sure is atmospheric, creepy, and very intense
There are few jumpscares
It does a successful job when it comes to creating tension, similar to Alien - Isolation
It doesn't have any puzzles, but this could change when the game gets released
Graphics look good
The stealth is the real beauty in this game
The sound ques are important because it changes depending on whether an enemy is further or getting closer to you
The story seems great but it's not finished yet so don't expect a full story
Even though the game is not finished yet, it's still definitely worth buying
There was a bug where the sound ques completely stopped, just like when the enemy is very far from you, but I found that the enemy actually disappeared
Then I started running around the house like leeroy jenkins
This was hilarious, but I got bored because of no challenge and loaded my save again which fixed the bug
Other than that, didn't found any major bugs
But this is Early-Access so this means it's gonna get updated by the developer

												Pro Evolution Soccer 2018 is without doubt the best football game since the PES 4,5 and 6 glory days
Not only is the PC version finally on par with its PS4 counterpart; it is actually far superior with an excellent technical performance and astonishing visuals thanks to the latest Fox Engine build
Graphically; the game looks almost photorealistic at times and the attention to detail is phenominal in places
The animations of players is an remarkable achievement and the immersive feel of the stadiums just offers an incredible experience
It is a groundbreaking step up from the 'hyrbid' builds we've had in recent years which is just polite terminology for 'PS3 port'
In terms of gameplay; the pacing is a bit slower in this outing and it feels spot-on
Matches are less erratic and everything flows much better
Players are more composed in their play and the ball isn't bouncing around the pitch like a hot potato
You have to be more tactical and patient in your approach instead and it works really well
Unfortuately, despite a string of key improvements to the game; the user interface is still incredibly dated as is the recycled commentary which drags the presentation down
It's not a major issue but Konami really need to improve this aspect next year
Online server and connection issues still persist as is the poorly supported online entity which is a shame
Overall; PES 2018 is a stunning game and Konami's best effort for over a decade
From a gameplay and graphical standpoint, it's simply outstanding at times and if you're just looking for a football game to enjoy; it's an absolute must buy despite some dated elements and a disappointing online portion

												HUGE improvements on graphics and gameplay and runs much smoother than all previous years!Well done Konami, you delivered on the PC version
			
Posted: 16 September
												Pro evolution Soccer 2018 Is so good
Ive put 36 hours in in three days and I'm not worn out for a long time!The gameplay is so raw, I love how free the ball physics can be, how good the keepers can move
How amazing those key moments are when everything goes right
For the first time the PC version is super smooth, Graphics and gameplay on par with the PS4 version (Trust me I played the PS4 version one week before launch, promocopy) And then the online


Even on PC the online is as buttery smooth as it can be
The new Netcode is really really good
The sense of playability is really high
I heard it was a hybrid of Peer to peer and server use
Which is frankly the same as what FIFA uses
From time to time you connect with a guy from a location far further away from you and things can get laggy online
Not stutter laggy, but a lot of input delay on the buttons laggy
That spoils the fun a bit but have never seen a football game that had zero lag matches
95% of the time the matches are great and smooth online, with the new Co-op mode it has even more replayability and you can even Mash up your myclub team in a wonderful Myclub co-op mode and play with players you both achieved together
And then the magic moments happen on the pitch again





Enjoy your football in this game!

												I am back to PES now, have been buying FIFA up to this point only because PES was not bringing their A game to PC, but now


damn, I forgot how good this franchise was
To start off with, I am coming to this game with 300+ hours on FIFA 17, most of those hours are with Ultimate Team, which I believe is the strongest mode of that game since you learn the game from a bronze 55 to a gold 90 rating team (without micro transactions, guess if you buy your way up is gonna take a shorter amount of time)  and learn to do tactical defending the bad way for online matches, so, of course, I got some appreciation towards FIFA, but one hour into PES 2018 and I am  already craving for some mechanics to be implemented into FIFA
In short, PES2018 feels a lot more like football (tactics, formation, positioning, passing, set pieces) while FIFA felt more like a pseudo free-style "soccer" match (flip the stick and break the defense unless you are MLG pro) 
Posted: 13 September
Pros:- Finally PC graphics are the same as the current-gen ones **High Quality replays, Higher resolutions supported w/60 FPS**- Gameplay is more realistic more than any older PES, they really did a great job at copying players movements- Passing is decent- Good soundtrack, I really liked the fact that they included a Linkin Park song there
(RIP Chester)- Modding community is so much present on this PES title (as always), Konami are not involved into this or helping modders, But if you want to buy the game for the mods, Think and decide by yourself if it's worth or notCons:- Grass quality is really bad (it looks fake)- Official teams names lacking (licenses)- They still didn't implement Keybindings settings in-game (changing keyboard settings)- Cursor Assist is really bad sometimes and unpredictable (Makes defending extremly frustrating), It swiches randomly and sometimes doesn't work at all, It impacts the gameplay a lot especially when you're playing the competitive side of the game ' PES LEAGUE ' - French Commentators are still the same for like 3 years now- Lack of hardcore/real community of the game, Check the most popular PES subreddit /r/WEPES/ and compare it with the official FIFA game subreddit /r/FIFA/ and you'll understand what i'm talking about, Well it's not Konami's fault if the community isn't as much huge as FIFA one but they could have done something with the subreddit like some publishers do, They use their subreddit as a direct contact with their customers/fans, It helps growing the community so much, Just see Rocket League, Devs are always listening on their official subreddit and updating stuff depending on the community choices/complaints- Denuvo DRM is causing a lot of issues to people (Game crashing at random moments for example

)Online issues/lacking stuff:- Online wasn't working at launch (fixed after more than 24 hours)- When the connection is slow between the two players, the match is cancelled no matter how much time played (This can be abused and used to avoid losing an online match which is frustrating and unfair, Konami needs to address this issue ASAP!)- The update of last transfers (Neymar on PSG


etc), ruined some default team formations, For example: You will find R
Madrid players formations completly screwed, Marcelo in attack for ex
I don't know if that's only for me, But it's really annoying, it felt like a non-official update/patch
- Sadly there are already a bunch of hackers in the game, Which always ruin the ladder/online experience, P
s: It's the case too with most recent FIFA title though
Will have to test Online and other Game modes for some more hours and i'll update my review

Posted: 6 October
												Since PES is about gameplay, here are my thoughts:PROS:- Better player animations, the player move smoother and have good movement with the ball and it feels realistic
- Better dribbling, it can be done now only with the directional analog which is an amazing addition
- Better passing, player positioning and the direction they are facing is a big decider in passes success
CONS:- Attributes don't matter, no matter what the players passing attributes are, they can play Tiki Taka with ease, which made square (X) tackles useless, you'll never make it in time
You can see Ipswich playing Barcelona level of passes
- In contrary to what PES is known for, this year all teams play the same
Striker 1 pass back, make a run, midfielder the lofted through ball to that same striker or wingers
Good luck catching them btw,  but that isn't the problem anyway

- Fouls, 1 per 2 games if you are lucky

And of course 45 meters away of the goal
- Injuries, from my over 40 hours, I don't think injuries are in the game, haven't witnessed none
You can hit an injury prone player with the boot to the face, then dislocate his shoulder and he will stand back just fine
- Scripting, I played the American International Cup as Colombia, beat Paraguay and Chile with ease, over 4 goals each
Last group stages game was against the already out Panama, except this time they fielded: 1-Buffon, 2-Cafu, 3-R
Carlos, 4-Nesta, 5-Hierro, 6-Redondo, 7-Figo, 8-Gerrard, 9-Battistuta, 10-Zidane, 11-Romario
I lost heavily
- Collision, your player leg can go through the ball, the opposite team player leg and then some, with neither taking the ball nor stopping it or commiting a foul
- Player switching is a mess, and players that are not selected still have hard time reacting to the ball placement
- Due to some point I mentioned earlier in addition to huge space in midfield, the play in PES 2018 revolves around constant attacks from the two sides with a small percentage of the game time spent in midfield bsttles or build up

The play is always in one of the two teams final third
CONCLUSION:I am a long time PES fan since ISS, I bought this year's edition on PC due to the finally on par as PS4 version where I usually buy it, and I still somewhat like the game and will be playing it, esspecially once the PTE patch is out
But it is far from being the best Footballing game experience

It has it's pros and cons, and at this point it is really subjective to say PES has better gameplay than FIFA
Try the two demos before making a decision
Konami has a lot of job to do, and the game needs many fixes
Bear in mind, this is an offline gameplay review, I don't play online
Why I reccomend? Only because there is no middle ground and I personally will play the game

												It has been long overdue, but finally, the game is equivalent to the NextGen
:)Pros:- Graphically it looks much more pleasing to the eyes
- Ball physics are amazingly good
- Gameplay is extremely fluid
- Master League and MyClub are addictive
- UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa league are amazing to have!Cons:- Game commentators can get pretty boring as they become predictable after you play more than 20 matches
- In-game soundtracks are nice but there are too little of them
(Maybe we should be allowed to add our own music just like PES 2009)
- There are no German leagues (Bundesliga)
- Limited pool to choose from when it comes to boots customization

												I have never reviewed anything but, for this game in particular, I need to do it
This game is a masterpiece
From the same creators of 'Forest of Drizzling Rain', it is one of the most popular horror rpgmaker games in Japan currently, it has already a manga, novel and even events being hosted in Japan
Pixiv reached over 8000 fanarts of this game in the spam of a little more than one year, and there is a reason why
This game is a masterpiece
The story is unique and complex, not to mention emotionally captivating, with unique characters and a great development for the protagonists
The graphics themselves are rather good, considering it is a pixel rpgmaker game
It has a sense of atmosphere, changing from beautiful to creepy whenever it is needed
The soundtracks are also top quality
Different pieces are played, fitting perfectly with the scene
The gameplay isn't challenging
For a horror rpg some would even consider it easy
However, it has many unique features, so it is not tedious
Some might find it lacking a bit in horror aspect
Where it is definitelly present, compared to other horror rpg games, the horror bases itself more in the atmosphere and plot, so unlike games like Witch's House or Misao, there are basically almost no jump scares
Some would consider it good, while others would find it bad
I personally find it good
Like I said before, the strongest point lies in the story
I won't spoil, but it is something that envelops you in every way
At the end, as much as messed up a horror game can be, you can't help but love every aspect of this wonderful masterpiece
Overall, I give this game a huge 10 out of 10
I might be biased, consider it might have flaws, but I enjoyed it in every way
It is my favorite horror rpg maker game so far and is completely worth buying it, considering it will support the creator who distributed this game in japanese for free at first

												This is my first time writing a review, which is something that I generally won’t do, but I feel that this game was special enough that it really deserves it
This review is spoiler-free, as the story is by far best enjoyed going in with as little knowledge as possible
If you haven't already, I recommend not reading the chapter summaries posted on the store page
They don't contain any key spoilers, but some things are far better left as surprises
By the way, yes, you have to play the chapters in order
Basic summaries will be at the top, with more in-depth thoughts below
Length: I streamed my first playthrough, so I will update this review at some point once I replay and have accurate times
The first three chapters are approximately the same length, and I found that the fourth is significantly longer
Pros:- Charming characters; good development; a very touching relationship between the two protagonists- Enjoyable and creative mechanics and puzzles- Deep and emotional story; lots of metaphors and symbolism- Graphics are appealing- Free music is extremely well chosen and very impactfulCons:- Occasional typos (which can be submitted to be fixed)- Running is clunky and tight turns are hard to control but scenes which need it are simple & shortRecommended for:- People who have played RPG Maker games in the past and/or are familiar with Forest of Drizzling Rain- People who enjoy visual novels or similar games with a frequent narrative and lots of text- People who want to enjoy a good (great) story and don’t mind fairly linear gameplay (there's still puzzles and etc, of course)Not recommended for:- People who don’t like to read a lot and prefer gameplay over story- People who don’t like RPG Maker graphics and (very well chosen) free musicAs for my personal thoughts, I recommend you play Forest of Drizzling Rain (same creator, Stardust KRNKRN/Makoto Sanada) first
Everything is very different, and AoD is an all-around improvement, but I recommend familiarizing yourself with the general style of the author beforehand (also, it's free)
I loved FoDR and went into AoD expecting the same level of story, but my expectations were absolutely blown away
While I’m sure some people are bitter over freeware being released for a cost, the effort put into the translation and into the original game absolutely deserve your money
The story and characters were beyond enjoyable; it brought me to laughter and to tears, and while I understand that this kind of game isn’t for everyone, I can safely put it on my list of favorites
The creativity blew me away, and the game took many turns that I didn’t expect
If you think you’re even slightly interested in it, I absolutely, absolutely recommend you play this game

												An amazing and beautiful story that is both heartwarming and a tearjerker
10/10, would recommend
			
Posted: 20 February
Product received for free
												Lots of people harbor disdain for RPGMaker titles, and for good reason
With the exception of a few gems like To The Moon, most of them aren't worth playing, with stock sprites, unoriginal story, poor world design, uninspired combat


Thankfully, Angels of Death has none of these
It's well-made enough to have garnered a sizable following among Japanese doujin game fans
At heart, it is a mystery story with similar "horror" vibes to Alicemare
That is to say, it is more of a atmospheric/psychological horror game, without any real jumpscares or gore
Which is great, because I'm a queasy guy :<(In case you're unaware, Alicemare is a fantastic, cheap non-RPGMaker title on Steam
Also from the makers of LiEat)
Right at the start, you are introduced to Zack and Ray
They are lost in a mysterious facility filled with other psychopathic axe murderers
Zack happens to be one of them as well, underneath his edgelord bandaged exterior
Ray is a mysterious young girl who begs Zack to murder her
Zack promises to do so


only on the condition that she helps him escape
The game is split into 4 episodes, much like LiEat
Be sure to play them in order!The real meat of the game, and its most enjoyable aspect, lies in unravelling the mysteries behind the characters, with a strange and unlikely rapport building up between these two oddballs as the narrative progresses
Both Alicemare and Angels of Death excel in this regard of storytelling - all the characters are genuinely likable and relatable in their dialogue and interactions
If you enjoyed one of them, I'm certain you'll enjoy the other as well
In the end though, you still can't escape from the limitations of the RPGMaker engine
The game is locked at a miniscule resolution, with gritty pixel graphics
The puzzles that you have to solve are limited to the 2D physics engines of RPGMaker
Not that they aren't challenging or fun, but they aren't anything too novel
The art isn't anything to write home about as well either
I'd label it as serviceable, for lack of a better word
Better than most RPGMaker titles out there, but Alicemare has it cleanly beat on this level
Overall, if you're after a quick dose of episodic psycho-horror + mystery story, Angels of Death is a decent choice
I still feel the price is a little high though - I could get both Alicemare and LiEat for $10
Considering that this game was released as freeware in Japan, you're essentially paying for 4 hours worth of in-game translation
Wait for a 50% sale?

												Chu~This game impressed me so much that I cannot but write a review about it
This was an unforgettable experience as far as the story itself is concerned
The characters…well, it is a difficult topic while all of them are extraordinary in many aspects
So, let’s start with the most interesting part: the plot
I should warn you that there will be some spoilers in my review, but I will do my best to hide them and not to ruin the plot twist for you (oh, and there is one, trust me!)
Please, do not read the hidden parts unless you have already played the game!The story tells us about a girl, Rachel Gardner, who finds herself in an unfamiliar place all alone
She is surprised and wants to see her parents as soon as possible but has no idea what to do and what happened
She sees an elevator and tries to open it
However, all of a sudden, there comes an announcement: “This girl is a sacrifice
The game starts”
Quite intriguing, is not it? And here comes the first floor, the first trap
Speaking about the gameplay, the game is not difficult at all
You can die, of course, but I do not think that it will happen too often
The main idea of the game is to show you a story, not to make you suffer from unsolvable puzzles or meet your end while fighting with endless enemies
The characters
We have a very interesting cast here
First of all, I would like to talk about Zack
My first impression of him was negative -  he was trying to kill Rachel and was quite a madman
To be honest, he scared me to death with his sudden appearances and crazy laughter! 
However, starting from the second episode, my opinion on him began to change
On the one hand, he is as crazy as a Mad Hatter well, the main difference is that he also kills people, but, on the other hand, he has a surprisingly innocent soul
Sounds strange, I know, but his childish outlook on everything and everybody made me like him more and more with every episode
 Most of all, I was shocked by the story of his childhood
He lived in an awful place where he even had to bury bodies of other children! He was no more than a piece of meat for adults there
No child, no matter how strange he or she is, should be treated like this!  I was rutting for him to survive through the whole story
Secondly, there is Rachel herself
You might be surprised why I did not mention her first, after all, she is the main character
The only thing I can say is that you need to play the game to understand the tragedy of this little creature
 Her life was as horrific as Zack’s one
Parents who always argue and have no interest for their own child, who beat each other and her, who deserved to die
And they died
They were killed by the hand of their own daughter
She just wanted to have her “own” perfect family and did not know any other way to achieve this goal
This is the most contradictive person in the whole story
I still do not know what I feel about her
Is it sadness? Or anger? Or disgust? Or sympathy? She deserves all of them
In the end, I cannot but mention other characters, the executors, the Angels of Death
Each of them is a complete person with their own bugs in the head
Each one has their own views of sins and virtues
And again I cannot say whether they are evil or good
They believe in their theories to such extent that they have become their very core
Still, the only person I really disliked is Cathy
This one is a cruel *insert a word here*, whom I despise not only for her beliefs but also for her terrible laughter
It was driving me crazy the whole second episode, for God’s sake!So, after talking about the characters for so long, I am finally coming to the main idea of my review
The ending was both surprising and predictable in some ways
However, I was mostly impressed by what kind of impact it left on me
 I was happy for two crazy killers! I was so glad that they survived and made their way out of this hell
And the ending itself is the best way to put the final point of this story
There is nothing to add, nothing to remove
My verdict is: play Angels of Death! No matter whether you like this type of games or not! This is one of the best stories I have ever read and the characters made me feel the whole spectrum of emotions, from fear to happiness, from love to hate
You need to try this title to understand what I am talking about
It is rather difficult to find the right words to describe all that I have seen there, and I do not think I should even try to do it
Angels of Death is worth your time and money, and this game will make you think and not just mindlessly click through the story
P
S
The final note: the music in the closing credits is amazing! Wish I could get it for my music collection
Also, the art of this game is not something that everybody will like
Personally, I found it as an integral part of the story and would not like to see any other artstyle there

												Completion time: I'd say about 5-7 hours, depending on how fast you can read
8/10 story> Girl loses some of her memories, wants to die but you don't know why until later episodes
> Befriends a serial killer that accompanies you for most of the game> Develops a bond with said serial killer throughout the episodesThe story is linear; there are no alternate routes you can take
The game itself is not scary; the horror aspect of this game is atmospheric and not through jump scares
Difficulty:Very easy, it's generally very easy to know the next thing to do to progress the story
The puzzles that you complete tend to be very straight forward, and give you a very long period of time to complete them
There are multiple chase scenes, and every scene that may cause game over will require you to save before attempting them
There are hardly any cheap instakill traps
If there are, you will be asked to save right before encountering them
If you're into RPGs like LiEat that have more focus on the story telling than hard puzzles and gameplay, I would strongly recommend this game

												Okay I'm going to keep this short and sweet, I just finished this game and let me tell you, it was


well one of the best story driven games I have played
The character building, the pacing, just everything felt so smooth
At first I wasn't that interested by it, but as soon as I dove further into it, I was infatuated, I couldnt even stop playing it
This game will 100% give you that satisified feeling after finishing it
Angels Of Death has so many twists and turns you never get bored, it truly is one of those story gems
I know, some of you may think I'm over hyping it, and well I just finished the game so I'm kind of still hyped
Overall I've never written a review on any game, and I play way too many, but I decided to take time to write this since it stood out way more then any other
I'm so glad I gave this a chance

												First of all a question to whichever genius wrote this story
HOW?! How do you create something that is both ****ed up and ****ing beautiful at the same time? I do not want to spoil the story because it is best experienced blind, in fact I'm very glad I got around to playing it rather than watching a let's play as this is one of the best game narratives I've experienced in a while
The main crux of it really focuses on the growing bond between Ray, a teenage girl who wants to die, and Zack, a ruthless serial killer, as they leave the building together with the promise that Zack will kill Ray once they've escaped
From there we go to each of the floors, which have their own unique killer to run from and puzzles to solve
I loved encountering each new threat, every character was extremely memorable and each one presented a different type of challenge to overcome
But it really is the relationship of Ray and Zack that pushes a lot of the emotional scenes, in fact it's quite unreal how much my heart aches at some of these scenes (I should not want to hug a killer as much as I do playing this)
The graphics are also really impressive, there is so much personality not only in each character's designs but the way they move when they're on screen, and they match up with the expressions on the character portraits brilliantly
While the levels aren't huge they do match the theme of each killer, and the puzzles don't get repetitive
The mechanics are quite basic but it works, the one issue I do have is how difficult it is to be precise while running; I died several times because I was running away from something  and I couldn't quite line up the character with the door I needed to go through (but that could just be me)
I would love to get hold of the soundtrack as there are some amazing songs throughout, particularly Zack's chase theme
The funny thing is that I recently made a list of my favourite games but I feel I need to rearrange it to include Angels of Death, this is easily my favourite RPGMaker game
Overall it's a fantastic game that I highly recommend, I loved playing it and I'm sure another playthrough isn't far away in my future
On a final note, I really think Doctor Danny needs his own rendition of the Jeepers Creepers song; that's literally what came into my head every time he said 'peepers'

OverviewI was initially having trouble pinpointing what this game actually is? What do you do in it? Plenty of things are shown in the trailer but I left the trailer feeling very confused
So here's the large and short of it
The main meat of the game is a video game that you play as a 1980's kid called "Duck Season"
This game puts you into the VR play space of the classic game "Duck Hunt"
You shoot ducks out of the sky with a rifle and a silly dog collects them and dances around
The quality of everything in this game, and I cannot emphasize this enough, is amazing
The "Duck Season" game itself is large amounts of fun despite being so simple
This game also has a rather dark storyline that happens in between successful "Duck Season" play sessions
Every time you jump into the game, time advances and the story progresses a little farther but I'll get to that later
All this being said it is something that might be best for people who show VR off a lot
There is some replay value but for 20$ you're getting something that can be completed in about an hour
Duck Season ItselfAs mentioned previously the meat of this game is the "Duck Season" game within the actual game
Starting this game up literally inserts you into the TV where you shoot at ducks for points
You gain more points the more ducks you hit in a row
The shooting feels nice and does something that I've yet to see any game, VR or not, do
This is to say that your ammunition is visible as an outline when you look at your gun, it visually shows you how much ammo you have by outlining the shells in your gun which I absolutely adore as a way to show ammo in VR
When you shoot you have to pump to ready another shell and eventually grab ammo to put into your gun, again all of this feels great
My main criticism is to say that beyond shooting at some ducks there isn't much more to the "Duck Season" game
I don't think there really is anything they could have added but if this is the meat of the game then I'm a bit disappointed
I have plenty of shooting sims already in my library and I'm conflicted as to whether or not I'd actually come back to this one over others
It's as if I've ordered the best ribs I've ever had and I get one solid bite before I'm done
Still, I have to say the quality here is without question one of, if not thee, best vr experiences I've had!The Rest of the GameOutside of Duck Season itself you play as a 7-9 year old boy who is spending a summer evening in front of the telly
The game takes place over several in game hours
As you play Duck Season, VHS's, video games, toys, magazines and snacks will pile up around you
It can be kind of fun to screw around in front of the television with all this stuff
I personally made it a game to see how many things I could chuck at my mom in the kitchen before she might take notice to her son
 After the succulent hit her in the eye, and she didn't react, I gave up
The other "Kingbit system's" games are all played with a virtual controller gun
You shoot at the options on the TV to pick them and none stood out as something I'd do more than once
Some are pretty silly even just as a title but it's pretty clear that they aren't meant to be done more than once or twice
The VHS's you find are mostly meme's of one sort or another and all fit into the 1980's theme rather well
Some of these look to have been made just for this game and none of them are short on entertainment
My friends and I got a really good laugh at a few that were up and even recognized some old youtube videos that were neat to see in game
All in all there isn't a whole bunch to do here, just some fiddling around in between "Duck Season" sessions
The Story and WorldSpoiler FreeThe story is quite simple and short once you see and understand it but holds several surprises that I don't want to spoil
Bottom line, was it enjoyable? Yes! It quite certainly is
The 1980's atmosphere set up is great and the game had me looking over my shoulder nervously multiple times
Each session of "Duck Season
" Advances time outside of the game by an hour
Around 4 o'clock, odd things start happening
It's no secret if you look at any of the trailers or tags but this is in fact classified as a horror game
Much to my own delight though it at no point says or lets that fact on
So if you have friends that come over to play VR, or maybe family, you could just throw them in and see how they react
It's not a terribly long story and we were able to finish it in about 1 hour although there was a lot of screwing around and we also had to retry one of the "Duck Season" sessions once as well as retrying the ending
Speaking of the ending there are seven of them
I've found two, the sort of "bad ending" and the "canonical ending"
I scratch my head as to how you might be able to get the other 5 though
I'm sure some replay value can be found there as well as the "New Game+" option that opened up but that I did not try
Verdict A clear work of love this game shines but not for long enough
1 Hour of gameplay for 20$ just isn't what I want for my money"Duck Season" is one of the highest quality VR experiences that you'll find
It lacks quantity, variety and length but makes up for it all with the sheer amount of love put into each idea and piece of the game
The game is by and large shooting at ducks but it breaks this up often enough that it doesn't become monotonous
I think after the first playthrough you'll probably want to stop but I can't tell you how much fun that short experience is
I've said it previously and it's kind of my verdict here but I recommend this game for a sale
If you think people will play again or if you're dying for a "shooting at things simulator" then I can certainly understand a desire to buy it
That being said I wouldn't recommend a let's play if you're bound to pick this up at some point
The surprises just wouldn't be the same without VR there

												66 Mins first play though (not rushed)  Well polished fun game, just make sure you understand that it is not a long game
 It does have some replayability but not a massive amount, at least for me
 I am a massive wuss when it comes to horror in VR and found parts of the game scary, others I have no doubt will consider it very PG
Would be a no brainer at $10 if you find it in the sale in the future, $20 is fair for the quality and effort put into making this game although its abit on the high side for how much I feel I will get out of itUltimately it was a fun and memorable experience, hence I recommend it

												I've only gotten 1 ending so far, but I do intend on getting the other endings
The game is such an amazing piece of work
I love it
I do recommend it
Gave me a buttload of nostalgia playing through it
Blowing on the cartridges, VHS tapes, juice boxes, toys! I'm a 28 yr old man who actually decided to sit down in this fake living room and play with the fake toys in front of me like I was a kid again hahahaha
The shooting mechanics were awesome
I really enjoyed firing the shotgun, a couple hiccups here and there with racking and reloading, but nothing that detracts from the game
The horror part of the game is TINY, I wouldn't warn anyone with a low tolerance of fear to stay away
Yeah, I really liked the game and I really recommend it for any 90's kids out there who want a huge nostalgia boost

												This game is horrifically lovingly crafted
Like
There are details on the details on the details
It blows my mind that there is so much going on in what is, fundamentally, a pretty simple game
This is probably one of the few times VR's made me straighten up and go, 'That thing? That thing is art
'

												Wow! This game is crazy! It really took me back to the 80s when I played on my NES until late at night, and then had to fight for my life as the Duck Hunt dog tried to murder me
Those were truly the good old days
I highly recommend this for anyone who wants an immersive anf fun experience

												Solid game, great performance, great graphics and really great gameplay! Intuitive shotgun controls, the best gun handling in any VR game to date! I've done one of the 7 endings and I'm hooked, only stopped because my controllers ran out of battery
The atmosphere is really well done

												As someone who religiously avoids horror films and games (just watched my first horror flick, The Shining, the other day to hype myself up for this) and is even scared of the Minecraft mobs, this game is still absolutely worth experiencing the scares
Just the fact that this game dragged me in regardless should speak volumes
Pros:- Beautifully crafted environments all around
Attention to detail glows in this game, from the wonderfully constructed cartridges & game boxes to being able to steal your mother's sandwich and eat it while she stares at you
These little actions go a long way in VR- Homages to the 80's help to sell the time period- Aiming the gun feels consistently fair- Minigames and VHS's that unlock between rounds keep the game fresh
Minigames make good use of the lightgun system so you don't feel like you're - 7 different endings- Game plays at your own pace
It only progresses when you choose to- You can grab just about any grabbable object no matter the distance
Just reach out towards it and use the force to pull it to your hands
Game cartridges and VHS's can be thrown or tossed into their players if they're out of reach -- overall, the game is extremely friendly to users with small play spaces
Cons:- Compatability with Oculus Rift/AMD is a little sketchy
Constant crashing and artifacts at launch, but reaching out helped bring out a near perfect fix
Turned async and interleaved projections off and added "-noaq" as a launch option to the game - now it works as intended, but a few crashes still occur every now and then
Playable, but they're still there
- (SPOILER) Devs have stated that the dog only attacks you if you shoot him first
In my "pacifist" playthrough, I was still put through the horror segments when I absolutely least expected them
I did shoot the dog in a practice room, but I don't believe that should carry over to the main attraction
Possibly a bug
- (SPOILER) The solution to the big dog boss didn't feel like it was communicated well enough
It makes sense in hindsight, but in the heat of the moment I had no clue where to begin shooting until I accidentally found the weak spot
Could've sworn that area would be invulnerable- The shooting mechanics, as good as they may feel when you get used to using them, feel really awkward to use
Aiming is pivoted to your dominant hand as opposed to the hand on the pump, so in order to aim with both hands you need to lead with the hand closest to you as opposed to the other way around
It does force your hands to stay in the general areas they would be if you were really holding the shotgun, but it feels extremely unnatural
Overall, mostly due to the nature of the shotgun mechanics and how crashing still is a (slight) problem after troublehsooting, I believe this game deserves a strong 8/10
If the crashes are addressed in the future, make that a 9/10
I would like to thank the devs I talked to for being patient with me throughout the troubleshooting process
I usually don't reach out like this, but I'm glad I decided to this time

												Shooting and managing ammo in the shotgun is really fun! Everything looks great, tons of polish
So much of it is an ode to '80s Nintendo kids
If you grew up in that era you'll find tons of parodies and references around the environment
The story is a minimal level of spooky, perfect for me because I usually can't take true horror VR games
Just the right amount of weird to throw you off
I got 2 endings and have no idea where to look for the others
There's clearly lots of secrets!

												If you played Gal*Gun: Double Peace and the thought of playing it in VR blew your mind, you probably smashed the "Purchase" button as soon as you saw this game and are just reading reviews while it installs and you probably won't be too disappointed in the purchase


For the more discerning consumer, though, this is *barebones* compared to GGDP
No story, no sisters, no Doki-Doki Mode, no angels, no devils (aside from the mini-demons that afflict girls), no Doki-Doki Mode, no collectible profiles, no Angel Eye Drops, no store, no sidequests, no Doki-Doki Mode


It honestly feels like an Early Access game but it's not marked as one
Like, why is the love gun not modeled at all? It's just a semi-transparent handle
The demon sucker gun is modeled so why isn't the love gun? Second, not having a full story is one thing but the game doesn't even offer a cursory introduction to what's going on so if you didn't play a previous Gal*Gun game, you're going to be confused
It's also weird how aiming is primarily controlled by the motion controller but it's also slightly influenced by the direction you're looking with the headset
In the shooting segments, that's fine, but it's awkward in the menusOverall, if you're a Gal*Gun fan itching to meet the girls in VR, it's probably worth it
If you haven't played any Gal*Gun games, though, I would recommend playing GGDP before playing this one
I really hope they go on to develop a much more polished and feature-complete sequel

												The concept just works a lot better here in VR than in the original game
The original Gal*Gun was a controller based rail-shooter game with no option to switch to mouse and keyboard
And it played like one
This VR version fixes the controller issues by being a VR game where you can point and shoot in six degrees of freedom, and gives a reason for being on a rail as you move forward from a series of room scale environments
Unlike the original, I beat the game and am fairly happy with the gameplay, and will probably try a few of the score challenge achievements
One of the reviews calls this a VR horror experience, and mechanically, they're right
You are being swarmed from all sides with entities that you have to shoot who charge right at you
You will get swarmed by multiple girls during some of the encounters which leads to frantic 'omg omg flail shoot shoot' moments, even though thematically, they're professing that they like you
The arena design is nice and diverse; there's not just different configurations of hallways and various open areas, but non-conventional ones like being on a ledge behind a stairwell where you have to worry primarily about what's above and below you
If this game is for you, you should buy it
That said, it's not flawless
The menu system should be thrown out and redone from scratch
(Why would you ever make the grip button the 'activate menu item' button while making the trigger button the 'cancel back one level' button? I almost abandoned the game, thinking it shipped broken
) The game will drop back to the empty Steam circle loading area for long periods of time between levels
There's problems clipping with objects in the world
In the 'Call' section of the game, where you can invite a girl to your room, the girl isn't placed inside the play area
There are no Steam Trading Cards
Gal*Gun VR feels like it needs a whole lot of polish but this shouldn't deter you from buying it because it's a glimpse into our waifu future

												pretty good girl wave shooter with progression
 Looking at the achievements there are 8 stages!  I'm on the second stage and I figured there would only be 2
And the stages so far are pretty good nicely modelled, you progress through them to different checkpoints
They really nailed anime look and feel
 nice animations and you actually feel  a little bit like a celebrity :)you can crank up the ingame graphics and make it look super sharp
Too bad there doesn't seem to be a story mode
I'll definitely be playing it though to the end to see what the other stages look like

												Five Nights at Freddy's is an awesome little indie game that's become very popular in a short span of time
The gameplay is simple - you're in a room and have the ability to control the lights and doors of your office as well as the ability to monitor the cameras dotted around the building
You need to keep an eye on the four animatronics that will move around and kill you if they manage to enter your office
To make things more difficult, you have a very limited amount of power which is drained more quickly if you keep lights turned on and doors closed, effectively meaning you need to leave yourself exposed if you want to survive
As a horror game, it works very well
The robots are suitably unnerving and the game makes you extremely paranoid thanks to the lighting and sound effecs
There's nothing unfair about the game - if you can keep your cool and use your resources effectively, you'll be fine, but more often than not the player will end up panicking and being punished for it
The atmosphere and story are fantastic as well - the messages and notes left behind for the player all add up to create a very enigmatic yet creepy story that people are still speculating on, combined with numerous other easter eggs
The developer seems down to earth and willing to listen to his fans, and has already promised a sequel
I would recommend buying the game to support him for this reason and so that we can hopefully see more games like this
The game is not huge, but it's a great addition to the horror genre and is definitely something all horror fans should want to see more of in a sea of action games and zombies

Posted: 19 August, 2014
												I'll start by saying I had no intention of playing this game
Actually, I avoided it
But it wasn't until I noticed it popping up everywhere that I'd give it a shot
The first night was absolute hell
I kept the doors shut the whole time and drained my power in less than five minutes
I give this game major props
I have bad anxiety, and this game has actually helped me a bit with that
The paranoia and anxiety I experienced through my multiple play throughs of the night one and two, helped me realize that things that make me nervous in real life aren't as bad as being chased down by killer animatronics
So thanks for that
I'd definitly recommend this game to anyone who can last the five nights
I know I sure as hell can't (made it to night 3), but that doesn't stop me from trying

Night 1 2AM: All quiet on the homefront, I think I'll ask that cute girl who works concessions out when morning rolls around
Night 1 3AM: I could've sworn that the bunny suit was in the room the other two animals, but now it's in the prop room
Must be more tired than I realized
Noticed an indicator that says power is at 65%, they must try and conserve power at night
Night 4AM: Okay, now the ducks in the party room, something is not right here
Power's at 50%, I'll have to be careful if I don't want to be in the dark with these things
Night 5AM: HOLY S#!% turned on the lights to take a leak and that damn bunny was right outside my door! Powers at 20% but screw this, these blast doors are staying shut all night
Night 5:30AM: SOMEONE IS KNOCKING ON THE DOOR
There is no way in hell I'm opening that

												Among the Sleep is a horror game that has a really unique aproach to horror
But will you want to play this through ? In Among the Sleep you dont play as an adult but instead as a two year old child
The game begins and its our birthday and we get a teddy bear as a present
But one night you wake up to find out that the teddy bear and your mom is missing so its up to you to find them
So how is Among the sleep ? Im kinda mixed on this game honestly
The gameplay is smooth and its a blast to play but there are problems that weigh down the experience
First of all the game is just like amnesia
The main charecter is defensless and theres nothing you can do about it so you have to hide to get away from monsters
The game also throws in puzzles you need to solve to get to the end
So now for the pros and cons
Pros: The game looks amazing
Its just amazing to see a nightmare world through a childs eyes
The story has a great set up and the ending is also really good
Atmosphere is outstandng and its one of the best i have ever seen in a horror game
But now for the cons
The game is incredibly short only an hour to beat
Easy puzzles that dont feel like they should be there
Sometimes frustrating stealth segments
Confusing map layouts and sometimes wonky controls
Overall Among the Sleep is an excellent horror game but it has its fare share of problems
I highly suggest you get this game on a sale and not full priced and dont go in expecting a masterpiece and you should be all good
I give Among the Sleep a 7/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												I finished the game in a single sitting (roughly 2½ hours)
I don't think that there's replay value to this game either, unless it gets mods at some point
Even so, I would recommend playing this for it's strong atmosphere, and the intense moments
If I had to give this some scores between 1-10, here's what I think:Gameplay: 5/10Story: 6/10Atmosphere: 8
5/10If you are on the edge about this one, then maybe pick it up later, during a sale
It's a game worth experiencing

												I never thought playing as a 2 year old could be so spooky

It is short but still a good game

Easy puzzles that keep the game flowing , great audio and graphics, nice scares

If you like scary games with no gore (who's gonna rip apart a 2 year old), then this is the game for you

***After latest patch***I've always been fascinated by the game concept, to be introduced to the world through a child's eyes
Where everything and anything is possible
A world so full of life and colors, danger and adventure, fear and magic
Nothing your plain adult life could bring you close to
A world where you can be the hero of your bedtime story
You begin your adventure at night, the time when we rest after a long day, time where nothing mostly ever happens
But not for a 2 years old! Among the Sleep, introduces you to a terrifying experience, which is completely insane and traumatizing on a basic human level
Takes place on a stormy late night, your mother is missing and you're a helpless little infant who sets off on a quest to rescue her
While he faces his fears of being lost in the dark, monsters lurking in the closets and every dark corner, worlds shifting, objects stretching which gives the illusion of hellish presence in the most clever ways I have ever seen, that you begin to imagine things and jump at the slightest noise
A psychological masterpiece
Many recent horror games, such as Outlast, Amnesia, DreadOut and more, have been aiming to achieve making the player feel helpess in the face of danger or supernatural exsitence, by stripping away any means of fighting back
Which is probably the scariest feeling of all
But I can't imagine what could be more helpless than a little toddler, who can't yet talk and can barely walk, so you're basically forced to cope with your surrounding
A big thank you to the Devs for releasing an update with new achievements
Being an achievement hunter, I had to replay the game, and it was even more rewarding than my first playthrough
It opened my eyes and made me realize what a special little game it was
It also added a Slenderman feeling into it, only a toddler version
The game runs perfectly smooth, haven't encountered a single problem, still has its amazing visuals and physics and I noticed a greater update in the ambiance and sounds, which creates a much better horror atmposphere
 I strongly believe this game deserves a lot more credit, as it leaves a strong impact on you that a lot of big titles can't do
With its provoking story and innovation to the horror genre, I urge you to try it
Such rich gem is very rare to find!

												Among the Sleep, it was rather good, and I did enjoy it
Though it has some issues
Animations at the beginning they just, they look horrible
I'm sorry to say
The achievements are broken I didn't get one of them, and I beat the game
The game was good, and I enjoyed the storyline, and it was a completely different take on any horror experience, and it was such a beautiful original idea
But at a $20 price tag, that's a bit much
I waited a year and a half for this game, and though I did enjoy it, that $20 thrown on it, was steep, very steep
I beat the game, my first playthrough in 103 minutes
$20 for an hour and a half of play, I have to admit, it's not worth every penny
But I did enjoy the game
Hopefully we could see a free DLC for a little bit of a compensation of how short the game really was

												This is an excellently executed horror game
It tugged at my emotions and I identified somewhat well with the toddler that stars in this game
While my own mother wasn't too similiar to the one in the story, I did closely identify with the kinds of negative problems a problematic parent can bring into your life, especially at a young age
As such I think I identified a bit too closely with the toddler and it actually left me feeling a bit emotionally distressed for awhile
Due to this, I'll issue a minor warning to people that the game addresses some really difficult mother parenthood negatives and how it can effect the child(ren) involved in somehing like that
 This could be very disturbing for some people, especially those who had issues with their female parent

												**Key was donated from the developer to review**   Introduction            Among the Sleep is a horror game where you play a 2 year old
Without spoilers, the game takes a look into the bad situations a small child could get into, through the child’s eyes
The atmosphere is absolutely amazing and the game as a whole is a gem
Among the Sleep is not without fault though, I did find the game very short and the graphics were a little weird
(The graphics may have been a deliberate decision made by the developers) Although 20$ is a bit expensive for how short this game was, I would say I would still pay it for the great experience
As with all horror games I would highly suggest you playing with headphones on max volume
Without spoilers, I would like to say that the ending is thought provoking and really made me thing about how young children may perceive the world around them
-HiPFiRED   Pros                Thought provoking story  Amazing atmosphere  Unique take on the horror genre     Cons               It’s a bit expensive for how short it is Graphics a bit weird at times    If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group

better paced than outlast
FAR TO SHORT
I love the game, flawless, polished indie title
But i doubt it has much more than 1 hours gameplay
If you Love horror games buy it, but at 14
99 this game isnt worth it and that hurt me to say
Its a great game in every way but i cant justify that price for a demo worth of content
Zero collectables and zero other activities other than the main plot
its worth £8 anything more and your getting ripped off content wise
Horror fans must buy
But i cant recommend at its price

												Needless to say, this visual novel's legendary reputation precedes it, and a lot of hype has been built around it
It's the #1 rated VN of all time on VNDB and people recommend this as a must-read even though the mandatory prequel (Muv-Luv) is generally seen as fairly mediocre
My impression after reading Alternative is that it's quite excellent, but also has its fair share of problems
Here is a list of my pros and cons with the game:Pros:+ Alternative has a strong cast of several returning characters as well as many new favorites that are introduced
For the most part they all have a layer of depth to them, even if some of them didn't get that much screen time
If you liked Meiya from Muv-Luv, Alternative will be right up your alley, and even if you didn't, there are still several great supporting characters
+ I've never been a huge fan of action in visual novels because you can't really show it all that well with just images, but Alternative did a great job of keeping me on the edge of my seat despite that
+ The plot gets quite complex and interesting, and weaves the individual characters' stories with the overall narrative very well
+ Alternative gets you emotionally involved with what's going on
Don't be surprised if you start crying or stare at the screen in utter shock
Cons:- I don't really care for the protagonist, Takeru Shirogane
His irritating personality traits from Muv-Luv continue well into Alternative
- At times the story drags on with unnecessary drama, rehashed conversations and overuse of flashbacks
- The ending was a bit of a letdown for me
- Reading Muv-Luv Alternative's prequel, Muv-Luv, is mandatory
Unfortunately, Muv-Luv is in my opinion a really big mixed bag of some good stuff and some straight-up bad and cringe-worthy stuff
But it lays the background and character development you need in order to know what's going on in Alternative
Overall I can definitely recommend Muv-Luv Alternative and while it wasn't the end-all-be-all of visual novels for me, it was still excellent and gets a spot on my list of favorites
TL;DR: Get it
Also, Meiya is best girl

												Muv Luv Alternative is something special to me
It is the most I've cried since being older than 8, made me dream of being a writer, and is my favorite story in any form of media (movies, TV shows, anime, books, etc
)It is the only thing I can call a master piece, despite how cringey in a way that sounds
It is hard to really put the respect I have for this, so yeah


think it is worth the buy if you don't mind trudging through the first game

												People ask, If you could experience one thing for the first time again, what would it be?My answer: The Muv Luv Trilogy
MLA is by far the best fictional story I've ever experienced, and nothing has topped it since I first read it about 3 years ago
I discovered this series because it is the highest rated VN on VNDB
I had only read a few other VNs before, so, I instantly got interested and dove into it practically blind
I would highly encourage you to do so too
Despite my high praise for this series, Muv Luv is not perfect
Far from it in fact
However, one thing it does better than anything else is a subversion of expectations
After reading through the happy-go-lucky Extra and Unlimited, I was beginning to have my doubts that this VN was going to be the masterpiece that it was hyped up to be
And god damn, I've never been so glad to be wrong
Parts of this VN have some of the best writing, character development, and plot twists I've ever seen
But other parts are extremely sloppy and rushed
I have some mixed feelings about parts of Muv Luv, but overall I would still consider it to be my favorite work of fiction
With that, I'll go over some good, bad, and neutral points about MLA with minimal spoilers
Good:-MLA has the best story I've ever read
It gives one of the most emotionally powerful experinces I've ever had
Takeru's character developement is nothing short of a masterpiece
The story sheds light on many different topics, including military strategy, PTSD, quantum causality, politics, nationalism, philosophy, traumatic psychology, time loops, etc
The characters, old as well as new, are great, each with their own views on the world and the ongoing war
-Muv Luv has an amazingly well written multiverse
The logic is consistent and key points make sense within the world's perameters
Nearly every part of the military operations are explained in great detail, all the way down to squad formations, technical specs of the TSF's, and strategic countermeasures for each type of BETA
-There in a incredible use of foreshadowing, with later major events being traced back to even the opening scenes of Extra
The payoff for reading Extra and Unlimited is truely amazing
-The action sequences are a fantastic, as Muv Luv Alternative has one of the highest production values out of any VN
-MLA features an amazing soundtrack
-The mecha design is amazing
Each TSF is based on a real life fighter jet counterpart, and the weaponry is conventional, unlike something you would see from Gundam or any other mecha show
Neutral:-You have to sit through about ~30 hours of a non-action, slice of life, slapstick comedy VN trilogy before you get to the "good part
" This could be a plus or minus for some
I was one of the weird ones who really enjoyed the first two VNs in the trilogy
However many do not, especially if you're coming for the action and mecha aspect
DON'T be that guy, please
It's extremely important to read the first two VN's before Alternative
It's called a trilogy for a reason
-There are points in this VN where its visuals might be too much for squeamish people
There is a heavy use of gore and nudity during some key story points
Bad:-The ending arc was obviously rushed
I feel like there could have been a much more comprehensive and well thought out ending, since the one we got felt a bit cheap
Some people argue that an ending is what really makes a story good or bad, and this might be one of the biggest complaints from readers
-If you don't get emotionally invested in the story from reading through Extra and Unlimited, the story will be very ineffective
It relies on the reader to experience emotions similar to that of the main character
-With such a big cast of characters, I feel like we did not get to see each one's development as well as we should have
Many new characters are introduced about half way into the story, and once they show up, many of the old characters lose any and all focus and dialogue
-The best songs in the sountrack are usually only played in a few specific parts, and most of the time it uses songs from Extra for background noise during conversation
Visual Novels tell the reader the story through the eyes of the protagonist
This might be the most important aspect of MLA, and the reason why it is so successful at telling a compelling and emotional story
Not being able to know what Takeru was thinking all the time would have made this VN significantly less impactful
MLA's intense action sequences, soundtrack, and excellent production value elevate the story to a new level
For these reasons, MLA could never do well translated into any other medium, and only really works as good as it does as a Visual Novel
TL;DR: The Muv Luv Trilogy is absolutely amazing
If you're willing to sit through quite a bit of set up, the payoff is incredibly rewarding, giving you one of the best and most emotionally gripping stories ever written

												I can see why this game is regarded as being somewhere around God-tier
This game completely erases the tones set up in the previous two games in the series, Muv Luv and Muv Luv Extra
The original Muv Luv, as you should know by now, was more like your typical dating sim visual novel, where a good majority of the girls are attracted to you and you have the choice of dating whichever one you choose
Extra took this a bit further, and added a more deep tone to it, while having that dating sim aspect still present
But then you have this game
Muv Luv Alternative
They took the design of the other two novels and literally threw them out of the TSF straight into the mouths of a Fort-class BETA
The carefree attitude of the MC Shirogane Takeru is annihilated, as he suffers similarly to Okabe Rintarou in Steins;Gate
The suffering never ends, and you get dragged through the mud and blood right along with Takeru as he stumbles and falls, but also while he learns to accept reality and face what he's been running away from this whole time
Of course, this is already along the lines of being spoiler, so I'll leave it at that
This game in particular completely threw me off
I was expecting to be able to have some fun and lighthearted adventures as Takeru comes back for his 3rd installment in the series
Of course, if you read the store description, you immediately know that something went very wrong this time around
You have to watch the suffering, watch the pain and despair, and you can't do anything to help as you are merely the observer
It's painful
It may give you borderline PTSD for a while
Every happy moment seems like it could very well break any moment, it's actually rather stressful as well
You get enveloped in the chaotic world of humans being at war with the aliens known as BETA and it pulls your attention even stronger the deeper you dive into it
The science is real, the reality is actually rather realistic
There's no magical powers, no plot armor
Every threat is real, nobody is safe
That's war
The tech is more advanced sure, but you get explanations for nearly everything that is used, and it all makes sense
This visual novel is Legendary
Truly God-tier
You do need to walk through the first two games to get that deeper connection with the characters, but it's worth it
Play this game, you seriously need to experience this story
It's on a level of its own

"Stand up and dance graciously, oh soldier subjected to thy Fate
Become the origins of tomorrow's peace
"Finishing Muv-Luv Alternative, I have seriously never felt more compelled to share my experience with others so that they might play this and feel the same satisfaction that I have
I played the fan-translated version long ago, and this is the bottom line:Muv-Luv Alternative remains one of the greatest stories I've ever experienced - it's perfect mix of exhilaration, solemnity, and love impacted me deeply and will stay with me forever
Seeing this masterpiece come to Steam and reach a larger audience, with a huge amount of technical improvments, makes me truly happy
The depth of the world building is incredible, the characters unforgettable, and the cruelty unrelenting
Also


 Sumika best girl Remember, the ultimate experience REQUIRES that you play the prequels, Muv-Luv Extra and Muv-Luv Unlimited, before starting this chapter
Extra, though very much a standard visual novel, introduces and endears the characters of this game, giving insight into their personalities, their desires, their dreams

and making this final chapter all the more incredible

Posted: 18 September
												Muv-Luv Alernative is the brilliant conclusion to the Muv-Luv saga
It starts not where Unlimited ended, it starts in the same place, but with a twist
Somehow our hero, Takeru, remembers the events of Unlimited, and using that knowledge he will try to save mankind from the bitter defeat it suffered in the previous game
What starts with hope, ends in despair
Alternative ties all the events in Extra and Unlimited, expands the game’s universe geometrically, and we finally learn the nature and the reason why Takeru is looping in space and time
A love history, a story about the best qualities of love, but also a story about obsession, the power of love, for good or evil is central to Muv-Luv
Extremely detailed military operations, complex characters, background politics, and an amazing fictional universe, seen from the eyes form a regular guy, who tries to do his best
Sometimes he will fail, sometimes he will be broken, but he is willing to do anything for the people he loves, for the girl he loves
You need to read Extra and Unlimited to fully enjoy Alternative
Really recommended

												I beat Muv Luv Alternative and all I got was crippling depression and Complex PTSD
10/10!			
Posted: 22 September
												Have you ever wondered what it is like to be in war? To give all your body and mind, fighting against all odds not only to survive, but to protect your loved ones
Even when you had tried all things possible, even going back through physically impossible, traveling back in time and doing things no human could ever do, only to face despair of your powerlessness
Because your enemies is not yourself, it's not other people, it's not



human
Amidst hopelessness, despair, and depression, do you give up? Do you run away from reality? NO! YOU ARE A SOLDIER! You don't fight for yourselves, you don't fight for your country
You
Fight
For
Humanity



and to fulfill your promise with her


"Achieve your mission with all your might
Despair not till your last breath
Make your death count
"======================Actual review:Don't be fooled by the harem theme
It was actually a bait to lure weak people in, and then crush their hopes with the ultimate despair
Muv-Luv Alternative makes a really good sequel of Muv-Luv by bringing you characters you are familiar with in Muv-Luv, but deepens the characters and emotions
Each girls has their own personality, their own stories, their own worries, their own reason, and their own


love
People usually portray girls as weakling who should be protected and saved in war, but in this game, the girls are the one doing the protecting
People might say this is a sad story, but you can think whatever
To me, this is a story about growing up
From the happy-go-lucky life in original Muv-Luv, suddenly everything changes and you are forced to face so many things to the breaking point
From each arc, each dialogue with all the characters I learned how small my problems were, I learned how to deal with my emotions, I learned how to endure, and how to give my best effort to face adversity
To know that I'm not the only one with issues, to know that everyone is struggling far worse and they manage to stay strong, I realized that I need to move forward too
For my sake and for their sake
This game helped me grow up

Reviewer's Notes:For the sake of full disclosure I did back this on Kickstarter
I have completed the Muv-Luv Trilogy, via the unofficial fan translation, twice
The Steam version of this game is the All Ages version
That means the explicit adult content that is in the normal game is removed or censored
There will be a Director's Cut patch at some point in the future that will address that
 Unlike with Muv-Luv Extra and Unlimited, however, I do not think that the censoring of the explicit content is a detriment to Alternative and the experience as a whole
This review will be as spoiler free as I can make it
The thing that makes the Muv-Luv experience so memorable is not knowing where it is going to go or what will happen next
I would hate to ruin that for someone else
 Do not play Alternative until you have completed Muv-Luv Extra and Unlimited
 My review for Muv-Luv Extra and Unlimited can be found here
Overview:As mentioned in my previous review the Muv-Luv Trilogy is considered by many, myself included, to be one of the best Visual Novel experiences of all time
 Where Muv-Luv's Extra and Unlimited primarily introduced the player to the characters and to the universe Muv-Luv Alternative is the heart and soul of the Trilogy
 It will take you to the highest of highs and drag you to the lowest of lows
 It isn't going to pull any punches
Story:Our protagonist, Shirogane Takeru, wakes up once more in his room convinced that everything that had happened before was a dream
 The thought doesn't stay for long
 Just like before, upon leaving his house, reality quickly sets in
 It has been roughly three years since the end of Unlimited, though his memory is foggy in places and completely blank after a certain point, and Takeru finds himself back in the hellish war torn world he had already suffered through at least once before
 It is October 22nd and he remembers the deadline and what will happen
 With the events of Alternative V still fresh in his mind he sets out to find Yuuko, to do everything over but this time differently
 This time he knows what will happen, he already spent years training and honing his abilities so he won't hold anyone back, and with his knowledge of those events he begins his work to change it
 To prevent Alternative V from coming to fruition
 To see Alternative IV completed and humanity saved
Unlike Extra, and to a lesser extent Unlimited, Alternative is a Kinetic Visual Novel
 There are technically some different routes and definitely a few places that you will get to make decisions but ultimately the experience is mostly set in stone and the choices matter little
 It starts out as a typical power fantasy before snowballing out of control and taking the player on a trip they'll probably never forget
 Extra and Unlimited had moments of emotional impact but Alternative takes all of that and cranks it to 11
 It was deliberately written and designed in a way that ensures the twists and turns it takes will always hit for maximum effectiveness, high or low
 The characters see actual growth throughout by taking what we've already learned and giving them proper conclusions
Now that isn't to say that the story is perfect, that there are no plot holes or contradictions, that the pacing is always spot on, or that the things people have criticized the series for over the years (like very heavy use of info dumping) aren't there anymore
 Depending on who you ask some or all of that stuff is still present, though I personally believe the updated translation has made a huge difference
So when the smoke finally settles, the tissue box is empty, and the credits start to roll feel free to utilize Extra as a palate cleanser while we wait for Altered Fable
 It'll be a good excuse to go back and hunt for all the various bits of foreshadowing and what not that was slipped in years in advance and you'll need something to feel good again anyway
Visuals:Despite being over a decade old Muv-Luv Alternative looks great
 The sprite work, the backgrounds, the CGs, movies, and action sequences are top notch
 It is pretty easy to notice some of the newer assets designed specifically for the All Ages version of the game (which is based off the Japanese console version) but they aren't harmful to the experience
If you like what you saw in Extra and Unlimited you're going to get more of that, just on steroids
Sound Design:Alternative utilizes much of the same soundtrack that Extra and Unlimited used which helps create a very cohesive experience
 There are a few new tracks that will pop up here and there but mostly it will be stuff you're already familiar with
 They do an excellent job of picking the right tracks for the right moments
Sound effects are about the same with some small improvements here and there
 The mixing on the other hand is significantly improved from the original release
Voice acting is still top notch, with the new additions to the cast doing a great job
 For the first time, thanks to the official localization, we now get proper English during a couple of sequences and they're solid
 Hopefully the option to toggle between the new English and the old beloved "Engrish" is added in the future
System:Much of what I said previously for Extra and Unlimited still holds true here
 If you didn't like the mobile game influenced UI, the no save slot notes, the non adjustable text colors, and so on you're probably still not going to like it
 But if you did like the fact that you can play the game on about any computer without it freezing, crashing, or just being difficult, good news! Alternative performed perfectly and I had no issues
As for special features we get an Extras section that is mostly what you would expect
 The CG Gallery is scrollable from the get go and the Chapter Select is very nice
 But why no Jukebox?  I feel like that was a mistake
Now on to the most important part: the updated translation
 Look, I am glad that Ixrec translated the trilogy back in the day
 I really am because that was how I was first exposed to the series and it was amazing
 But the difference between that fan translation and this version is quite frankly astounding
 It is just better in every way
 Everything actually makes sense, character motivations were "fixed," the political intrigue isn't full of contradictions, the hard science info dumps aren't full of nonsensical babble, and tone remains far more consistent
 At times it felt like I was playing a different game and it was great
 This is the best way to experience Muv-Luv Alternative
Conclusion:"One day, when you get to the point where you can laugh at your mistakes


I'm sure you'll rediscover whatever you've lost


"In a game full of memorable lines this one always got to me
 I'm sure it did for others
 It marks a turning point of sorts, where you realize that things will get worse, much worse, before they're going to get better
 That is the Alternative experience condensed into a single line and it is an experience that I think everyone should try
 I can't promise you will like it, let alone love it, but I know I do
 Hopefully you will too

 Gist of the story Moving to a new house means that you might have some difficulty acclimating to your new environment, especially if you’re a little kid
It’s hard enough to make friends in an already unfamiliar neighborhood so what is little Emily to do when she’s in this exact predicament
Perhaps, she’ll find friendship in the most unlikely “people
” With the discovery of three dolls ( well, 1 little girl doll, 1 puppet thing and a clown doll…thing) in her new house’s basement, these seemingly inanimate objects creeps their way into this little girl’s heart and they all become good buddies
It’s a happily ever after, right?Right?Then, why was Emily’s parents driven to the point where they felt the need to sequester their daughter and her pals in the basement, where they are out of sight, out of mind?“They will never take my friends away from me
” -EmilyIt’s strange that Emily’s parents disappear soon afterwards
What? Someone ordered pizza from Emily’s house? Good luck, pizza guy
;)--- Gameplay The game consists of surviving a of couple nights inside what seems like a recently vacated house
You play as a pizza delivery man and unfortunately you are now in the company of one little psychotic girl and her possessed dollies
Emily’s three besties chases you around the house for some reason and avoiding them becomes tedious and downright exhausting at times
When the clock strikes midnight, this is the time when Em’s first doll, Kiki, comes out to play
Kiki likes the attention and even if the game tells you not to look at her, you really need to keep your eye on her because she will grab and choke…I mean hug you to death if you avert your eyes away from her
She’s just full of love
When you hear her giggling, it’s best to search around for her so you know which direction she’s coming from and ready yourself for a light jog
This is important when her friendos join the fray later on
Once the first hour is over, we are introduced to Mr
Tatters, a cute little clown that loves an audience so much that he’ll kill you if you don’t stick around
Once again, the game will warn you to “Please stay still” when Tatters is around but never believe the warnings, especially when there’s a winky face involve
Tatters want you to stand still and touch your warm, soft…pizza bread
Like Emily, listen for his laugh so you know when to stop and his disappointed groans when you didn’t run away from him
Oh, did I mention Kiki is there? Just pray you don’t get a Kiki spawn at the same time you hear Tatter’s laugh
The next hour is with Chester
Marvelous, he is not
Like the previous hours, you’ll have Chester and his other joker friends hunting you down
If you guessed that the game tells you not to run away from Chester, then you guessed right
Definitely get out of dodge
He looks like a puppet…that moves without any help
There’s nothing eventful there, really
Until you reach the next hour and have the three stooges and Emily gang up on you
The technique is really simply
Just run around through the house, in circles and never stop running, unless you hear the clown
---  Did ya scare me? The scare factor of this game, on the scale of 1-10, I rate Emily Wants to Play a 4 out of 10
4 being, “the game tries
” I must admit, the game genuinely creep me out at the beginning
When I saw the unmoving figure of Tatters hunched over by the corner, my “NOPE” senses were tingling
I really thought I would be giving it a higher scare factor score
The introduction of the game sets up the atmosphere really well
However, after figuring out what I should be doing to counter Emily & friends, the urge to fire up Dark Souls so that I can shove my rapier in an innocent undead soldier out of frustration swelled within me
The creepy vibe starts to dwindle away by the 20 minute mark
All that was left were the jumpscares, unnecessarily loud ones
The game is mostly silent and besides ambient noises like doors creaking open, it stays quiet the entire time
Doors and lights also randomly open/close occasionally, which was confusing at first but whoever is doing that just loves to troll
I think Kiki is responsible for these occurrences…or maybe it was just the wind
--- Graphics and Technical Issues The game isn’t the most upstanding, graphic wise, but it does its job enough
There are few graphical options to choose from but for some reason, I had a hard time selecting the resolution
The resolution sometimes changes when I (alt)(tab)
Clicking my native resolution wouldn’t register
It’s happened only a few times but I thought it was worth mentioning
Emily Wants to Play crashed about 6x for me in the past 2 hours of gameplay
At one point, I couldn’t even click NG without it crashing
I am also reading in the Steam Community forums that some players are having problems launching the game
It hasn’t been addressed (not to my knowledge) but hopefully it will be in the future
--- My observations I had my fingers crossed that Emily Wants to Play will keep me on the edge the entire time but that’s not what happened
It got a little annoying and although I was almost terrified to proceed onwards (b/c I saw a clown and a little girl doll

thing), I’m glad I did
I knew annoyance will always triumph whatever fear I felt at the start
I love overcoming obstacles
--- Wrap Up It’s an okay game with a sad story scattered around for the players to piece together
It’s not exactly a FNAF clone since it does have its own thing
If you have an extra 5 bucks lying around and you like quick bursts of jumpscares that will last about 30 minutes then get this game
--- TL;DR Pros:-The beginning sets up the atmosphere- Creepy at times- Sounds are timed well- Sad but interesting storyline- Clown doll…thing- Dolls in generalCons:- Although the sense of dread was there at the beginning, it flatlines fairly quickly- Needless trolling when it comes to the game’s mechanics- Crashes- Some players are have difficulty launching the game- Clown doll…thing- Dolls in general---If you stuck around me this long, and if you have the time, watch me fool around in Emily wants to play Emily Wants to Play Video

												Cute game about a girl ordering a pizza which in actuality is her way of bringing a playmate home for a foursome with her friends all night long
 Once you figure out the "games" she and her friends want to play and follow their "rules" you can make it through the night with relative ease along with a big tip and a happy ending
 Here are some hints I will give to help those having trouble getting paid for the pizza delivery and satisfying Emily and her friends
Spoilers/Walkthrough Below:1
Paper Notes can be picked up and read both on their front and back so turn them over for hints and story lore
 A flashlight can be found in one of the rooms and is needed to finish the game
You keep it even if continuing after death
Audio recorders can also be listened to and will provide backstory to the game
2
The game is broken into 7 parts/hours
After a certain amount of ingame/real time passes the clock will chime and move into the next phase of the game
When you continue, the game will resume at the previous hour you reached
     11PM-12AM is the intro to the game where you get to meet the dolls and explore the house
    12AM-1AM is playing a game with Kiki (the female doll in a black dress)     1AM-2AM is playing two games with Kiki and Mr
Tatters (clown)     2AM-3AM is playing two games with Mr
Tatters and Chester (male doll in suit)     3AM-4AM is playing three games with all three dolls          4AM-5AM is playing with Emily alone     5AM-6AM is playing with Emily and all three dolls 3
During the first hour of the game, the game itself is leading you to a "secret" by opening doors towards the parent's bedroom closet
In the bedroom itself is a note that will explain how to exploit the "secret" that will lead to the basement
Without opening the secret passage, it is nearly impossible to beat the game
Find the correct wall lamp in the room to touch
4
The white board in the kitchen gives hints on how to play with each dolls, the first three hours are a lie (due to winking face) so you want to do the opposite of what it says
When you hear a particular sound cue in a room, the game is telling you that one of the dolls has entered and you must deal with him/her
 Kiki has a childish chuckle, Mr
Taters has a low sounding chuckle, and Chester has a higher pitch laugh
5
These are the games each dolls/Emily wants to play and how to deal with them
 Kiki wants to play red light/green light with you being the light post so once you hear her chuckle look for her immediately and stare at her until she vanishes
If she is not in your field of vision she will make it to the light post (you) eventually
You can also run from her into nearby rooms which she may or may not follow
 Mr
Tatters is playing the same game but in reverse roles
Once you hear his sound cue, stop all movement immediately and wait until he goes through another two sound cues with the second sounding like a sigh
Once he leaves the room you may begin moving again
Chester is playing tag and he is "it"
 Once you hear his sound cue, run away into another room as fast as you can or he will tag you
 Emily wants to play hide and seek in the dark so once she shows up at 4AM, you are given a timer to find her in the house but luckily it's just the two of you
If you turn on a lightswitch, she will come after you for not playing her game correctly, so the flashlight is needed to proceed
If the timer drops to zero you lose and she will find you instead
Once you do find her and tag (touch) her, she will hide again in the house and the timer will reset
Each room has one possible  hiding spot so continue playing with her until the next hour comes and memorize the locations to save time seaching each room
If you don't find the entrance to the basement you may never get past this part since she sometimes hides down there
Also sometimes she is tricky but hiding in the same spot twice with each timer reset so check it again if you can't find her
Lastly, for the final hour Emily wants everyone to play so now you must continue to look for Emily through the house while dealing with the three dolls
 Run from Kiki (stare her down if you have the time though) and Chester but stop for Mr
Tatters
Make it through this and you finish the game
Good luck!

												EDIT: The ability to invert y-axis has been added (and x-axis for some reason) which should go a long way to help those more used to mouse look
Positives:Nice monster models
Effective jump scares (for the most part)
Some interesting gameplay ideas involving how to handle each monster
Negatives:The story is very much secondary to what is really only a 'jump scare' game
Items which explain what happened are few and far between
Since the back story is communicated in those same items you examine around the house, you will quickly find everything, and will be left with just evading the monsters for the rest of the game
Very limited settings: Widescreen only options, and no ability to invert mouse vertically
Later sections will throw you completely at the mercy of the randomly generated monster placements
Be prepared to replay the same part repeatedly until you get fortunate enough to progress to completion
Not recommended

												DO NOT PLAY THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE PLAYED 999 AND VIRTUE'S LAST REWARD ALREADYWithin minutes of starting the game there were several things talked about that relate to the two of them
Unless you have played them, you WILL end up simply confused and lost

												Its pointless for me to write a review saying to buy it or not to buy it
If you played the previous installments, I don't think anything I could possibly say could dissuade you from buying this one
If you have not played Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors and you have not played Virtue's Last Reward, go play those first and then you will fall into the former category

												The best series of all time but have to give a warning like many others have said on every review:PLAY 9 HOURS 9 PERSON 9 DOORS FIRST THEN VIRTUES LAST REWARD IN THAT ORDER
DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THE PREVIOUS TITLES OR A HUGE PORTION OF THE EXPERIENCE WILL BE LOST
IN ADDITION THERE WERE HINTS GIVING BY THE DIRECTOR THAT THE PREVIOUS TITLES WILL BE RELEASED ON STEAM, SO BE PATIENT OR FIND A WAY TO PLAY THE OTHERS
ALSO DO NOT WIKI THE GAME AT ALL BECAUSE HUGE SPOILERS ARE THERE EVEN IN THE FRONT PAGE
AVOID THE WIKIS
Moving on, there is no story that is epic like this series on PC at all
It's the best story period and not much details can be given because it will be a spoiler
This is what many people will tell you about the Zero escape series when trying to explain it to you
However all we can say is that the game starts out basically as you being a participant in a game with other people
There are decision making events which effect actual outcome and you will get different experiences from each choices
There are puzzles as well which play a huge role to the story
You'll learn theoritcal ideas and you will learn knowledge which are used in real life work environments
At first, it starts out simple then the story just explodes and branches out in to braingasm of events in which you won't get the experience in any other games
This one expands on the previous title in a much bigger way you won't expect if you played the previous titles honestly
The first title is about 5 to 9 hours if your only going for the story which is still good enough, second title Virtues Last reward increases to 40 hours and finally this one goes beyond that in terms of elements
I own both the VIta version and PC in support of the team that made the series and trust me I don't buy multiple port versions of a game if it sucks
This game has done an excellent job on the PC side on it's first try as well
The Series has won awards in the past for best story so please consider playing the previous titles in order before playing this game without looking at the plot
It's 100% worth it!

												Zero Time Dillema is a good game, but its the weakest of the entire 999 series
First off, the puzzle design could use some improvement
The escape rooms have a lot of repeat puzzles
One type of puzzle re-appeared in 4 different escape rooms
It isn't even a particulary interesting type of puzzle
Granted, the 999 series has always had repeated puzzles, but usually you would only see repeats in the final escape room
The real cool feature of hard mode versions of puzzles from VLR is also missing from the game
It was cool to be able to solve a puzzle multiple ways
The game also basically gives you the solution to some puzzles if you don't solve it right away
This is really annoying because some puzzles require you to look at an item in your inventory before you solve it
The game still has some interesting puzzles though
How the game handles some of its characters is also lacking
Compared to the rest of the series, the character design is really low-key
Part of the 999 series' appeal is the flashy characters, Due to the nature of how the game works, some really unatural characterization is forced on an important character
It doesn't really add up with the character's history, despite how they try and justify it
Furthermore, the character is even made ignorant of knowledge they should know at this point
It also doesn't help that some of the animation is really low quality, so you get some wonky facial expressions from some characters
Thankfully, the story still has the signature craziness of a 999 game
It certainly goes places
Although it also unfortunately fails to resolve some hanging plot threads from VLR
It does leave an opening for a sequel, but to be honest, I'd be happy if the series ends with this game
Overall, I did end up enjoying the game a fair amount, so if your a fan of the previous 2 games you should definitely pick it up
			
Posted: 6 July, 2016
												This comes from playing the first two games in the franchise and thouroughly enjoying them
   To begin, this isn't a horrible game in and of itself
 But it suffers, struggling in almost every area
 1
New people are going to have an impossible time getting in to it
 It starts slow out of the gate  just trying to catch up newbies with a massive information dump, and it's going to create a lot of head scratching
 There is some dense dialogue about premises from the previous games that is hard to swallow
 Its still possible to approach for new players, but I can't possibly see it being as enjoyable for the first hour
 2
 For fans of the series, there are some red flags for you as well
 The presentation completely restricts the narrative and makes no sense
 Unlike the previous two games, this isn't strictly a choose your own adeventure story
 By adopting what the game calls "fragments", you basically play only snippets of a story, before jumping to another line of the story
 Your choices don't result in a feeling of accomplishment or weight
 Instead of encouraging choices about how to progress through the story, its really just an inane system where you put check marks in a box as you move along
 3
 And the story
   Don't get these games wrong
 There are always puzzles, but the puzzles always play fiddle to the story
 There aren't very many and they aren't hard enough to challenge someone who likes puzzle games
 In the past, this has been okay because the story was so good
 But the story is lacking in this installment
    The first half is addled by the presentation like I've already said
 The elements are all present to be interesting, but its a slog; however, the third quarter is where this game shines
 For a brief moment, it gains some direction and feels like its headed somewhere big, and the excitement is there
  But then
 Without spoiling anything
 The home stretch of the story is the most ridiculous series of deus-ex-machinas that I have ever seen
 There are huge concepts that are introduced at the very end with basically zero set up, and, somehow, even less explanation
   Its borderline offensive how stupid it becomes
 In summary
 There are moments of greatness, but most of it is a slog
 The puzzles are fine and the story is a slow build that nose dives just as it becomes satisfying
 Players of the first two will inevitably play this, but it won't live up to the previous installments
 New players?  Just go play the first two games (999 and VLR) if you can get your hands on them
 They are fantastic
 I was excited to play this game
I loved the first two
 But I am extremely conflicted about this one
 It's not a bad game, but its not good

												Before you read my review, there are a few things you should note:- This game is very text-heavy and you will be doing a lot of reading and listening
- This game is rated 18 for a reason; topics and imagery that could make people feel uneasy will appear in this game
- You're probably going to need a notepad and pen If all of the above things bother you, you probably won't like this game
If you're alright with these, then continue to read! Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma - Overview9 people wake up to find themselves trapped in an underground facility
They're told the only way they can escape is for six of them to die
In addition to this, they'll be put to sleep and lose their memories every 90 minutes
You're also told a story about a woman going for a run
She comes to a fork in the path, however this time she takes the left path rather than the right path like she usually does, because there was a snail
Two hours later, she's murdered
In ZTD, you become the snail
(Metaphorically of course, but that would be pretty cool
) Zero Time Dilemma is the third (and final) game in the Zero Escape series, straight out of the mind of the wonderful Kotaro Uchikoshi
The game features a non-linear narrative (meaning you don't have to play the game in a set order), and depends on your choices and their consequences to advance
There are essentially three parts to ZTD: cutscenes/story, Escape Rooms, and player's decision
Like I stated above, there is a lot of reading to do as the cutscenes feature heavily between different segments of the game, and (depending on how adept you are at puzzles) you're probably going to spend most of your time watching these cutscenes
The escape rooms are the majority of the gameplay - you'll be placed in a variety of different rooms, and must use your own knowledge and the items and clues provided for you to make your escape
Players decision is exactly what it sounds like, similar to the choice aspect of Life Is Strange, but with a bit more of a twist - the choices you make are weighted on a percentage chance, so they may end well or they may end horrifically
Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma - My ThoughtsI have played the entire Zero Escape series (albeit in the wrong order - oops), and I love them
As a puzzle fan and an avid reader, the series is perfect for me
However, you do not need to have played the previous two games to enjoy Zero Time Dilemma, but it is recommended
I repeat: you do not need to have played the previous two games to enjoy Zero Time Dilemma
Story: The story behind ZTD is phenomenal
Every twist and turn poses more questions, and you feel as though you can't stop playing until you've found all the answers
There are many different endings to explore, both good and bad, and you won't feel like you've truly completed the game until you've seen them all
As previously stated, it follows a non-linear story and you can play it in any order - which works extremely well due to the participants losing their memories every 90 minutes
They don't know what order things are happening in, and neither do you
However, as endings are unlocked, you'll be able to see the game's story flowchart, and this will allow you to pinpoint things you've missed
Gameplay: I love the gameplay within ZTD
I've managed to escape all of the rooms without help, but I did struggle and become frustrated at points
Escaping from a room off of your own back is extremely rewarding though, so try not to use guides unless you're 100% stuck! (See my tips for escaping below
) The only thing that bothers me, is lack of gameplay during the first hour or so
The introduction is quite heavy, and you'll find yourself waiting a while to get into things
Characters: The characters are very interesting too
There are 4 returning characters from the older games, and 5 totally new characters - and they've all got their own story to tell
You start off by only knowing their names, but after playing through their teams fragments, you'll slowly learn how they came to end up in this messed up game of murder
Whilst I'm on the subject, the 9 people are split into 3 teams, each with a team leader (and that's who you'll control)
But I honestly loved getting to know them all, some of their backstories really took a turn for the worse
Visuals: The art and animation is average honestly
Now, this does not mean bad, it just means compared to the rest of the game, I don't favour it as much
If you love the artstyle from the Telltale games such as The Wolf Among Us and Telltales The Walking Dead, you'll probably like the art in ZTD
However, the animations are quite clunky, and the mouth movements can be quite bizarre at time
That being said, the team making the game was small and they had limited time and resources so they did a great job considering that!Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma - Pros and ConsPros:- Compelling and interesting story- Amazingly written characters and backstories- No puzzle room is the same, and they will all make you think- The addition of the skip text button!- Flawless PC port- Estimated 20 hours playtime without skipping/using guides- Gab Cons:- Janky animations- The memopad (partially because it has a limit, partially because no one likes writing with a mouse or controller)- Lack of gameplay during the intro- No 'rotate' prompt on Xbox Controller (it's RB)- I pressed the button- Snails Do I recommend the game? 100% yes
I'm honoured that Spike Chunsoft provided me with a review copy, ZTD is currently my favourite game of the year
If you love mysteries and puzzles, get this game! Fantastic

WARNING: Zero Time Dilemma is the third installment in the Zero Escape visual novel series
If you care about avoiding spoilers and sticking to the correct order of story elements, do NOT play this game until you have met the following prerequisites:1- Finished the Nintendo DS game "9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors" and attained all endings
2- Finished the 3DS/PSVita game "Virtue's Last Reward" and attained all endings
Otherwise, playing Zero Time Dilemma without doing the above will spoil most of the plot line for you
IMPORTANT UPDATE: I have finished the game and will now write my review below
However, a bit of news first
It was recently confirmed that the first two Zero Escape games will be ported, most likely to Steam
It was also suggested that 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors may also receive voice acting
Now, the review
Review (Without Spoilers)Being the third installment in a series of visual novels that already far exceeded my expectations, I thought it would be hard for Zero Time Dilemma to win me over
However, it did, and with flying colors
+ Exceptional storytelling, as expected from the great Uchikoshi
+ Mind-bogglingly fun puzzles in some of the later rooms in the game
+ Beautiful character design, especially Zero
+ Intense decision-making moments with befitting UI
+ Some reviewers argued that the voice acting is bad, and I agree only when it comes to a few characters
The rest are very well voiced
- The character animations feel unnatural at times (even though it appears they tried their best to avoid this)
- Though the music was sublime, too many tracks were borrowed from previous Zero Escape games, which I found to be lazy
All in all, if you've played the previous games, Zero Time Dilemma will offer you plenty of satisfaction and fond memories
If you haven't played the previous games, I strongly urge you not to play this game until you do
Have a wonderful day

Posted: 12 July, 2016
												Absolutely brilliant ending to this mind-bending trilogy
No amount of stale animations, "trial & error puzzles," or lacklustre voice acting can take away from how ridiculously fantastic the story is
The series made me question reality, it made me question who I am, how my mind works and why it works the way it does
The series has sparked an interest in me that I hope will never die
Zero Time Dilemma wrapped everything up, while still managing to create its own unique mind boggling tale, and great new characters
I cannot recommend this game enough, although I do recommend waiting until the first two of the series are released on Steam
It's a shame they're being released out of order this way, but I'm just glad that more people get to experience this masterpiece of storytelling
In my opinion this is one of the purest forms of "interactive storytelling
" It truly shows how video games can produce stories that would never work in another format
It's just so goddamn good
Seriously

												Ok, I've finally completed the game, so I'm making a review for this
Before I start WARNING: SPOILERS
Now this isn't going to be a review saying something like "BEST GAME EVER 10/10" no, I'm actually going to put time into making this
Now Scott Cawthon, you are a great man
This game is definitely different from the other FNAF games, and you actually took time to make this game instead of the normal 3-4 months of developing
The teasers look great with those special effects, and I love how you tried to keep everything balanced and not show much of gameplay in the trailer
Speaking of gameplay, let's talk about that
Now the only problem I had with the previous FNAF games is that the gameplay was the same thing and repetitive
No matter what in FNAF 1-4 you  are doing the same thing  each night, but just more animatronics
(In FNAF 4's case, one animatronic changes things up
) In this game you're doing something different on EACH night
Now that is what I love to see, a FNAF game that doesn't have repetitive gameplay each night
FNAF: SL also has different elements, instead of waiting until it's 6AM you actually have to keep progressing until your shift is complete, I can say that this game is pretty much faster than the previous games because of that and the fact there isn't any extra nights, but that's if you can
Not only is Sister Location different, but it's more difficult than the other FNAF games (Especially night 4
) so if you're planning on doing a speedrun of this game, you better completely master your skills first, because like I said this isn't your usual FNAF
Now, I'm not gonna go too deep in the story, but I will say that it's very good, of course since it's FNAF, it is dark, but it is also much more interesting than the usual lore
This is by far, the best Five Nights At Freddy's game, it's worth the money, it won't feel rushed, and best of all it has very nice voice acting
The voice acting is absolutely amazing, I love how Baby talks in a calm, monotone voice, and Funtime Freddy sounds like an insane killer clown
Is there things that I don't like about this game? Yes there is, I'm not calling the game bad, these are just a few things I don't like about it
(I won't say Night 4, it's meant to be hard)The checkpoint system, ok, I understand getting jumpscared is a penalty for dying, but some of these checkpoints are ridiculous
For an example, if you get killed by Freddy in the Breaker room, you have to crawl though Ballora gallery
That's not really how a check point works, what's the whole point of crawling through Ballora Gallery again, why don't we just start over in the Breaker Room?ULTIMATE SPOILERS AHEAD!The Worst checkpoint in this game, is dying from Ennard in the Private Room
If you fail to complete the Private Room section, then you have to start all over in the control module and do that code thing with Baby again, and run to the Private room again, I don't understand why we have to go through all of that over and over, when we can just start in the Private room, I mean I love how it's a throwback to FNAF 1, but seriously, why do we have to start all over if we die?I will give this game a 9
5/10, it would be a 10/10 if the checkpoints were better
Thank you again Scott Cawthon for making all of these games, and this one was definitely worth the wait

I just cannot express how much I hate Night 4
8/10			
Posted: 25 December, 2016
												A very good game, only the difficulty is kinda wavy
SPOILERS AHEAD:   Night 1: Far too easy, you don't do anything ; Night 2: Difficulty off the scale with ballora trying to catch you, if you don't have VERY high quality gear, you can't even hear her ; Night 3: Again, too easy
; Night 4: Difficulty OFF THE SCALE with those annoying Minireenas coming at you from all sides ; Night 5: You don't do anything, you only hear baby guide you through everything
Minigame (for 2nd Star) You spend about 2 minutes figuring out how to do it, but the hard part is actually doing it
Ennard Boss Fight: Same as Night 2 	Pros: No lag Pleasant graphics 3D rooms very well done Amazing Storyline Custom Night Awesome Sounds Immersive gameplayCons: Minigames are a pain Difficulty changing frequentlyI recommend it! BUT you should consider some high-quality headphones for this, if you don't have any i find that FNaF 1 and 3 are better for you

												Here is a non fanboy or cancerous, entirely honest review of this product,The graphics of this game are good, not quite as good as some other modern games, but it still looks very good
The sound is good, although the soundtrack is very sparse, however the very little sound that we get is important so that you can locate an animatronic
The gameplay is great, and puts a new twist on the series, not just the sitting in the office until 6am trope, (unless you perform certain things to get to a point where you can), instead choosing to play the game in minigames and being more story driven gameplay wise
When playing you can tell that time and effort has been put into this game, and it is worth the price, however if you wish to get scared, that is also covered very well
I rate this 7
5/10or a 9
5/10 if given a rank for it's place in the series alone
			
Posted: 30 October, 2016
												Pros: Night 1, 2, 3, 5         A lot of good story and intrigueCons: Night 4			
Posted: 7 October, 2016
												Much better than the previous ones, it's clear that more effort was put into this as there's more new gameplay mechanics
I have only completed the first two nights so far but it seems to be actually interesting
New features/improvements:CutscenesVoice acting for animatronicsMultiple voice-acted charactersMore interesting hidden lore/story
The Game Theorists might go back to FNAF because of this
The nightly shifts are not timed (at least not in the first two nights so far), but instead require you to complete certain tasks
You are able to actually move around the whole place, without being restricted to one room
Gameplay that involves more than just shutting doors your room
Combines a lot of the good gamepla elements from previous FNAF games, like having to listen for sound, looking at the map, etc
Has a funny cutscene after completing each shift, which gives a 'comic relief' element for completing a night
It seems to have checkpoints
I died once and the game restarted from just before I died, without having to do the whole shift again
Does not feel 'recycled' like most of the sequels to the original FNAF

												I am one of the biggest fnaf geeks ever and this game was my most favorite out of them all!! it was absolutely fantastic!  atmosphere was very creepy and the voice acting was beutiful! i love how the game was a free roam! i had so much fun playing this! the day it can out was one of the best days of my life! :D

												my own fish shot and killed me
			
Posted: 17 October
												First, it's a text-based game
 There are great illustrations, but the game play is all about reading and responding
Second, a single play-through of the game is relatively short; maybe an hour or two
 Third, it's gay
 The main character is gay
 The relationships are gay
 The whole approach is gay
 It's just as advertised
If you're okay with all three of the above, it's absolutely a great game
 The dialogue is witty and frequently laugh out loud funny
 The situations and choices range from realistic, to absurdly bizarre, to "why doesn't this ever happen to me?"   One of the major strengths of the game is its branching in seemingly insignificant dialogue choices
  Deciding to wear a hat can change your entire life
 After a number of playthroughs, I'm still being surprised by the variety of outcomes possible and that some of the paths are more poignant than "happy"
 Occasionally, stepping through dialague that you've already been through to get to another choice can be a little long, but that's a minor nit and the payoff has usually been well worth it
 The game as delivered used censored illustrations of some of the encounter screens, but I consider this a NSFW game in any case with partial nudity and some written dialogue displayed in large text on the screen
 For personal use, the uncensored screens are a fun update noted in the forums
Overall, I found it engaging, fun, and worth well more than the $15
			
Posted: 14 October
												Fantastic game! Very well written with witty dialogue
A huge cast of likable (and dateable/screwable) characters
There are serious endings you have to really work towards, hot endings that are more for


"fun", and there are also some really funny "WTF" endings
The art is amazing
The sex scenes are incredibly hot (play them uncensored!)
I'm so glad Steam is giving gay people a platform in the gaming community
This game is important
Dream Daddy by the Game Grumps is a good game made by good people, but it doesn't take the risky moves Coming Out On Top does
What Coming Out On Top lacks in mini-games, it makes up for in genuine, realistic love stories and gay relationships that are actually sexual
This game gets pornographic if that's where you want to take the story
It doesn't shame or lecture the player, there are tons of fantasies you can live out in this game
The steamy (ha, STEAMy) scenes are clearly made for people who appreciate the male body
There's no fade to black after you start kissing
COOT has the balls (lol, balls) to actually let you make choices in these scenes
Want to be a top? Want to be a bottom? Cool, you can choose! But even more than that, what do you say during this event? How do you want you character to feel? Is this too much, and do you want to stop? You can
Or do you want to keep going and reach the


climax of the scene? WHERE do you want to


finish? The amount of choices you get in this game seem endless, even down to picking if the guys have body hair and beards, or if you want to use condoms or not
This game doesn't hold back
It's for grown ups, like the old adventure games of the 1980s used to be
Most importantly, this game can be a real tool for people who are thinking about coming out
It really shows how it's not the end of the world - but it's also not always a cake walk
You can have a really depressing ending, or you can be brave and fight through some tough choices and get the happy ending you want
Coming Out On Top gets an A+ from me
A LOT of hard work went into this, and it really shows
			
Posted: 17 October
												One of the best games I have played
It's nice to feel represented and be a part of the many romances that I've only seen straight people play out
Whether you have a crush on your best friend, or your professor, or the quarterback, this game lets you live it as the gay man you are
It also makes gay relationships seem realistic, and doesn't rely heavily upon stereotypes
All around, this game makes the gay me feel heard, and empowered
			
Posted: 16 October
												Bought this when it first came out years ago
Really hot
Between the various guys there's fantasies for pretty much anyone into guys
It's also just really well written, funny and entertaining
One of my favourite games
			
Posted: 16 October
												This game defines the term "hidden gem" for it has everything you'd ever want from a dating sim
Beautifully written story with characters that you simply can't get enough of
I originally bought this game in 2014 simply looking for a game with hot guys but man, this really exceeded all my expectations! So glad that it was released on Steam :)			
Posted: 16 October
												I cannot recommend this game enough
Bought it on Kickstarter some years ago and didn't cry over the 20 €
Pro:Finally (!) a dating sim with non-anime artwork, excellent writing, funny lines, lovely pictures, explicit content (if you're over 18), loveable characters 


and it is all gay! Hurray! You can even decide if each of the characters (plus the mc) has beard and/or body hair
Same goes for all the one night stands
Very nice and helpful developer who does her best to assist with problems
There are just two negative points for me:1
The music lacks a bit but that's a minor thing since the rest is really done very well
Apart from the opening track the rest of the music is quite boring
2
Some routes are way longer than others
If you happen to like Alex best, you may find his route is not that much worked out like, for example Amos
But maybe that is just my personal opinion and you might be satisfied with it
Fish are evil

												***Check steam forum boards for instructions from developer on how change to de-censored version***I played this game before it was on steam and I can honestly say that no other gay visual novel compares
The writing is witty and fun and honestly, if the naughty bits where removed I would still enjoy the game
Each character has a distinct personality and while I don't think all the routes where equal I found myself playing through each route multiple times to try to get all the CGs
Not to mention the one-off "Bro-finder dates" which are hilarious and amazing
 Coming out on Top is an equally fun, funny, and steamy game
Obscurasoft made one of my favorite visual novels to date and is well worth a try if you’re into man on man action

												I actually have never played a VN before this one so i can't really gauge it accordingly
I saw it on the store and thought to myself that "well i have this friend that always tells me how great VN's can be and since the guys got my attention"
In all honesty i thought  this will be a corny piece of crap since i never found a game that respects the context of this game
Well i was surprised
The writing was witty and i could actually read all of the content without the need to cringe
The game in general made me feel ok to be gay and did not try to dirty it or make me feel ashamed so the main thing i want to say is thank you to the developer for making it
I don't know if i will ever play another VN but never say never especially if this developer makes more

												Lemme tell you a story
2 months ago when I was browsing on YouTube, I came across one of the insert songs of this game
It was an ending theme for a certain ending, I am not gonna spoil it, but damn
All the feelings I had when I got to the ending 6 years ago just hit me again all at once
Despite that I forgot the most part of the story already
And yea, I never turned the game on ever again after I beat it
I hardly even talked about it with people
You don't even need to understand what the story is about and what is actually going on within the entire mess to enjoy it, because it isn't even meant to be understood anyways
It's simply a bizarre and unforgettable experience that you need to go through
Just buy it, finish it, then go enjoy your own wonderful everyday
And yea, make sure you check out the important announcement before starting the game

												Before diving into the juicy details, some "technical" stuff that I think isn't talked about enough:I finished reading Wonderful Everyday, henceforth "Subahibi" to save keystrokes, after 54 hours
A few of these hours are from idling
Fifty hours may sound long, but individual chapters are no longer than 5-6 hours each
As a result, you can experience a satisfying "playthrough" in one sitting
You won't be saving at awkward times, nor will you be briefly disoriented loading a save after a break
I'll be talking about this chapter format a lot more later on, it's pretty important to how Subahibi works
Although Subahibi has some choices, it is fundamentally linear
The player has basically no effect on the story, so you do not need a walkthrough
PlotTwo student deaths start a disastrous chain of events
One student investigates the deaths after a strange encounter with the second deceased shortly before her suicide
From beyond the grave, she sends text messages to students about her goal to save the world from destruction, tormenting a specific few
One student declares himself humanity's "savior," intent on leading believers into the End Sky
Subahibi has supernatural and psychological horror elements
As a whole, the most accurate genres might be thriller, mystery and tragedy
There is a lot of disturbing content, and it doesn't pull any punches with its execution, giving the reader a front-row seat to everything that happens
This includes depictions of bullying, sexual assault, suicide, and murder
This content is mostly in the middle third of the game; the beginning and ending are relatively tame
StorytellingEach chapter in Subahibi is narrated by one of six different characters
The game is fully first-person narrated, without any third-person interludes, so you experience the story just as the character would
Many of these narrators are shown to be unreliable narrators, and it usually isn't clear who is unreliable when
And when it is obvious that someone is delusional, Subahibi goes the whole hog with some crazy absurdist scenes
Most but not all of the chapters cover events leading up to July 20th, 2012, the prophesied date of the apocalypse
Every character sees the world differently
Many non-narrator characters only appear in one or two chapters
Most importantly, not all chapters cover the same days
For example, one might take place in July 10th-14th, another might be July 12-20th, and another might be July 8-12th, 14th, and 18th (I completely made these dates up, don't sue me)
The result of all that is that you are constantly shown contradictory events, and your understanding of what happens and why or how it happens is constantly changing
One chapter shows you X, another shows you Y, but you don't know that Y supersedes X, and you don't know that one of X or Y is true, maybe it's Z
Subahibi forces you to reevaluate what you thought you knew at every turn, making you feel anxious and confused, just like the characters
AccessibilityFor some reason, some people who haven't played Subahibi think that it's esoteric, incomprehensible, highfalutin, the kind of thing that would use the word "highfalutin
" Don't worry, none of that is true
Subahibi references a lot of philosophy, mainly from Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, but its aim is to teach it, to make complex philosophy understandable through a compelling story
It's kind of like how Flatland teaches you about dimensions and geometry
In fact, Subahibi even references Flatland a couple times
The philosophy in Subahibi is pretty grounded, too
In the end, the philosophy serves the actual story itself
You don't need a game theory Ph
D
to enjoy A Beautiful Mind, after all
Subahibi encourages and rewards paying close attention to the story
This isn't the kind of thing where you zone out while reading


until you suddenly regain consciousness and realize you don't remember a single word you saw in the past ten minutes
Every detail is meticulously placed, with tons of foreshadowing and callbacks
But as with all foreshadowing, you don't have to catch everything in order to understand the story
It's just sitting there, tempting you into devising hypotheses to explain everything
Subahibi even directly provides some hypotheses for you to ruminate on
SummarySubahibi is a transformative work of art
It is as much designed as it is written
Subahibi makes you want to re-read it even before you finish reading it
Subahibi keeps you at the edge of your seat with more plot twists than you thought possible
At other times, Subahibi makes you dread clicking your mouse
Subahibi uses tools unique to visual novels to tell a tale that could only be told as a visual novel
That's not something I can say of any other VN I've read
TranslationDespite my better judgment, I saved this for the end because as you might be able to tell, I really like this game
But the localization is such a disappointment
It seems accurate, and it doesn't sound awkward or stilted, but it simply isn't polished
A line starting with a quotation mark might be missing one at the end, or vice versa
I saw "closely" spelled as "cloely," I saw "journalist" spelled as "jouranlist
" There aren't that many errors, but they're very noticeable and easily preventable, there obviously was no QC
It won't affect your ability to understand the game, but it's still a bummer

Everything changed when you apply the 18+ patch 
The REAL STORY about Wonderful Everyday Down the Rabbit-Hole is behind the 18+ patch
Beware, this is not for the faint of heart			
Posted: 1 October
												Just to make it crystal clear ahead of time
If you're looking for heavy sexual content romantic visual novel, you might consider to pass this one
Wonderful Everyday is considered to me a beautiful well-written philosophical visual novel
Each chapter hold mystical meaning, and logically can not be explained if the reader doesn't proceed into next chapter
Every story is built on one another
The stunning discovery of the time when reader realize the connection between each chapter is phenomenal and not like every visual novels can tell a story this astonishing
It is true for me that my reading began in very depressing mood
Certain storyline contain disturbing images and upsetting endings that frustrates me as I keep reading
But if you enjoy the process of discovering the truth and how are those things happening, keep on reading is the only chance you can get yourself out of this "depression"
I believe readers can see this world in a different way by finishing this visual novel
As human, we have the gift to think, and this visual novel actually provokes the ability of doing so
I do highly recommend to those people who like to think philosophically to read this masterpiece

												It's been a while since I've read a good denpa visual novel, and I think there are quite a few who would agree that Subahibi is one of the best
Subahibi kept me hooked in from the very beginning, and I only got more and more interested as I read on
The first episode starts slow, but is crucial to the story and has a fair bit of foreshadowing
"It's My Own Invention" and "Looking-Glass Insects" is where a lot of controversy about the game seems to come from, but every last disturbing detail services the plot
The story really shines in its narration style, in my opinion
I loved looking into the same timeframe and events from different perspectives, revealing more and more as I advanced
The soundtrack is fantastic as well
Each song fits each scene perfectly, adding to the emotion whether it's fear, unease, melancholy, or happiness
A few of my personal favorites are "Yoru no Himawari" and "Denpa Relay no Shousha
"All in all, out of the 40+ visual novels I've read, Subahibi comes out somewhere near the top
I highly recommend this to anyone that wants something more than light reading, that will require them to think, and is fine with the more disturbing areas of the story (which weren't actually as bad as I had been expecting)

												Lone Survivor is a 2D psychological survival-horror game that pulls a lot from David Lynch and the Silent Hill series
I originally played it back when it came out from the developer's website, and have played through it a few times since also on Steam and on the PS3
You play as a nameless character who is stationed in an apartment in a ruined city
Each day is a struggle, with limited supplies and draining willpower
Our character decides that he doesn't want to die alone, and sets off to find someone else to give meaning to his minimal existence
As he ventures out, he does meet other characters, but they all seem rather odd
Are they real, or a figment of his imagination? Is everything as it seems, or just an illusion?The game has atmosphere in spades
While the graphics are low-res and pixely, the game has a fundamental understanding of the effect minimalism can have on games; like the original Silent Hill or Resident Evil, your mind fills in the blanks of details
Everything is just detailed enough to make out what everything is, but minimalistic enough that your imagination fills in the blanks
The game also utilizes some nice lighting and fog effects to help add to the atmosphere
The audio is fantastic, with moody and stylistic music, wonderful sound design, and while unsettling, adds so much to the experience
The game doesn't have jump-scares, but rather mood to unsettle and oppress you
Some will find this decision to make the game ultimately not very scary, but it remains tense and unnerving through tough obstacles and strange moments
The game is a bit cryptic, which might turn some off from the title
Something that most may not see coming is that our character has human needs for things like sleep, food, and rest of mind
If you don't take good care of your character, it effects him
And to take good care of him means to search around for things that may help, such as gas for his stove to cook things or a game system and batteries to use to play it with
You collect food and supplies from the environment, and from utilizing these elements you can help tend to your characters needs
Or you can not, and just do the minimum effort to get by
But choice in gameplay matters here
The game has about six different endings (one of them is a slight alteration of another ending though), with four available on the fist playthrough
Which ending you head towards is not determined by simple A or B choices, but by how you play the game
And most everything effects it
How often do you eat? How often do you sleep? Do you use the transfer mirrors to return home? Do you indulge in side-quest? Do fun but meaningless things to help your sanity? Do you help or hurt this guy? Do you kill or avoid enemies? All these choices add to an unseen score (that they finally show you after the credits) which determine which ending path you're going on
Well, that is except one ending, where you need to do a secret side-quest to obtain it
There are a few points the game drags on a bit, particularly of note in the basement segment where your map is near useless and maneuvering can become rather confusing
After completing the game for the first time, you'll probably have more questions than answers
To really get the full experience of Lone Survivor means to play the game more than once, in fact certain areas, side-quests, and endings aren't even available until the second playthrough
This kind of commitment will turn some off from the game
And for some the survival element will feel superficial, as the game essentially will give you anything you need if you don't mind gaining 'ending points' to go on a certain bad ending path
But it's also probably one of the truest Silent Hill games to release since Silent Hill stopped really being SH, and is one of the best 2D horror games to exist
To really dig into the game requires hard work to keep your sanity up and your spirits high, and rewards those that dig into the game's systems and figure it all out
Lone Survivor is atmospheric, and in my opinion, one of the best 2D horror games in terms of atmosphere, and one of my personal favorites
It has sim-like mechanics not all will care to manage, but those that delve into it will be rewarded with interesting story twists, revelations, and new areas
It needs to be replayed to be fully experienced, but likely will attract a niche audience with its surrealism and mysterious storyline
For those less interested in the strange, there is a pretty solid old-school styled survival-horror game here
It may not have all the bells and whistles, but it's an ominous adventure while it lasts

You know what, screw that make a sequel and make it better than the first game
			
Posted: 25 December, 2013
												I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is or has been a fan of psychological horror games
Lone Survivor has a very Silent Hill feel to it, and quickly allows the player to become immersed in it's interesting story line
Although the pacing can be a little slow at times when you're trying to discover what to do next, the game offers interesting puzzles and combat that requires you to be tactical, in a sense
The music for the game is incredibly catchy, but also quite dark, and goes perfectly with the game's dark theme and humour
Despite being only 8-bit, this game could be considered better than some big-budget that currently exist
I'd recommend this game to anyone who is in the mood for a retro psychological horror, or loves games that carry dark-underlying themes and immersive storylines
			
Posted: 25 November, 2013
												This is a great example of how outstanding music can elevate a game from good to great
I also do not want to disregard the writing in this game either
The creator managed to meaningful dialogue within the game without over doing it and without being corny
The retro pixel art is outstanding
The pacing can suffer a little from time to time as you wander around looking for what to do next
But aside from that, I enjoyed gradually making my way through the 7 hour campaign
The enemies are not found in abundance or varied but all placed with thought behind the room design
That and other attention to detail show me the the developer who made this game truely cared about what he was making
If you are in the mood for a retro survival horror game you probably won't do better than this

'My name is… not important anymore, I guess
[…] As far as I know, I’m the only one left
The Lone Survivor
'You__________________________________________Introduction'Lone Survivor: The Director’s Cut' is one of these little games that shows how good indie titles can be
This little pixelated horror adventure suceeds where many huge (Horror-)AAA-titles fail nowadays: Creating a deep and atmospheric experience full of creepy and mysterious situations without relying too much on (cheap) tricks like e
g
jumps scares behind every corner
After the outbreak of an unknown disease the nameless protagonist – only called 'You' – tries to survive in this harsh and cruel world
He lives withdrawn in a lost apartment building, unsure if he is still sane or if everything he sees is only a hallucination
Due to the questionable mental stability and the omnipresent problem of starvation he doesn't know how long he may be able to stay alive
First of alll 'You' doesn’t want to die alone – therefore he starts exploring the apartments and looking for other survivors of the catastrophe
While exploring the remnants of the 'good old times', 'You' will be confrontend with deep fears and mysterious situations, monsters and hallucinations, unsure what is real and what is just a trick of his own mind
Armed with a flaslight, batteries and a gun with very limited ammunition he makes his way into the unknown depths of the apartments, facing mysterious horrors while trying to keep the rest of his sanity and finding enough food to eat and time to sleep
The only 'true‘ friends he has in this apocalyptic world are a plant and a plush doll – but is it really a sign of sanity to talk to them? Who knows…The story is short but well done and the dialogues make you actually care about the characters, their well-being and their behavior, questioning the situations that 'You' has to face in and what’s really happening in front of him as everything may change in the blink of an eye
And in the end every step and decision you‘ve taken may affect him
Until 'You' will see the end of his journey it will take approximately four up to maybe five hours (I finished the game already two times outside of Steam, therefore my short gaming time is no sign of lacking experience)
Fortunately the replay value is quite high due to many different endings based on your choices during 'You‘s' journey and a NG+ Mode with some additional content
__________________________________________Graphics and AudioTo cut it short: It’s a pixelated game based on Flash Engine so you shouldn’t expect too much – but for this it does quite a good job
The games‘ soundtrack is fantastic and fits most of the times absolutely perfect
It’s creepy and catchy at the same time, giving you the chills in the right moments
The pixelated graphics are well done and you can see that the different appartmens, rooms and scenes were crafted carefully and with a love for details
The game feels like a great trip in good old 2D-Horror Games and has a deeper atmosphere than many huge titles nowadays
__________________________________________ConsUnfortunately 'Lone Survivor' somehow feels bulky and using the inventory or selecting items can be quite annoying from time to time (just as using your gun in my opinion)
The controls aren’t very comfortable despite some hotkeys, remapping them isn‘t possible and due to the restrictions of flash games there is no easy solution for controller support aside from third party software – a fact where the game would benefit from heavily
That’s kind of sad as the PS3-version has both controller support and achievements (that are somehow missing in the PC version)
__________________________________________ConclusionThis game may give you the chills while taking you on a little journey about sanity, surviving and the horrors that are hiding either in the shadows or in your own mind
Sure, it has some flaws and edges but the overall experience is intense and it suceeds in creating a deep and nice atmosphere when 'You' tries to hide from the strange creatures or faces them – realizing that he’s actually out of ammunition
Moreover it has a brilliant soundtrack
Seriously
I’d rate it 9 out of 10 points and definitely recommend the game - it's worth the money, even without a sale
This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union, providing better standards for reviews and reviewers
			
Posted: 8 January, 2014
												Lone Survivor is a difficult game to reccommend
 I've been hearing good things about it from friends and various sources since its release, and I tried to play it when the Director's Cut edition first came out -- but it did little to hold my attention and subsequently collected pixelated dust for months and months
A few days ago, I forced myself to play it again at the behest of a friend who was convinced I was robbing myself of an amazing experience
 While I wouldn't call the experience 'amazing', I don't consider it a terrible one
 Lone Survivor is a game that has its moments of brilliance, but all too often this brilliance is marred by mechanics, lazy dialogue, and design theory
The GoodWe'll begin with what Lone Survivor has in its favor
Lone Survivor features a cohesive aesthetic, a persistent, chilling atmosphere, an engaging, apposite soundtrack and good pacing/length
The Aesthetic:The aesthetic design in this game is tight, cohesive, and remains this way throughout the entire playthrough
 Environments are detailed and fit nicely next to character models
 Characters are semi-detailed sprites, and all are animated well
 The Man Who Wears a Box was especially well rendered
 Enemies and corrupted environments are visceral and exploding with gore
There's nothing that stood out as exceptional to me in Lone Survivor's aesthetic, except for one: The text is presented in absurdly low-quality
 Reading it was a bit of a struggle at first, and even when I was used to it it was still ugly and strained my eyes
 I understand the intention behind the font, but readability need not be sacrificed in a retro font
Sound Design     Lone Survivor's sound design is possibly its best feature
 Sound effects are harsh, untempered, and low quality, which help augment the visceral nature of the environment around the player
 Monster screeches sound more like white noise and synthetically generated wave forms rather than actual grunts and gutteral groans, and I believe this helps add to Lone Survivor's unique atmosphere
Lone Survivor also has an apposite soundtrack that enhances the gameplay and conflates with the environment and atmosphere
 I find that many sountracks either don't do enough to augment the atmosphere of a game, or they are too zealous and begin to drown out other elements
 This one fits nicely somewhere in the middle
Pacing // Game Length: The game's pacing is quite good as well -- things develop at a satisfying rate, and the game doesn't hang on one section too long nor fill itself with useless padding; while at the same time still offering those who wish for an extended stay side-quests and multiple endings
The BadLone Survivor seems to work hard to make itself a very neutral experience -- for every good design decision or execution, there seems to be a poor one following closely in its wake
 Lone Suvivor suffers from sluggish mechanics, a rather banal pool of enemies, a narrative that is just a little too self-conscious of its esoteric nature, uninspired dialogue, and an underdeveloped character cast
Mechanics:Perhaps the most crucial flaw in Lone Survivor lies within its game mechanics
 Controls are clunky and there seems to be a slight input delay for most actions -- for instance, many times I would take an extra, undeserved hit from an enemy when using the flare hotkey due to the delay
 Combat is simple, basic, and unengaging
 Players are given the option to avoid combat using the stealth 'system' (if you can call it a system -- hit X to hide in pre-designated spaces, then hit X to unhide), but this is equally dull and boring
 There's an elaborate cooking system, but I also found this to be unengaging
 Food heals the protagonist as well as boosts his mental health, one of the metrics used to determine which ending you get
 Nothing's broken, but it's not ideal either
 Everything works and functions at an acceptable level, but nothing is compelling
 Because the game's mechanics were so prosaic, I felt absolutely no want nor desire to play the game based on them alone
 That meant that the narrative and characters had to do some heavy lifting -- which they didn't quite do, as we'll discuss in a moment
 To summarize:  Aside from the frustrating input delay and clunky controls, the mechanics work in this game
 They're just too basic or too dull to make for a fun or engaging experience
 I think many might argue that these clunky controls build tension in the game , as many other survival horror games have similar setups
 Yet that's an argument without weight, and one that excuses lazy or lackluster development strategies
 Tension could (or should) still be maintained regardless of the control setup
 Limiting a player's options is an acceptable strategy to build tension, but the options that remain available should be fluid, entertaining, and satisfying
Narrative, Dialogue, and the Cast:Lone Survivor thrusts you into its narrative in media res, but then does very little to supply the player with the backstory
 There are a few mentions by characters that hint at the past, but specifics are almost non-existent
 In fact, vague ambiguity is the main problem with the narrative: It's presented to the player as a large mystery to be solved, yet frustratingly little is resolved in the end
 It's a narrative that seems rife with potential and one that, unfortunately, instead only delivers minimal emotional impact
 Characters aren't given enough time nor dialogue to develop into something the player will actually care about
 And about the dialogue -- it's very hit or miss
 Sometimes it's fitting and poignant and interesting
 Other times it's tacky, too colloquial, or entirely too self-aware of its attempts to unsettle the player
 Many of the character developments and dialogue just feel like cheap, thoughtless shots that are meant to add tension
 For some, this might work
 For me, this only served to pull me further out of the world
Lack of Motivation:Tying all of these other issues together severly limited my motivation to finish the game
 There are mysteries (in theory) to discover, but there's so little information given to the player that I had little interest in solving them
 There are characters with which to interact, but I had no reason to care about them and felt no connection
 I felt rather insulted by the cheap shots in the dialogue with regards to generating 'tension' or 'suspense'
 I felt bored with the fact that there were only a couple of enemies that appeared throughout the entire game, and that all of them featured very predictable AI patterns
 There were only a couple of bosses, and both of those fights were inane and unimaginative
 In short, I had to force myself to finish the game
There are multiple endings, but I felt no want or desire to put the effort in to see the others (I did research them, however)
The GestaltThose who enjoyed the game and reccommended it to me argued against my complaints and averred that it was the gestalt of Lone Survivor and its experience that caused it to transcend its flaws
 From my perspective, this isn't a valid argument
 Something must carry the weight in order to deliver an excellent experience, and I don't see any element doing this in Lone Survivor
Lone Survivor isn't a terrible game, it's just a boring, unresolved one
So there it is
If you feel that Lone Survivor is still something that interests you after reading my complaints, pick it up and form your own opinions about it
 However, if you want a truly compelling survival horror game that delivers both stellar gameplay and a fascinating, coherent narrative -- look elsewhere

												After an apocalypse, you are a Lone Survivor lurking in the halls of a low fidelity 2D side scrolling, abandon apartment building
There is no power and supplies are limited
Every day you leave the safety of your humble bedroom in search of food and a solution to the mysterious, surrealistic hallucinations that are happening to you
What lurks beyond your apartment 206 walls are faceless mutants that only have a sense of smell to find you
This sense of smell leads them to find rotting chunks of meat that you can find in refrigerators and leave to bait them
Once you've dropped some meat, you can hide in specific areas and watch as they travel past you
You do find a gun, but ammunition is scarce and these wandering mutants take a few bullets to put down
Firing is slow, reloading is slow, but that comes with the genre
How can you be terrified of a mutant walking toward you when you can instantly kill it? Well how can you be terrified when you have a gun to take them down?Lone Survivor has all of the makings of a survival horror game or at least a point and click adventure without clicking anything
The game is keyboard only which under normal circumstances, I have no problem with, but I do prefer a controller
The real problem is there are plenty of keys to use and sometimes finding the correct key in the glow of your monitor can be a daunting task
There are keys for reloading, shoot and interact share a key, left, right, flashlight, map, leave meat, show the inventory and two other things
Eight keys in all and even more for gamma correction and so on
The game excels in an atmosphere and creepy vibe
Flesh covered walls you need to cut through
Coming across a party going on in a room while there are threatening mutants outside
Having to find a girl's stuffed animal
Saying hi to a plant as you pass by
Finding a girl locked away behind bars
You are a lone survivor though
How can you be lone and yet have all of these people inhabiting your wrecked apartment building? You're the only one tat seems to know there's any danger going on
Every so often you experience a dream or hallucination in the form of a cut scene that plays out and only adds to the odd experience
One cut scene has you and someone else in chairs discussing pills
It adds to the surrealism that the game brings
The radio in your bedroom and your plush cat toy are your only source of friendship
The radio gives hints as to what you should be doing and you will find cards that tell you what stations to tune into
Its a good way to bring you back to a game if you go long periods without playing
After all the best way to play is in the dark after midnight and who can stay up that late?I know that your character sure gets tired easy
He gets exhausted as much as he gets hungry and when he gets tired, you need to return to your room every ten or so minutes
Its only a constant recommendation
Something might happen if you take too long, but its never anything that you need to do right then and there
To make travel easier, you can look into a mirror and teleport your way through back to your apartment
It adds to the surreal nature of the game, and it becomes mandatory because you need to fight the whims of your character
He gets tired and hungry as we all would in a world of sheer darkness and famine, but he refuses to do things like traverse a hole he had gone through before
Its a good way to force you to use the mirrors as a sort of tutorial
Doors are locked and your character mentions coming back there later
You get a map of the apartment level with all of its rooms
Everything is marked, locked doors, blockages, open doors and so on
It feels small enough to learn your way around over several trips, but you can still get lost
Places to go are marked with giant question marks, but the problem is, these never go away, even long after you've explored everything in the room
There are plenty of items such as can openers, gas tanks for stoves and hams that need to be cooked that manage to still be fine in a refrigerator with no power
You can see an item's description in the menu
Some things are obvious, but its the food that you need to see if its spoiled before you consume it
There's also an option to talk with objects, such as your sleepy cat doll
Whatever keeps the crazy isolation away I suppose
While I do feel the menu is a bit cumbersome to use, it keeps you in the action because its just a minimal series of items at the top of the screen
I'd rather stay in a game like this than hop to a menu
When you see an item that can be interacted with, you still need to delve into the menu and use the item when it could have been streamlined so you just use it at the proper place
I can chalk it up to survival horror game design forcing you to figure out that you need to use a can opener on cans
You can find red, green and blue pills scattered around here or there
The choice to take them is yours, but I learned from arcade games in the 90s that winners don't use drugs
They accumulate to a sort of score at the end determined by what food, pills and choices that you made such as pushing drugs on someone
As a character, you're alone and sanity has gone with everyone else
You're wearing a medical mask that might keep out whatever mutating apocalyptic virus there is, but it also makes him look like he has a giant smile in this shambled building shooting "mutants" while downing pills
Lone Survivor feels like a good, simple game, but once all the mutants are dead the challenge goes with them
New areas have new mutants, but roaming through an empty wasteland for the fourth time can get dull
With an area so small, its never frustrating and the game lays out your objectives in a good manor to keep you going
Other times you'll need to check cabinets that you've already checked previous to being stumped in order to find a hole to crawl through
Its easy to recommend for its atmosphere, surrealism and simplicity
Its a good environment that takes you to a different place where there are no clear answers only your interpretations

												It's like a 2D Silent Hill game, but doesn't really deliver on horror for me
Its strength lies in its ability to make you wonder just what the hell is going on
It plays on the fear of the unknown, I'd say
There's almost always something weird and unexplained around the next corner
All in all, the game has very nice atmosphere, pixel art and just a tight survival gameplay mechanic

												This one actually managed to scare me
Not the jumpscares or cheap noises, but the atmosphere
It has a feeling of reliving your childhood nightmares: monsters coming to get you in your bedroom
Only two nights in, and it terrifies me already
For the other three games, I only really cared about them for the story that was supposedly hidden behind it, waiting to be uncovered
This one, however, I actually feel scared by
Of all of the series, I recommend this one much more than the others
VERY MUCH RECOMMENDED

												Apparently Halloween is on the 23rd of July accroding to Scott Cawthon


--------------------Edit:Ok, since this has somehow become one of the top reviews for this game, I decided to edit it so it's actually helpful
Firstly, the game was teased with images showing the Halloween date
This has led many fans to believe that the release date for this game was going to be on Halloween
However, Scott later announced that Five Nights at Freddy's 4 was going to be released sometime in August and that a DLC would be released on Halloween
But, even Scott himself said that he is bad with release dates and he released it early, on the 23rd of July
Ok, Now I'm actually going to review the game:Summary (TL;DR): It's completely different to the previous FNAF games but it's more scary and it looks better
Actual Review:This is the 4th and probably the final game in the Five Night's at Freddy's series, with an expansion pack coming out on Halloween and a movie being worked on which is planned to be released sometime in 2017
The game itself differs quite significantly from the previous 3 games because instead of playing as an adult security guard during a night shift, you play as a young child at home
This means that there are no cameras, no high-tech lockable doors and no power management
Before each night, the player is presented in an 8-bit styled minigame which explains the backstory and shows how the child is locked in his room and later starts walking around the house
Then the night starts, the gameplay mainly consists of running around the room, using a flashlight, and holding the doors closed as you can't actually lock them
You can run to the left door which is where Bonnie is, the right door where Chica is, the central closet where Foxy is, and you can look behind you where miniature Freddies or Fredbears can be
When you approach the door, you must actually listen  for someone breathing which forces you to turn the volume up which later makes the unexpected jumpscares louder and scarier
If there is no breathing, you can flash the flashlight to check if anyone is there
If there is breathing, then you must hold the door shut and wait to avoid being killed
You must also look behind you to make sure that too many mini-Freddies don't gang up on you
Then there's Foxy in the closet and I have no idea how he works
So that is the basic gameplay for the actual nights, however, there is one more thing which starts happening in between nights after night 1, the Plushtrap minigame
In the minigame, Plushtrap (a miniature version of Springtrap from FNAF 3) sits on a tall chair in front of you
He will not move if you shine your flashlight at him and he might move if you don't
There is an "x" marked on the floor in front of Plushtrap and the objective is to get Plushtrap to stand on that "x"
To do this, you must not shine your flashlight for a few seconds to get him to move
If you manage to make him stand on the "x" within the time limit, then the next night will be 2 hours shorter
To conclude, this seems to be the best and the scariest Five Nights at Freddy's game out of all of them
The animations are much more detailed and smooth and the gameplay is much more interesting than the previous games
			
Posted: 23 July, 2015
												The game was very tricky and hard unlike the previous games where it was easy once you got your patterns settled
I do recommend making the breathing a little louder since when I went to the doors (especially on night 3) I didn't know if a character was by my door or not so it kinda annoyed me a bit
However, It's one of the best yet, and I like the change
The DLC on Halloween will add so much more, and hopefully it will be a good close to the series, great game scott :)9/10 :)

												FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S 4 REVIEWFirst off, it has taken me forever to beat this game
Not because it was impossible, but because I've been incredibly busy
I honestly have to say that I really like this game
The obvious camera-checking mechanic is gone, and in turn has yet again changed the game entirely
That's the thing about the FNAF games
No one game is the same
They aren't cheap remakes, they're each innovative and change how the game is played in their own way
The FNAF series in my opinion really picked up around the third installment
In that game, there was less randomly-generated stuff and more skill-required gameplay
THAT is what the game needed
In the first two games, there was frankly too much random-generated BS that would kill you when it's not even your fault
In FNAF4, you have to rely entirely on learning sound cues and knowing where to go at the right time
You have to adapt to a new kind of game
You aren't overwhelmed with keeping up with things, you just have to listen and act adequately
This is a hard game
I mean that when I say it, I died many times on the first night
Granted that's because I still had to learn how it works, but it's no joke
All the way up until the game mixes things up on Night 5
You defend yourself against one animatronic, as opposed to four (hearkening back to FNAF3)
You get so used to hearing certain audio cues, then realizing that "Hey, that's not normal,"
You check outside your door and see something you've never seen before, and immediately die
Night 5 changes, even while you play
You're constantly learning new things and adapting to them
Not to even get started on Night 6 (which I beat) and Nightmare (which I did not)
Scott receives a lot of hate for putting out the games too fast, but that's just how he is
He works exceptionally hard, and he outdoes himself
He makes good games
Overall, it's a good game
The story to be uncovered is intriguing, and the gameplay has nearly been perfected
It's a horror game, but one you can have fun and enjoy yourself with
I recommend giving it a try

												This game, in my opinion, is the best in the series
The game lost its touch in 2 and 3 and I wasnt expecting much from this one, but when I got it, I literally fell off my chair!Overall, I would reccomend the 1st and 4th game for horror players, the 2nd game for the lore explorers, strategy players and minor horror players, and the 3rd for the casual horror players
9/10 best horror game I have played yet!

												Good adventure with a great story and a great voice acting
Devs really well made this little gem, little because the game is like 5 hours, the map is not that huge, it's a 2D indie with some interesting mystery facts
It's totally worth to be played in my opinion, especially if you're into adventure games where there is a lot to read
There aren't fights or weapons, just a radio that will help you through the game
Only thing, you really need a good english because the dialogues are quick, you don't have much time to pick your replies
Said replies matter a lot during the game, you can get your friends to hate you because of your replies, also pick choices that will affect your experience, so pick wisely


and fast!Very reccomended
8/10

Oh what a game!This game is something fresh and beautiful
Mystery adventure with amazing story
You arrive at the island with your friends to drink and have fun, but strange things start happening
You must explore the island, help your friends, find out whats happening and get out of the island
The game is purely story driven, there are no puzzles or anything
You just walk, talk with your friends and exploring the map
Maybe it sounds boring, but believe me you will be hooked up after 15 minutes of playing and will want to find out what's happening
You can choose what to say to your friends and this will influence the ending of the game
Choices matter in this game and you can get a totally different endings
Also the game has really nice and surprising online integration, to not spoil the game i will not talk about it
The graphics are very simple but the game looks amazing
This game is an example that you don't need amazing graphics to tell the story
Of course it would be nice to have graphics like Beyond two souls, but it would require a huge budget and a few hour game wouldn't sell many copies for 60€
Or developers could've chosen the cheaper way and made the game full 3D like Duke Grabowski or something like that, where character faces are emotionless and lip sync is horrible
This would ruin the game completely
So the simple graphics works perfectly for this game
The sound
The sound is amazing
A spectacular voice acting makes up for not seeing character faces and emotions
It is probably one of the best voice acting i have ever heard
And music is awesome, soundtrack helps to create that creepy, mysterious atmosphere
If you like story driven games and mystery, just get it without any thinking, you will like it

												I'm gonna keep it short and sweet:This game is an underrated gem
Oxenfree is the love child of "Life is Strange" and "Stranger Things" (the Netflix series)
It's a mix of time travel and 2 realities colliding (with one being much darker and gruesome than the other)
So if you are interested in any of that and actual choice based elements, this is your cup of tea/coffee/hot chocolate or if you dont fancy that crap, your can of beer/pop
Sod off if you like plain water, fizzy water still welcome
Jokes aside this is one of the games that I recommended to my friends the most, it has superb writing, gorgeous visuals, beautiful music and voice acting and an interesting storyline with choices that more or less make big differences
It also has replayability as there is a newgame+ option (which also adds some new choices and voice lines to the story) and there are multiple endings that you can get (albeit in the same concept with different meanings)
The voice acting is a huge thing in this game, you can hear emotions and valunrabilities in the character voices, as if it's really happening
Controls are great but there are a few places here and there that may frustrate you a little bit
(and this is probably my only minus points for this game)I feel sad that so many people ended up skipping this game because the screenshots and trailers don't really represent the depth that this game has
Believe me, it's worth your time and it is value for money
In any case, if you do grab it, I hope you enjoy it :)

												Get this
Get this and play it, preferrably all in one go
This is the first game in a while that kept me interested enough to complete it in one playthrough, albiet, I only completed one



storyline? The plot is amazing, it is a mindfudge, it has great art, its just


good
I originally got this as a palet cleanser, as something to play between some more in-depth games, but honestly, if I didn't have to work in the morning, I would continue playing this to get all the achievements available
I should also mention, DONT LOOK UP PLAYTHROUGHS OR HINTS, this game is about playing on your own, about finding out about who you are a little more
I know that doesnt make sense, but you'll understand once you play this
In short; if you like mystery, good artwork, building your own plot, deeper meanings behind things, being immersed in the story, and dont mind that youre not shooting, stabbing, or otherwise killing/maiming/destroying things, then play this
Do it
You wont regret it

												Can you walk and talk at the same time? If not, Oxenfree might not be the game for you because, for the majority of the game, that is all you will be doing
If warning lights are currently flashing in your brain and the phrase “walking simulator” is on the tip of your tongue, hold on for just a moment and let me explain why this game is worth your time
Yes, Oxenfree is a narrative driven experience in the same vein as any Telltale game and yes, the game has very few mechanics to speak of
However, rather than using “walking simulator” to describe this game, I believe the label “conversation simulator” would be a much more appropriate choice, as this is the area where Oxenfree truly shines and sets itself apart from the rest of its genre
On the surface, Oxenfree’s dialogue system is comparable to that of Mass Effect or similar titles; every time your character Alex speaks, you are presented with three dialogue choices that appear in different colored bubbles above her head
I say three options, but there is actually a fourth: to not say anything at all (you can actually play through the entire game without speaking)
Unlike in other games that allow dialogue choice, however, Oxenfree’s dialogue operates in near-real time; Alex will speak exactly when you tell her to, interrupting or talking over other characters
This makes conversations flow naturally without unnatural pauses and provides that real life conversation pressure of not wanting to interrupt someone who’s talking but also wanting to get to get your 2 cents in before the conversation moves on
However, a good dialogue system alone does not a great conversation simulator make
What really sells Oxenfree’s dialogue is its flawless writing and voice acting
Unlike Life Is Strange, where teenage characters are speaking lines obviously written by adults trying to immitate a vernacular outside of their experience, Oxenfree’s teens sound wholly natural
Lines are delivered full of pauses, incomplete thoughts, “ums” and “ahs”, and the kind of grammatical errors caused by talking faster than your thoughts
Sometimes lines will also just slowly die off or end mid-thought
I’ve rarely seen dialgue written and delivered so realistically, especially for adolescent characters in a video game
In my opinion, the game is well worth your time just the points I’ve listed so far
However, it would be unfair not to mention the rest of the game’s strengths! Firstly, its atmosphere
While Oxenfree may be marked as a horror game, I don’t think that label is appropriate here
While there may be one or two scenes that startle, Oxenfree’s soundtrack, visual design, and story combine to form an eerie supernatural thriller that is tense and head-scratching, rather than scary
And what a story it is! While it may start slow, using a clichéd horror trope of a group of teens spending a night in a remote location, the story quickly picks up and sucks you in
Characters are well rounded and detailed and the plot is paced well right up to its solid conclusion
If I had any criticisms to level agains the game, most would be related to the way you move around Oxenfree’s island setting
Many areas of the game are proportioned to allow space for conversations to play out
However, there are many cases where you have to backtrack the way you came without the luxury of a conversation to keep your mind off of the characters’ glacial movement speed
I also encountered several conversation-related bugs that prevented me from progressing
Although your choices subtley influence the course of the game  (there are no “Telltale will remember that
” cues), Oxenfree plays out largely the same over multiple playthroughs, giving it a lower replay value
Due to this fact and its short, 3 hour runtime, you may rightly decide to invest your money elsewhere
However, if you’re looking for a tight, well-delivered narrative experience that you can finish in an afternoon, Oxenfree might be just what you’re looking for

												I love this game
Like, I really love this game
The dialogue is organic and the voice acting is excellent - nothing the characters say feels forced or shoehorned in
As for the characters themselves they are well rounded, likable and don’t fall into any of the typical teenager stereotypes - and it’s refreshing, to say the very least
The atmosphere is consistently creepy and oppressive, even during the lighter, more comedic moments - and the soundtrack and visual aesthetic add to it
And when you find yourself alone, you really feel alone
It’s hard to properly describe, but you’ll know what I mean the first time you get separated from your friends
My only complaint is that sometimes your companions will occasionally get stuck either on corners or in the middle of a stairwell, but it’s fixed on transitioning to a new area
I cannot recommend Oxenfree more
This game is fascinating, terrifying and excellently written
If you are on the fence about buying it, I urge you
It’s well worth the price tag

												Options are simple enough, with Subtitles (NOT the default), Disable Effects, Windowed or Full-screen, and a range of resolutions from 640x480 up to 1920x1080
 I played the game entirely with my controller with no issues
Oxenfree is a compelling game for those who love dynamic story-games
 Replayability is added to by having multiple endings and a variety of achievements
 This is not a "I have no idea what to do next," kind of game with impossible puzzles and obtuse logic
 It's all about the journey
The graphics are not what I'd call compelling, but coupled with the stellar soundtrack, voices, and story, they set the stage for an environmental journey that will keep you riveted throughout
 You can see from the screenshots that the people are not super-detailed, and yet you can tell that the devs put some care into their mannerisms and movements
 For instance, when walking down a steep incline, the characters will lean way back and have the kind of jerky steps one has when they're trying not to lose control of their descent
 Little touches that add some realism and suck you deeper into the world they're created
Gameplay consists of 2
5D exploring, discovering secrets, and interactions with the people around you
 You will generally have three options to choose from during conversations, and your choices absolutely matter
 There are color-coded thought bubbles that show you which character is speaking, and if a face shows up in that bubble, it means that the character either feels closer to that person, or the opposite, depending on the situation
 Along the way you will discover a compelling story with plenty of "What the HELL?" moments
The characters themselves have well-defined, believable personalities that are absolutely evocative of the teen years, from their mannerisms right down to their word choices and life decisions
 This is not to say that they're annoyingly "angsty"


just that the devs did a beautiful job capturing their individual personalities
 The voice actors are masterful in their delivery, bringing them all even more to life
The soundtrack and sound effects range from beautiful to thought-provoking to downright creepy, and all of it atmospheric
There is one thing that I found semi-annoying about the game, and that is the loading screens
 They're artfully placed in a manner that is reminiscent of the breaks producers add to their shows to allow commercial lead-ins, but I still would have been happier without them
 I also enjoyed the first half of the game more than the second half, with the difference being more interaction with the unknown in the beginning, and more character-development in the latter parts


but that could also be because I was off exploring and looking for secrets instead of progressing the story
There are 13 achievements to be had, and it will take multiple play-throughs to get them all


The idea of playing again is OK by me, since there are multiple endings!  I managed to get 5 achievements and the second-best ending during my play-through, but I'd like to see where else the story can take me
 There are also five behind-the-scenes documentaries, but when I click to look at them, it just takes me to a loading screen, then back to the page you see upon entering the game
 Not sure what's up with that *shrugs*If anything in this review sounds enticing to you, then I think that you'll love the game
 Absolutely recommended!

												You know


when I had someone ask me, "Is this game worth the $20 price tag?", I had to sit there and wonder if I was just telling myself to like it because I bought it or if I really did enjoy myself
 After finishing the game (yes, it may not be an extremely long title but I also missed some collectibles), I would say that this is a strong start for Night School Studio
 It was hard to define this to that person when they asked if it was a puzzle game
 While there are certain situations that test your ability to remember or pay attention, there are actually no real puzzles in it
 Most of the time, you're walking through this dark and gloomy environment and conversing with the other kids
 The game is more narrative than anything else, but I feel that's where it shines
 Having to deal with the supernatural occurences on the island while working your charm to not have the other kids hate you really builds a great story and character progression
 Add in the wonderful music and the fantastic 2D environment with 3D characters that actually feel right, you're given a game that helps prove that 2016 is off to a wonderful start
That being said, the game is not without it's flaws
 First off, there's no audio sliders in the options
 Not a big deal for me, but I know some would prefer quieter music to voice acting
 While the voice acting is pretty great, there are audio issues as to when your character decides to answer over someone else
 Sometimes you'd like to wait for the person to finish, but the choices you make in conversations don't neccesarily stay there for long, so your character just ends up interrupting sentences before they start or mid sentence
 I also feel I encountered a visual bug in that something chose to not disappear, but I'm still unsure if that was the case
 It just felt off during the scene because it was there and no one seemed to question why it was there
  Also, the traveling may turn some people off of it
 As I said prior, this game focuses on story moreso than action or game mechanics, so if conversations during your walk time isn't enough to peak your interest, you may find yourself not liking it
 So maybe with that one massive piece of information about how it plays, the $20 may be too steep for some, but I recommend this title to anyone else who actually would enjoy story more than crazy gameplay
 Beautiful art, outstanding music, terrifying moments, wonderful character building, well displayed teen drama


what more could you want from a game that is a "sit down in one sitting" type of title?  If this is what we can expect from Night School Studio, I can't wait to see what else they can pull off
			
Posted: 14 February, 2016
												Oxenfree is one of those games that takes a genre of game in terms of play and art style and flips it on its head
The use of radio as a plot device as well as a gameplay mechanic leads for some extremely creepy moments and my fondest expierences of this game so far have been when you know you need to tune the radio and something scary will happen, but you just don't want to and you're left sitting there freaking out
Strongly recommend to anyone who enjoys character driven narrative and extremely creepy horror aspects

												This is a walking sim in the truest sense of that term
 You have no run, no jump, simply a slow walk
 I am a fan of this style of game, so this wasn't as issue for me
The game itself only took me a little over an hour to get through and thats was with me exploring the areas to find the hidden photographs
 With that said, I am not sure the $5
99 price point is going to attract many buyers
 In a market where walking sims are posted nearly daily, I feel this would do better at the $2
99 price point
 This does not mean I didn't enjoy playing the game, because I did, it just means I think in a market full of walking sims, in order to stay competitive the price should be slightly lower
 This developer clearly has a fairly good grasp on how to make this style of game, so I would like to see them be able to make more in the future
Now back to the game itself
 It was clear from the moment the game began that the developer used high quality textures
 This came with the upside of beautiful to look at areas, but the downside of some frame rate issues
 My GPU is a few years old now, but even on low/med settings I struggled to maintain more than 40fps in most areas
 Sure, if you have a newer GPU this probably wont be an issue, but thouht I'd point it out for those of us who don't have the newest PCs
 The different areas loaded quickly and it has windowed and fullscreen options
Gameplay wise, you follow a linear track most of the time, but remember to explore areas the best you can to find the hidden photographs, as they are part of one of the achievements
 The majority of the game you will be listening to voice overs and taking in the story, which honestly, was pretty good, albeit I do think it could of used a few more areas to explore, or possibly some puzzles to solve
 I say this, not only to increase the game time, but to increase the immersion as well
 I really did enjoy playing the game though, it was atmospheric, had decent voice work, and stunning visuals
 In a walking sim, thats pretty much all I need for me to recommend it
 So, I will recommend this game

Caligo tells the story of a man who appears to be trapped in a cycle of life and purgatory, where the final choice to break this cycle is determined by the player
There is a heavily atmospheric, psychological horror theme throughout the game, represented by contorted characters, dark set pieces, and abstract visuals
The standout feature of Caligo is its graphics
This doesn't feel like a standard Unity engine game
There is some great lighting and shader work going on, the textures are of a high quality, and the character design is excellent
The soundtrack is also befitting of the themes present throughout even if they may not be original compositions
The only issue I take with Caligo is the limited amount of voice actors, whose dialogue (and subtitles) often don't make too much sense as they are filled with grammatical/typographical errors and sound all too similar, even with pitch-shifting applied to various characters
There are some severe frame-rate drops, especially in highly foliage populated areas, where I could easily tell the game was dropping below 30 frames per second
I also found a number of issues in regards to clipping through geometry and coming up against invisible walls
The in-game settings are also oddly worded and could be further fleshed out
Caligo is a very short experience, about 1
5 hours, with two endings
I believe it's worth the price of admission due to the level of detail and consistent aesthetic throughout the experience
It is a simple game, there is no combat, no inspecting items, but where Caligo lacks in gameplay it definitely makes up for in visuals and an intriguing story
You can view my quickplay of Caligo on YouTube

												Caligo is the darkness of everyone descends into one's way or another, and to each of us
For some it's a short but exciting adventure, some will see it as a place to relax
Yet others will be reminded of their worst nightmare, while for a few, it might come as a revelation
Excellent simulator walks for a leisurely passage, beautiful graphics and history!

												*WARNING: SPOILERS!***Definitely was a good gameplay for my YouTube channel! :)When I first opened the game, the very clarifying, colorful aesthetics got to me the quickest
Everything was so well-detailed and illustrated, I swear that my eyes met the most artistic indie game ever designed
Aesthetics is number one here
Another great aspect was the flow of the story
The game wasn't so solely focused on the positive memories nor their negative counterparts
From stepping into the "colorful, fantasy-filled world" all the way to "war", the process of combining memories going from positive to negative is a great process, rather than the opposite
Doing so from negative to positive would give the wrong idea since the Master stated that "war" is the means to an end instead of "peace"
The way this game flows memory elements is incredibly logical
The last thing I want to mention is the good philosophical thoughts that were embedded within this game
I think the protagonist mentioned something along the lines of "


time stops when one sits down with a fresh brew of coffee and relaxes himself within a story
" You did what the protagonist did, and I really respect that aspect: as a result, Caligo is story-rich with nicely-unrelated imagery and mind-provoking critical thinking
Would give this a perfect 10/10, in my opinion!If you want to see my gameplay of it, here is the link: https://www

												STUNNING! I want to point out that this in my words is no game, but rather a story, you adventure in it and look for a few items(inked papers)
This story will be told to you via the narrator and he offers insight to all that you see so just go with it! I will point out that this story(Game) is Very Power hungry and does not support any running, jumping etc


Not like that would change anything with the SUPER power Hungry Graphics which the game shares as you progress on your adventure through the light and darkness of life
While this is called a game I would not say it is a story and the graphics make it worth its purchase
Remember you only get to find 20 ink sheets and get to play the the story twice as that is the only option at the end, but this kinda make it worth it
Have a LOOK as it is INSANELY STUNNING!

												This is a walking sim game
You have no run, no jump, simply a very slow walk (w,a,s,d)
I am not a huge a fan of this style of game, but this wasn't an issue for me
 The game took me 50 mins to get to the end
I am not sure the $5
99 price is going to grab many people
There are a lot these games
 I think this would do better at $1
00
I would like to see more content in future games
 The graphics where great even tho sometimes disturbing
  The scenery in the begging was great after 30 mins less impressed
The different areas loaded quickly
 Gameplay wise, you follow a linear track most of the time
The majority of the game you will be listening to voice-overs and taking in the story
I do think there should have been more areas to explore, or possibly some puzzles to solve
I say this, not only to increase the game time but to increase the immersion as well and I think you should have been able to click on more object even if they do not do anything
 I was sad to see we did nothing with the dreams :-(   I am saying no,  as maybe is not an option (ahem steam, please fix)

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Lucius Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags:  3D; Third-Person; Adventure; Puzzle; Sandbox; Horror; Stealth My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 4-6 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamersREVIEWLucius is a fun little game that puts you in control of a 6 year old spawn of Satan
 The story is in the same vein of the classic horror movie, The Omen
 The game itself mixes together a number of elements from different genres and the outcome is a pretty novel and entertaining experience
This game is frequently called a "sandbox" game, and it certainly is
 The whole game takes place in a rather small little "sandbox" that takes the form of a wealthy senator's manor
 But I feel the game is more accurately described as an adventure game that handles like a 3rd person stealth-action game in a tiny sandbox world
The game is quite short, (maybe 4-6 hours*), broken up into 18 levels
 In each you solve an adventure-game-style puzzle to murder someone for your father, the Devil
 The story itself is mediocre, but it is told well
 And there is admittedly very, very little content to the game
 Altogether, however, the flow of the story and the length of the levels mesh well into a game that creates a good atmosphere and paces itself perfectly to keep you entertained; so it ultimately feels pleasantly short-and-sweet
The graphics and sound neither take away nor add any value to the game
 I experienced no crashes or glitching whatsoever in my playtime
 The controls and interaction are intuitive and work properly
 Everything makes sense as you solve puzzles to beat each level, and there are various in game methods to get hints/help
 The game is short and entertaining, and worth a playthrough if you would be into what it offers
*I have a high playtime because I idled to earn an achievement

												I've rarely seen a game that embraces the bad guy as thoroughly and wholeheartedly as Lucius does
There's no hesitation, no complex explanations, no hedging of moral bets, or offering a suggestion that the game's victims kind of had it coming
In the game's opening minutes, the player is asked to lock a maid inside a walk-in freezer overnight, for no other reason than because the devil tells them to do it
Lucius is a singularly bleak and nasty experience, its only "redeeming" characteristic being the utter straightforwardness with which it treats its darker subject matter
Not only does the game refuse to shy away from depicting the horrifically violent, it lavishes attention on the atrocities, showing them in slow motion from dramatic camera angles
A third-person adventure game based loosely on the film The Omen, Lucius lets players control the titular character
This nefarious six-year-old spawn of Satan murders everyone foolish enough to come onto the grounds of the family estate
The game is broken up into nearly 20 chapters, each one themed around Lucius killing someone in his house without drawing attention to himself
To accomplish these violent ends Lucius has access to a variety of powers, including telekinesis, mind control, and spontaneous combustion
The game manages to find a wide variety of clever and gruesomely creative ways to employ these powers, but it's important to note that all the cleverness is on the part of the developers—there is no experimentation allowed, and each kill must be performed in a specific pre-scripted fashion
At times, this can make the game feel like it's on rails as the player moves mechanically from one kill to the next with only the barest context offered by cut-scenes
While the brutal murdering goes smoothly enough—in fact, most of the levels can be zipped through in just a couple of minutes if the player knows what to do—there are other aspects of the game that are downright rough
Two key stealth sections are far more difficult than they ought to be because the game never clearly expresses what its rules of stealth are
Even worse are the game's ill-conceived boss fights
There aren't many, but at certain points in the game Lucius is exposed, and has to kill a foe not through guile and trap-laying, but by throwing fireballs at them
The controls are a little wonky to start with, and in these sequences they completely fall apart
While the question of whether it's a good idea to put players in the role of a dead-eyed mute psychopath is open for debate, it's undeniable that Lucius's developers have captured the feel of their inspiration perfectly
There are missteps that keep the game from truly excelling, and the story is serviceable at best, but Lucius provides a unique horror gameplay experience

												Once upon a time there was a little boy called Lucius
He loved his bicycle, his cute teddy bear notebook and bizarre murders, you know like beheading a guy with a grass cutter
Do you really wanna know what's next? Did he make his father proud? Did anyone survive being under one roof with him? How many photos does it take to get a perfect picture of a naked uncle? Just play and you will find out
			
Posted: 25 March, 2015
												Remember that horror flick titled The Omen? I know it was released in the '70s but it had some sequels (and a remake in the 2000s) and it was a unique film so you probably remember it
Lucius, in essence, is the video game version of Omen
You take control of a 6-year old boy who, wait-for-it, is the son of The Devil
Now, the goal here is to eliminate people one by one in the household where Lucius lives
This is quite the manor as daddy is some famous politician who is preparing for the upcoming elections
So, the house is full of maids and other servants - offed one by one without anybody having a clue
And that is the point here
We cause accidents
Pick up items, combine these items and get rid of the evidences or make sure those point to another person
I like how the breadwinner of the family and his wife slowly go mad as they have no idea how these people died or for what reason
Between the almost 20 chapters we get to see many cutscenes with some decent voice acting
A detective gets involved and decides to really find out what goes on with the family
Anyway, I do not want to spoil it
The game has very nice graphics and memorable music
I like how the effects change to indicate a different time of the day or different season
This is good as it brings us change and running around in the same house does not get boring
Different rooms / areas of the house get into focus in each chapter and it is not uncommon that the season itself has a role
Later on the game starts granting us abilities such as telekinesis or mind control
To be honest setting people on fire was a bit too much - after all this is an adventure game
I think they should have just stuck with the stealth / adventure approach but for some reason they added this spell to spice up the gameplay a bit
In fact, the ending sees two ways of solving the game: there is an action as well as a puzzle-oriented solution
The game has some flaws, though
For instance, in some cases I really could not find out as to what I needed to do
Lucius does hint at the next task (you have a journal which regularly gets updated with his notes) but they are not always very helpful
Oh well, just grab some guides then and complete the game like in the old days with the point-and-click adventures, am I right?I am a bit perplexed to see many negative reviews stating this game is mediocre at best
I think this is a nice little game and a must-have for the adventure game fans or those who like the idea of playing an homage to Omen

												Burnt some guys face off, killed a bunch of other people, worshipped Satan, came home and played Lucius
Its pretty good			
Posted: 23 June, 2015
												Admittedly, most people won't enjoy this game
Games have changed and advanced, many scores are based on replayabilty, the scope of the enviroments, and freedom of variation in how to go about things
That's all superb standards to go by today, in open world/sandbox games
However, there is something to be said about restriction in games
With freedom of choice can also come a certain stress, and a sense of incompletion
There's the time and place for both, naturally, but some times there is something soothing and satisfying about playing a game the only way it's meant to be played
"Lucius" is about exploring your surroundings and figuring out how the puzzles are solved
Sometimes the solution is far fetched, sometimes ridiculous
But all in all, there's some sort of logic there
I enjoyed this game far more than I probably should have
I liked it's simplicity, the house and garden, the idea of it all
Granted, there was much more potential behind the concept that was left unrealised, but for what it was, I enjoyed it
Shiver Games tried to respond to peoples objections and critique to this first game somewhat in the sequel, which I can't speak of as I haven't played it, but, it did seem like that game have fallen apart in them trying to do so
It was probably more somewhat what they wanted the first "Lucius" to be; being able to have access to a variety of tools to make death traps, lethal situations and weapons to off any number of roaming NPCs at any given point
From what I've read and seen though those ambitions resulted in a broken game with great potential
The more complex, the more wrong things can go
"Lucius" has its fair share of bugs and limitations
But it also has a great idea behind it, and for me personally, finally getting the kill I was going for was surprisingly satisfying, as was achieveing "good boy" status by doing mundane chores around the house
My guess is, if you get some self therapy by say, doing the dishes or painting the fence, you might enjoy this game
Get it on sale though

												Quite possibly the most evil game ever created
Bravo for another Indie developer
This game is something else even though it's a familiar genre
As you play you may recall such movies as The Omen, The Shining, The Exorcist and Final Destination, among others
Also, if you like Hitman and Death to Spies series, then this game is definitely for you
Anyways, I believe that Shiver Games is onto something here
This could easily be made into a movie
You play as the son of devil who wants you to harvest souls for him by killing people, or by rather making it look like freak, deus ex kind of accidents
You live in a huge manor along with a congressman (your fake father), his family and about a dozen of staff
You play through 18 chapters (even though four separate chapters are molded into two missions, so it's essentially 16 chapters)
The game may take you at least 6 hours to beat if you don't use any help online (which I quite often did)
This game requires your utmost attention, there are no abstract objectives as to what you are supposed to be doing
You have to read between the lines
You have to use your Ouija board and your notebook to try to figure out who is the next target
It may take you a long time to figure out which tool to use and on whom
After the sixth mission or so, you get access to the rest of the manor and you can pick up items that you are going to need for the rest of the game, making the job easier later on
You also get to do around 7 menial chores to increase your behavior level in order to get three presents from your parents
As far as the killings go, well some of them are absolutely atrocious and were it not for the somewhat mediocre engine, they could look even more gruesome
The ambiance is awesome, the soundtrack is outstanding, the voice over decent enough (by male actors mostly, I found female voice acting weak)
One thing that bugs me is that Lucius doesn't speak, although they admit to that in the game itself






There are also numerous crosses spread throughout the house that are nailed to the walls
These crosses take away your abilities of which there are 4 (telekinesis, pyro-control, mind control and forgetfulness spell)
So you have to turn them upside down to be able to do your black magic tricks
The story and the pacing of the game are amazingly well put together, the "freak accidents" get more and more, well, freaky, and the detective investigating the murders narrates the entire story with a small preamble before each mission
Your parents also start getting suspicious to the point of them being scared of you, so every murder has an effect in the game
This kind of story telling sucks you in to say the least
The last buggy mission coupled with some graphical glitches like (people warping ahead or you getting stuck in doors) was slightly annoying but it wasn't anything game breaking
In the end, I feel that this game needed slightly more polish
---------------------------------------------------------------------------This is definitely an adult game, made by a confident studio
If the religious Right had GTA in their cross-hairs for all these years, then I would not be surprised if this game got the same treatment
That would be awesome so the game could get more publicity resulting in more sales
So please don't forget to support this new and bold Indie Developer, this IS a PC-exclusive after all

												I highly recommend this game
Not because I'm a big fan, but During my time playing it, it really hits home
First of all, the game is very different from the previous two
There is only one animatronic
Now you may think that is easy
 Come on, like only one? While this is technically true, there are the other animatronics (in the form of hallucinations), like I've seen Foxy, Chica, BB, etc
, that act as distractions by jumpscaring you, so that mister new guy can say hello
Second of all, the new defense system isn't very obvious, which I like
There are two main defenses (at least I think), which is the audio system (consisting of BB's HI's HELLO's and HAHAHA's) , and the ventellation grates
The audio is used to lure the new guy away from you and the ventellation is used to block certain vents so he can't crawl through them, one of these leading straight to your office, which can allow for some new strategies on how to survive the nights
Third of all, is the atmosphere
I never feel safe when I play this game, dreading that something will be jumping in my face
In the game, there is a big wide window in front of you, in which is implemented greatly, as sometimes you can see Freddy limping to your door, to the new guy staring at you, then dashing away, even to him peaking at you while trying to stay hidden
It reflects the game's mood, which is what I like the most
In general, I believe that this game is the creepiest game in the trilogy, offering new scares, more stress for you to get over, and new secrets to discover
P
S: Things that I look forward to;- Golden Freddy (if he exists)- The Custom Night (1/20 or more


)Update:I've done some research, and I think I can confirm that there is no custom night which makes sense (you only got SpringTrap really) but thats fine as there are a lot of secrets that makes me keep searching for them
Also I don't know if Golden Freddy exists or not
Anyway, thanks for the comments!Another Update:Golden Freddy does exist in this game
Just search it up on youtube!

												4 quick tips on how to get ready for Freddy 3:1
Distract the animatronic by using your audio equipment
2
Make sure to watch ventilation system
However do not worry about checking it like you would the regular cameras
You will hear when an animatronic is up above you and that is when you should check
3
Reboot your audio, cameras, and ventilation system as soon as it is malfunctioning
4
Look out for animatronic hallucinations
If you stare at any, then get ready for a jump scare
What’s worse is if you see Marionette, it will prevent you from doing anything until it decides to go away
And that creepy face

												Hello? Hello


?? Well, if you're hearing this


You're probably wondering why there's a 3rd game already
"Does Scott even sleep?" Relax, this is last time you'll see this game
Probably
(EDIT 4/27/15: Well


I did say probably, you know
I want to get off Mr
Fazbear's Wild Ride
)Welcome to the future! Specifically, about 30 years into the future
Freddy Fazbear's is no more, its legacy diminished to a cheap horror attraction at an amusement park, set to open in one week
And hey, lucky you, you're part of the attraction
You'll be starring as


The security guard! So let's get some things straight, help you get settled in
Five Nights 3 is a different form of horror than the first two games
The first game preyed upon a feeling of helplessness
The second game used panic as a vehicle for fear
This game uses the concept of struggle and strategy to out-wit your killer, as best you can in a game this limited
There's only one animatronic, so you only have one major threat to look out for
Assuming you can find him
But be careful -- there's something in the air
You're not just dealing with Springtrap here
The gameplay is very similar
You know the deal by now, I'd wager: Cameras to monitor where Springtrap is
But now, instead of doors or a mask to keep you safe, you have systems to maintain: Audio, camera, and ventilation
These are old systems, in order to keep authenticity, and they will break
This forces you away from the cameras to your reboot menu, where you'll spend agonizing seconds not only regaining order, but losing track of where Springtrap has gone
And heaven forbid you look away from your cameras at the wrong time, linger too far away from them, or even stare at them for too long
"How do you avoid him?" It's fairly simple, if perhaps not obvious at first -- your cameras are tied to the speaker system, allowing you to play sounds in various rooms
You also have the ability to seal vents
Springtrap wants you, but he's not the most focused individual in the world
If you do well, Springtrap won't even be a threat
Do poorly, and, well


I'm not implying that you'll die, but


However, with that said, this is probably the easier of the Five Nights games, just a little bit behind Five Nights 1
This game's purpose, rather than challenging you as nights progress (though it still will try!), is to wrap up the story of Five Nights at Freddy's
"What story?" If you haven't been following the story of the murdered children, the bite of '87, the Golden Freddy suit, the "Purple Guy", or even been listening to the calls, there's not too much depth here
I won't spoil anything, but there's some closure to the trilogy
If you know nothing of the previous game's happenings, this game will at least give you some sort of closure by itself, but it definitely caters to players who have played all 3 games and invested themselves in it
If you liked the first two games, you'll like this
If you didn't, you might not, though I will say it's definitely the highest production quality of all three games
If you didn't enjoy the previous games, the increased quality may be appealing on its own if you see it on sale, as long as you remember that the core gameplay itself still remains to watch cameras
So if that interests you, hop in! Get all nice and suited up
Just make sure not to breathe on anything that might look unsafe, and just remember:It's all in your head

												Five Nights at Freddy's 3


oh boy
This series has been notorious for its fast sequels (or prequels) and recently the rumoured last installment of the series has finally come out
So, this review will answer one question: Is Five Nights at Freddy's 3 actually scary or just a jumpscare fest?Long Description on the Game (Look below for a summary):Five Nights at Freddy's 3 has a completely different gameplay from its predecessors
The only gameplay mechanics that remain are winning at 6 AM and the office and cameras
Other than that, nearly everything has been removed and/or changed
In Five Nights at Freddy's 3, there is a control panel where you can monitor the status of systems like Ventilation and such
These systems will randomly go offline and cause your death as most of them are required to stop the animatronic from reaching you
You can now play a sound in the cameras to lure the animatronic away from you, although the system errors might mess you up and cause your death
Cameras are now more staticy and the animatronic isn't as visible anymore in the cameras
This causes the user to rapidly search for where the animatronic is and strikes fear into their hearts
Five Nights at Freddy's 3 is no longer a reflex game unlike the second installment
It, however, still keeps your heart pumping
Losing causes a jumpscare however this is not why it is scary
Most of the time when I was playing, I was panicking and getting scared due to losing track of where the animatronic went
Not only that, this animatronic can peek through the windows of the Office
The animatronic can walk past the window and run past you
There are, also, hallucinations of the animatronics from the previous games and they cause a jumpscare and system failure
Some people might call this a cheap way to scare the user but it really isn't scary anymore after the first few times
The reason they are there is to cause system failures in a different way (other than them randomly going out)
To me, this was executed in the best way possible
Summary:Pros:- New scary and dark atmosphere due to the pizzeria being abandoned
- MUCH better jumpscares (These are NOT the reasons why the game is scary)- Hallucinations of characters from the previous games- Story is finally nearly pieced together- Brand new gameplay mechanics- Completely different from the earlier games- No longer a reflex game (unlike the second installment)- Animatronic isn't easily visible in cams (causing player to panic)- Multiple cam sections (Normal and Vents)- A brand new extras menu- Cheats- A window where animatronic(s) can walk past and stare- Bigger Office- Freddy's NoseCons:- Animatronic can sometimes "teleport" from one end of the cam to the office- Hallucinations might bug sometimes- You will not understand the story if you have not played the previous games- Gameplay mechanics can be confusing at firstOverall:Therefore, to me, Five Nights at Freddy's 3 is not a jumpscare fest and is by far the best horror game in the series
It is also a good indie horror game that is actually pretty cheap
You should pick it up if you are looking for a good horror game or are a fan of the series

												Well now my daughter wont touch the computer 10/10			
Posted: 4 March, 2015
												After a lot of hard work, I finally 3-stared the game, and holy crap does it feel good! I kid you not, I actually shed a tear of relief when the clock ticked over to 6:00 AM on Night 6
To do the game justice, I'm rewriting my recommendation now that I've completed everything that the game seems to offer, but I'll include the original recommendation in a comment in the description if you're interested in reading some of my first impressions on it
So, would I recommend it? Hell yes
It was incredibly satisfying working to get a grasp of all the mechanics, but the game still has a huge element of unpredictability, so even when you think you'll be able to pull of the hardest challenges it offers, you may still end up short
It is this feeling of utter helplessness at times that makes it such a good horror experience, and I think FNaF 3 manages to capture this to an even greater extent than either of the first two games
If you're new to the Freddy experience, this should be a pretty interesting and wild ride for you, but I would honestly recommend that you start from the beginning of the series or at least watch a playthrough on YouTube, as you will miss out on the best parts of the overarching story as well as the subtle changes in game mechanics that are present throughout
For the long time fans of the series, you get a lot of answers and even some closure to a lot of big plot points in here, and I won't spoil anything in writing here, but I have posted some spoilery screenshots if you have the desire to view them
Ultimately, this feels like a great possible conclusion for the FNaF franchise, which it might very well be, but rumors are plentiful everywhere you look, so we'll just have to see what Scott does
Either way, if this is the end or not, I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and I honestly believe the FNaF-series is a milestone in the horror genre that won't be easily forgotten

												I've played the game for 5 hours
Which is enough time to beat the game 3+ times over
If you want a good review, this might be it
This game is pretty good
It's simple, fun, and interesting
It's not too hard, but not too easy
And it's constantly being updated
They have already updated twice and the game has only been out for 3 days
Here is my breakdown:PriceI got this game, on sale, for $1
79 USD
It is usually $2
00 USD
I believe it is most definitely worth that price
I don't like spending a lot of money on video games
Most great games are cheap
This game falls into that category
It is nice for the price and considering the game is being updated regularly, it is not a bad buy
DifficultyThe game is difficult in general, but easy to understand
There are a lot of things making the game difficult
Getting hacked, tracked, and kidnapped are all very possible and quite frequent
But, there are ways to avoid all of them (not so much the hacking, it's quite inevitable)
There are most definitely ways to play the game that are better than others
It being a horror game, it will be easier to beat if you have good awareness
I will link guides for people that want to play at the bottom of this guide
Overview and RatingThe game is good, overall
It is definitely worth the price and a good game to play if you like Indie, Horror, Puzzle, or Deep Web games
It is cheap, fun, and easy
The developers are still working on making it better for it's players and they listen to the fans
If you want something changed, you can ask them and they will kindly help
I would give the game an 8
4/10

												"Hey Ivan" Said one Russian kidnapper to another, "I think there is a guy in that room
", "Do not be foolish Boris", the other replied "The light is off, we can't go in there
"10/10, Deep immersive realism

												Adam - the developer of Welcome To The Game - truly thought of everything
And I'm not just saying this
From the new innovative idea of deep web horror to intricate little noises that freak you the hell out, this game is so beautifully made
This is NOT a FNAF clone
Yes
I've seen people write scathing reviews comparing this to FNAF
But this is really not true
If you want to play a complicated, immersive game that is chock full of deep web wit, you'll love owning this
Adam has made this only 2$ so everybody can enjoy it when he could just as easily priced the game at around 25-30$
I've completed WTTG many times and it's still just as fun playing through each time
Now I'm paranoid when I'm home alone and I hear strange noises (yikes man)
The game makes you paranoid in a good way and adds that whole new level of intensity that's refreshing to see in a horror game
I did not receive this for free, so take my opinion seriously

												PROS: -Absolutely amazing and fresh premise-Good atmosphere-Hacking mechanic is perfect (not too frequent, not too infrequent, not too hard, not too easy)-Browsing the Deep Web is fun-The game is, at heart, a puzzle one so actually making progress while putting the pieces together is VERY rewarding-Hiding from the kidnapper for the first few times induced genuine dread in meCONS:-There's not enough accessible sites regardless of the time (maybe I just got unlucky), so it got boring after a while-I quickly mastered the whole kidnapper mechanic so I felt there was never any possibility of getting caught, which took away from the dread factor
