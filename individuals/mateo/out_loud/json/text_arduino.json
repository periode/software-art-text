If you got like 100 LED and each draw 20 mA, that would be 2 Amps and not only Arduino can not supply it, you are risking burning your Arduino. After you figured out how much current your system needs, you gotta use a power source that can handle it. You got several options, for example a BJT is a current amplifier but it complicates the design and needs some background in electrical engineering. The other option would be using external power sources such as batteries or wall plugs. Then, you just need to buy a good adapter or voltage regulator that can handle your current need. Also, in that case you will need some sort of relay to control the leds with your Arduino. What Relay does is that it lets you turn it on and off with micro controller logic, but when it is on it uses an external power source."]]}
