 I would however love it if the author of this program contacted me as I would love to speak to him/her about some other features moving forward since I come from a software development background myself
Pros :- I love how every SAO game aren't 100% the same mechanism with the other SAO games
 In my case, I love the japanese voicing more, which you have here
 I always buy most of bandai game in full price, mostly because I'm a huge fan and I would love to see more of their game being imported in the western
 If you love JRPG game, but dislike the anime, you can always try the SAO games, there no harm, except only harming your wallet depending when you buy it
 If you love FF games, you must give this one at least a one month (or 14day) trial period
9 hours in according to steam and I love it
I love this game, it's the only one I have played this much
Overall, I can't say I'm in love with this revision of the Tekken series
- Not in love with the character redesigns either (for the most part); at least Bandai Namco gave alternates that could be used that were more like the Nostalgia costumes Cacpom charges for
 Since it is early access there are a few things I hope can be improved before the game offically comes out, mainly the dialouge/ translation, its a bit off here and there, but overall the art is beautiful and I love the 'intimate' scenes
 It was designed with newcomers in mind, yet still retains everything veterans love about the franchise
(Go hard if you would like more of a challenge) -Story rich (Can drag on a bit at the beginning but it's getting really epic and interesting once you are hooked)-It's quite linear but you have time to discover various places and towns (You have your freedoms) -No prior knowledge needed (Trails in the Sky or the other titles - Just light references) -Great and illustre characters and character development-Motivating to deepen the bonds (Similar to Persona) -Almost every character (NPCs included) has his/her own story -A lot to do (amsuing sidequests, minigames, discovering and collecting various stuff)-Average graphics in general-A lot of love put into details, characters and environment -Graphics are still way better compared to PS3
I love Steins;Gate
 I've never fallen in love with a tsundere genius girl
 Characters will die whether you hate them or love them
 You can definitely tell that a lot of care and love was put into this game
I've fallen in love with a fictional character
 I∆d dare say this game made me actually fell in love with Muxin for the duration of the game, and several days after that, even right now as I type up this review
 Plus, I love Muxin and Muxin only, so the storylines that doesn∆t involve her‡yeah
She appeared in front of me,like a godness,She made me know, what is the feeling when you fall in love with a girl
She made me know, if you love a girl,how happy will you feel when you see her smile
Put her hand in your hand,and say"I love you"
First things first, the storyline in this game is absolutely fantastic, So many good characters and interactions, a lot of text to read through but i love that
Mini-GamesOh boy, I love minigames and they added some in this game, namely gambling and fishing
 I love this game to death, and even after finishing it I just wanted to continue
>notice the "learn about dogs" skill option>i love dogs in real life so i'm immediately sold>spend the next 30+ weeks doing absolutely nothing besides learning about dogs and playing alone with my toys>other leaders see me as "weak" and "unfit to rule">they demand that i step down from power>i refuse>a civil war breaks out>i quickly lose and wind up becoming a servant for the rest of my lifeeveryone's just upset since i know more about dogs than they do
 Something which caught my attention is that the UI or menu is very beautifully done I love the direction off the VN that it makes the menu and UI looks very realistic which contributes greatly to the overall atmosphere
From his experiences, we question values, what is love and what it is to love
HK -> dp" you'll find a lot to love here
You will fall in love with the playstyles of each and every one of these characters, from Filia, the girl with a fanged monster for hair, to Peacock, the living cartoon character, to Ms
I love it
This game is like real life because women are unsolvable puzzles and they love to laugh at me
 And unless you go out of your way to patch the game, adding explicit content, the focus is way more on the inner struggles of the sisters and how they deal with their love for each other than it is on sex (Disclaimer: I haven't played without the patch
 I absolutely love Clannad and cannot recommend it highly enough
 These plotlines are mostly love stories
 We're active and very friendly and love discussing all things Clannad (as well as other games, anime, etc
11th decepber 2016I Hope the English Patch will come out very soon :/ I love the Animations and the Music
 What I got was a short, amazing filled story that I immediately fell in love with
99 , you should get it, this game has already made me laugh, intrigued and fascinated by the story and all the things to discover, I may also be in love with this game
11/10 - would make mom love me again
 I also love the E-MOTES system in Nekopara
STEP 9: Try to rekindle a relationship with a past love interest IRL and fail miserablySTEP 10: Out of frustration, flirt with multiple girls who remind you of the original one
 She has seen his good traits and love he gives to her as his daughter
 After all, that's the best way to tell "I love you" to his 11 years old daughter
 I presonally love it and feel that it adds a lot to the visual novel with the different backgrounds, charater designs, and effects
for the love of god play through the 1st fault milestone
I∆d love to see more works from these developers on Steam too
 If you like metroidvania-type games and bullet hells, you will most likely love this game
 It's also pretty spectacular, and if you love the metroidvania/bullet hell genres, you owe it to yourself to buy this game
 I absolutely love this game as a whole mainly reason is that there is full freedom of exploration, you could easily spend your time not following the story and just hunting for hidden treasures or objects
Audio and Visual Elements and FeaturesThey are STUNNING I love the artwork of the CGs they are all extremely detailed
 Soundtracks, the soundtracks are really great they fit into the battle that is happening in your screen it just makes the whole game feel more immersive and Ùcoolˆ like you are really part of the fight, I absolutely love the soundtracks
Definitely a BIG, Yes I definitely recommend you to pick it up if you are a fan off bullet hell and great soundtracks and love treasure hunting with RPG elements
 I also love RPGs, so you can see why I looked at Recettear and liked the look of it
Basically, what I'm getting at is that Recettear is an amazing game, I love it, and you probably will too
The game is a propaganda piece created by the US government to get you to love capitalism
 I've talked to all of them while playing, and some of them don't fully appreciate the artistic masterpiece which is Montaro, they do love it
Obviously I'd love to see a new Arrange mode as DLC in the future but I'm sure they will be too busy priming more old games for release in general to take such a long look back into the game code
 I'd love to see an Arrange from any of the CAVE devs who didn't work on the original game, but I'd love to see what some random hacker did with it too
 I love the soundtrack especially Gentle Jena, one of my favorite songs
 The music and soundtracks are possibly the most satisfying thing you will love about this VN, considering that it is over 10 years old
 To be noticed: - Super comfortable playing via gamepads; - No bugs, no glitches, no crashes, no lags, everything works perfectly, can't believe this is in Early Access; - I'm in love with main characters
 Almost every aspect of CrossCode feels really, really good to play, not just in an acceptably non-distracting sort of way, but dripping with love and care and attention to detail
The 1 bad thing about this game is that if you play this for countless hours, you will love the way the game looks and then when you go back too the rebirth series you feel a bit
 I love the new characters
An incredibly solid third-person shooter / puzzle game filled to the brim with all the things I love about Danganronpa and more
 Your swordsman jumps in with his sword and then suddenly summons a sword out of thin air due to his sheer love for swords
 Honestly Matt, I love this goddamn game so much
 Would absolutely recommend to people who love a good, lighthearted turn based RPG
Freedom Planet undoubtedly has a love of speed, similar to Sonic, and features great level design, with branching paths and multiple ways to tackle areas due to characters' different abilities (more on that later), but the levels can be fairly lengthy and aren't afraid to slow you down for some more intricate platforming or a bit of combat
>Took too long, and best girl fell in love with my best friend
 How will you and your sister adjust to life in a different nation, will you be able to make friends or possibly find love and most importantly will your piloting skills position you and your GEAR at the top of the Cenorobotics program
 I really love it when these sounds are incorporated into the V
 I would love to learn more about GEARs and how they define people's lives
 I would love to keep following these characters and their relationships beyond the beginning stage (but that's a general gripe for too many VNs)
 Apparently in their next game, Crystalline, there is only one love interest for the main character that will be relatively complicated and fleshed-out
I'd love to share some character details, but any relevant information about identities or backgrounds would be downright spoilers
Ys Origins is a prequel to a series named Ys which I had never even heard of, which I was suprised considering my love of rpg's
- Good story- Memorable Characters (nameless npcs are even memorable)- Good Characters (I love all characters, even nameless npcs)- Challenging but not impossible - Excelent Platforming + Puzzles- Funny and unique dialouge
So if you like Metroid/Castlevenia you will love this game
 If you're interested/new to the series, love horror/thriller genre or have watched the anime and still feel that it's lacking, pick this up and sate your horror/thriller need
 I'd have done the same for Watanagashi, but my love for Higurashi's quasi-sequel Umineko has flared up and stolen away my attention for the time being
 Like, after everything that∆s gone on, Hyun-ae suddenly turns into terrible tsundere and decides she∆s in love with you and wants to get married
