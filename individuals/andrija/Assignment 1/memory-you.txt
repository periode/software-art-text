You can choke
You can still have an opinion
You never did say I was right
You're just a memory
You better call the Coast Guard because baby we sinking
You walk Memory Lane
You can't see within
you'll understand what happiness is
You think you hear my voice
You'll understand what happiness is
You know you got to ignore
You'll understand what happiness is
You’ve been going along
You’re letting go
You know exactly
You still sicken me
you died in.
You're branded by the lost night
You can try just a little bit once in a while
You're strangers in a lost night
You look like a dream I was dreaming, a dream of a boy by the sea.
you seem as real as ever you were...
You seem to be
You unlock the past
You didn't predict this, a carnal rebellion in its wake)
You still have the power to reshape - do not let this escalate
