												It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory
You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own
Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game
It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means
Fu­ck team work
You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP
You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin
Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin
You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b
Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all
Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods
You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon
Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever
You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in
You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'
You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO
Go forth and procure many skins of great value

Early Access Review
								PUBG is the type of game where it starts off with not caring too much if you die in the first few minutes (approx 90 players alive), after a little while and some reasonable loot and gear has been found, you would prefer not to die at this point but still not too fussed if you die (approx 60-70 players alive)
After the 3rd/4th blue circle,You start to believe that you can achieve the impossible


you could possibly win


you'll taste the sweet fruits of victory


(10 players remaining)


you've made it to top 10



but you still want more



no more mistakes or joking around now


you're close



(last 2 players)


you believe in this


you can win! But alas


you make an idiotic mistake
You end as #2




that moment will haunt you forever


This is what will happen every game, you'll feel rage, anger and above all serenity when you die because you know that the game is over



until you start the next one
Welcome to the battleground

								For those of you getting severe FPS lag on Nvidia cards, try the following steps:(do this with the game closed)1
Open Nvidia control panel2
Go to 3D settings3
Set the options for PUBG specifically (listed something like TSIgame)4
Enable threaded optimization  Apparently adding " -USEALLAVAILABLECORES" to launch options (without the quotes) fixes it which is an option for people without Nvidia or its control panel
Edit: It seems this is more or less helpful for potato CPUsEdit again: I have no idea whether or not this still works

								I'm not usually a Battle Royal player, but this game is perfect for my play style
ARMA is too "hard core" for meH1Z1 is too arcadeish for me
PUB fits right in between those two, and it is really well done
Looking forward to the next 6 months to see how the games progress with the optimization the devs will focus on

												Well, my review is mainly for beginners who have just started this game or willing to buy it
This is also for them who had stopped playing it after some trivial hours of trying
A great game but yet I think the enjoyment will depend on how you are playing it! All that I mean, if you want to get the fullest essence of this game then play with suitable co-op partner(s)
Some who enjoys solo, they may say different but as I played solo because I had none to play with, so I felt even boring in some point and so also I felt how much the experience would be better with suitable co-op partner(s)
This is a hard-core game for hard-core gamers
Death and incapability may happen every now and then… but again the number may be reduced dramatically if you have your co-op partner(s)
There are some other advantages too to play co-op (such as, better loot, or think that while you are reloading your gun, your co op partner still firing and thus you will be less hurt by enemies) and the game itself prompts for co-op although everything can be done in solo except few achievements
This is a long game, including DLCs and need patience to finish them all
However, as I said before, this is a hard core game with almost a lot enemy everywhere, so, at some point you can feel frustrated if you don’t have proper levelled equipment and so you should farm for right things enough
Here again comes the advantage of co-op; such as you 4 people if farm for 4 weapons and then you can make duplicate of those [though it is a glitch] and you 4 can be well equipped… which chance does not exist in solo and so can be a lot time consuming and monotonous to be advanced
For new players, as I was when I started this game… may be a problem to understand the architecture of the game
At the very beginning the game starts in NORMAL mode
Once you will finish the main game… then TVHM [True Vault Hunter Mode] will be unlocked which you can take as medium difficulty
Re-playing the game in TVHM mode from the beginning once you reach at level 50 and then so also if you have finished the last mission of main story, then UVHM [Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode] will be unlocked for you
So take this as hard mode
There are over power [OP (1 to 8)] mode also where you can think it as very hard difficulty mode where enemy is up of your level
but that can be unlocked once you reach the ultimate level of the game, i
e
level 72
So, the main game will take you upto the level 50; The UVH pack 1 will take you upto 61 and UVH pack 2 will take you to level 72
Addition as on 30th June: Since I have just finished the main mission of main game in UVHM mode so I shall suggest you if you are playing UVHM then you must carry 2 blue pistols: Potent Rubi and Potent Gorg Nozzle and always keep one of these at your one slot
Whenever you are low in health start shooting using it
This is the review basing on my present experience of nearly 400 hours; I can update this review in the future as I shall get new experience

												Borderlands 2 is a game for those that enjoy the feeling of finding awesome equipment hidden in a massive pile of other stuff
Sure, you don't NEED to go in-depth with this game
 On the first playthrough you can get by with just picking up gear as you travel along, choosing stuff that looks better than your current gear, and maybe occasionally buying something in the vendor that looks handy
 The deeper you go down the rabbit hole however, the more there is to discover
The story is decent for a First Person Shooter (albeit one with RPG elements), and dialogue is often amusing to a degree
 Handsome Jack, the main antagonist is a cartoon villain with M rated attitudes
 He believes, or at least pretends to believe that he is the good guy, and you are just a "Filthy Bandit
"
Graphically, the game has a lot more variations in design and color scheme than it's predecessor (which was brown, brown, and a bit of color here and there)
 Cell shaded graphics with thick, graphic novel like outlines is the style of the game, and does a good job of separating it from the average FPS
Now, on to the gameplay itself!:Action is often fast paced and exciting
 So long as you don't allow yourself to get too far ahead of the enemy levels, you'll find battles where you have to fight hard to win
 The game does a decent job of easing you into the various elements, such as different gun types (Pistol, SMG, Assault/Combat Rifle, Shotgun, Revolver, Rocket Launcher, and Sniper Rifle), the importance of a good shield, grenade mods (alter the way your grenade behaves, including damage bonuses and special effects), Class Mods (Class-specific devices which can boost skills, and have other effects like increasing fire rate with specific weapon types), and lastly Relics (Device which generally boost damage or defence in some way)
 Equipment rarity is also made fairly clear
 It goes White, Green, Blue, Purple, Magenta, Orange, Seraph, and Pearlescent
 The final two rarities (Pearlescent and Seraph) are special
 Seraphs require you to have at least one of the season pass DLC to obtain (and you need all 4 of the Season Pass DLC to obtain all the Seraph rarity items), and as to Pearlescent rarity weapons, you need to be in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (Playthrough 3) for them to have a chance of being spawned
 Don't assume that a blue is automatically better than a green rarity item, even at the same level
 Experiment!Playable Characters and Skills:There are 4 included playable characters, and two DLC characters
 Each class has it's ups and downs, and a special game changing skill unique to them
 For example, Salvador (Gunzerker) will dual-wield guns when his action skill is active, meaning TWICE THE FIREPOWER
 Axton (Commando) drops a turret, which damages enemies and draws aggression away from you
 Maya (Siren) locks an enemy's movements for a short time, allowing you to get in free hits
 Zer0 turns invisible for a few seconds and launches a decoy, and his first attack made whilst in this mode does increased damage
 The DLC characters are Gaige (Mechromancer) who launches a flying robot that attacks nearby enemies, and Kreig (Psycho); a schizophrenic musclebound maniac that will whale on everything within reach with increased offensive and defensive capabilities and can even throw his axe at more distant targets
Aside from the action skills unique to the character, there are various other skills that you can put points into, and have an effect on gameplay in some way
 For example, increasing fire rate or damage for a few seconds after a kill is made
 Each character has 3 skill trees, each ending with a final gamechanging skill modifier
 For example, Zer0's Bloodlust (Melee) tree ends with the Many Must Fall perk, which will instantly re-deploy the hologram if he kills the enemy with one melee strike
 As mentioned before, Class Mods unique to a character class will boost certain skills
 It's possible for them to go as high as +6, meaning some skills can be boosted to 11, as the normal limit on points you can put into most skills is 5, though some skills are only 1 (those usually affect the way you play)
Plus, there is a gun that shoots swords



EXPLODING swords


In DLC4 (Tiny Tina's Assault on the Dragon Keep)
 So yeah, there is that too
I hope you found my review useful, even if it might be a bit messy XD

Borderlands 2 - Excellent Story, Solid Gameplay, Great Characters and one of the very best Coop experiences around
 || 9
5 || Score Comment   Graphics 8 Borderlands 2 has a visual style all its own, it may not initially impress some used to a "next generation, high definition, ultra realistic landscape", but it is nevertheless very appealing and detailed
Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora (the world on which the story takes place) are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere
Characters and enemies are detailed and extremely varied in appearance
You can customise your characters appearance with a large selection of outfits and heads which you can collect throughout the game
  Audio 10 No real killer soundtrack here (apart from the the introduction video), just really good atmospheric music throughout
Where this game really shines is the voice acting for characters, enemies, audio logs and even weapons (yes some of them can talk!)
The dialogue is often very funny, helping to explain and drive the story, fill in background and really adds the the immersion
  Gameplay 9 A mix of FPS and RPG, Borderlands 2 is a lot of fun to play
So many missions to complete, so many enemies to kill, so much loot to grab
You are given massive area's to explore all over the world of pandora filled with creatures, quests, secrets and homages to lots of popular culture
Controls are responsive, intuitive and the game mechanics (even at higher difficulties) feel fair and well thought through
As you progress through the game you will earn xp and levels which allow you to customise your characters skills giving a large variety of gameplay styles
  Story 9 The story in Borderlands 2 is rich and engaging
The action is character driven, and while the main story is fairly linear, the open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora
It also has one of the most badass, charasmatic and handsome villians of all time


   Replayability 9 So many reasons to replay this game
Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards
There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different
Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore
Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character
These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text)
   Multiplayer 10 For me, this game remains simply the best cooperative multiplayer experiences you can have
Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team
Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels
The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication
   Overall 9
5 I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters
So much fun to pick up and play with friends
- I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game
To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more
 More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree? Please leave me a comment 
Posted: 27 June
Edit: Please stop joining my game, my anxiety can't handle itI've been avoiding reviewing this game, being my number one favourite I couldn't think of a way to make it unbiased
But after the resurgence of Open world games, the downfall of AAA and the battle between TF2 and Overwatch, I think I can finally pinpoint what makes it so beautiful
The art style is an obvious starting point
Everything is cartoony and exaggerated, it's filled with colour and despite being cartoony it feels more realistic than the grim grisley greyness of Skyrim, Morrowind, Witcher etc
It's not perfect of course, with clipping and terrible lip sync but with the cartoony atmosphere it adds to the exaggerated charm that it provides
The characters themselves are also important
If you compare how they were designed to Mass Effect: Andromeda, the way it has been presented is genius
There are a lot of gay characters, black characters, female characters- but these characteristics do not define who they are
The characters still have peronalities, they just happen to be these things- they are not just addons, it just adds to the depth of the world
I suppose the most important thing in a game is the gameplay, and this Borderlands nails too
A lot of games can't tell whether they want to be simple or complicated, they can't tell what gimmicks they want to use, so they use everything and it turns into an incoherent mess like Undertale
Borderlands knows exactly what it wants to do
It's a Single Player or Co-Op FPS with RPG mechanics with levelling and loot systems
The RPG mechanics make it feel more open worldy than most open world games
It defines what towns exist, and gives you fast ways to get to them, and while games like Skyrim use the open world idea to make you travel for hours, Borderlands 2 just adds a lot of depth with; secret loot boxes, experience, Cult of the Vault logos or mini easter eggs
Something that I noticed in my most recent playthrough is how much freedom you have throughout and how this can appeal to both new players and veterans
One example is the first area, the entirety of Southern Shelf
You fight Knuckle dragger, to a new player they find out how brilliantly designed the bosses will be: They aren't walls of health, they aren't stupidly damaging, they are balanced with weaknesses and phases
An expert player on the other hand could then debate whether they would want to farm Knuckle Dragger for the legendary pistol Hornet, or just move on
This can also be seen in Southern Shelf Bay when you have to kill Midgemong
A new player could rush right towards Midgemong or maybe explore the boats, while an expert player would take the long route around for some extra loot and instead of calling the bridge over to get across the lake, they can just run across the chain, significantly increasing the pacing and replayability of the game
Of course Borderlands 2 isn't perfect, the majority of the fun is in the UVHM playthrough which is a DLC
The bugs might throw people off while I enjoy discovering two or three new ones every new playthrough
Even despite this, just the first playthrough with a friend is highly worth your time
Let's hope Borderlands 3 will be another great one
Iron out the issues of Borderlands 2, while still being able to provide replayability where Borderlands: The Pre-sequel couldn't

												There is something to be said for a game that I just don't get sick of
I have owned this on console and played through TVHM at least 4 times with 4 different characters there
Played all the DLC except Tiny Tina on console, but when the GOTY edition became so cheap on PC I jumped at it and bought all the Headhunter DLCs, and the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack as well
So I can now play through the game THREE times on a character
DarI'm so addicted to this game still, but the funny thing is that I don't even finish it, or even come close to it now
I'm in a mass addiction to boosting my Badass Ranks so I just keep trying to "prestige" it instead of moving on and going towards UVHM
xDI feel like I can pick this game up and play it at any time
Do a few things, and then quit playing
Unfortunately, for me anyways, I don't do that
I keep playing for hours, and I let all the other hundreds of games in my library continue to pile up
I play this game EXCLUSIVELY in SINGLE PLAYER
People will tell you that it is much more fun playing with friends, and truly it can be, but don't disregard this game as a single player game
It is insanely addictive, and it actually poses some slight challenges to you to play it solo
Beating Raid Bosses solo is actually a genuine accomplishment, if you can actually do it
They are meant to be beaten witha 4 player team, but you CAN beat many of them solo
The new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM) makes it an even more insane challenge to play solo just for the regular game enemies
Needing to pump them full of slag just so you can actually get ready to start damaging them with any real power
Of course all this is basically a math problem of damage output vs
damage defense
Borderlands 2, simply put, is one of the best games ever made in my opinion
The sheer addictiveness and fun in playing it are jsut off the charts
I recommend this to anyone, even if you think you won't like it
I thought Borderlands 1 looked stupid for years until I bought it for $5 with everything and realized how amzing the concept is and how it was made for OCD gamers
Now they are both 2 of my most played games ever, and I don't see myself stopping BL2 anytime soon
After all I ahven't even used The Psycho yet!Buy the GOTY Edition
It is the best deal by far and has most of the relevant content you will want
Forget about the Season Pass and regular game
GOTY has all that stuff and more
Then buy the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack to get extra level sand a 3rd round
The headhunter DLCs are worth it too for the cheap prices
Only thing not to buy are the stupid skin packs
Unless you like that sort of thing
Wait for it to go 75% off and you can get GOTY, UVH Pack, and allt he Headhunter DLCs for less than $20
BTW


these DLCs are legit and worth buying
This isn't some garbage map pack DLC, or jsut skins
These are high quality and large DLCs on the scale of the FAllout DLCs, and add even more than that in some of tehm
GOTY edition has almost too much content
>_>

												Definitely one of the best "new" games I have played
This game is fun to play solo or over the net with friends
The characters are witty, yeah even Claptrap :) Graphics are beautiful


Even after playing this game over 3000 hours; the game gives wow-moments to me
And every time there's something new



and the vast choice of weapons, shields and other gadgets
So I full-heartedly recommend Borderlands 2
And yes, I will play co-op with you :)

Posted: 16 January, 2015
												I had played 1200 hours before I even tried any of the DLC
Now, if that doesn't speak to the incredible level of fun and depth that this game brings, well, I just don't know that anything can
Sometimes I wonder how much better my life would be if I had spent those 1400 hours doing something constructive like studying my trade, helping the poor, or working on my home
But not often
Second best game ever made
Absolutely terrific
Life ruiner
Go for it

												I really don't undertsand the approach they were going for
You make a game about the second world war, the deadliest conflict on planet Earth till this day, 60 million human beings died in some of the most painful and brutal ways possible
But you're too afraid to include swastikas and the segregation and sexism that existed at the time? I mean, you put WWII in your game's title, but I feel like Return to Castle Wolfenstein is more historicaly accurate
-Zero historical accuracy, which we were promised for at least the campaign
-Delevopers censoring the brutality, sexism, racism, and the symbology of this game
-The voice acting for the Germans in this game sounds like someone typed that trash into google translate and copied the audio wav
s and used them in the game
-The characters in the plot of the campaign are extremely boring and forgetable
-The function of weapons in this game is far from how they truly operate (feels like none of the deveoplers actually fired any of these weapons at a range prior to developing them in game)
-The multiplayer makes me want to kill myself, enough said
I usually make parody reviews, and try to make people laugh, but I feel like this really needs attention
			
Posted: 4 November
												This game's title is a disgrace
When I saw the initial trailer,  I was actually pretty hyped and thought that this might be a good game
Well, it's the worst CoD I've ever played
And it's not even so because the gameplay is bad
It's just that this game pretends it's set in WWII, when it's not
First of all, please save me all "this is just a game" talk
If you call a game WWII, and say you'll try to keep it authentic, you do it
Not include stuff that's totally out of place
--> black female soldiers--> fighting for Wehrmacht--> in London--> wearing american helmets, because apparently the devs don't care about creating an even remotely authentic feelingWhy not make ACTUAL WW2 maps??? London?? USS Texas?? Why?? What was the thinking behind this? Were there too few locations to choose from? Jesus Christ, what's next? New York?When I was a kid, I learned a lot about history from games like Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2
Kids playing CoD WWII will spread false knowledge
This is the first CoD since MW3 I spent money on, and definitely the last
This franchise needs to die			
Posted: 3 November
												Definitely not worth full retail price
  CONS:  - Campaign levels are incredibly short
60 minutes and I had already completed 5 stages on hardened - Enemies are all deadshot, even behind cover at any difficulty (difficulty only changes the rate at which they shoot you with 100% accuracy)
Hell, they are even accurate when blindfiring from cover
- Because of how accurate enemies are at any range with any weapons, mounted weapons are really fustrating to use, especially madatory mounted weapon sections where you absolutely can't dismount the weapon you are forced to use
There's no cover, and you  can't take cover 
Worse still, the gun requires a somewhat lengthy reload after just 50 bullets (some uses a cooldown system)
- Characters are pretty forgettable in all honestly compared to something else like Brothers in Arms, COD 2, or even Company of Heroes Tales of Valor
-  Ally
Useless (can't shoot for sheet) and annoying
Screaming "MED PACK READY BRUH" "GOT YOUR AMMO BRUH" every few seconds
- Microtransactions on a full priced AAA game
Solely cosmetics or not, just NO
- Settings between SP, MP and Zombies   DO NOT   carry over between each
So you'll have to manually set all of them again (i
e if you fine tuned your SP settings, you gotta do the same for MP and Zombie)
It's a hassle
- Bugs & errors (e
g error 4128)
- Hackers everywhere
Reporting them doesn't seem to help either
 PRO/CON  - Can't complaion about the visuals
It's not bad, but its nothing to rave about either
I won't go into nitpicky details on ulgy textures, but as a whole, so long as you're not going out of your way looking (i
e zooming in at a particular rock) for it, the game looks and runs just fine
- QTE
Not a fan, but not totally adverse against it either
Some QTE sequence require you to move your mouse in a circle (kinda like telltales games I guess?) and there are some variety of different buttons to press, so its not just smash X button all the time
- HP regen, I don't like it, but at the same time i don't not like it
I'm confused, it does what it does, but it doesn't feel as "fluid" as something from say, Dying Light, S
T
A
L
K
E
R, Half Life and Halo
I'm guessing that the slow animation to heal is for balancing purposes (i
e you can't just heal in an instant) but then again, I have played game with healing animation and they don't feel as off as this
It's not bad, but its not  good  per se? Idk its hard to explain
- Enemy AI aren't exactly stupid as they know when to try to flush you out while flanking you and blindfire as you try to advance towards them, but they do really stupid things from time to time like throwing a bomb that bounced back and killed themselves or "taking cover" right infront of you (and the cover is facing the wrong way)
- For a game that prides itself alot on "historical accuraries", there are sure loads of jarring historical inaccuracies, even on the very first level alone
But I'm not really complaining since some of them are beneficial, like german units using weapons they weren't suppose to have (e
g " troops "Sten guns", historically speaking, german made ones were called the MP 3008, and it was avaliable ONLY for the Volksstrum, not the Wehrmacht or any branch of the military, even in desperate times
The MP 3008 was literally a really crap copy made in haste to arm fanatical civilians
)  PROS:  - Sound designs are pretty good
they feel heavy when they need to be and ambience have its moments of tranquil breaking into a furry of bullets and explosions
- Zombie and MP are okay (zombie is really good imo, had always wanted something similar to COD WoW zombies for a while now), nothing much to shine or bash on
Aside from the absolute bs that is the microtransaction (and how they've impliment that degrading patent it into COD WW2), it does what it does
Though I'll admit it is really weird seeing a negro nazi running around
- Amazing settings design for PC, wide variety with helpful screenshots to better explain what each settings does at what setting (i
e Texture at med, high, extra)
Something like what you'd see at geforce
com- You cannot truly just ADS and empty the entire mag in a single burst with laser accuracy (atleast in my experience)
There's a very noticable weapon spread at range even while going prone
Hipfire is pretty inaccurate aswell
- Auto presets for lefties
- Surprising range of weaponary- WW2 themed (like finally i suppose)TL;DR: It's fun, but the asking price is too high for the content avaliable (Get it for 30 USD or less)
If you're buying this solely for SP, don't bother (even with discount) its incredibly short and unmemorable
The set pieces don't even feel grand or pumped (like COD WoW Downfall  or COD2 Ponte de Hoc)
Now I really wish there was a "conditional thumbs up/down" system because I'm recommending this game, for its base game content value,  AT 30 USD OR LESS  (absolute max I'll say is 40$ and that's really pushing it)
Buying the full edition that comes with the season pass and bonus map is really ludicrous for the average joe earning average wages (also if I were a parent,unless wealthy af, dropping 60$ or more on a game that isn't that content filled would make me squint at best and straight up no to buying at worse
Adding microtransaction ontop of that doesn't help either)
Oh and microtransaction is still crap, regardless if you're opening a box in private or a box that appears from the sky for everyone to see
edit: some spellings and making it easier to read
edit2: added some extra details about how the microtransaction is earned/worksedit3:   welp hackers are everywhere
   Details about the microtransaction (as I understand)  Something I believe lots of people are interested in knowing about
I'll put it in bullet points so its easier to read- They're all cosmetics (as far as I know)
Emblems, gun skins, helmets, emotes, icon, etc etc
- You can earn lootboxes via the game's "orders" (functionally speaking, they're pretty much challenges)
- What are "orders"? At the HQ, there's a place (the game will guide you on this) where you can go and choose which orders to activate
They range anything from "kill 500 enemies" to "win a TDM match"
Now, each "orders" grants a different reward (e
g XP reward, lootboxes, rare lootboxes, crafting materials), you can see what reward are tied to each "orders"
They come in daily (24 hours) and weekly (7 days) cycle which will refresh and load new "orders"
Upon completing a challenge, you have to go manually redeem it (HQ or loadout section)
  IF YOU DON'T IT DOESN'T REGISTER AND YOU LOSE YOUR POTENTIAL REWARD WHEN IT REFRESHES NEXT CYCLE   (subject to change imo)
- Crafting materials? Yes, like Overwatch, you get crafting materials (armory cred) through various means (e
g dupes from boxes, challenges, hourly/daily "mail" which gives you some amount of free crafting materials) which you can use to buy stuff and rank/prestige perks this which lets you buy weapon/class upgrades stuff
You can  technically  buy your way to unlock every weapon, perk and streak specials) via lootbox free exp (each rank gives 1 rank point)- Everyone can see what you get if they're around you, and any  Epic  quality stuff that was unboxed in the HQ (you have to unbox it in the HQ as far as I'm aware of) will be announced on the bottom left as a text (e
g Unforseen Lemonquences has unboxed an Epic item!)- When you open a box, nobody can "steal" it (since its considered opened the moment you decide to open one in a sub menu)
But they  CAN  troll you by blocking your screen (standing between your character model and lootbox), thus preventing you from taking screenshots to showcase what you got
- Lastly, yes, you can use real money to buy these lootboxes

												I played Single Player mode for 15 hours


which only would have taken about 7 if my save games hadn't been deleted every time the game crashed
I played through the first five missions 4 separate times due to this
Not enjoyable
Historical and military accuracy were terrible
Russian sub-machine guns in Western Europe? PVTs continually calling a Tech Sergeant "Sir" without getting chewed out? Many, many German uniform screw-ups (all officers won the Iron Cross, apparently)
I'm not talking about black or female soldiers, but the rest is laughable
			
Posted: 3 November
												Absolute tat, totally different to the beta, which I enjoyed, historically inaccurate (PPSH used by germans on D-Day?) just definitely not what was promised from trailers, interviews or anything else developers said pre-launch
Just go and see if anyone is playing WaW rather than this
Requested refund after 1 day

												I


I don't know where to begin
 I wanted this game to be good, really I did
 I have played the Call of Duty franchise from its beginning to its terrible, terrible demise during the Black Flops series
 Campaign-No, you cannot skip the cutscenes
 You WILL have feels for these characters, you WILL (but probably not because they're all lacking depth)
*-All those awesome moments in the trailers?  That's all of them
 In the whole game, right there
-The missions?  I expected more
 D-Day, sweet!  Oh, it's over


okay, I guess I was done anyway
 Kinda missing COD2 here though


 A car chase, okay


pretty sure you've done this before, COD, but this works
 Sneaking around a German compound, sweet!  Finally something


oh he saw me?  Wearing this German uniform, he saw me and is apparently upset about this
 Meanwhile all of his buddies are having conversations without actually moving their mouths or talking, that's cool Activision, I'll go elsewhere to fulfill my attention to detail
 A flying mission, sweet
 DEFINITELY did this one in one of the earlier Call of Duty games, but hey, we're repeating everything, so why skip this one
-Physics
 Did we forget this was a thing?  I just watched a Stuka divebomb a tank and pull a 270 up in a matter of maybe 10 meters
 I can hop for days, and hop I will, because


MULTIPLAYER-If you're not hoping or dancing or dolphin diving, you're dead
 Forget what I said, you're already dead, but you respawned so, no, wait, you're dead again
 Because the guns that you have are outmatched by his custom-pro-mod-why-the-hell-is-this-even-in-this-game-gun
-Okay, I'm a huge fan of games that people die when you shoot them, maybe I'll give Hardcore a try


 M1Garand shot, center mass, no kill, he returns fire with a pistol, instant kill at 20 meters
-Kill cam
 Watch it, watch the muzzle of the weapons jump, but the bullets go straight
 Just watch it
-All gripes and complaints aside, this game is an AMAZING


airsoft simulator
ZOMBIES-look awesome, now we know where all the dev's time went
**-It's Nazi zombies


did you expect differently?  There's some new zeds, bombs and fire and stuff
 1 map, hope you like it
-Honestly thought it was good my first run through
 Prologue was cool, read reviews about it being more linear and adventure-y, but once you've opened all the gates, it's a circle map with the old tried and true tactics every game
 Not my flavor, but a solid improvement still
Here's to getting TBagged by that black female German with an American helmet using a Russian PPSH in Gibraltar
*Edit:  You can, apparently, skip the cutscenes
 Lesson to be learned - do not remap your keys, no matter how bad you want them to make sense
 You'll miss things like skipping cutscenes and not getting stabbed repeatedly by that one German nobody wanted to shoot
**Edit2:  MORE INFO ON ZOMBIESTLDR:  Game looks great, plays like a Burger King toy, feels like a hot-and-steamy on a history book, has zombies

												Very short, alot of qtes and on rails sequences, cliche as hell story
Game is very good looking though, and runs at around 100fps on my 1060 on high settings
Same same call of duty multiplayer, certainly not worth full price, pick it up when it hits $20 or less for a bit of fun
			
Posted: 3 November
WARNING- I mean -CARIFICATION!A lot of people are commenting on my short playtime for this game
Some are claiming that its impossible to evaluate all the game's elements in just under two hours- which is true
I did not play every single multiplayer game mode and map or every single campaign mission
I only played some
However, its certainly possible to get a feel for a game by trying out a few things and not all
That's what demos do
And especially in games like CoD, if two or three multiplayer game types and maps are bad, the rest will probably be uneventful and boring as well
And if not, well, its certainly not worth paying $60 for that one game mode and/or map that's fun to play, is it?Onward to the Review!I played the first campaign mission, "D-Day", which was pretty cool in and of itself
It set the tone very well
As someone who loves history, it was a very somber experience launching off the boats and onto the beaches of Normandy
Granted, the campaign is not exactly historically accurate, but the opening still serves as a somber reminder of the hell on earth that was World War II
At least it did for me (I appreciate history)
But then I played mutliplayer


The game claims to have returned to the CoD roots
I can honestly tell you objectively, from an unbiased perspective, this is false
Of course, there's no space jumping and wall running, but it truly feels like Black Ops 3 with a World War 2 skin; which I suppose is fine for many people who liked Black Ops 3
I liked it, but I don't like a World War 2 version of it
I suppose I may have been expecting something drastically different, since I remember World At War being dramatically different than the CoDs that came after it
But either way, I did not enjoy the multiplayer experience
Allow me to explain: Multiplayer 1) The map design was fairly bad
I mean, the maps were dang beautiful to the eyes, but hideous and disgusting to the gameplay experience
Plus, there's only 8 maps
2) There's a new social space which is kind of


not really necessary, I guess? There's not really a point of it
Just some place you can hang out with people and


watch them gamble their real world currencies for a chance at winning a chance to obtain good-for-nothing and worthless items
3) The customization is rather poor, which is something I've heard many people say so far
Many complained about this in the beta, but it seems they didn't really listen to the feedback in this regard
4) As mentioned above, there's loot boxes in this game
That should be no surprise; as soon as Activision heard about this cancerous money-making scheme, they immediately jumped on board
I hate microtransactions in the loot box form, as does the majority of the gaming community
Gambling real world, hard-earned money for a chance at winning some worthless cosmetic or game-unbalancing weapons and cheats is disgusting and, quite frankly, immature for a studio of this stature
Loot boxes in free-to-play game models make sense
Loot boxes in a $60, supposedly fully finished retail game is absolutely unacceptable and ruins the already unbalanced gameplay of modern Call of Duty games even further
Zombies Now there's the Zombies mode, which was actually very well done
I applaud the designers behind this iteration of Zombies
Its not perfect, but its very exciting and brings back that stressful experience we all came to know and love in World At War and the original Black Ops
As much as I loved it, its certainly not worth buying the game for
I could never justify purchasing a $60 video game solely for the horde mode it offers
If the Campaign was much longer and there were more than two Zombies maps at launch, I    might    consider it
I'm not really going to talk much about Zombies, because its essentially the same model as its always been, but darker and with more grit
I will go over a few things, though
1) The Zombies are more animated, and less


undead, if you can believe that
When I say animated, that's not necessarily a bad thing
I'm not talking about a cartoonish appearance
They're far from that
But they seem like more than just mindless undead humans
They're more, "lively", if you will
Which is


not really a zombie
They also speak
Not English of course, but German
Which is also quite strange
But its not like these things are too much in your face
For most people, including myself, it doesn't break the experience
2) This is still very much Zombies
Its just not "Nazi Zombies" from World At War, which is what many of us wanted this to be
There's still perks, easter eggs, etc
Really nothing has changed gameplay-wise
Many of the perks are generally the same but with new icons and names
Some are new, though
I'll leave those for you to discover yourself if you decide to purchase this anyway
But please, save your money
Campaign  Normally the Campaign is the first thing I do in any first person shooter
I play games not for the multiplayer experience (although I most certainly do get my money's worth on the multiplayer modes), but I mainly purchase games for the single player stories they offer
This game certainly does well in it's singleplayer mode
The campaign is (generally for the most part) nearly an accurate representation of how dark and horrible the worst conflict in human history actually was
In fact, it surpasses Battlefield 1 largely when it comes to the "War Is Hell" mood that both games tried to set
Battlefield 1, which I enjoy far more than this game, did a horrible job at realizing the realities and tragedies of war, making its stories about being a fantastical War Hero performing stunts that were sometimes even near superhuman, whereas this game does it very well, for the most part
Its no Private Ryan, but it comes close
Summary Call of Duty: World War II is a fair attempt to recreate the World War II experience for Call of Duty, however, it fails to shake off the dust of the previous Sci-fi games, which had lead to the series' downfall
Its still extremely reminiscent of the latest games like Black Ops 3 and Infinite Warfare, and fails to return to the roots as it claims
Its almost as if this game's multiplayer experience is Black Ops 3 with boosting disabled and a WW2 appearance, with nothing else changed
While the Campaign and Zombies modes are certainly very interesting and would be entertaining to play for hours on end, they too fall short of being worthy of the $60 price tag
The Campaign is fun and interesting, but very, very short
The Zombies mode is great, but its not worth buying the game just for Zombies right now
If you loved Black Ops 3 or Infinite Warfare, you'll probably love this, but if you're thinking this game returns to its roots and is reminiscent of World At War or the first three CoD games, think again
This most certainly does not return to the roots of the franchise despite the claims, and thus, I do not recommend this game
Do not spend your hard-earned money on this quite yet
Have patience and wait for either a sale, or wait until there's more content
Unforunately, though, the latter will be very irritating, since you'll have to purchase the Season Pass to get the later content, which furthers my point as to why this game is not worth it

												So, I was previously writing a review with a very positive rating
After reviewing my own review and also purchasing a copy of this game for the playstation 4 (please note my steam copy was a gift and I already fullfilled my ps4 preorder long before this) I will be rating this game negatively
I implore you read my full review as some of the issues that lead me to the negative rating may very well be opinionated
This is also mostly a review of the game itself, I will discuss PC specific topics towards the bottom
May Contain Campaign Spoilers
CampaignPros*Very well crafted, lots of nice scripted events that make the world feel alive
*Removes the overdone health regen system for a more dynamic squad system
*Has some very nice memorable moments making this a very enjoyable campaign
*Has segments of some of the greatest battles of WW2 with near photorealistic graphics
*Heroic events can be pretty intense in higher difficulty levels
*Engine overhaul allowed for mild level destruction which can be awesome during certain missions such as the tank one
Cons*Very cliche, overdone story
The tension between your squad mates is very predicable and you don't ever get enough screen time with any one member to actually form an emotional attachment to
*Relatively short, looking through my achievements I did it in about 6 hours and I didn't really rush it
*There are only 2 sections in which you aren't doing generic soldier combat, would have been nice to get another tank or plane mission
*I had a hard time getting immersed into the world when there was a major lack of attention to detail, an example being swastikas feeling insanely forced as if they were never planned to be in the game before the backlash
*After your squad medic is captured you no longer have access to a substantial amount of health packs, this can make the game insanely tedious while playing at higher difficulty levels
*Only real reason to complete the campaign is a simple helmet you receive in multiplayer
MultiplayerPros*Familiar Call of Duty gunplay, if you enjoy this like I do you will feel right at home
*Nice maps, while this is subjective, I found the maps themselves were fun to play, in certain situations (more info in the cons)*The inclusion of MWRs quartermaster system
*Supply drops are currently not able to be purchasable with real world money, and are obtained through game time and numerous challenges which ensure you get plenty of them sometimes (More info in the cons)*Some of the most iconic guns of ww2*War is a very underrated and unpopulated game mode
Cons*The headquarters, the headquarters is akin to the tower in destiny
In this game it absolutely does not fit
Many features that would fit just fine in its own menu are only accessible through the HQ
Meaning if I wanted to something simple like changing my emblem I would need to load up the whole entire HQ, run across the place, and access yet another menu
As of the writing of this review the HQ also consistently fails to load you into a lobby with other places making it just this empty area with nothing of interest to do
It just seems like an afterthought and only exist to sell people on supply drops
*Gun Balance is very poor and the gun roster contains few unique weapons
All but one sniper rifle are bolt action that kill from the chest up, 3 smgs that are high fire rate short range weapons, and 3 smgs are slow firing ones meant for medium range
Most of the ARs besides the M1 and SGT contain too few bullets and have damage profiles to similar to these two to actually be of use
There are only 4 shotguns, a decent pump action, a weak double barrel shotgun another weak double barrel, and a weak semi automatic
Most of the LMGs fire to slow, contain way too few bullets, and slow your player down so much it would be stupid to not just use an AR
Only 3 pistols, 2 of which have the same damage profile and the other being a machine pistol with insane recoil and 10 bullets
*Supply drops make a return in this game
As of the writing of the review this game does NOT contain any supply drops with weapons that alter gameplay
However, there are several bugs with them
Supply drops are constantly disappearing
(I have earned 7 and only been able to open 2) The developers took a step back and removed the “recently obtained” menu making it hard to find what you actually own
Sadly, unlike MWR the game does not contain any camos in supply drops
Pistol grips are what has replaced MWR camos for the bulk items in supply drops, they are very uninteresting and can only be used on 2 weapons
Like in MWR, once you collect a full “set” of quartermaster items, you earn a special item, usually a reskin of a weapon
However, it is obvious some of them were overlooked and special attention was paid to others
Some of the SMGs have full weapon overhauls and look fantastic while others look almost the exact same with their stock modified, which you don't even see in game
*Spawns are god awful
I have always been a lucky person and never had issues with spawns in previous call of duty titles, so if you thought those were bad you are in for a bad time here
You will constantly spawn within earshot of another player even on some of the larger maps
In smaller maps it is possible for an enemy to spawn directly beside you
*While the maps themselves are good when played properly, good luck finding a game where people play properly
With call of dutys return to boots on the ground combat, comes the flood of players who will prone in odd doorways, sit in the back of the map not contributing to the team, and flank you from BEHIND YOUR OWN SPAWN
Power positions on most maps have to many entrances to make them worth defending and add in poor spawn systems it can make for an unpleasant experience for the majority of your time
*The way penetration damage is handled is very different in this game
I do not have the 100% direct from the code numbers, but I have had situations where the M1 Garand (a 2 shot kill weapon) took 6 shots to kill through a thin sheet of metal
*Flinch is back and worse than ever, nothing is more infuriating than either getting your gun kicked up so high you miss every bullet, or causing another player to flinch giving them a free accidental headshot
*Map count is the smallest a cod game has shipped with
The base game contains 9 basic multiplayer maps and 3 unique maps for the war game mode
This brings the total map count up to 9 maps, but seeing how 3 of them are only accessible in a single game mode with little replayability it is mildly disheartening
*Despite cods recent addition of more 60hz dedicated servers, the way the game is coded to handle latency means you will still be dying around corners that you were fully behind on your own screen
*Some real attention to detail would be nice, clan tags on your weapon that look like they are written in comic sans is a prime example
*If you can think of a bug that's been in every call of duty release up until now, your gonna be in familiar territory
Launch servers still suck, certain challenges are bugged, the new item indicator is still bugged, certain maps fail to load on PC sometimes and so on
Due to steam character limits my zombies and PC related sections was removed, you can view them here https://pastebin

												My hours
help
I wrote something for real!These hours are legit, I played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life
I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own
TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed
I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side
The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays
You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game
When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose
 However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game
In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect
Esspecially the mann vs
machine co-op
I mainly play that now
Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games
I believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game
I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people
Atleast from my experiance after over about 4+ years of playing it just got worse and worse
You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it
You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that!Although in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be
BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is


people really love to trade more than actually play
Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps
One last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way
I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above
Strictly towards the community
I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing
Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there
Just give it a shot and see what you think! Have fun <3

> Kill yourself
Or maybe that was just my experience
Oh well

												With all the new FPSs that are coming out you'd think that TF2 isn't relevant anymore but that is not true
TF2 has aged very well and can do most things other games can and more
Pros:-Gameplay is still fun and fresh-Hundreds of weapons to choose from-Hundreds of cosmetics to wear-Diverse and interesting maps-An active trading community-An in-game economy-Active workshop community-Many types of player made gamemodes -Many player made maps-It's freeCons:-Can be hard to learn when you first play-Lack of interesting updates recently-Many players have moved to overwatch-You need to buy keys to get most of the interesting cosmetics and weapons

												The vicious cycle of Team fortress 2First when you'll arrive in the game, you'll want Weapons, tons of them
Then you'll see that everyone has hats, and you'll want these, a tons of them
Then you'll realize that hats doesn't matter, only skill count, so you'll want a lot of skills, tons of them
Then new weapons will be added, and you'll want them, all of them
Then a new hat will be added and you'll want it, cause it'll be fancy on your main class
Then you'll realize again, that you don't give a damn about hats, all is about is skill
Then when you have waited for 3 years, new weapons will be added, and you'll want them
And then you realize that you spent  like 2000 hours of your life for this, met great friends, and you'll have a server where's you feeling like home, and you discovered so much things via the community, it learnt you so much
Then the rude reality of life, bring you on earth, and this game is here, Waiting for you to play 1,2,3


hours, and you'll be happy to see that all your good friend are still there

												Team Fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date
There is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one
The first time you start the simulator, you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items
If you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame, you get your very first hat: the Gibus
This is where it really starts; To play the simulator correctly, you have to spend money in the market place, made by Valve
After that, while you play the minigame, you can find hats which you can trade for, or collect! There is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats, just like you! After you collect enough items and/or hats, try joining a trade server! There, the REAL fun begins! Good luck, and beware of ending up poor!

[Description]Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast
The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities
Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through
[Pros]+ Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets
+ No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1
5 years after the game’s release
+ Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far+ Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate
From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior
+ Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher
+ A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency
+ You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players
+ Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits
+ Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together
+ Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from
This is making good use of 5
1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones
+ Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all
[Cons]- Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you
(This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future)- Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity
- Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode
- Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are
Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter
[Conclusion]While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series
Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it
I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork

we are the master race after all
(Only with controllers)
AIM ASSIST IS ONLY FOR CO OP AGAINST AI
(Terrorist mode)
Some collision problems with some of the maps
Price
All in all a very, very good game
Has the be the best tactical shooter I have ever played
HOWEVER I would warn anyone looking to pick this up, it is hard

This game has truly made me addictive heh
Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3)
I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people
Operation Health Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated May 26th, 2017===================================================Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 30,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing
The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team
Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc
People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh
If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall)
Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them
CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does
(but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)Now that you have a "general" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying
(if I miss something let me know)
=====================================Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use
However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there
Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing
If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual)
If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer
Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it
Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME
However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now
Despite what you might "think" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game
Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again
Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do
This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge
Plain and simple
For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual
Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win
There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game
This includes most skins and cosmetics
Pay2win is not anywhere in this game
Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll
This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk
There IS a program running to "check" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad
An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies
Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge
In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me
You need to know which windows/doors offer the best "peaking" for killing people, and go out carefully
In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions
Running Outside To kill ------ Another "Game Knowledge" Category that you should know
If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill
Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that "CRASH" in no time
It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location
There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones
If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!============================I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly
Check the comments section if you want to see it!Operation Health


my, my, my
This has caused quite the stir since Ubisoft decided to not release a new operator or map into the game
The change however is a welcome one
As I've played the game since release date, I'm extremely surprised that they decided to do this now instead of two years ago
This was a sorely needed update that wasn't entirely welcomed by the community for the cut content
Many people are stating that they should be compensated by Ubisoft if they bought the season pass
This is quite an odd thing to say considering they still get the bonus skins, renown, more challenges to earn more renown, all season 2 operators a week ahead and free, legendary skins, etc
So with Operation Health, it's essentially Ubisoft's way of saying, "We done goofed"
Since releasing, people have had problems with netcode, hit registration, and much more
This season is specifically targeted to fix these issues which as I've said before: FINALLY!Complaints regarding Operation Health aren't groundless though, and are well understood
We had a set basis for content release, and Ubisoft does a 180 two weeks before the Pro League Finals! My inital thoughts were "DANG IT!" but then after the first initiation of Operation Health hit, my Ping has gone down from an average of 60-80, to 40-60 which is HUGE
For a brief synopsis on Operation Health:One-step Matchmaking to improve it and prevent issues with disconnections, errors etc
Map Fixes for bugs, glitches, and spawnkilling (adding more assests to prevent instant spawn killing)HIt Boxes is basically improving and modifying the Hit Registration to improve it
Map Adjustment: Some maps are VERY hard to defend in certain areas, and they're planning on modifying some areas for an easier defense
Joining in progress bugs, and preventing someone from accidently joining a Ranked Match (few cases here and there)All around bug fixesMy response is a grudging thankfulness for this
Not entirely happy, but by far not upset because I'm very excited for these fixes! For the Main website link for your own look:https://rainbow6

												The main problem with the game is that it had to live up to Borerlands 2, and unfortunately it didn't
To put it simply
Positives;+ It's fun + Last half of the story is very good+ New fighting mechanics such as using the OZ kits+ Bad loot isnt obsolete with the grinder+ Character actually has personality and belongs in the campaign+ Cryo element and laser weapons+ You can feel the characters changing as the story develops+ Final Boss has new and interesting mechanics+ Great ending setting up for B3Negatives;- Alot of the missions early on are the same, you go to a place to try and find something, turns out you cant get it that way, have to find another way to get there (can happen up to 3 times), kill a weak bandit boss and get poor loot- Bugs, the new jumping mechanic means that enemies get stuck in walls even on flat ground- Needless running to areas- Fairly short story and not alot of side missions (35-40% of what B2 had to offer)- Alot of enemies use DOT weapons meaing you die after you cleared out an area with no way to get back up- DLC characters seem to be alot more powerful- Some of the mini bosses seem like reskinned versions of B2 bosses (BNK3R is pretty much in the game)Overall the game is enjoyable but I can only reccomend it to people who have played the earlier games in the franchise
If you are looking to play a game get Borderlands 2 as it has more value of enjoyment attached to it
Borderlands 2 > Pre Sequel > Borderlands			
Posted: 13 November, 2015
												Since the opinions on this game are really mixed, I decided to compare it to BL2
And make an acutal review about it with that
Obviously these points are my opinion, so don't judge it
Pre-Sequel Pros:- Classes are more interesting- Cyro is probably better than Slag (in game design)- Cars are faster- Early game is more fun- Vault hunters actually say things to the story- Butt SlamsBorderlands 2 Pros:- Longer story- Better DLCs- Not as much walking- More guns- Maps are more colorful- Better characters and humor- No annoying oxygen mechanic- More types of enemies- More Bosses/post story content- Better side quests- Less expensiveSo, overall I'd say BL2 is better
If you already played BL1 and BL2, buy TPS if you liked them
Even though you might wanna wait for a discount
As for people who are new to the series, I'd play BL1 or BL2 first, since this one is more expensive, and probably the worst one of the three
			
Posted: 2 August, 2015
												I would recommend to buy this game during a sale if you liked Borderlands 2, but this game isn't nearly as good as Borderlands 2
			
Posted: 16 April, 2015
												NOTE; Most of the other reviews are outdated
They were right at one point, but the game has taken a turn for the betterIf you haven't played Borderlands 2 yet, I highly recommend at least playing through the main story of that game before picking up this one
The game takes place on Pandora's moon, Elpis, and just like the games before it, you take control of one of four Vault Hunters, and you shoot your way through waves of bandits, psychos, hostile wildlife and an entire military force to open a vault
However, this game does have many different features to it that make it unique, and a lot of returning features
Pros;+Lazer weapons
A very welcome tool for your arsenal
They range from rapid fire assault rifles to shotguns to railguns+Cryo weapons
I wanted these very badly in 2, and my wish got granted
They restrict affected enemies movements and makes them vulnerable to melee attacks (mind that it does the same to you)+Vending Machines are now somewhat relevant
In 1 and 2 I didn't even bother looking in gun vending machines, but now that you're able to buy purple and orange rarety weapons, they actually have a purpose now+Manuverability
This is what really defines this game out of the series
The low gravity on Elpis allows acrobatic gunfights and more importantly; butt slams (or ground pounds
But butt slam is more fun)+Grinder
You can grind lower rarety weapons into better weapons of a higher rarety
Not an 100% chance of a higher rarety, but its a good way to get rid of some of your white and green guns+Classes
Skill trees are the same setup (I mean that as a good thing), and the classes are very unique


hopefully they'll have enough ideas for threeCons;-Side Quests
While the main quest's dialouge is interesting, and the gameplay is great, most side quests are just flat out dull in speech and gameplay
Too many fetch missions, that lead to more fech missions
Granted some do reveal how things came to be in time for 2, and others are funny enough to be redeemed, most aren't worth the EXP
-Lazy Raid Boss
Bosses now respawn (that was an issue for a while), but the first and only raid boss of the base game is the final boss with more health and higher damage output
While I still did enjoy murdering it, I would much rather prefer something new and fresh
-Shorter than 2
It has 13-14 chapters versus the 18 chapters 2 had
-Terrain
The game has many cool areas, with multiple ways to kill you
The only problem is, falling to your death is a little too easy at times
The manuverability I talked about before helps this, unless you're in a vehicle
Neutral things*Oxygen
When in a vacuum, you must rely on your oxygen supply to live (surprising right)
Oxygen also allows you to double jump and butt slam, so be sure to keep an eye on it
*Many returning weapons
A lot of weapons are similar to 2, so it should be a somewhat familiar experience with the loot
*Moonstones
The new Eridium
Used for ammo upgrades, moonstone chests (spend them to get purple rarety weapons/gear) or that lame raid boss I was talking about earlier
So mostly ammo
If you loved 2, you'll love this game
I love this game, so it pains me to say this; buy it on sale
Sure the gameplay is great, but the quests seem tedious and lack luster, and while the Claptastic Voyage DLC redeems this, a game shouldn't rely on DLC to fix itself
(This is my first review, so please give me some feedback on how I could improve my writing, or any spelling or gammatical errors
)			
Posted: 25 June
												If you enjoy the gameplay from Borderlands 2, and want some additional content, I highly recommend this
 However, I would also recommend you only purchase this on sale because it is not worth $40 in my honest opinion
			
Posted: 21 November, 2014
												Edited on 03/29/2015: The changes are made to reflect the most recent patch released on 03/24/2015, focusing on respawnable bosses
I DO NOT have Claptastic Voyage, so this review still only covers the base game
I thank the 2000+ readers who have given their time to rate my review
 More thanks to those who left comments
I don't want to write lengthy reviews since they take a lot of time; time that could be spent on playing my backlog of games
I love Borderlands
 I want to continue loving it
 The Pre-Sequel (TPS) is the 3rd game, and I have expectations
 At $60 I would expect more creativity, more risks, further embrace what BDL2 did successfully and remedy the areas that needed correction
What TPS offered, however, seemed to be a mediocre effort on the fronts that mattered that warranted a detailed review
TPS does do some things right:Classes: Although it still follows the archetypes of assault, offense, support and general purpose, there is enough variation and changes to make the classes feel different
 For instance, meleeing in BDL2 was very unsafe; Zer0's Deception covered too many areas to make melee effective (Slag, movement speed, dashing attack, damage output and more
) TPS introduced a much more flexible melee style through Athena, where she could close in distance very quickly, dashing across the area and capable of surviving through firefights
 TPS also expanded the use of stacks in all characters and eliminated overpowered damage increases from the likes of the Gunzerker
Money and Vending Machines are relevant: In BDL2, money was useless on any mode
 Vendors continued to sell white items even at OP8
 I rarely saw Purples and Legendaries never appeared
TPS vendors have Purples and Legendaries much more often, so money does play a role to help you gear up, and you'll want to treat death seriously to prevent being unable to afford said items
Moonstones: The eridium equivalent and this resource is constantly used
Players will be using it on multiple things, such as the Grinder to enhance the chance of improving the rarity of the weapon generated and adding an additional effect on the final product
Grinder: All weapon have a use
You can recycle unwanted weapons in hopes to get something new
Given that the vendors have better gear often, there's a bit of resource juggling where there's a choice to sell the item or craft a new one
Slamming: A crouching mechanic, for all classes, used in midair to drop quickly to the ground to create an AoE slamming strike
 This opens up new combat tactics and variations
 It should be a new staple
Lasers: A very welcome addition to the player's arsenal
All barrels function differently (with varying strengths and weaknesses,) and combining with the weapon brand gimmicks, lasers are the most varied weapon in the game
Different brands could enhance the strength AND negate the weaknesses
The rest of the game is where it starts falling apart:Writing: I wasn't impressed with the writing
Censoring profanity is fine to a degree, given that profanity shouldn't be the dictating factor to provide humour
But when you replace the profanity with words that don't even seem to match the harshness, the potential seriousness of the Borderlands world, it sounds weak
  Many characters seem to lack impact due to the limited influence they play throughout the story, and when a lot of the humour from the predecessors is also ripped out, the game fails to make a good lasting impression
 More often than not, I found myself being bored of the tales I was presented because the game couldn't make me care
Terrains: Lots of death pits
 Auto-save beacons were rare
 It's almost designed to ensure players died often
Side Quests/Main Quests/Padding: There are game designs that are generally despised; RPGs fail to make Charisma have impact; obscene amounts of QTE's that add nothing to spark interest; poor autosave location etcs
 There are also bad quest designs
 TPS embraced one of the least liked quest designs and amplified the worst aspects of it
TPS adores Fetch Quests, but it's done in a way that quickly loses its welcome
 You have a fetch quest that midway branches to another fetch quest, then this branch opens up to another series of fetch quests
 The objectives have objectives within the objectives to reach the objective!  Multiple fetch quests in the span of only ONE quest, effectively doubling to tripling this dull experience
 Rinse and repeat multiple times in multiple quests
 The experience becomes infuriating when you add in the poor terrain, killing legions of enemies that drop no good loot to show for your efforts under agitation, painfully dragging yourself through this boredom all in hopes of there may be something better later on
This is padding in the worst way -forcibly lengthening a game with minimal effort and creativity
 The game acts like it hates and mocks your free time
Lack of Creativity: For a $60 game, I expected that 2K Australia (2KA) came up with more content with BDL2 as a foundation
Hyperion could have their own Assault Rifles again
  Atlas could have hid a stash of guns to preserve their brand
 How about a new gimmick in existing brands? Instead, 2KA did little, if anything, to the existing BDL2 weapon pool, thus all weapons felt exactly what I expected without additional testing
TPS uses 90% (estimation only) of BDL2's legendaries, creating very few originals for a new experience
 No praise should come from this lack of effort
DLCs: DLC business practices are judged very unfavorably when the game is threadbare
It puts me at a moral standpoint where I am morally unable to want to buy the DLCs when more work needed to be focused on the main game
DLCs are welcome additions when the main game has substance, but in TPS's case, these DLCs may serve as the surgery needed to revive it
So why not put more energy in the main product? Why must I feel cheated of a better experience?And the very worst:Bosses are now Respawnable: For 161 days until March 24th 2015, bosses didn't respawn
 Players had to "ALT+F4" their game to prevent saving or duplicate their save files to fight minibosses
 Despite that this is remedied, that does not excuse the incompetence of 2KA for removing the said feature of to begin with
161 days
2KA knowingly took out a crucial feature that effectively killed the game's longevity
 2KA doesn't understand Borderlands
 The spirit of the franchise is noticeably absent
 2KA deliberately made a choice to make the game less fun for players, making the already hollow game offer even less
 Why?  Who approved of such a thing?Raid Boss:  The raid boss is the final story boss that has more health and deals more damage
At best, the raid boss is a lazily slapped together effort that lacks any innovation and originality
 At worst, it's open contempt to the fans who had any expectations
This is 2KA's way of saying that the players, who paid them $60 for this game, aren't worth their time to create a brand new boss fight
 2KA is giving no respects to the players who love the franchise, as if poorly reusing an existing boss meets the requirements of having a new boss, arrogantly attempting to justify that this mediocre amount of effort is suffice
This is taking incompetence to a whole new level
 2KA has taken a new step on to directly insult players
 It took out the middle man that is the gameplay and questing, and found a way to get players to feel shocked, appalled and disappointed just by looking at the boss
Final Verdict: 5/10 at the very best
2KA has offered us a game that meets the minimum expectations that fans have come to expect from a Borderlands game
This plays like a $30 DLC that costs $60
I cannot justify the $60 value with the experience TPS provided
 I do not pay money to feel insulted
 I do not reward such contempt and incompetence
If you must give TPS a try, buy it on a steep sale

												(Updated review
Went from about 9 hours gameplay when I first wrote this to 30),Well I guess I'm just not having the same experience as most of the top commenters
So far I've really enjoyed the game
Does it feel like it is a huge DLC? Yes
The menus are the same thing, the main screen when you start the game is the same thing (Your character, Claptrap doing stupid stuff in the background, same layout exactly just a different setting)
Does driving suck? Sorta
I've had issues with not making jumps and I've had times where occassionally my car decides to keep going straight while I'm turning
Yes I've fallen off the map multiple times, but it hasn't been that bad
Just something to get used to
I think the issue is more so that the jumps you have to do to get to other parts of the maps are very exact
There's not a lot of room to undershoot even with a perfect take off
Is AI bad? Not really
I feel like it's about the same as BL2, which wasn't perfect, but was pretty decent
If you see a guy and he doesn't see you he tends to walk around aimleslly
If you shoot they notice you 98% of the time, and when they don't, I just kill them and keep moving
No sense in standing around looking for reasons to not like the game
So now I'll move onto things that I've noticed:In BL2 you could find any weapon at any time
Not so here
Want a shotgun or a sniper rifle early?  Do some side quests then
You won't find them randomly
Want to play with the new ice weapons? Too bad, they don't start showing up for a long time
The loot system is definitely less randomized in this game
I got an Anshin Oz Kit from a side quest from Janie at level 3 and it's still the only one I've seen by Anshin and I've gotten two characters to level 12
I've seen Orange level rarity weapons and items a bunch from vendors but I've had white level equivelants that were better from a lower level
Also selling and buying prices are DRASTICALLY different in this game
Buying the Item of the Day costs me around $2000, If I were to sell pretty much the exact same item back I get like $60
This leads to me wanting to use the vendors less and less because money seems harder to come by and buying one or two things depletes my reserves for a pretty long time - and  I loot ALL the things
I wish higher rarity weapons truly showed that they were better in this game like they should be
The Oxygen thing is honestly neutral for me
It doesn't add to the game much, but it doesn't take from it either
I hardly notice it as almost every enemy drops oxygen tanks
If you're running low, kill something and there's an 80% chance it'll drop a tank
If one isn't enough that's what Kraggons are for
To sum everything up though, I have really enjoyed my experience so far
Things are a little less polished than I'd like, but I'm sure it'll be fixed in patches
There were no beta testers for this game and I'm sure most play testing was done on limited varieties of hardware
You cannot expect it all to run exactly the same on 20,000 different computer setups as well as the consoles it was released on
I'd recommend the game if you enjoyed the previous ones
If you are worried about these issues though, wait until it hits a sale
This is Steam, there's gonna be sales
EDIT: I've hit about 30 hours of gameplay now and I think I've grown to like the game more
I played through first as Athena and really didn't like her, then started as Wilhelm and enjoyed him but found he seemed to be underleveled and I got killed a lot
Now obviously the level is up to me to move, but I like to play through games without doing side quests first to experience the story, and then I play again and do achievements and sidequests
You can get through a really large chunk of the game this way, and then I got stuck around level 20 fighting level 25+ enemies
Restarted as Nisha because I figured if I had to grind I may as well try the last character! She's definitely my favorite, though her ability is a bit underwhelming on multiplayer haha
I find that once you get farther into the game and do side missions the issues I had with loot and money seem to go away for the most part, so I think I can mostly retract that
Still not a fan of vendor gouging though; I've seen orange level rarity weapons at vendors for well over 35,000 while everything else they're selling is around $1000
It feels like they're taunting you! I hadn't even FOUND that much money at that point in the game!I've also gotten more used to the different gravity and while I originally thought it made you a bit slower I find that I can get around really fast by using the oxygen boost (double jump)
There are oxygen geysers everywhere so it's not a big deal to burn that extra few O2
 I still stand by my recommendation for this game
If you like Borderlands, you're going to like this game
Also, thanks for the rates and comments

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is the follow up to Borderlands 2 and fallows on the rise of Handsome Jack
But will you want to play it ?Borderlands TPS takes place after the events of Borderlands and before the events of Borderlands 2 and follows on four new vault hunters
Athena, Wilhelm, Nisha and Claptrap get a message from a hyperion worker who happens to be Handsome Jack
After the Dahl soldiers take over the space station they try to destroy the moon of Elpis and it's up to you to stop them
Gameplay is identical to Borderlands 2
The only new thing is the new Oxygen system
You have a bar which starts to drain when you are outside the oxygen field for too long
Then you start to suffocate
You can also use the double jump to get on higher platforms
You can avoid the oxygen system by picking Claptrap as your character
The new abilities are awesome and all of them are very fun to use
Graphics are stunning as ever
They look awesome and all the colors are very nice to look at
The textures are kind of mediocre and some of the character models look very bad
Overall the game looks great apart from minor flaws
Audio is pretty bad
The game's audio for me stopped during firefights and I couldn't hear anything the characters would say to me and sometimes the Echo Com screen didn't transfer the dialogue and I couldn't hear anything which wasn't a problem in Borderlands 2
The soundtrack is alright, there are some great songs but a lot of them are kind of mediocre
The game is pretty easy for the most part until the final chapter where there is a massive difficulty spike and the final boss solo is incredibly hard
The boss fights are very team oriented meaning the game expected you to play with people from the start
Level Design in some parts is abysmal it took me massive amounts of understanding where my objective was and where the side quest start
This by far the worst level design in a borderlands game
The game took me 22 hours to complete every quest and to get to level 27
The game like other Borderlands games has tons of replay value with different vault hunter modes and trying out other characters and of course not to mention the DLC which I will have to check out one day
The game is pretty stable from the most part
There where some parts where the game wouldn't open a certain door to progress through a quest but a quick reload always fixed the problem
Overall this game is not as good as the other titles in the series and without a doubt not worth it at the full price
I am a massive Borderlands fan and Pre Ordered this game once I saw it and I can safely say it wasn't a bad game but it's not as good as the other Borderlands games
For other people only buy this on a sale
It has a lot of horrible side quests but this is an overall good game and I highly suggest you to check it out on a sale
I give Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel a 7/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												EDIT: Season Pass content has been completely revealed, updated review to reflect that
If you know me, you know I'm a Borderlands maniac
This game simply just did not deliver
Gearbox handed the reigns off to 2K Australia and it seriously suffered
Lemme give you the run down:POSITIVE+ Buttslams and low gravity are fun as hell, and make combat in this game incredibly satisfying and borderline addictive+ 4 new(ish) vault hunters with great skill trees and little to no skills that absolutely suck (lookin' at you More Pep & Flicker from BL2)+ Each vault hunter is more chatty and has unique dialogue to chime in with during story and side mission conversations+ The Grinder is a great tool for helping you get that specific gear you're looking for by putting in the correct ingredient weapons+ Laser weapons are friggin' sweet! Pewpewpew!+ New vehicle, the Stingray, is unique in being the first solo-rider-only+ Vending machines have significantly higher chances to have an orange item as the item of the day (like BL1 chances)NEGATIVE - 90% of orange items in this game are DIRECT PORTS or RESKINS of guns from BL2
Some are even clones with very small mechanical changes as if to pass it off as something brand new
There are a VERY SMALL handful of completely new orange weapons- As a cherry on top of that issue, a large group of bosses and mini-bosses that have specific orange weapons tied to their loot drops NEVER RESPAWN
You get one shot to get their loot
Good luck or have fun Alt+F4ing- Don't forget the chocolate sauce for this sundae of dissapointment! The Grinder WAS cool until you find yourself rely on it nearly completely as a source of oranges during end-game because you got no BOSSES TO FARM
- As if finding ported oranges wasn't bad enough, welcome back a few freakin' direct port quest uniques! REALLY 2kAUS?? They burn you on the oranges and then even get too lazy to make UNIQUE quest rewards for this game- Areas of the map include lots and lots of long uninteresting treks across the moon until you unlock the vehicles- The soundtrack in this game is not very interesting
It's all just kinda bland space trancey stuff
BL2 (especially the pirate dlc) had some absolutely sick music- enemies are very watered down in variance
Basically you have bandits in space suits (but much less variety of them), dahl soldiers, kraggons (they're cool), shugaraths (only on 1 map though) space spiderants and eridians
They cut out badass psychos, nomads, goliaths, varkids, bullymongs and crystalisks completely
The amount of new enemies is very much out-weighed by what you lost- enemies don't really say anything memorable
In  BL2 the bandits and hyperion personal said some hilarious things in the middle of battle
Scavs on the moon just say a lot of aussie mumbo jumbo
I mean it's lightly amusing, but the delight of the accent wears off soon and the dialogue itself is not that funny
- Once you hit 50 there isn't a lot to do
With all the recycled oranges from BL2 and the issues of their bosses never respawning why do you even bother farming? Oh that's right so you can take what you do from farming vending machines and put it in the grinder
gee thats fun, whoopee!- The season pass is very pail compared to BL2's pass
It includes 2 characters (Handsome Jack's doppleganger and Hamerlock's sister, Aurelia) 1 arena dlc called the Holodome (also comes with +10 levels) and 1 campaign dlc (+10 more levels included, so max level cap will be 70)
So in total that's 2 characters, 1 arena and 1 campaign
Let me remind you BL2 had FOUR campaigns in their season pass and still had 2 characters dlc you could get serperately from the pass (Gaige was even free with preorder of BL2)- The story isn't all that impressive, and leaves some pretty big questions unaswered for the viewer
But you form your own opinion on the story, if anything the unique dialogue from each vault hunter is very fun to listen to
In summary, this game is not woth the $60 price tag
I would reccommend waiting for a sale that drops it to $45 or lower
The pre-sequel is a fun game for the first play-through for fans of the franchise and newcomers
Play-through 2 and endgame will largely dissapoint the hardcore fans that enjoy the series so much, though

The product Irrational Games showcased at E3 2010 is significantly different compared to the product that's available to the consumer
Not every game has to have more than one ending, stealth mechanics, weapon customization, a third person player view, character customization, a variety of meaningful choices, manual save mechanics, modification development tools or have no scripted moments to be a decent game
Sure, any one of these features would have been great additions and dispite of the downgrade, I can absolutely recommend Bioshock Infinite if the price is right

												Bioshock Infinite is a masterpiece
The graphics are awesome, it's a cool experience to explore the flying city Columbia by hooks and railways
The best thing of Bioshock Infinite is the story, you can't stop playing without thinking about what happened or what will happen next
At the end of the game you will be speechless and sad that it's already over (but don't mind, you can play as many times as you want)
You have a solid variety of weapons you can use during the game which make the battles against the enemies very interesting
The DLCs are as good as the game itself
Bioshock Infinite is a MUST for everyone who likes great stories

												No game will ever affect me as much as BioShock Infinite did
After playing through the game three times (twice on Xbox 360 & once on PC) it still upsets me that Irrational signed over the series permanently
I'm going to keep this clean of any spoilers and say that this was a brilliant end to the revolution of the trilogy, and that Burial at Sea episodes One & Two are to be considered absolutely mandatory if you are to play this game properly
This game has been one of only a few games, that has brought me to tears on more than one occasion
Call me a cry baby or whatever, but I am as passionate about this series as any fanatic is about whatever they are obsessed with
BioShock will always have a special place in my life post of completing Infinite
I would recommend not only this game, but BioShock, BioShock 2 also
If you are thinking about buying this, do it, have fun, and pay attention

Posted: 24 June
												This game was absolutely amazing
 Even a year after playing it all the way through, some aspects of the underlying story still stick with me
 I won't speak much to gameplay, because while I enjoyed the game immensely that wasn't what made this a true experience
 All of the BioShock games were excellent and a great journey - certainly at the top of my list for enjoyment
 Infinite was a little different though
 For me, it was the visually impactful segments and the deeply moving moments throughout
 Everyone connects with storytelling differently, but this one resonated with me a great deal
 For reference, my beloved list of games like this one are F
E
A
R
Perseus Mandate and 2, Dead Space 3, Mass Effect 2, Dragon Age II, Syberia I and II, The Longest Journey and Dreamfall, Half Life 2, Unreal II and a handful more
 This game was at the upper end of that list and I wish I could have stayed in the Infinite world for so much longer
 The ending for me was like the ending of the Hyperion/Endymion novel series - I understood it and knew at a visceral level that it was coming, but it took me a while to accept it because I was so invested in the main characters and I didn't want them to go
 It is so rare for a story to sit inside me casting around for a place to rest amongst my values and character
 In 40 years, I have experienced this with a very small collection of books, movies and games
 BioShock Infinite managed to find a place there

								Be me
Create a new squad and be SL
A bunch of randoms join it
Game starts
Whole squad follows my orders
No questions asked
Worried we are all a bunch of casuals that are going to get wiped out as soon as we get into contact
Hike across map for 20 mins stressing out about it
Hostiles spotted
All hell breaks loose
Everyone starts shooting
Everyone screaming
I s**t my pants
We call out targets and look out for each other and somehow make it through
We wipe out three enemy squads, a BTR, a logi truck and an enemy fob
We cap two points and push enemy team all the way back to main
Our squad is so good, other squads start thanking us wherever we go
Other squad leaders start arguing with each other over who asked for our help first
We become the stuff of legends and take out another squad, a BTR and fob
Game ends
10 seconds of silence staring at score screen
We win and are by far best squad in every category with kills, points etc
Squad says I was the best SL they ever played with

								Very team (Squad) based realism military shooter
Squad is a game where if you get a squad that works together you will destory everything and it makes the game a lot more fun with a good Squad leader with Squad members who listen
A game for the more tactical gamers, military Veterans, and mature groups of people
I have a list of weapons and kits and what they mean, along with some screenshots below

Early Access Review
								May 31st 2017 - 15:30 GMTAs a medic in the Russian Ground Forces, I saw bodies in the streets of SE Petrivnka, of my fellow comrades, ones who fought beside me, the ones I trusted, laying beside me as I was firing bullets into an enemy we could not see, but was there siphoning the lives around me
All was lost but hope
As I helped build sandbags around the village, I could feel the presence of the militia, their eyes on me, their fingers ready to see me drop
As explosions and bullets smashed through concrete, the concrete we thought would protect us, the concrete we thought was impenetrable, I made a desperate run for the two-storey farmhouse with my best friend and some comrades in arms, a few of us were in the same squad, some from different squads, yet we fought and bled together we saw some of our comrades hit the ground as the militia technical's DShK ripped into the building shattering the soldiers
Some of our men were down, I peered through the window hoping to get shot, but I see enemies coming over the hill and I see one in an alleyway, I take a shot at him and he is injured, but I was too scared to take another, my team-mate finishes the job, I went to attend to the men which were down but I had no bandages, then a comrade decides to go and help with the bandages as he was too a fellow medic
He goes and tells me something but he

he gets shot in the head blood pouring through like a waterfall
I take cover, as many other men fall around me
We were stuck in a two-storey prison and also a mass grave
I took cover in the corner, as the only people left was me and an automatic rifleman, I saw my best friend bleed out in front of me, he dies
I shut my eyes and then the automatic rifleman was shattering the stairs with bullets
The enemy which I couldn't see is now one floor below me
I shut my eyes one last time and as I open them I see on my screen:"MILITA FORCES HAVE WON"I was glad, not because the enemy won but because the pain had stopped
I was only a recruit, 13hrs on my belt
Yet nothing could prepare me for this

Early Access Review
								I spent the first 20 minutes in Squad not knowing what to do
I spent the next 15 minutes trying to kill someone
I didn’t
Then the game ended
Undeterred I picked a new server and got ready to roll into the game with guns blazing
Twenty minutes later, I still hadn’t managed to shoot a single insurgent
It took me a full 45 minutes to get my first confirmed kill
 The first half an hour in Squad was awful, the HUD wasn’t intuitive, and I had no idea what the point of the game was
The next hour was filled with short and intense firefights, slow and steady progress and some of the best teamplay that I’ve ever experienced
 Squad’s gameplay bursts to life once you start actively participating in your squad and communicating with your team members
 Each kill you achieve brings you one step closer to victory, and every death you experience cripples your squad
 Squad is an immersive and realistic experience, filled with tense moments, bitter defeat and sweet victory
One of my most memorable moments in the game occurred about halfway into the match
 We had just managed to capture the Market and parts of squad 1 were with us(squad 2)
 After an incredibly tense firefight, we had finally managed to take down the insurgents and were stationed in a defensive position, looking out towards no man's land, on the lookout for the opposing team
 One of the cool features of Squad is proximity communication, in other words you can push-to-talk and those that are near you will be able to hear what you have to say, with the voice getting quiter the further away you are from the speaker
 One of the members in squad 1 activated his proximity communication, and started talking to us about a firefight that he had experienced the other day
 What happened next was a couple minutes of players, sitting in a circle swapping war stories as if they were old soldiers
 It was an incredibly rewarding and organic experience



until we got way too distracted swapping war stories, and got overrun by the insurgents
In CS:GO are punctuated by a bursts of activity, gunplay and death, Squad’s gameplay is much more of a slow and steady burn
 At its core, Squad is a game that revolves heavily around teamwork and being able to communicate effectively with the rest of your squad
 Communication with your squad and your team is especially important and the game allows you a multitude of ways for you to communicate with your squad, your team, and those in your direct proximity
 You’ll need to work together with your squad in order to capture and control each base
 This will require large amounts of teamwork and for you to have complete trust in your squad to watch your back
The gameplay in Squad is deadly, with death occurring quickly and oftentimes unexpectedly
 You'll run and duck as a shower of bullet peppers the wall behind you, grip your gun tightly as tracer rounds fly above your heads and breathe a sigh of relief when your squad rounds a corner in order to back you up

Early Access Review
								If you don't trust Early Access titles, then this game may change your mind
I can honestly say that I have NEVER in my time playing Early Access games, seen a developer team that works so closely with the community, and even comes on the servers and plays with every one and asks questions and makes sure that the communities voice has been heard
But to get down to an actual review of the game, here goes
GAMEPLAYThe gameplay for it being an alpha early access game is PHENOMENAL, the firefights that you get into are intense, and really get your blood flowing
The game is so well designed that from the standpoint of gameplay, you actually gain a sense of fear before assaulting a compound, or hearing footsteps outside a wall unsure if it is a friendly or not, and being unwilling to check your map for fear of potentially getting shot
The in-game comms are very well done, Local positional voice, Squad voice, and Squad leader voice (For SLs talking amongst other squads)
The medical system is an ever changing system, but it is also a system that works, and it works damn well
The weapon handling is fantastic, it really emphasizes not blasting full auto, unless of course you are in a CQB situation then it works perfectly fine
Fob building is great as well, clear images of what is going to be there once it has been built by squadmates, and what direction it faces
Overall, coming from Project Reality myself, the gameplay for Squad gets a solid 10/10 from me
AUDIOHonestly, I have never heard a military shooter with such crisp audio
From the footsteps of friendly and enemy soldiers, to the supersonic crack of a bullet flying passed your head
Nothing in my opinion beats Squads audio team and I really commend them for doing all the research they can to get the sounds as close to what they are in real life
The weapon sounds are crisp, clear, and sound powerful
Not like other games where they sound like peashooters
The death screams are a nice touch, and help with identifying allies that have gone down and need a medic and confirming kills
The music score in the main menu is also phenomenal, it really brings to life the thought of being sent to a warzone and not knowing if your squad is going to make it, although the music isn't featured in the actual gameplay, it's a welcome and very well done touch to the main menu
GRAPHICSThe graphics are a huge step-up from Project Reality
I've played games like Arma 3/2 and before that, I've also played the entire battlefield series (but stuck with BF2), and countless other games that are very intense when it comes to graphics
Squads graphics in some aspects are some of the best I have seen
From the backblast of an RPG or LAW, to the actual explosion of hand grenades, 40mm grenades, or the warheads from the LAW/RPG they are fantastic to watch and truly a sight to see, and gives a sense of danger when you see this huge cloud of smoke land just feet away from you as you are taking cover behind a wall waiting for your moment to break cover and return fire
The player models are always being updated, with the new Russian, Militia, and the Insurgent factions getting a welcome makeover since I started playing in September
The Americans are due for a makeover as well, but this will come in due time
CONTROLSUnlike the Arma series, Squad doesn't feel even close to as clunky as arma, but offers the same range of movement(Save for free look which is a possibility in the future)
It offers a rich and rewarding movement system that causes you to think before you make an action as the momentum of your soldier is what propels you towards the direction you are facing, unlike games like Battlefield 2/3/4 where it feels like you're constantly sliding around with a constant momentum in either direction where you can turn on a dime and get a headshot
Squad isn't a milsim, but it also isn't a twitch shooter, and it really finds it's balance by bringing the two together and taking the good parts from both, while getting rid of the bad parts as well as incorporating a lot of the phenomenal things that Project Reality has done
TEAMPLAYI'm going to say it simple, and blunt
If you DON'T communicate with your squad/team, you WILL fail
I play in a highly organized clan where we are all comfortable with each other, and understand each other
We know what is expected of us from our Squad Leaders, and the #1 thing that you can, and have to do to be successful, is LISTEN to your squad leader and COMMUNICATE what is going on around you
Giving valuable information such as enemy movement in a certain direction (0 to 345, 0 being 360), letting your squad leader know when you have stumbled upon an enemy FOB, or even letting the medics know you've been tagged and need medical attention
I cannot stress enough how valuable communication and teamwork is in this game, working as an effective squad where that squad is helping the team will make or break your experience
All in all, I recommend squad 110% the game took my breath away from the moment I stepped on the sandy hills of Logar pressing through hostile fire coming from the central village, or stepped into the deep desert valley of Kohat
Now with the addition of Fool's Road, I can add the intensity it was when we had three squads all communicating together storming up the side of a steep hill, to overtake an enemy FOB and release the capture point from their possession
If you pass up the opportunity to buy and play this game, I guarantee that you will regret it, Squad has been the best money I have spent on a game in a long time and I couldn't be happier
To give you some perspective on what I mean by teamwork, here is a link to a video I recorded tonight (2015-12-14) that should shed some light on what it's like to really play as a team
The game takes time to learn
There are bugs yes, but the game is still in early development and the developers are very active in the community and do their best to fix every bug they can find before the next build update
With regards to the learning curve, it's not as steep as Armas learning curve, and it's designed so that the average FPS player can hop in and start playing basically
But, there are still concepts that are not present in other FPS games, like listening to your squad leader and doing what he says, building FOBs, taking defensive positions etc
The game isn't about rushing in and trying to get the most kills, it's about playing as a team, moving as a team, and making sure everyone is ready in your squad before moving in to attack
There aren't any bugs in the game that are gamebreaking, AMD users have a bit of trouble playing, but that's not completely on the devs side, that has to do with Unreal Engine 4 not really liking AMD processors and graphics cards
I myself have a Core i5-3570k and a GTX 970 and I usually get between 40 and 50 fps right now while recording video
To end the final edit on this review, the game is great, it's still in alpha and being developed by only 30 people, now for 30 people to do something like this, it's amazing
When you get a company like EA/DiCE who have hundreds of developers at their disposal, and they still turn out a bad game (E
g
Battlefront, Battlefield 4, Battlefield Hardline etc) or Treyarch/activision (Call of duty games = same thing every year no real ingenuity) then what exactly are those devs doing to make sure they put out a good game? Anyways, YMMV with this game, but it's up to the individual to decide whether or not this is the game for them
I chose to replace the original video with one that shows what you will see more of in Squad
This is what you will experience 95% of the time while playing
Or at least what I have experienced 95% of the time while playing

												What I've played of the game so far is brilliant
But being able to play the game is like navigating a minefield
Between save data being corrupted (have had to restart the campaign TWICE), seizure inducing flickering, alt-tab crashes, mouse cursors showing up in gameplay, I just can't recommend anybody purchase the game in its current state
I really want to support Single-Player FPSes til the day I die, but I can't support broken releases
It pains to me to not recommend this title, but I will gladly change my review once a drastic fix is released in the coming days

												Just finished the main story, and I gotta be honest, I feel underwhelmed
Something about this game feels unfinished - you'll find out as you play, all the elements are here - Killing Nazis
Cool guns
Great sound
Fantastic attention to detail
Everything in these departments is set - as the first game was
But it's missing a couple things as well - the story is simply not finished
I don't know if MachineGames ran out of time, or money, but it's missing the "Big Revolution" element it so desperately needed
I don't feel motivated to destroy the regime as much, because I'm not put in anywhere nearly as many positions where I see the struggling of the American People - similar to the Concentration Camp mission from the first game
There is nothing like that, and I think the game could have used a couple missions like that
Your buddy - Wyatt or Fergus - also is relegated to a backseat role - disappointing considering the amount of emphasis they put on the choice in the first game
At this time, I simply cannot reccomend the game at full price
While the first game had the depth and drama that a game like this should, this is lacking in that oh-so-crucial department, and has a pretty meager amount of time you can enjoy everything

												Let's be serious
Every time we consumers do not punish something poorly done we are encouraging that it happens to us again
I am no techie and when I buy a product I expect it to be finished and polished unless it is early access, in which case I know the risks I am taking (and probably would never pay 60 $ for an early access game)
I love you guys in Bethesda and Machinegames and I own and have really enjoyed a lot of the games you developed or published
But this time, someone has done a crappy job, and I don't see why I should pay for it
The game is so terribly optimized that you put a patch out yesterday that caused thousands of players (me amongst them) to not be able to start the game ever again due to "Could not write crash dump" error messages
Then, trying to find the solution has become a game in real life (maybe this is the real WII TNC game! Brilliant!): install this, uninstall that, cry here, shout there


and nothing works
I have a heck of a computer and a great bunch of games and never experienced any hardware issues, not to mention the impossilibity to launch my expensive, newly-acquired game
Therefore, buying this game right now is an act of irresponsibility encouraging the developers to put to sale more crappy job before it's finished
Let's not buy, let's refund and only when they get it properly done, we'll buy again
WII TNC IS A MUST-NOT as it is!EDIT 11/03/2017 10:00 am: I tried reupgrading my driver (again) to the latest version (after I had downgraded it since the crash error started) and this time it worked! Back in the game, working like a charm

 The game as it stands October 31st
After nine hours of play time on "Call me Terror-Billy" and completing the main story I started out loving the game
It was fast paced and had a fun enough combat system to keep it fresh enough through the entirety of the game
By the middle point of the game I started to feel a sense of dread as I began to realize that the story was coming to an end way too early for the $60 price tag
I would love to say I would love recommend the game but as it stands it is much too short, littered with bugs, poor optimization and the fact something as simple as the steam overlay crashing the game even in the main menu I have to give it a no
Maybe in the future when the game is patched and updated with the three DLC stories the game will worth the $60 price tag but as the game is it doesnt stand up to other single player games of the same price

												Oh boy here I go Killing again			
Posted: 29 October
												Since people complained:***SPOILERS FOR Wolfenstein: The New Order (a THREE YEAR OLD game) IN REVIEW***Sadly, I can't recommend Wolfenstein II at it's current price
Firstly, the game is extremely short
I beat the main storyline in two sittings
Granted I probably game more than most people but seriously, the main campaign is SHORT
I got about 18 hours out of the game, which might be long for a FPS, but as someone that most recently played Breath of the Wild, $60 to play for about 15 hours and watch 2-3 hours of cutscenes seems pricey
This game never reaches the heights of Wolfenstein: The New Order
Remember that surprising bit in TNO when you go to the moon and discover entirely new weapon types that feel badass and futuristic, and totally change the way the game plays? There are no moments like that in TNC
 I kept waiting to discover some cool new weapon, but midway through the game you have all the weapons unlocked and almost all of them are boring
They actually feel like a step backwards from TNO, especially the heavy weapons
They're so slow and unweildy they're functionally useless in most situations
You keep playing and playing expecting some bit "oh COOL" moment to happen, but all of the coolest moments in the game happen in cutscenes, to be frank
Stealth in this game seems like an afterthought
Most levels feature a small opening area where you can stealth around and kil a few guards, but there's very little chance of stealthing 100% through any level effectively
Granted its Wolfenstein but the game seems to try and reward you for stealthing and punish you for going in guns blazing, only to then make it nearly impossible to effectively stealth around
There also doesnt seem to be a "lost em" mechanic, meaning once you're spotted the enemies always seem to have a general idea of where you are from then until they're dead
 Remember that moment in TNO when you have to choose between your companions, who lives and who dies? Remember how terrible a decision that was the first time? There are no moments like that in TNC
Everything feels like it's on rails and you're just running from cutscene to cutscene
Remember the almost puzzle-like complexity of the prison camp? Remember the awe-inspiring reveal of the Da'at Yichud armory?  Remember the gut-wrenching sacrifice Bobby made to get BJ in for the assault on the London Nautica launch facility? TNC has so many opportunities to tell a compelling, interesting story, but instead uses almost all of it's time to hit you over the head with the "WHITE PEOPLE BAD" messaging
The cartoonish violence and hamfisted characters are never brought home with compelling and rich storytelling
Storywise, EVERY SINGLE PLOT TWIST is telegraphed way, way in advance
You'll see everything coming, for the most part
During some cutscenes I actually found myself bored, since there was nothing interesting or surprising about what was going on
There are no jaw-dropping "Oh WHAAAAT" moments like there were in TNO
Plus things about the storyline just don't make sense
For some reason in cutscenes the Power Suit is bulletproof


yet when you're playing it doesn't seem to matter that you have it on, you take damage just like normal
Whoever did Frau Engel's voice acting was stellar and some of her writing is superb, but she just wasn't given enough to do in the game
She is never as compelling or terrifying a villain as Death's Head
Also


Venus? What? It's never really explained why the Nazis have a gas mining facility on Venus, unless its explained in some collectible that I haven't found yet
The moon made at least a little sense, since it's strategically important and the plot did a pretty good job of at least handwaving why they had a base there
But Venus just doesn't make any sense
Also the developers don't seem to understand just how far Venus is from Earth
Venus is 162 MILLION MILES from Earth but for some reason ALL of the Oberkommando decide to make that their permanent base of operations on a whim? They couldn't move to like, California? Or Washington? The most optimistic estimate (even given sci-fi space tech) is that it takes about 100 days to get to Venus
So for BJ to get there and back would have taken the majority of a year


the game suggests he gets back in days
A lot of the plot just seems like the writers had a bunch of cool ideas they wanted to see in a game and they drafted a story around those ideas
Sometimes that works, here it's clunky
Having said that, if W2: TNC was $49
99 I would suggest maybe picking it up if you're a huge fan
But There's some good stuff here - the weapons are somewhat satisfying to use, though certain weapons just completely outshine others, so you'll find yourself using two or three guns through the entire game
Also as a quick tip - somehow tagging someone with a dieselkraftwerk DOES NOT raise an alarm if you're unseen
This is bonkers
Lastly blocking ACTUAL CONTENT behind a pre-order bonus is a turn-off
Overall the game just doesn't feel like it's worth $60
It's short, messy, poorly written, and while there are a few moments where you truly feel like "Terror-Billy" the badass, for the most part the game is boring and repetitive
I'd say wait for a price drop
Edit: Added more detail to balance the review
			
Posted: 1 November
												Not a lot is different compared to the previous game
The game feels a lot shorter compared to the previous as well and all the new characters are simply just so unlikeable - especially Grace Walker (the stereotypical black woman) who is unnecessarily rude to everyone for no good reason
Skill upgrades in the game are so pathetic and useless that I forgot they even existed 2/3 into the game
Anya is pregnant, which is fine, but the devs must have some sort of pregnancy fetish because she is constantly sexualised in odd ways - like at one point she tears off her clothes and shoots nazis
It also feels like the game is ripping off concepts from other games
For instance - there is a mission where you have to go to Venus to do something - and I challenge anyone to convince me this level did not remind them of the game DOOM
You also unlock a new heavy weapon up there (BFG?)
Manhattan level felt like it was trying to be Fallout 4
etc etc
There just wasn't any levels that made the game feel original - compared to (lets say) the opening level of the previous Wolfenstein game - which felt fantastic
But most dissapointing of all is the ending - no spoilers - but you don't even realise you're fighting the final boss - just a couple of 'stronger than usual' enemies that you can beat without any problems - followed up by an anticlimactic ending

												Since this review is at mixed with 2,896, I thought I'd chime in with my two cents, and see if that is worth it, or more, to anyone who might be deciding whether to purchase this game or not
Wolfenstein 2 is less a sequel to Wolfenstein The New Order, than it is a Retro Future Nazi Killing Themed sidegrade to D00M
And that isn't a bad thing
Although it lacks D00M's parkour-esque mechanics, the gunplay has the same visceral, balls-to-the-wall, think-on-your-feet mentality
With that, there are different ways to play
Run and gun, pump and dump (as in just get the craziest heaviest weapons and go ham), or stealth
I tend to favor whichever I think works best for the situation at hand, but none of them feel contrived or played out
One of my biggest issues with The New Order was sometimes having no clear way of tellng where to go, and while that isn't completely fixed, it is addressed by giving you a sometimes difficult to spot waypoint marker which does help
As for the Elephant in the Room
Crashing
Wolfenstein 2 is one of the most optimized and polished releases I've seen on PC
From a technical standpoint it is sheer magic
The choice to stick solely with Vulkan has benefits for every platform, even our little Penguin Bros on Linux, and is absolutely vendor agnostic
This game does not pick sides
It doesn't cow down to nVidia's Gameworks, or AMD's Open Design Tools equivalent
Crashing on Team Green has been, and confirmed by the steady release of (to their credit), nvidia drivers to address their cards shortcomings
AMD has been quick to resolve some as well
It must be said, that them having to disable forced driver updates (which, is stupid, people you need to keep your stuff up to date) and also disabling Async Compute Shaders for nVidia shows that that DX12-ready sticker they slap across the box of the 900/1000 series is just smoke and mirrors
I prepped a PC with a Ryzen 1700 and a GTX 970 for this game, with Display Driver Uninstaller and clean drivers, 388
00, and 388
10, and 388
13 as they were released
Neither him, nor I, having an old 2012 R9 290X 4GB [the hot and spicy b-tard as it is] had any issues, save for one crash for myself
On one of the later areas, on a conveyor belt I had one crash
Reloading the game after losing about two minutes worth of progress, and no issues
At 1080p Ultra Preset with TSSAA I was able to maintain an average of 70-90fps, with drops to 35 and 45 in New Orleans (thankfully in areas where there wasn't a lot of fighting to do)
This is the way the PC Gaming Industry needs to go
TItles that push limits, that break molds, that hold card vendor's feet to the fire, instead of backtracking on comfortable, heavy-handed, vendor-specific features
Vulkan and DirectX 12 are the future, and Wolfenstein is its Flag-Bearing Vanguard, and deservedly so
One of the best FPS games since D00M, and one of the best sequels
A must have, a must own, and a must play, bar none

Early Access Review
[written for version 0
51]In modern parlance Paladins would be described as a free-to-play "hero shooter" - that is to say, an objective based, co-op only, first-person shooter where, rather than your avatar being largely defined by the gun you pick or the items and abilities you equip, they're already fully formed characters with their own unique, pre-defined abilities and specific roles
There are several modes to play, but the main thrust of the game is Siege mode, which sees two teams of five charge to the centre of a map and try to hold an objective zone
While there's a lot of nuance to the mechanics and conditions of play, the fundamentals are this - capturing an objective zone to spawn a payload earns your team one point; escorting the payload to the enemy base earns you another point; but if the opposing team manages to successfully prevent the payload from reaching their base within a set time, then they earn the point
First to four points wins the match
Characters, or "champions", technically fall into one of four different roles - front line; "tanks" made to take punishment and hold the objective - damage; made to dish out said punishment - support; primarily focused on healing - and flank; who are all about being sneaky-sneaky and harassing the enemy from behind
I say "technically", because, even though that's how they're labelled in-game, most champions can bleed into a couple of roles to varying degrees
One important thing to note is you can't change champions once the match has started
So if you're part of a terrible group of players who wouldn't know how to create a decent team composition to save their life, then you're kinda screwed and more or less have to endure a horribly unbalanced game where a team lacks any real cohesion and synergy
But to help with this to some degree are loadouts and items
Every champion has a deck of sixteen cards that are unique to them, and during your time outside of matches, you can construct your own loadout based on five of these cards which boosts the effectiveness of their abilities
Items are like temporary versions of cards that can be acquired mid game but are only applied for the duration of the match and bought with credits earned during play
And finally, there are Legendary cards, with each champion having three of these but needing to commit to one for the whole match
These are cards which apply a massive bonus to one of your abilities and can make your champ highly specialised in one aspect of performance or another
But this is where you have to be really careful, as choosing the wrong cards or items could make or break how a match goes
This is actually one of the most ingenious features of the game, I think, as it allows for a lot of strategy and means the player with the best aim or reflexes won't necessarily be the victor
In fact, one of the things I love so much about the game is how accessible it is to so many different skill levels and styles of play
If you just want to do the shooty pew-pew thing, there's plenty of characters that'll have you covered there
Maybe your aim isn't so good but you have a keen sense of timing and situational awareness, in which case healer might be the role for you
Or maybe you just like being a stonkin' great big tank throwing your weight around at the centre of it all
There's a little something for just about everyone
But the real star of the show here is the ever increasing cast of colourful, creative characters that somehow manage to all play massively differently from one another
Both the design and artwork really shines through, and is topped off with great animation and largely top-notch voice acting
There's an abundance of detail in every aspect of them, whether it's some little nicks and scuffs on the side of a firearm, or even the motions as they actually fire and are reloaded, or just the way a character moves around and performs each of their abilities, or even how they idle
There's a real sense of love and attention that's very clear to see, and that extends to every aspect of the presentation both throughout the UI and within each of the many maps as well
And, if anything, this only seems to be getting better as more and more interesting and creative content is being released with admirable and impressive regularity
As well as all the artwork (I don't think enough credit goes to the card art in particular, while I'm at it) I think special mention has to go to the audio as well
Sound is very important in this game as every single champion has their own noises, from the sounds of their abilities being activated, to their main weapon being fired, to the stomps of their feet
If you listen out to what's going on around you then there's an awful lot of information to be found just by keeping your ears open
At any given moment you'll likely be able to tell exactly who's firing, roughly what direction they're in, and probably even how far away they are
A lot of players probably aren't even consciously aware of it, but it's always there and making a huge difference, more so than just about any other game I can immediately think of
It's not all roses, though, as the game does have its fair share of problems
Personally, I think the damage feedback is desperately in need of improvement
Having the very outer edge of the screen momentarily turn a faint red hardly seems adequate in the heat of combat, and at this point I've lost track of the number of times I've died without even knowing I was being attacked in the first place
But a bigger issue than that is the matchmaking
I wouldn't go so far as to say it's broken, but I'm only a few more bad games away from calling it that
It feels like it's becoming increasingly hard to get games with consistantly matched players of equal skill, and 4-0 stomps are becoming more of a thing lately - which are never fun, no matter what side of them you're on
The rating system, on the other hand, I think at this point I can call broken
In Competitive mode, both your individual champions and your overall account ratings are awarded or docked points based on whether you win or lose, and then (presumably) used to calculate further matchmaking as it attempts to queue you up with players of equal skill
The trouble with this system is, it seems so focused on the bottom line win or lose result and has little bearing on personal preformance
As a result, you could play the best game of your life, but if you were teamed up with bad players, or someone on your team was disconnected or there were heavy lag issues, the game doesn't really care and will still deduct you for it
It's really not fun when you feel as though you're being punished regardless of your own ability or contribution, and as it stands right now, my own personal rating for both my account and many of my champions are in the toilet despite my consistant above average performances
And the worse thing is, that effect only seems to be confounded with time, as it takes multiple wins to make up the points for a single loss
Also, due to recent changes, the grind for new players seems a little rough going
Cards need to be unlocked through a random loot chest system or bought with "essense" from duplicate cards, which could take a while and doesn't exactly encourage new player experimentation
Although, to its credit, it's nowhere near being pay-to-win, and I think Hi-Rez are generally pretty reasonable, and maybe even generous, with its current financial model
I mentioned the build version at the start because this is a game that's constantly changing
It's worth pointing out this was a very different game a year ago compared to what it is today, and some or all of what I've written could be completely irrelevent a year from now, for better or worse
But if it does change, I really hope it will be for good, and that I'll still be playing it and loving it just as much then as I do now
Oh and you can ride horseys!

								-Do you want Overwatch?-Yes!-Do you have money?-No-Here is a free Overwatch for you!			
Posted: 23 September, 2016
Early Access Review
								After playing 11 hours



here are some details
First off, something everyone must understand is that this game pits you against BOTS until your account reaches level 5
Just incase you feel the game is too easy when you first try it
Secondly, this isn't Overwatch, but it is close in nature, and it borrows heavily from SMITE
Try to look at it as another "Hero Shooter", a genre
You have these 4 classes: Frontline, Damage, Support, Flank
Each HERO has a loadout you can customize, unlike Overwatch, unlike Smite
You have several slots to create your own custom loadout, and the game provides you with a default loadout for each Hero
The loadouts consist of 5 cards, these cards have unique modifiers that have an affect on the Hero ability associated with that card, and each card has a number value 1-4 that you can determine given a 12 point system
The cards effectively change the Hero's set abilities
So for instance, if your Hero can produce a shield, one of the cards might allow the Hero to self-heal while you use the shield ability
So all cards do is slightly alter the Hero powers to provide a bit of customization and playstyle variance
I mentioned the 12 point system
To elaborate, when creating a loadout you must choose 5 cards to complete it, and each card is given a point value of 1 by default
You are given 12 points to raise the cards of your choice to a maximum of 4 points in a single card, but you can only spend 12 points total,  so not all 5 cards will be allowed to reach the highest upgrade at the same time
So choosing which cards to enhance more than others is the trick
As you can imagine, adding aditional points to a card enhances the stated change that occurs to the Hero power associated with that card
On top of all this, you have the items you can only purchase in a match, this is like SMITE or other MOBA's where you fight in a match for awhile and collect points to purchase upgrades that affect your character in different ways but are limited in use to that match
These changes are things like movement speed, defense, offensive strength, and other utility type enhancements
There are no consumable's at this point
Now

lets talk about loot boxes
To my knowledge loot boxes are rewarded when you level up your account

not your hero
Hero's have a leveling system and you have a different system of leveling overall
Whenever you level up your account, you get a loot box to open
Once opened, the loot boxes provide you with random prizes, but mostly cards that can be used in the loadouts as mentioned above
Note that you win a gold currency by playing the game, and the same cards you might receive for FREE in the loot boxes can be purchased individually with this currency you collect as you play
As far as I know "some" cosmetic items like skins will also come out of loot boxes but I haven't had any drop for me yet
As for gameplay, it's currently simple; you fight over a control point until one side controls it, then you push a "payload" or "small little thingy" to the other end of the map to win


if you are defending you just stop those guys from doing that and you win


Not much else to do really


I hope they work on this
Regardless of the repetitive nature, and lack of variety, I enjoy the game, I play Overwatch competitively and this gives me a nice but familure break from the seriosness of Competitive Overwatch
Speaking of competitive! Paladins offers the option to play RANKED matches, but only once you have taken 12 of the 16 current Hero's to a level of 4
I'm working on that and perhaps I'm just a masochist for doing so
So there you go thats the game in a nutshell, in my opinion the game lacks variety, but in it's defense, it has only just made it to open beta
I was a fan of Smite for awhile and I can assume this game will do just as well and grow into a much larger experience
I hope this review helps people make the insurmountable decision to install a FREE game and give it a shot
Have a good time!

Early Access Review
								I originally enjoyed this game
However, after update OB39, I cannot recommend this game solely because of one reason: Easy Anti-Cheat
EAC is a well known slack-jawed excuse for a functioning anti-cheat system that works in kernel space
It takes screenshots (full-screen, mind you), keylogs the user, and has been known to privacy leaks many times in the past
My proof for these claims? http://eac

org/As you can clearly see in this link, competitions in this game use EAC to track the input of keys, screenshots when it "detects" something, and is in the public domain
In their defense, not 100% of all information they look at is put on a public adress, as this is just an example of information you can see happening in competitions
However, if you can spy on this happening in competitions, who says people can't spy on your login information or even worse: paypal or credit card information from in-game purchases? Just look at what happened with Robocraft, and how the devs tried to cover it up
If you respect your privacy, I highly suggest you not respect Hi-Rez or this game
Hi-Rez has been known to use EAC in their games before, and will continue to do so
EDIT: I noticed several people in the comments outlining potential issues in my critique, for example, the link providing content with the consent of user
Before commenting on this issue, I highly suggest paying attention to my comments below
These comments help make my issue with this link more clear
EDIT2: If any more people refuse to either A
stop acting like incomprehensive morons and not reading anything more than the first two sentences of the reviewor B
stop acting like idiots and posting the same rehashed vomit from the previous commenters,then I will block and remove your comment
Using EAC's EULA, "promise" to not hack you, saying the link I have provided "doesn't count" because more EULA lies, leave an unoriginal rehashed "ur just made xd" comment, or just plain insult me because you're too braindead to come up with original content, all fall under this

Early Access Review
								With Easy Anticheat being added I cannot support the title
It's a kernel-based anticheat that is known to waste resources even when the game it's supposed to monitor exits, allows the developer to actively take screen-wide screenshots and upload them for them or anyone else to see, can cause system instability via blue screens, and it runs at a root level
If you favour privacy and keeping others' out of your system, then skip this title lest you install one of the worst anticheats currently in ploy
Remember: If there's a bug that can be exploited against EAC, then you can have your entire system compromised by amateur anticheat makers

												Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming
If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it
Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh)
There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2
5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers
A great game with a good community if you know where to look

												Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod
Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod
It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there
Well, here I go anyway
"Where do I start?" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time
It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing
Hmm


_The gameplay


the gameplay


hmm


Well, there's singleplayer sandbox
You can do


uh, whatever you want really
Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours
Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated
Make your own content! Multiplayer
In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay
I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc
In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more
_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics


drumroll please


7/10
This game is and older game
Came out in 2006
I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old
It's not 2006 anymore
_Hear the bullets flying
The zombies growling
The people chatting
The boxes jumping


The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds
_Play this game
Play it again
Play it some more
Play some now, and play some later
Play it over and over
Play it as long as you want
_My Personal opinion
Get this game
Now
Get Gmod on sale or not
I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime
I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported
You need it to play MOST multiplayer games
Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Story: N/ASound: 8/10Replayability: 10/10Overall 8
5Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy

												With having 139 hours with this game and playing for nearly a year I can honestly say that
This game is an amazing experience
It's such a joyride jam packed with
A lovable cast of characters, Multiple gamemodes, Dozens of amazingly well made maps to enjoy your zombie wacking slashing and shooting on, A mod workshop filled to the brim with modifications to enhance the games experience with new ones being added almost every day, Decently good looking graphics(especially for the time this game was made, even now they can be considered great looking), Online, p-to-p multiplayer, and single player greatness that you can enjoy either with new people, friends, or even by yourself! Even after how much it's aged it's community still holds strongly and is even still growing to this day
Truly a fun and memorable experience for many to enjoy

												Even though this game is over 9 years old it still holds up as being one of, if not THE best zombie game on the market
It's not only fun playing single player but it's hilarious when you can get three more friends to join in the zombie killing
There's of course the standard Easy - Hard difficulities (Here being Easy, Medium, Advanced and Expert)
So if you're looking for some mindless slaughtering to do you can put it on easy or if you and your friends is a tatical squad preparing for the zombie apacolypse this is a great way to start!Also you don't have to play the first game to get into this one, all the maps and more from the first game is in this one
Even if you want to play oldschool there is a mode for that
Speaking of modes, there's Versus mode which is exactly what it sounds like, you control both the infected and the survivors in rounds
The one who ends the final map with the most points win
There is also a realism version of this mode which means the survivers can't see the green/orange/red glow around them as they used to
There's also Survival which is aslo what it sounds like
Survive for X amount of time and you get bronze, silver or a gold medal depending on the requirments for the map you're playing
Scavanger is the last major gamemode, here you play as survivor and infected and the objective is to fill a generator with gas
Who wins depends on which team's the fastest
Then, finally, there's something called mutation
These are pretty much fun little mini modes
For example you have to try and survive an entire campaign on your own, you and all your teamates have katanas and can't get other weapons, you need to carry around a lawngnome to win etc

												Dear Humans
This is Tank
You probably know me from hit game Left 4 Dead
Well, Tank need to get something off chest
It make Tank sad that as soon as you see him, you start shooting at him
Tank not mindless killing machine
Sure, Tank enjoy smashing human skulls to paste
What 12-foot tall, 800 pound, horribly mutated creature wouldn't? But there is another side to Tank
Tank also enjoy stamp collecting, scrapbooking, and updating blog under pen name "Love Muffin"
Tank took origami class once at adult-learning annex, but fingers to big, so Tank smash teacher
Got B-minus
So, when you see Tank on the streets of city, instead of shooting, try asking Tank how day is going
You may find that you and Tank have more in common than you think
Of course, Tank will still smash you, but you will die having made new friend
And that make Tank happy

Early Access Review
								H1Z1 is a game I've played for over a year and a game that I've loved a lot for such a long time
It was a game that I was willing to look past the bugs and poor development team because of how much fun I had playing this game
The current state of the game, on April 11 2017, is absolutely terrible
We've been promised so many things and been given so little
We just NOW got a spectator camera
9/10 of my games are ruined by a hacker two tapping me from a mountain
Despite all of this, I loved King of the Kill so much
I made so many friends and got close to so many people through this game, and it held a special place in my heart for that
Until today
My best friend got on to play a couple of rounds with me only to find out that she had been banned
Why, might you ask? Well neither of us have any idea whatsoever! She's not someone to care about cheating or even her rank all that much, seeing as we only played duos and fives
All of her games were very low kill counts and placings, if anything she was a very average player around Gold level
She never had an insane performance or anything like that
Today, she was banned by Daybreak Games for virtually no reason
I can not, with a clean conscience, recommend ANYBODY to purchase this game or give the developer any of your money whatsoever
Daybreak Games is a terrible company in literally every single right
The game has been early access for three years and the game has gone nowhere at all
Edit: Daybreak responded to my friend's complaint about being unreasonable banned with:"nullnullThanks!don't reply
":)

								So before i begin with this review : Yeah we all know Rust is a laggy piece of sh*t sometimes, so i won`t discuss this here
Pros- Great concept- Stunning graphics- Game mechanics are great- The combat system is good- The crafting system is very good- Weekly updates! Which is one of the most important things for an Early Access game!- Good and serious developers, who listen to the community- Modding is easy, and the community has almost full access to modding- SkinsCons- Not optimised for extreme potato users, but that is not a main problem i
m
o- The community can be cancerous at times, but that is life! Not everyone you meet will be nice or help you!- Server creation is a little complicated, but if you are stubborn enough you will learn how to do it / manage it

Early Access Review
								After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust
I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped
Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust)
I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith
After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear
We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them
I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it
I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across
A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow
I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away
When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones
The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined
Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start
I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me
It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking
I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines
He simply wrote "Sorry guys :D" This is the single problem that I have with games like this
Why does it have to be "shoot-on-sight?" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us
Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area
But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets
Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players
All in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while
I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game
People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience

Early Access Review
Day 1I seem to have woken up on a mysterious island, I don't remember much
All I have is a rock

I'm scared
There seems to be no sign of other humans
I do not have any food or shelter yet, however, I was able to obtain a few logs by hitting a tree with this rock multiple times

What a mysterious island
Day 2I have found a chicken, some more wood, and a few stones, I was able to conceive an amateur, handmade axe, it only took a few seconds to make, so I was able to kill the chicken too
I have also gathered a fairly large pile of wood, I might be able to build a makeshift shelter, but for now


Tonight I feast
Day 3Today is the day, I will finally build a shelter, I can feel the warmth of a warm bed and fire already
I haven't felt this good since I was a child, playing with my toys, I remember one toy more than most, it was called a "Steam", ahh, the good ol' days
I will be home soon
I promise
Day 4I'm sorry
I have killed a man
It all happened so fast, he was holding a gun, I was debating on making peace with him, but he seemed the brutal sort
And all of his gear, it was


Enticing
He must have had a family, but I am becoming selfish it seems, I don't care about the man that I have killed
All that I can think of is one thing, not my family, not his family


But tonight I feast
Day 5I've come across a small, abandoned town, there seems to be a lot of loot within the area
The only problem is that I obtain a heavy dose of radiation if I go into the barriers
I have a choice: Obtain what's necessary to survive and die from radiation, or live on how I am now

In poverty
I think I'll live
Just for a while longer
Day 6I saw a man today, outside of my cabin, he was naked and he had a rock

He seemed to have been yelling incomprehensible jibberish, he must be insane

I remember when I was like that
I still am in a way
Day 7I don't know what to do
The man that I saw yesterday came into my cabin while I was asleep, he held a rock to my head and struck

My life flashed before my eyes, stupid reflex, I grabbed my journal
Remember when I said that I was coming home? Sadly my dear, you'll have to meet me in heaven
I am bleeding out
I am in god's hands now

UPDATED MAY 08, 2016: You can still find people in multiplayer
			
Posted: 25 November, 2013
												Whether you prefer Single Player, CO-OP or Multiplayer, this game has all three of them
I have reviewed all three parts of the game if you are considering buying this
CAMPAIGN REVIEW (Single Player):The campaign is about 6 hours long roughly
It can be shorter or longer depending on your selected difficulty
The story itself is very good and is set 5 years on from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
It is not a Hollywood Blockbuster but at the same time it is not some random quickly written story that was put together in a few hours
Every mission has different objectives and you can feel the climax building up to the finale of the game
Every level is action filled and there is never a dull moment in the campaign
As you progress you will play in different locations in the world such as: Afghanistan, Brazil, Russia, the Atlantic Ocean and the United States
Even after completing the story there are Intel collectables to find and of course Steam achievements
There are also quite a few Easter Eggs in the campaign levels
The story for this then continues on into Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3SPEC OPS REVIEW (Single Player / CO-OP):The Special Op missions are mostly the campaign levels but switched the other way round and with different objectives in the level
There are a total of 23 spec ops missions in MW2
21/23 of these can be done on your own or with a friend
There are 2 Spec Ops missions that can only be done with a 2nd player
The missions get harder and harder as they go on
Some of the levels in this have been re-used from COD4
There is no matchmaking for the Spec Ops so the only way to find another player is to invite / join a friend and begin playing
There are also quite a few Steam achivements for this like with the Campaign
MULTIPLAYER REVIEW (Multiplayer):The Multiplayer is what is considered the strongest part of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2
Unlike COD4 this time the game uses Steam Cloud, so your rank will all be stored online and will sync every time you close MW2
The highest level you can reach is level 70 with the addition of 10 prestige levels
When you reach Rank 4 you will have the ability to create your own classes where you can choose your main weapon, secondary weapon, perks and equipment
You can also stick attachments to pretty much all of your weapons on here
You can also unlock weapon camos for your main firearms, which some look very cool when placed on
You have the ability to join friends in a session and vice versa (provided there is space) and host your own private matches for this
Conclusion: I highly recommend buying this game if you are reading this out of personal interest or if the game has gone up for sale
I recommend playing the Campaign before going to Multiplayer to get a feel of the game, but it is of course entirely your decision
Things to be aware of - There is no direct controller support for this game
If you are considering the DLCs, it should be noted that there are less players than that of 2009 - 2010, so the only two main playlists are the base game and those who own both of the DLCs
If you only buy 1 DLC, you will find literally 0 games on there
MW2 Multiplayer has no dedicated servers
It uses a matchmaking system that will pair you up with other players in the same playlist and game mode as you
This game uses VAC
So if you are banned for cheating / modding the game, your ban will be permanent
There is no way to lift a ban
You have been warned
At the time of posting the Multiplayer peak for this is around 10,000 players which is more than enough to find a game and play
Campaign / Spec Ops population doesn't go above 5,000
If you have any questions or concerns with the game feel free to leave a comment

After 250 hours in this game, streaming, uploading videos, and spending hours aquiring data, this is my honest review of this game:Pros:-No pay-to-win
-Free-To-Play, but doesn't suck
Seriously, this game plays like a mid-tier first person shooter almost on par with CSGO and COD
-New guns/equipment can be acquired quickly through normal gameplay
No grinding for a week for a new gun, you'll have one in an hour or two
-Fast Paced: Compared to other AAA competitive shooters, the action is fast and hard
-Large Variety of Weapons: This game has a gun for everyone! Guns for Sprayers, 1-Tap Gods, No-scopers, whatever playstyle you have, there is a gun/knife for you, and it doesn't take long at all to get!-Positive Community: Most players you come across are positive, you can easily find people to add and play with
-Hit Registration: Unlike CSGO, I've never had one instance of a shot I know landed not register
-Global Support: There are servers being released often, and support for you to play normally with servers around the globe! Definitely give this game a try if you don't live in an area that is usually supported by game developers servers!-Multiple game modes: There is a game mode for every FPS player! Team DeathMatch for the COD players, Demolition for the CS:GO players, Battle Match for the Battlefield players, BOT TDM for casual players, and Assassination for the awesome players
There is even a PVE mode they have released for Halloween that is a true challenge, and might even stay in the game!-Holiday Events: They gave skins out just for playing the game during Halloween, introduced a new game mode, and implemented a lot of new items during the holiday update
I hope this trend continues!-Community: Unlike a lot of other games, this game isn't toxic as hell
Even with random strangers, most of the time you'll have have a good time
The discord is almost always popping with players discussing the game, looking for a clan, or challenging one another
Beware, people still get salty!Neutral:-No voice support: You need Discord or another program to communicate via voice
-Netcode: This works both ways, the greater your lag, the longer it takes for the server to register your shots
If you go up against a lagger, he will have a slight peek advantage on you
If your ping is in the 300+, you will suffer, but there shouldn't be an issue with servers all around the globe
-Early Access: Now, I'm not going to complain because this game is free, but it's not perfect
I've not run into anything game breaking during my gameplay, but just keep that in mind
-Hackers: I have 250 Hours in this game, and I've only ran into ONE hacker/cheater during a battle match
In all of my competitive gameplay, I've never observed, or went against any cheaters
People do cheat, but it is rare in this game
Anyone that says they run into hackers all the time most likely aren't used to the game, or don't play on a higher skill level
-Boxes/Crates: These can be opened by spending Real Money to buy bullets
Bullets is a currency in Black Squad to open boxes, and to also buy exclusive boosters, epic player models, and more
There are a ton of different boxes in Black Squad, so you know exactly what you will get when you open a box
Want a legendary AK-47? You can click the box and know exactly what you might get
Usually they contain an "epic item", such as a rare skin, and all the other prizes include gold, medals, BS coins, and sometimes, even lower tier skins
All the boxes, except for one, require you to pay, and everything inside is purely cosmetic
The only box that you can open for free have exclusive knife skins that you can only get by spending gold to open
Some people get lucky, others do not
This is for you to decide
Cons:-Uninspired maps: Most of the maps aren't that great in my opinion, they release new ones nearly monthly, but some of them are just


awful
-User Interface: The main menu sucks
The friendslist/chat gets in the way of anything on the right side of the screen, you cannot chat in the main menu screen at all, and some items you can double-click to quickly navigate, and other buttons you can't! Why? I blame this on early access, but this goes down as a con for me
I enjoy my efficiency!-Lack of a competitive scene: Yes, this game is early access, but the only way to find "competitive" players is to either get lucky on a clan match selection, or find a team on the official discord
There are clan ranks, but no one takes them seriously right now
-Matchmaking: There have been times where I've went against a team of 5 when I was by myself for 3 rounds before other players connected
This has happened when I've went solo, qued with a team, or just randomly jumped around
The game will TRY to match you up based on rank, but after 30 seconds, it will just throw you with whoever is on
Doesn't really happen in the competitive gamemodes, but if you play assassination, it will happen a lot
-No report system: Early access, I know, but if someone is being really toxic, or is cheating, the only way you can report right now is by posting a video on the discord
It's better than nothing, and the mods actually do their job!-Currency: There are 4 different types of currency in this game: Gold, which is gained just by playing the game and given as a daily log-in reward
Gold can be used to buy most guns in the shop, and is easy to obtain a huge amount of it
Medals, which is gained every 7 days as a login reward, and is gained every time you level up
It is used to buy guns/knives/characters from the medal shop
(There are two shops in this game, more on that later) BS Coins, which is only gained by opening boxes
They can be used to buy different skins, compared to just winning them from a box
Finally, Bullets, which is the currency that can only be bought using Real Money
You use these to open boxes, or to buy a special model, or EXP/GOLD booster
I spoke about boxes in my Neutral section of this review above
If you're broke and want to try something new, give this a try! You get free currency just for doing a quick tutorial, and if you look in the DLC section, you can try almost every gun in the game for free for 15 days! That is more than enough time to amass enough gold and guns to supply your own Black Squad
Give it a shot, and feel free to hit me up at IGN SL4DE
Happy Fragging!(P

Early Access Review
TL;DR at the bottom!Ah yes, yet another Free-To-Play online FPS game


I'll be honest, I wasn't really expecting a lot from this game, that being said, I was pleasantly surprised
Let's address the elephant in the room, that being the cash shop and premium items
Yes, there is premium stuff, no, there is nothing you can buy to give you a stat advantage
The only thing money will buy is a currency called Bullets, which are just skin crates
that's it, so far
It's wayy too early to tell if this will evolve into something more sinister, time will tell on that front
Since that is out of the way, on to the rest of my unduely long review!Graphically this game looks pretty nice, animations are good, the maps follow their own colour palettes, some are brown and grey, some more colourful
Overall map design is all very simple and easy to get a hold of, the maps are easy to learn and navigate
Textures look good, haven't seen anything blurry or that stands out as weird, the graphical design is all very coherent if not a bit dull
The guns look very nice and tacticool
Sounds are good, there are a couple music tracks and they're decent enough, mostly rock\metal style music, some songs sound a little bit quiter than others but it's nothing major
Gun sounds are everywhere from unique and good sounding to mediocre and bland
The starter pistol sounds like an airsoft gun
However you can generally tell the weapon type being fired pretty easily
Footsteps are loud as hell, making walking a very important tactic to employ since it'll make you completely silent
Gameplay is very reminiscent of Call of Duty meets Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
If you played any of these titles, you'll feel very comfortable in this game
The guns have almost no recoil making assault rifles feel very samey, they mostly are the same aside from varying stats, such as one rifle might do more damage with a slower rate of fire and smaller magazine size, while the other has a much large mag size, and fires faster but has lower damage
The available primary weapons are Assault Rifles, SMGs, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, LMGs and Designated Marksman Rifles (DMRs)
They're all very straight forward, however shotguns in this game are brutal, they can take someone out with a single shot from quite far away, they have barely noticable recoil, and they fire quickly
Basically, matches, especially in Demolitions, will come down to who has the most KSG shotguns on their team, and who sees who first
Game modes are fairly straight forward
You have good ol' Team Deathmatch which is addictive
Demolition 8v8 & 5v5 which is identical to DE defuse game modes in CS:GO, minus the buying
Assassination, where one team defends a VIP (controlled by a brain dead AI, mind you
) that can die in like 4 shots, as he waddles to a helicopter
The other team has to kill the enemy team and the VIP, or kill the VIP and extract from their own helicopter
This mode is very


meh
It's out of place and not fun
And last, but not least, Battle Match, where you have to work with your team to destroy the enemy base, which are giant supply crates or something
This mode is where classes come into play, and it's pretty hectic and clearly the main gamemode
It's okay, it's certainly one of the better modes
The maps for it are quite large as well, which is nice
The combat is very, very fast
The time-to-kill in this game is intensely low, and fire-fights rarely last more than a couple seconds
Pretty much every weapon kills in 2 - 1 headshot, in some cases like the shotguns and close range, headshots aren't even needed to take someone out in a split second
Grenades in this game, unlike CS:GO, are lethal
While easy to avoid, catching one will seriously injure or just outright kill you from full health
There is "sprinting" in this game, but it's just pulling your knife out ala CS
However the interesting thing here is you have the option to hold a button to take your knife out, and then swap back to the last weapon you had upon button release
It acts like a sort of sprint button, very different feature I've never seen before
Knives themselves are just 1-hit kills if you manage to land a stab, 2 - 3 hits if you just swing it
In-Game Store is where you purchase weapons and stuff like that, and I was pleasantly surprised with it
There is really nothing to buy with actual money, and they give you a LOT of cash to start with
You get 215k just for starting and doing the tutorial, guns range from 96k - 192k, and they are permenant, no repairs or anything like that, once you own a gun, you keep it forever and can use it forever
Cash is very easy to earn, you get 15K just for logging in each day, 20K or so for dailies, and around 800 for each match completed
You also have weeklies
They award Medals which let you purchase more novelty items, like player cards, side-arms, skins and stuff like that
A Desert Eagle costs 1,500 medals, after only about 15 matches I had a little over 1,000, so it's not hard to obtain
Overall, the store is quite nice, the menus are a bit hard to navigate, though
It remains to be seen if this game will turn P2W, only time will tell
Community ohhhh boy, the community


It's already really bad
Very toxic, a vast majority of the people you play with are actual children, racial slurs, hostility at the slightist provocation, you name it, this community has it
I highly suggest not interacting with the people in this game, for your own sanity, and the safety of your braincells
TL;DR It's very nice if not a little graphically bland, it's a very small game (only 4
3 gigs) and doesn't require a sign up, the combat is pretty intense and fun, it runs fairly smooth, no pay-to-win as of yet, no timed guns or BS like that, the guns are easy to earn, the gamemodes are alright, but the community is incredibly immature

								This games pre good
I mean i have a potato laptop with an apu and a trash processor
Both are below the minimum
With this said, I can achieve 20 frames constantly
Im not saying thats good but im saying that its at least playable
So if u have a trash pc like me and want to play a f2p fps game that isnt p2w, then give this game a try

								This game is fantastic, you can easily run it on your potato pc and get decent fps
Pros: Devs listens to the community
No random recoil
Game is focused on pure skill not RNG
Very fast pace and gives you time to waste
Cons: Hackers need to be dealt with which I think the Devs are working on
Hip Fire Accuracy Some description for guns can be worked on

Black Squad is a great F2P shooter as of writing this
The weapons are fair and balanced, the maps (especially for demolition) are decent, and the gameplay feels like a hybridization of Call of Duty and CSGO
(Such as running around with your knife/Aiming down the scope) The game is still in Early Access so many things feel barebones (2 or 3 character models atm, repeating sound effects) but what is actually in place is a great start, and hopefully the developers continue to listen to the community and don't go back on their word
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1104974307PROS+ Tight and responsive controls+ Balanced weapons and maps+ Hybrid gameplay of COD and CSGO+ Decent amount of players on every mode (Including Demolition)+ Playerbase is a healthy sizeCONS- Repetitive sounds/animations/models- Not a whole lot of content yet- US server is flooded with high pingers from asia- Not many features to combat toxic players yetSUGGESTIONSAdd more content! Be it character models, maps, weapons, animations, sound effects
Just add more QUALITY content without compromising the entire package
(Like Line of Sight) That would really spruce the game up a bit
Just make sure you don't let the game stagnate either
BOTTOM LINEhttp://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1094777678If you enjoy CSGO, COD, or other F2P shooters give it a try
If you're a vet looking for some good old competition in Demolition you won't be disappointed
Hopefully the devs don't run out of steam and keep a good thing going!

								This reminds me of Warface before it went to s@#!
Very solid shooter and not pay to win
Maps could be a little bigger though
Still it's fun

Early Access Review
								At first, I was not going to download it because I thought "Pfff, another pay-to-win free to play fps"
But the graphics, the guns, the gameplay, even the shop and inventory it's quite different from other f2p games while maintaining at the same time some common things
As of now, I'd say this is the best f2p shooter on Steam
I hope the Devs keep updating it because it has a lot of potential

												This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things
Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality
There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release
One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s
As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon
We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols
Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower
There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower
I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position
But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed
As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered
I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head
I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols
After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention
I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive
Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command
I had done it
I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive
That is what this game is about

												My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever
We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces
I'm leading a team of 4 men
We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back
I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers
Nothing
I run, my Autorifleman runs, my Medic runs
But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across
Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene?The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down
He then takes two more in the chest
The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here
He screams as he's being shot
Crawling, drenched in his own blood
"SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!"he died after that
I criedand he respawned

												I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides
I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides
It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty
Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life


Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target
Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision
I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving
The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life
haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D			
Posted: 28 December, 2015
												Having accumulated over 13400 hours in-game with Arma 3, I would certainly recommend it to others
If you enjoy tactical shooters and playing online with friends, it's well worth a look; especially if you appreciate a high dose of military realism!

												Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this
You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have
But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game
Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away
You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly
Arma is a game which you can never called finished
There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations
Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem!I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back

												I'm re-writing my review to go more in depth as to why this is not a hunting sim and more of a hunting arcade game
I will also list some reasons why the game is "broken" and not getting good reviews at this time
This game fails at being a simulator for many reasons and I'm sure I will not list all of them but I will do my best to point out the biggest issues my friends and I had
Animals & AI- There are just too many animals honestly for this to be a simulator
They are EVERYWHERE! A hunting simulator should require a bit of patience and planning on the hunters behalf ,however, in this game you can just sprint around and wait until you hear a "warning call" from an animal then go into stealth mode and call it in or stalk it
The worst thing about the AI I feel is that you can shoot at an animal and the other animals around it and yourself only run away a short distance and can be called right back after a very short time
By very short I'm talking less than 10 seconds in some instances
The game needs a longer "spook" timer and range
Animals should run further away and be gone for 10-30 minutes
There are also cases of animals running in circles right in front of you
Weapon system/ballistics and shot placement- Something that gets me personally is that the ballistics in this game are completely made up and garbage, let me explain
Animals in the game have an integrity bonus which is there to stop you from using larger more powerful weapons on smaller animals which is fine but the weapons they have that can cause you to get that 0% bonus are very off
For example using a 
270 on deer will give you 0% integrity bonus
This seems very silly to me as many people hunt deer with a 
270 and many even use a 30-06 these are both extreamely common deer hunting rifles
Yet at the same time you can take that 
270 and shoot an elk in the head and have it bleed at a "very low" rate and have to track it for 10 minutes
This should obviously be a critical wound
Another big issue I have with this is that if you shoot an animal in the legs or any bone used in walking and it doesn't stop the animal from running
I have shot a deer with that 
270 which they claim is just so overpowered for deer and gives you a 0% integrity bonus in 3 different legs and the pelvis bone and it was able to RUN from me
Now for shot place-ment
The game is overly picky about where you shoot an animal
Taking that same overpowered 
270 that just ruins your deer to the point you get a 0% integrity bonus and shooting near the heart should drop the deer dead in it's tracks if it were so damaging but it doesn't and the deer will still run off and force you to track it
You must shoot a direct shot into the heart to get that instant kill
 In theory you should be able to take one of the biggest guns either the 7mm or the 
338 and shoot a deer in the neck and drop it on the spot but you can't you will still have to track it
Finally shooting doesn't place bullet holes on animals
It just doesn't make sense to me and it seems like they took everything they learned while making The Hunter Classic and tossed it out the window on this game
Night Hunting- Night hunting should not be in the game
It is illegal in most places as well as hunting with artificial light
They could fix this by not allowing you to shoot before/after certain hours in game while still allowing you to travel or track an already shot animal
They could allow you to shoot an animal at night if you are attacked by it while traveling or tracking
Bugs- The game has a lot of bugs currently
Some of them are minor and some are in my opinion game breaking
A few bugs I can think of are a small window pop up that is blank and says Press F1 for more info
The box blocks some of your view and is more of an annoyance than anything
Weapons, callers, and such will disappear from your hands randomly
This is really bad when you're changing from a caller to your rifle to kill that animal you just spent 20 minutes calling in only to find out your rifle is randomly missing
Sometimes you will crouch to sneak around and just randomly die
You might shoot an animal only to have it freeze in place this sounds silly but really breaks immersion
You might kill an animal only to have it disappear in front of you
You might shoot an animal to have it stop bleeding in the middle of tracking it
At times you will buy something from the shop and it won't be in your storage or inventory, I feel this one sucks because things in the game are pretty expensive to begin with
Your flashlight has no effect on animals
Panning while looking in binoculars if very slow whiled zoomed out
There are areas on the map which are bugged and will cause large mixed herds of animals to spawn at times there may be a mix of 50 animals in one area again this one breaks immersion
In multiplayer only the host can interact with landmarks, claim outposts, and build stands
Entering a stand while another player is in it will kill you
Desync issues where people who join your game can't see animals and at times can see and shoot them but when they collect the animal they recieve no xp or money
This is by no means a full list of bugs but it's long enough and I pointed out some of the more crucial ones that I am aware of
Now for the most heated and debated topic yet
Microtransactions/DLC
This company said back in the beggining they would not have "microtransactions"
Which was great as The Hunter Classic had a ton and really turned people off
They said this game would be a one time pay game
So what happens shortly after launching the game? They put out "DLC" instead
You get people who say that microtransactions and DLC are two different things
Myself and others will agree that they are the same thing under a different name when it comes down to it
Paying for additional content
Some say that microtransactions are typically small and/or temporary and are usually cheap and may give an advantage during gameplay and DLC is usually a fair amount of content like a new map or missions and once you pay for them they are permanent and can be pricey
Now from my personal experience I have seen things from one category fall into the other countless times
Skins, cosmetics, teleport stones, pets, and access to new areas in a game all permanent and being sold as microtransactions
I have seen DLC sold anywhere from a large new map full of creatures and content (Ark: Scorched Earth for example) to a few weapons or skins in a pack
So what do we have for "DLC" in The Hunter: Call of the Wild? Tents and blinds for $3
99 which basically breaks down to $1
99 each
I would hardly call it a "large" amount of content, it does give players an advantage to quickly be in an area, and also change the time of day so they can be in spawn zones when they spawn without much downtime
This leads to my conclusion that if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it's a duck
The issue here is that either one can be called the other
I am quite sure the company knew they would be releasing DLC and should have said so
You may call it what you like
You may buy it if you like
Many others will not
Long story short I suggest people stay away from this one for another 6 months or a year and check back to see if this company has got itself together
Hopefully that is long enough as they have been very slow at bug fixes and seem to have no troubles getting out "DLC"
We would all like to see this game succeed but it's currently in a questionable state

												Nice game to kill a few hours and even a few deer and bison while your at it


(Only if you master the ways of the hunter of course and dont stomp like bigfoot through the vegetation)
Pretty realistic from what i can tell, i dont care to shoot animals IRL, but I'm happy to indescriminatley shoot any furball that moves in Hunter COTW
The graphics and sounds are well executed and it is nice to walk through the long varying maps stalking your prey or just taking that opportunistic  shot at a deer grazing peacefully in the distance


BAM! Spine shot, bambi is now offically venison


That being said, when you have enough of all the trudging through the forrests and mountains, the recent ATV DLC is really a must have that should be part of the main game and not stand alone DLC
And this is where I have to line up my sights and take a headshot at the dev team (Sorry, pun city i know


cringe) 
Damn you are a greedy bunch of


The Tents,bivies and ATV DLC - This stuff simply should not be DLC - For the price of the main game, this should be included as standard
I reluctantly bought the game at its price and also the DLC but i have been disappointed with the DLC and pricing
Not a cool move guys


especially the tents/bivies DLC! The ATV DLC is barely excusable as it does  add another small dynamic to the game but even still, it shouldnt be DLC
Surely offering new maps or enhanced weapons packs or better ATV, bivies etc but taking core elements out and charging as DLC is a bad bad move
 Another major gripe is that there doesnt appear to be any Modded content available


this game could be so much better if the community were able to build mods etc
However the buisness plan appears to be" squeeze the customer", sad really as they have a good game that could probably grow so much more with modded support
Do i recommend?No
I cant recommend the game given the direction the devs went around mod support and DLC
If you are into hunting IRL and are looking for a decent game, well then this is probably going to be for you anyway



But if you have a passing interest in this concept, then wait for another dev to release something similar or else at least wait for a sale as you will need the ATV DLC
Hopefully another dev comes along and builds on the Hunter COTW concept without the greed and lack of mod support
This is a nice game thats been well made and i would like to recommend but just feel like i cant given the greedy DLC move and lack of mod support

												Disclosure - I am British, non-gun user, non-hunter and have no desire to ever do this IRL
This version of the franchise has been getting a bit of flack from buyers, especially after the first DLC, due to it seemingly straying away from it's original purpose which was to provide an alternative to those who are wouldn't be the most out of the pay per season model of the original game
 I brought the game as this wave of negativity started, and it might have been justified in parts, there seemed to be a slightly cynical way in which the DLC was being put out
 But, since then, personally I feel the Devs have been excellent in listening to feedback, adjusting the sale strategies and the regular patches have been coming in to get rid of the wrinkles and creases
PROS:Beautiful to look atGood implimentation of multiplayerPlenty to do for someone who dips in and outHas a good balance between sim and less serious game
CONS:Some missions can be a bit of a choreMake a few assuptions on only being played by people who already know about huntingThe animal types in the two maps are quite similar in style (minus the bears)
It's been nice to wander around a take a shot at antlered beasties every now and then, I feel like it's making a very bad user of mouse and keyboard get ever so slightly better without the pressure that most FPSs would have
 I even feel a bit more confident going into a PUBG game after warming up on here for a bit (that feeling lasts about one round)
I get why there are some criticisms of the DLC, but I think that is being addressed, and for me the price of adding these packs is minimal to what I have happy sunk into games like Destiny etc
 I am not saying the method they are using is perfect but it's not bank breaking and I think a few some who are being the most vocal about this stuff are probably being a bit over the top considering the very transistional period the games industry seems to be lumbering through
For me, the biggest negative has been sticking points with some of the missions
 It's perfectly possible to just play without them but they have been good to show me some of the different things in the game to do (I would have never tried night hunting otherwise)
 But there are some early missions that are exceptionally challenging to complete without items that take a considerable amount of time to level up enough to buy
 There is still plenty to do while you wait but for me I just wanted to fire up the game, do a mission and the get back to work, playing something else
 Once I unlocked a new more powerful rifle though this became less of an issue, mainly due to opening up the larger animals as sandbox prey
 Future maps with a bit more landscape and animal variety would be the icing on the cake - as there were 2 included with the £25 pound base game I think an extra £7 for each would be fair for new ones but we'll have to wait an see
With the pretty nice photo mode too it doesn't just rely on the shooting of digital things, which is nice
Hey, this game clearly isn't for everyone and I get the impression people will either get it regardless of review or not
 And it's pretty packed with stuff so covering every aspect in a short(ish) review is tough
 I brought it after looking at many, many free to play (with hidden costs), cheaply made and priced or more arcade-y style games - I feel I made a good choice
Now to just wait for that Just Cause/theHunter crossover game
 (Isn't that just Farcry though?)			
Posted: 17 February
												This will be detailed review by person who was hunting in Real Life and played almost all hunting sims for pc to date
If You want join our Hunting Club too: http://steamcommunity
com/groups/GPVHC--------------------------Preword:I hunted with my Dad years ago, just 


thank You Devs
It is perfect software, not only Game, just bring more stuff and continue to develop, it's like on real hunting with my dad years, years ago
Nothing can be compared to this game
The Hunter, Cabela, Deer Hunter, Hunting unlimited, they died today
Best hunting experience in history of computer gaming
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=873221433 It's completely relaxing just to hear pines waving on the wind somwhere over Rotwald area, listening to rain, storm, forest, just close eyes and have that short break on digital nature during day
For real it's best audio-video application for PC and when it comes to give true nature feeling  Call of the Wild is beyond any competition for years
It's great to turn this game on for a few minutes during workday and relax
Not to mention You can easily spend hours and have enormous fun during hunting here
Night hunts or ability to seamless walk/trek/hunt/ in 24 hour cycle is great and going after wounded animal through dark forest is da bong
Especially when you chase wounded 400 kg wild boar in dense forest around midnight


Feelings , presentation and realism are above perfect
If you have ever been on real hunt just buy it
Game have some UI bugs in menu but it will be fixed with 1 or 2 patches
No other problems
Shooting and tracking are real - it works exactly the same in Real life - some hunts are very easy some are long and no outcome - but for real hunter most important is respect for nature and harmony with it - this game as only one in pc gaming history gives that well
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885527159 Night hunts are just thrilling - imagine rural field after harvests at midnight , full moon and you on the hunting tower watching pack of wild boars roaming the field after mouses and seeds 
Yes You have head lamp and if You miss vitals or hit [like in real life] big boar it can run good hundreds of meters after
Searching for animal at night are just amazing! Check my uploaded screenshots to understand !YES YOU CAN TURN OFF ALL HELPERS [ very detailed and lot of options to  choose from ! ] and act like in RL
To say more i just forget after few minutes that im playing a game [35 years old here] and feel like in archive movie from one of my hunts in real life
All works the same - animals reacts different , depends when bullet hits, etc
Together with video-audio work of art presentation it makes amazing job
No one ever bring so much real poetry in digital gaming presentation of nature than Expansive Worlds did here
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885502542 This game have so many features that it will be very hard to describe them all
And all of them are well tested and realized in the game
If You ask yourself "is that feature is here?" - answer YES it is
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885844967 If you are looking for ethic game about hunting to interest your kids or friends with hunting it's best title ever released
There is no better PC program that can awake love to the nature than this game [and please all eco terrorists who don't even know what real hunting is about just shut up and keep chains around trees still  as simplest hunter did more to ecosystem and nature than band of ecologist through whole their life] 
Details are just breathtaking ! Shoots are dependable by range, wind, position, after unlocking some skills and perks [ great by the way , very good mechanics and very real too ! ] 
Someone really knows how to present real hunting!And if you only have occasion just listen to Pines waving on strong wind at Rotwald mountians at first reserve
Did i mention that leaves flying from trees depend on which driection wind is flowing? Good
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885526048 Forget about The Hunter - just sink into this title and beg Devs to develop it further [its just great joy to simply walk in this game] - personally i will pay for all DLC for it , and im sure we get some free dlcs too
You are like on real hunt here in Call of the WIlds , im playing on I5 Haswell, 16gb Ram and 1060 Geforce , all on ultra and high - and trust me - stable FPS around 50-60 , and DAT FEELING along with excellent sounds [you will hear very high range of nature sounds, different for each bush, plants, grass, day and night or even part of day or night ] 
There is NO DIFFERENCE in visual or sound presentation with normal, real life hunt
Im completely shocked - Light in this game works like in real life too , you will almost feel wet cold mornings, warm sunsets, scary storms
Just like in real life simple walking through woods [hello no one generic fragment of land, each is handplaced and designed like real life, no boring terrain all over the map]
About bugs - i havent noticed any in game about what is essential - hunting , tracking, playing 
There are small and very minor buggies with UI but it will be easily solved by small patches so really screw negative reviews
If You are hunting in real life, if You love nature, if You hunted long ago, if You are interested in hunting, if You are looking for best looking game on PC , if You are looking for intelligent and enormous hunting application , if You are looking for enjoyable multiplayer hunts [not so embarassing like in the hunter online - all is really better here ] - JUST GO BUY and THANK Devs for realizing every hunter dream ! http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885651194 ABOUT "BUGS" : Shortly: Leave bugs to vegans and keep hunting and eating meat instead
Longer:And please stop listening people about shooting - it works exactly like in rl life - not only shooting [wind guess [after perk - eralier by observing nature], magnitude setup [after perk] but a way of the bullet mechanics after the hit
If someone never shoot on real hunt he just simple can't understand that hit which lands on "soft" part of the animal only wounds it and make a lot of pain and hunter is obliged to track it even 2 days with dogs
If You want to score animal learn to shoot and read some hunting books
Devs here are one of most dedicated and involved in gaming industry and their fame for long supporting of titles is well known, just look at older brother theHunter Classic
And i bet this wonderfull game, Call of the Wild will become it's successor
There are many "headshooters" from stupid fps games around here , who never hold and fire from real gun
Trust me this game is as close to real shooting and hunting as it can be
Not only visually [dat scopes GOD! almost smell rubber near eye] , but what is most important from shooting mechanic
There is Bullet drop, wind , calibre and power incorporated and very smart and real hit system
 SO ALL OF YOU COD/CS SONS GO SCREW YOURSELF KIDOS
See You in the wilds !!!Developers please keep this game supported and developed in next years as it's best and most realistic hunting experience ever created
I will gladly pay for future DLCs, and remember about some freeLC too
Just give us more of eveything in next years and we have a deal!

												Pros:Beautiful relaxing scenery to exploreHuge open world (50sq miles)Has multiplayer to play with your friendsSome nice free DLCCons:Can be tricky to find animals (but thats realism should be)Can't have mutliple save filesATV DLC should already be in the gameOverall:Perfect game if you love viewing beautiful scenery and appreciating nature but also being able to see and shoot up some animals
5/5 - Loved it so much that I also bought a copy for my friend :3My name is Coyote Peterson, be brave, stay wild! I'll see you on the next adventure!			
Posted: 19 February
												This is my first review of a game, but I though this game deserved a review as it's been getting a lot of negative reviews that are unwarranted in my opinion
I live in South Africa and have been hunting a couple of times before and it's something I enjoy
What I enjoy about hunting is that you go out into wide open spaces of beautiful nature
You have to patiently stalk your prey, following spoor (tracks), looking at their dung, checking that you're not upwind
It's not easy, and some days you can go the whole day without even getting close to having a shot at your prey
So in context of this game, I never thought I'd ever find or enjoy any hunting game that gives me the same thrill as I get in real life
But I was wrong
This game does really well in making you feel like you're in this beautiful nature reserve with some of the best graphics and sound design I've seen in a game
It really is stunning
I often just stare at a beautiful sunrise or a strong gust of wind blowing leaves off the trees around me
The beautiful world you get to play in alone is worth the asking price for this game
The actual hunting part has been done extremely well
In this game I've felt like it really is quite close to hunting in real life
Patience is key
Checking wind direction, following tracks, listening for your prey's sounds, looking at your prey's dung etc
has been really well thought out and implemented
It can take hours to find and hunt the prey you're looking for, but it feels worth it
I've seen a lot of people complain about bugs in their reviews, and I have seen a couple, but none of them were game breaking in my opinion
If that is what is holding you back from buying this game, then let me assure you, it's not that bad
The bugs aren't that major, and I have to say that it runs extremely well on my machine
My settings are all cranked up and I'm running a GeForce 970, 8GB RAM, Intel i5 2500k processor, and have experienced no lag or crashes
If you want a game to get lost in, that takes time and patience, that is beautiful and realistic, then give this a go
I hope they bring out an African map in a future DLC!

Where IRL meets fantasy gaming Really, the outdoors experience in this open world sand box hunting sim is so like being in the great outdoors that most sessions I forget I’m gaming
I often even forget the fact that I’m looking for achievements in the game
And, for a gamer who enjoys the thrill of capturing every single achievie, that’s a big deal
It is the total world immersion that makes the experience of COTW so impressive
I’ve only been playing for 3 weeks, but at the time of writing the review I have 60% of the achievements and almost 200 hours in game
I am already the ‘Hero of Hirschfelden’ and ‘Lord of the Lakes’ because I’ve explored the total area of both maps
(*Mumbles to self in monologue-ing voice: “I like that
Yes I like that very much
”) The missions are challenging enough that it will be awhile before I finish them all
So, time in game is almost unlimited
I can’t see a stopping point yet
UPDATE: Edited to remove problem with using 2nd monitor, since the latest patch 1
11
2 this works just fine
Thanks EW for the frequent updates & for listening to the community needs
Story Lore/ Music & Sound:I often think of the game as a mountain climbing sim with hunting opportunities
Of course, that’s because I’ve often wished for a sim for climbing mountains
And, the challenge of discovering all the sights modeled after real-life geographical landforms: archipelago, butte, canyon, gorge, volcano, and much more, is all very alluring
But, many natural points of interest are integrated into the maps, providing a history or lore to these fictional maps that matches their real-life counterparts
You are able to climb every mountain in the game
You can explore totem memorials and abandoned ruins and collect artifacts
The sound effects immerse you in the outdoor world, and the music is lovely
Every area of the map is crafted with painstaking detail that provides eye-catching splendor to each sunrise and sunset
Gameplay:Much of the fun gameplay comes in with tracking the animals, for hunting and for photography with the cinematic camera in the controls
The controls are all very simple, and can be keymapped for ease of use
I like the run toggle so you don’t have to hold down W
I changed the E use key to mouse 5, so that when I’m tracking I can run toggle and use the mouse to navigate and click to read the tracks as I’m running
The overlay provides mapping and a codex that stores all your accumulated knowledge of the world you’ve discovered
 The day/night cycle is 4 times the speed of in real life
So you have 3 real time hours of darkness to immerse in the nightlife of the woods, as well as those daytime hours
Many outposts are scattered throughout the maps, and provide access to your storage, the in-game store, and a sleep point
Sleeping allows you to move time ahead in hours
Setting it to 18:00 for example, would make it sundown if you want to hunt at night
But, each time you sleep costs in-game money, making it a bit more of a challenge
Your character and your atv can take damage
Creatures stampede and can hurt you
But, ‘death’ only resets your character at a sleep point & you lose nothing
Atvs are unlimited
Abandoning one at the foot of a mountain is nothing
You can retrieve it at the next outpost, or even pitch a tent, and summon one up
Tents have a limit that seems to be about 7 or so on each reserve
With fast travel, you are able to move from tent to tent if you wanted to be in another location to hunt at dark
I like to explore in the daytime, and hunt at sunset, sunrise, and nighttime
Tracking and missionsThroughout the world you come across animal need zones and tracks
These can be ‘read’ to give information about when the animal species was last there and often how many animals were in that location
Returning to that spot at the same time will allow you to encounter that species, whether for hunting or photography
Multiple arcs of missions are imbedded in the single player to allow the option of structured gameplay, for those who want more than just simple run and gun type game play
Of course, even the most hobbit-like adventurers like me, who love to wander around the countryside seeing all the sites and animals, love to find a cozy spot on a rock overlooking a canyon and accumulate a few carcasses down below before climbing down to harvest them all
The Shooter Experience: COTW has a range of weapons that you feel sufficiently motivated to collect for hunting every species
Of course, more is always better, when it comes to weapons in game
More would be even better
It also has lures, ammo, and other gear for hunting
Scattered around the countryside are woodpiles for building permanent ground blinds using in-game currency
These provide more experience points for the skills & perk trees as well
The skill & perk trees provide a good range of skills to work toward increased hunting experience for the current 60 max of levels
These add abilities such as gauging the weather, and improved tracking skills
DLC expansions added ATV’s and tents and ground blinds
I’m not sure, but it looks as if these can be purchased eventually with in-game funds as an alternative, though it would take a lot of time
Either way, 4 bucks is the cheapest expansion dlc I’ve seen
And, the ATVs are an awesome part of the hunting and exploration
And, the tents allow portable base access; functioning like the permanent outposts throughout the maps
Personally, I’d love to see the addition of boats and fishing
But, that is just a wishlist item
I see no cons to this game
The Diversity of Animal Life:The game is inspired by the book, Call of the Wild by Jack London
Like the book, the game reveals much about the lives and behaviors of animals, and the great outdoors
Many species are integrated into the world of the current two reserves in Germany and America: Black Bears, Roosevelt Elks, Red Foxes, Coyotes, European Bison, Wild Boar, Moose, Red Deer, Fallow Deer, Roe Deer, Whitetail Deer, and Blacktail Deer
Besides the typical colors, several rare & albino furs appear randomly
The upcoming dlc expansion will add a third reserve in Siberia: Medved, with snow and an anticipated new selection of animals such as the already revealed Lynx
MultiplayerI was in Scouting myself at an early age, and later an Explorer’s Post as a young adult
I’ve enjoyed the fun of group campouts with my sons in the cub scouts over the course of a decade & the numerous camping trips with families & friends over the years, and even group & solitary hiking & camping experiences
But, I’ve never been hunting myself
As great of an experience as solitary hiking & camping can be, friendship is a huge part of the outdoors
COTW provides a smooth multiplayer experience, where you can either create your own server game, or jump in with already created servers
All outposts & locations unlocked in singleplayer are also available for quick travel on the multiplayer maps
You can join your buddies for group cooperative hunts or compete in challenges
Graphics:I get 60fps steady & can play mp with crappy internet
No problems at all
Second monitor & the Steam overlay works great with COTW
You can even open vids in the overlay and listen while you shift/tab back into the game, which is really nice while sitting in a hunting stand in the dark waiting on the animal herd to arrive
Call of the Wild is a truly spectacular real world experience that takes all the quality of life improvements of computer video gaming and makes the outdoor life even better
 I highly recommend the game for animal lovers, fans of shooters, open sandbox, and sims
The devs at Expansive Worlds have made a high quality game for everyone to love

												100+ Hour's + and i love the game, Had mad repect for the devs as i thought they were not going for cash grabs with a buggy unfinished game
Two thumbs down boy's i dont feel this is right, i and many many other people were under the impression that what set this game apart from thehunter original was the ONE TIME PAY FOR CONTENT game that they promoted
			
Posted: 8 August
												If you like nature and hunting, this is the game to get
No game on the market nails down the atmosphere like this one does
In my objective opinion, it has the best looking "nature environment" i have ever seen in a game (the playermodels do feel a 'bit' more Cartoonish)
CAUTION:if you are a 'run and gun' type of player, this has little to offer you
Also seeing the relative scarcity of animals, you will be walking alot
LIKE ALOT
I personally dont mind because i get immersed into the scenery and audio, hiking simulator
XD If you play it smart ( aka dont keep running everywhere and scare all the animals away), you can stalk or lure animals pretty fast
Just keep in mind to make your first shot count
This is no zombie shooter game
Try going for the lungs at the beginning, then gradually learn to hit more smaller vital spots
(this is for the noobs who would stalk an animal for 30m then miss the shot because they went for a headshot, then ragequit and refund) At launch there were some problems with animal AI (they kept getting stuck in trees and bushes) and some UI problems
These have been fixed and many other things (however some smaller bugs remain)
To be honest i dont like the quests, some are even ridiculously hard (like making a valid photograph of  3 bears in a certain zone)The business model however is deceitful 


Unlike their previous titel 'Thehunter' that has microtransactions for every little piece of content, "Thehunter: call of the wild" was advertised as an "one time purchase" , ok no problem even though i knew they would add new reservations as dlc (currently 2 ingame)
AcceptabelNOPE,they added some basic stuff that should have been in the core game as "free dlc" and started pushing some core game mechanics as "PAID dlc", custom spawn/fasttravel points (tents) and motorized transport (atv)
Conclusion:transport and cutom spawn/fasttravel points as DLC
Whats the next step in the game development world, selling the ability to save a game as 'DLC'
Yep lets chop the whole game into dlc
The ability to run, the ability to reload, the ability to harvest an animal
ALL DLCI like this game, really
But i currently cant support the business model of the developers
ONCE they start selling 'actual EXTRA content' as DLC and setting the core mechanics they are currently selling to "free"
I will give this a upvote

Early Access Review
								One of my favorite games that I have played in the past five years has got to be 7 Days to Die, hands down, maybe even my absolute favorite
Whenever I try out a game, I dont play it for three or four hours before rating it, you're barely into a game to even rate it, in my opinion
At this moment, I'm 529 hours in, so I felt the time to review it was approaching fast, so here I am
Where do I begin? Well, I had been scrolling around on YouTube, looking for games to watch people play, when I accidentaly stubled upon this gem
I only saw Alpha 1 gameplay at the time, which barely resembles what this game is now
Despite how it looked, I had been looking for a survival base building game for a long time, so I bought it one weekend, and it absorbed my soul and then some
Whenever you first start, you have little to nothing on you
You have a bottle of water, a bandage, and some food to start with
You can loot your surroundings to get some basic materials to start making a stone axe to start getting wood to make a simple shack
If you don't want to build a base in the beginning, you can claim one of the many buildings and fortify it so it works as a home until you decide what you want
This task won't be easy, with zombies added into the mix
Depending on your difficulty, the zombies might be a niusance or an absolute nightmare to deal with
Every 7 days, a Zombie horde will come to attack you and destroy the precious progress you've made on your base, hence the name 7 Days to Die
In those 7 days, you will build your base, and get traps and weapons ready to survive the night and emerge victorious from your base when the morning comes
As the game goes on, it senses how well you're doing
If you're sweeping through the zombie hordes and haven't died in a while, It will send stronger zombies in more numbers to try to give the hardcorre people a challenge
There is a whole lot I could add into here, but for the sake of people who get bored of reading reviews all day, let me get to my pros and cons
Pros:-Lots of replayability
You can play a whole lot of this game and get the best stuff, and start all over again on another world with different settings to give your veteran self a bigger challenge, to keep the game fresh
EDIT: Even though the updates come rarely, there is SO MUCH added each update it's sometimes like you're playing an entirely different game
-Smart building
You can't just build a castle in the sky here! There is structual intergity in this game, so if you build a structure incorrectly or a zombie takes out an important support beam, the building could fall apart around you, along with your supplies being cast into the void
-Friendly Community
This community isn't like DayZ or some of the other communities that have murderous players lurking everywhere, there is a huge variety of servers, some being PvE(Player verses Enemy), others being PvP(Player verses Player), other servers being modded to give the game even more life
Cons:-Updates
The game does have updates, but they happen at least 3 or 4 times a year, so you will be playing the same thing for at least a couple of months before anything new is added, which is annoying at times
-Learning Curve
There are games like Space Engineer that have a very steep learning curve that makes casual players not want to pick these games up
7 Days to Die can have this problem with new players at first, with so much to do and a horde on Day 7 being a problem that might overwhelm some players
I would reccomend watching some people play this first before jumping in, mainly so you have a vague idea on what you are doing
After that initial curve, the game definitely gets easier
-Graphics
If you are a big graphics gamer, then this game might be a bit dissapointing for you
The models, especially for the players, aren't too pretty to look at
The zombies are a bit better, but like I said, the graphics are a bit dissapointing to look at
The landscape is kind of blocky, but It is a minecraft-like game, so it is to be expected
Overall, this is one of my favorite games of all time
It does have it's flaws, like not super good graphics, a bit of a learning curve, few updates, and the occasional bug, but what it has far outclasses its cons, like solid gameplay, lots of repalyability, and having building physics that make you build smart and realistic
I would reccomend at least trying this game out, I think that you will enjoy it!

Early Access Review
								First time playing when it turned night I had no choice but to burry myself in the dirt



Sitting in the pitch black hole just listening to the insane sounds of the zombies outside
I felt a real rush and fear not knowing what would happen




Its rare a game can do that to you
Pros:Great extensive crafting mechanicLootingZombies present an actual challenege especially at night when they runMining for resources feels like you actually acomplished somethingCons:DOGS, $^#@ themStill in alpha so some glitches may occurPerformance can be rough on older systems unless you turn graphics all the way downAll in all though i give this game a strong 8/10 -The Fun Pimps seem to care about the game and are quick with fixes-It can be insanely addicting to play-I love the mining and crafting mechanics-The fun to be had in this game is only limited to your own creativity-LOTS OF REPLAY VALUEI am not good at writing reviews but I hope this helps at least one personFINAL VERDICT:  BUY THE GAME

Early Access Review
								I have been playing this game since Alpha2, it is my and my son's favorite game to play together (he's 14)
We have written a few suggestions that would increase longevity of gameplay, efficiency and fun
1
Decrease the stupid wasp noise, way too loud and obnoxious2
Incorporate rope, and simple machines including but not limited: pulleys for drawbridge function, trip wire, netting, and levers
3
Equipable ruck sack for additional storage, but decreased speed
4
Weather? rain would dampen smell and sound sensed by zombies, slow player


etcetera
5
A zoomable minimap6
Ladder lock, jump to eject, I have died way too many times falling off of a ladder
7
Easier book reading for recipes
8
Laser sight, red dot sight, and mechanical sight
Add a sword and a spear
9
Alliances, groups, clans?10
Big military base instead of those small camps
a lot of loot a lot of risk
11
First aid kit to restore either half or full health
12
Restaurant food prep/ovens and MREs13
Fall breaking: IE pressing space bar breaks fall

Early Access Review
								Minecraft was too boring for me (I'm not a creator for creations sake)
Terraria was fun, I enjoyed the additional combat focus
DayZ didn't have 'it' for me, I didn't like the lack of building (at least when I played it)Ark was fun (dinos!), but it got stale as there was no forced conflict
No reason to explore, no reason to keep building
So it fell into the minecraft trap
7 Days to Die allows me to be creative, but gives me a good solid foundation of conflict and purpose to my building
Not only that, but it creatively forces/encourages me to get out of my safe keep and risk exploring which causes me to engage with the game content in a very enjoyable fashion
This was a recommendation from a friend based on the steam sale, and I've dedicated 90% of my gaming hours to this since I bought it over the holiday break
Strongly recommend

Early Access Review
								Considering the amount of hours I've poured into this game, I believe a proper review is far overdue
To give a bit of background, I first discovered this game back when alpha 9 was the current build
My adventure began when I logged into a singleplayer game in Navezgane with all the settings on easy
This was the first game of its kind that I had ever played, and I had no idea what to expect or how to play
This was evident, as I spent my first day sprinting through the Wasteland in which I had spawned, completely panicked because I had no idea what the game controls were and I had no idea how to get the endless trail of zombies off my back
I never did, either; I ended up dying multiple times and that was where my solo beginning of 7 Days to Die ended
Then, a few months later when alpha 9 got updated to alpha 10, I convinced my friend to buy the game when it was on sale so that he could help me learn how to play it and actually enjoy it
He caved, and so our adventure began in Navezgane once more
Of course, we spawned in the wasteland again, and it was like the horror of my solo journey all over again as we desperately tried to escape the zombies while scavenging for what little supplies we could manage to stop and gather without getting bitten by a dog or smacked by a cheerleader
By the time the 7th day had rolled around, we had finally gotten a grasp on how to play the game


or at least we thought we did at the time
I say this lightly, as we also considered killing ourselves a better alternative than the progressive zombie infection, broken legs, and the endless dysentery that we always seemed to have - probably because food was so hard to come by that we were filling ourselves with old sham sandwiches, rotten flesh, and raw eggs
We hadn't the slightest clue that we were completely destroying our chances of survival as our wellness plummeted down from 100 to 60
Then, our blissful ignorance turned to incredible terror as nighttime rolled around, and the hordes came for us
We had shacked up in the desert by the river and made twin towers out of the incredibly ineffective log cabin wood, which the sprinting, bloodthirsty masses of zombies tore through in a matter of minutes
We had little choice but to hide ourselves on our top floors, watching and waiting in horror as the dead simply demolished everything we had spent the last 7 days working for
But then, in a final moment of hope and desperation, we whipped out the chainsaws we had found and quite literally blasted our way through the masses, only to escape in the night and return in the morning to pick up the pieces and kill off the stragglers
We considered calling it quits and starting over, but ultimately decided against it and decided to dig ourselves a series of bunkers connected by tunnels across the desert
As time passed, we became wiser, and we grew stronger
It was day 35 that we had finally built ourselves and our base up enough to fight off the hordes of the 7th night
We were victorious
From that game on, we've stayed ever-faithful to this game
With every new alpha that's been released, we've been waiting on baited breath to launch a new game, each time slowly but surely helping us progress from the dark, early days of alpha 10 to the hardened, survivalist veterans that we are now in alpha 15
With countless play-throughs on both Navezgane and Random Gen, on servers belonging to friends, random people, and eventually even ourselves, we have learned the game, though we are far from masters
Each new alpha released is like an entirely new game, and we revel in the chance to start anew and work at the chance to better ourselves and our tactics even more
So, do I recommend this game? Well, that would depend on what you're looking for, and what you're expecting to take from the game
You will pour an endless amount hours into this game, you will sometimes regret it, but most of the time you won't
You will be frustrated, you will be terrified, you will be inspired, you will be determined, you will be devastated, you will be excited
The accomplishment you will feel is immense, and it will keep bringing you back to this game even when you think it won't
So, yes, I do recommend this game, because this game is golden, and it just keeps getting better and better
10/10 will continue to be terrified by dogs but explore the wastelands and cities unarmed anyway

Early Access Review
I am speechless
I bought this game together with two friends after we ran out of Coop-Games to play
And since this game has been on my wishlist forever, I decided to go with it
It was on sale, after all
After a 5
5h session on the first sitting, we became addicted
And I mean, really addicted
Couldn't wait to come home from work and continue
To prepare
To survive
This game is basically a survival-bulding game
DayZ+Minecraft, to be  really general
You can build and destroy blocks, create furniture, traps, weapons, houses, etc
You can find blueprints and craft even more things!There is also a skillsystem in place where you can teach yourself recepies and f
ex
craft ammunition
But most of the time you're just gathering resources to set up a base and not die
And of course you alos have to eat, drink, stay warm and dry and not get sick
There are multiple ways to do so and the more you play, the more you'll learn
Pros:- Big world for you to explore (Either a map or randomly generated)- Lots of stuff to craft and build- New enemies with 7 days- Upgrade your weapon parts and build weapons from scratch- Change the world the way you want to! Dig caves, live in trees, etc
- Play with friends together / against / or alone- A lot of places to discover, change, upgrade and live in
Cons:- It lags when zombies spawn (Down to 20-30fps)- You can get stuck underneath the ground when you join a server- A few minor glitches- Not easy to get started; you need to read most stuff on the wikiOver all, I do recommend this game
In 3 days I logged 23hours of game time and I do not regret it
There's a lot to do, a lot to plan and a lot of fun involved
You get better, quicker and smarter with each day & move
If you love a scare, some pressure, crafting, harvesting, looting, creating, building and shooting, this game is for you!

Early Access Review
								A16 ReviewAs a die hard veteran of this game it has been 'suggested' by various friends on Steam that i write a review
(Write a reivew after only 6,000 hours? Pfft


FINE)Away we go


Buy this game only if you fully understand what Early Access and Alpha stage game development truly mean
This game is incomplete and yet it still is one of most playable and enjoyable Early Access titles on Steam
Watch some current videos and educate yourself on what you're getting into before you buy this game
This game has a steep learning curve and while in game tutorials have been added the game does not hold your hand,Buy this game if you enjoy:-Fully destructable, randomly generated, ludicrously large game worlds
-Zombies-Crafting-Zombies-Survival-Zombie DOGS-Building system with structural integrity-Zombie BEARS-Mining-Exploration-Base defense (A16 added turrents and traps)-And yes, good ole' first person, zombie shootin' goodness
Did i mention that this game is incomplete?Yes? Well ok then, let's all say it together
7 Days to Die is an Early Access game which means that it is not finished yet
The developer plans on completion sometime in 2018
Updates for the game are about every 6 months
The developer is active but wants the game to be built right so is taking it's time
This game will not run well on a potato
Performance is good but rough on average hardware
Summary: Highly recommended for the reasons listed above
Worth every penny of the $25 i spent on it

Early Access Review
								The Baron Reviews: https://www
youtube
com/watch?v=0vL7q4LHwCwOn paper, this game sounds pretty dull; shoot a variety of guns at targets
In reality it is one of the best VR experiences out there, and I think that can largely be attributed to the quality control and attention to detail put into the game by its dev
I don't particularly love guns in real life and I find the idea of owning/shooting gun kind of intimidating, but this has really been enlightening for me as an educational tool
The level of realism for each gun is so high, that after 20ish years of gaming where the majority of games involve guns and shooting of some kind, I was shocked to find that with an M-16 in my hands I had no clue how to actually fire it
All the small things; loading the right clip, flicking the safety, racking the slide, fiddling with the sights and attachments


I absolutely loved it as a learning experience
Plus, the little things, like I didn't know that after loading and racking a pistol, removing the clip still leaves one bullet in the chamber that can be fired
It was therefore surprising to me when I accidentally shot my virtual foot off, thinking the gun was safely unloaded
To me, this is one of those things where even if you are the most liberal, anti-gun person in real life, it's a damn good thing to at least understand how they work from a safety/preparedness point of view!But it's not all educational and serious; In fact, for a game about realistic, lethal weapons, H3VR does an incredible job at not taking itself too seriously! There's tons of fun to be had with all sorts of varying game modes, from straight up target shooting at a range, to swinging out of the ceiling whilst shooting in a jungle gym type arena, to the terrifyingly intense meat grinder mode
As well as being able to spawn items to mess around with without limitation, there is also the ability to reset the environment back to its clean, original state
The variety of guns is large and fantastic, with a huge amount of quality and care in each one
With one exception, they are all true to their real life counterparts, but that one exception is a fictitious gun, the Cleric's pistol from the film Equilibrium (which was a total dream to get to shoot!)
There are also some melee weapons to mess around with, as well as throwables and then some straight up silly items
Graphically, the game is so well done
The guns and textures look amazing and some of the best I've seen in VR
The audio too is absolutely top marks, with fantastic attention to detail being placed on little things from the crack of the different calibers to the plink of the bullet casings hitting the floor
Gunfire also takes into consideration environmental reverb, so a rifle shot doesn't sound the same in the gunrange as it does outside
All these small things do such a good job at making the experience feel realistic
The physics are excellent, with the ability to change how physics work from realistic to semi-realistic, or to not at all
I love realistic because I love the "feel" of the guns when you toss them on a table, though tossing grenades with realistic physics is a little tricky! I also absolutely love that the option is given to have no bullet casing cleanup, so you can see all the casings pile up on the floor
Other than that, interacting with guns can at times be a little niggly, especially with the Touch controllers, but I mostly chalk that other up to just the nature of doing anything with the motion controllers, plus a recent update helped tremendously with Touch calibration
Because of the mostly standing nature of the game, VR sickness was non-existent for me
You can move around the areas with a teleport, which works perfectly fine
I have no complaints about this game at all, but I do have two disappointments, of which sadly the debates on each have been soundly put to rest! I would have liked to (or the option to) been able to see my hands in game for immersion
However, due to the understandable technical difficulties in this task and potential bugginess it could cause, it isn't going to happen
But even more than that I wish so much that H3VR had a Workshop on Steam where modders could create fictitious guns from sci-fi or movies (like the RoboCop gun, Blade Runner, etc, or maybe even crazy things like a Proton Pack!)
However, due to the complexity of adding guns and their physics, the game wouldn't be able to support the architecture for modders, so it is a sound no on that
The absence of these two thing are disappointing in the truest sense of the word, but in no way make the game any less incredible
Even though its Early Access, the current game is polished like a full release
Updates have been consistent and substantial in content, with the dev being active on the forums and engaging with the community
If you love guns, this is a must play game
If you don't love guns, this is a must play game

												This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike
Here you go:I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game
I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it
A few weeks passed by and another friend came over
He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it
He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house
When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy
I was playing it hardcore
Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself
Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience
Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful
In a pleasant way, ofcourse
Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different
Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way
Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day
Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game
The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT
I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience
I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008
 So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played
I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago
I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist
I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots
I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games
It's harder though

												So here's a little story
Before my dad and my mom got a divorce, and before I was even born, my mom would work late nights at the the hosipital (she was a nurse), leaving my dad home alone
He wouldn't really have anything to do so one day, he went to the store and bought Counter-Strike (it was back then when you needed a disc to play; steam wasn't around yet)
and he would play until she got home
14 years later on Saturday, April 15th 2017, he personally bought me and my little brother copies of Counter-Strike so we can all play together
This game brought my family closer together ever since the divorce
10/10, best game ever

												Once upon a time, Call of Duty was a legit, epic, vietnam shooter
There was a time where snipers camped and didn't run around quick scoping
There was a time where submachine gunners ran around and didn't camp in corners
There was a time where thermal scopes didn't exist and smokes actually did someting
There was a time where 2-3 bullets actually killed you instead of 10-12
There was a time where shotguns weren't OP
There was a time where 12 year olds didn't sleep with your mum
There was a time where squeakers didn't dominate over people
There was a time where trolls didn't anger over-sensitive people
All in a place called Call of Duty: black ops			
Posted: 25 November, 2013
												IMO, one of the better COD available to PC
Had a rough launch but Treyarch seems to be the only activision COD developer who cares about PC gaming; rolling out bug fixes quickly and including FOV slider
This has true Dedicated server support and support of unranked modded servers
The community has very much diminished, and most of the lower latency NA servers are mostly Nuketown forever game types with almost no servers hosting DLC
Buying DLC for this is only justifiable if you desire to play the Zombies game mode; which is an absolute blast, especially with friends; going for those higher levels and finding all the easter eggs
My favorite part of this COD is the gunplay
Trades in gunfights tend to go to the more skilled player rather than the player who sees the other first (like we see in newer COD titles)
In summary:Pros:Twitch Shooter with skill oriented gun playTrue Dedicated Servers with Mod Support on unranked ServersZombies gametype with tons of replayCons:90 FPS Cap (Old Quake engine bugs when running over 120 FPS)Lack of Eyefinity or Surround multi Display support (Flawless Widescreen or Widescreen fixer solves this)Small CommunityNuketown everywhereNo point of buying DLC unless you like the zombies game type

												Before you say that I barely played this game then let me inform you that I played this game when it was in closed beta testing as a browser game about 10 months ago
I just downloaded it to try it now that its on steam to see if there are any big changes and here is what I found
The game still has the same horrible cash shop as before and I really dislike cash shops like this where you can buy weapons and gear for real money, or you can buy them with ingame credits that takes a while to earn and the weapon only last for about 7 or 14 days (alot of guns are permanent though)
The game does have decent balance between all the guns but I still don't like the cash shop system it has and you need to repair weapons
I play a bunch of different games so I don't have the time to no life in this game for 7 or 14 days and grind
The best kevlar and helmet can only be bought for the co-op currency and only last 14 days
That system really sucks for me since if I buy something that last 14 days but I only play 7 days then I obviously lose on it
I am also not interested in the co-op part of the game
The cash shop also seems to rotate a few weapons every 2 weeks that are only available for real money and only last 7 days
The game has very small maps, granted some people might actually like that but I really hate these incredibly small maps where you can spawn and throw a grenade to the enemy spawn, it also just encourages a bunch of nade spamming and camping and spawn killing
The dedicated / peer 2 peer / lobby server system is a good idea with potential but as it is right now after you play 1 map it takes forever for the next one to start on most servers because people always seem to leave and the host has to start each new match manually it seems but this could be cause the game is in beta
There are also always people that lag in every single match
The games graphics are not that good on max settings
I know graphics are not everything but when they keep using it as a selling point and even on steam they keep bragging about "cryteks cry engine" for example this is what it says under features of this game: "Expect the best – Crytek's trademark quality meets free-to-play gaming" You kinda expect them to deliver but they really don't, this game looks like its from 2008
So to sum it up: Game has bad cash shop, small maps with nade spam and campers and spawn killing, lobby server system with hosts that is buggy, laggy and slow
Graphics are not as good as they advertise them to be
Overall "feel" and "smoothness" of the game is really weird in my opinion and I just don't enjoy it that much
If you play this game then please look at the characters movements and stuff in the game and you'll see how sluggish, weird and awkward everything is
Keep in mind this is just my opinion of the game, feel free to download the game since its f2p and try it for yourself, I am sure plenty of people will like this game
Oh for all the people defending the game and saying its in beta, then yeah it is, but its been in beta for like 1 year now and the same problems exist now as they did back then, so to me that is no valid excuse
If you like the game and thats your opinion then good for you, but please stop defending the game by simply saying "its in beta, what do you expect" bla bla bla

												Do you enjoy getting kicked by moderators because they are losing?Do you enjoy playing a pay to win game because upkeep is higher then income? (unless ofcourse you pay)Do you enjoy playing versus hackers?Do you enjoy getting votekicked by regular players because you do not have the best score or for no apperent reason?If you can answer all these questions with a yes then Warface is the game for you!The game starts out pretty nice
There are special rooms for new members where everybody uses almost the same (underpowered) weapons and armor
For the first 30 or 40 matches your chances are fair and you might even start to like the game
When you get to lvl 13 you are placed in the rooms with the members that pay for the game and get all the overpowerd gear
From this moment on your chances will strongly decline unless you are willing to pay
I started playing back in 2015 when the game was under Crytek
The game was pretty nice back then
Updates were plenty, hackers got banned quickly and you could play the game without spending a single euro or dollar
Paying members got their stuff a bit faster, could get some nice skins and some other perks but everybody had the same chance during the game
Sinces the start of 2017 My
com took over and the game changed for the worse
(As you can see from all the negative reviews that came pouring in) First I waited patiently because a migration from one developer to another can take some time
After about 3 months into 2017 the game is becoming almost impossible to play
Warface is changing from a free to play game with chances for everybody to a free to play game with chances for those who are willing to invest fast amounts of money (id say €60 and more if you want to be able to play every class with decent weapons)
Upkeep of your weapons and armor is now exceding the amount you earn from missions
Paying members are able to use these armors and weapons while the free to play members are left with and unfair disadvantege
Untill now hackers are free to use whatever hack they want
During 'ranked' matches normal players are getting carried by hackers and My
com doesnt do anything about it
If for some reason you take the time to report this to My
com they send you an automated messages trough their support system that makes it seem like they are taking your problem serious while in fact the same(!) hackers are continue playing
If you send another message to support (about the same or a different subject) they send you the exact copy paste message back
To make it all worse, there is apparently a bug or hack that grants you certain ablities (kicking, banning) to use against regular members (although i have only seen this during the ranked matches)
I have reported this over a month ago to My
com and the same member is still abusing this bug today
In the more then 2000 hours I got on recored playing this game I have seen a strong decline during the last months
If you are in doubt of playing this game or if you should or should not spend money on it I would strongly discourage it
My advice would be to not start playing warface or at the very least not spend a single euro on it

												Pay to win
Buy weapons and upgrades, they last for a few days then you have to buy them all over again
You can earn money to buy some weapons just by playing but you cant earn the credits you need for the strong weapons
Essentially you play and lose matches repeatedly against players who pay money and finally earn enough for the gun you wanted and it is gone in 7 days and you have to earn it all over again

Classic shooter nearly ten years oldIt might seem weird to dedicate a review to a game that came out on november 16th, 2004
Still, Half-Life 2 is no "ordinary" game
Even before it's release, it was the most talked about, and surely most anticipated game up till then
Back in 2004, Valve was still primarily a game-developer, Steam had only just been launched in order to streamline the updating-process for the Valve-games (quite an original and ground-breaking idea since back in those day patching one's game could easily turn into a hazardous adventure)
Immediately after its release, Half-Life 2 was loaded with critical praise, and almost instantly rose to the top of all lists defining the best games ever
And even today, after ten years, it still tops a lot of those lists
I played it for the first time only five years ago, messing around with the original Half-Life up till then
Five years ago, the game struck me as still very good-looking and a blast to play, even being five years old
Quite recently I picked it up again, to be honest in the first place to get some of the achievements I had missed during my first play-through (I only got really interested in the Steam achievements this year)
To my surprise, the game immediately got back under my skin, so I decided to give it another play-through, and I enjoyed it immensely, hence this review
Of course the Source Engine shows its age: up-close textures get quite blurry, but the wider vistas are still amazingly "alife", and the colours and general atmosphere are still exciting
The physics engine - a novelty back then - now surely feels outdated, even crappy, but playing around with the famous "gravity gun" makes more than up for this, and surely has its funny moments
But in every other respect, this game is a classic and a masterpiece in the true sense of the word
The story is so convincingly told, that I felt myself beeing "Doctor Freeman" again, already during the first chapter (which introduces the gameworld in a very ingenious way which has not been surpassed ever since)
The level-design is simply awesome
Compared to modern-day shooters, the interface and the amount of information about the surroundings you get as a player, are minimal
There is no minimap, there are no waypoints, there is no compass, there is no large-scale map
And still, I never ever got lost, thanks to the downright genial way the levels are designed
Still, the amount of freedom you get is great: there are tons of hidden places, byways, or larger spaces to explore, besides the more traditional corridors, but they always manage to lead you in a logical way
This game offers the classic examples on how levels can be optimally designed
Sound, too, is amazing: there is not much in-game music, but when it appears (mostly in the action-packed scenes), it really delivers to the full
Sounds from the guns, NPC's and ambient sounds are extremely convincing
But what still shines most of all is the actual gameplay and the way this games is "paced"
Sneaky, almost stealth-like scenes alternate with extremely violent action-moments, in a very, very clever way, only to be alternated with puzzles and other moments where thinking is required
The choice of the right gun at the right time is essential, and very rewarding
There is a lot of interaction with other characters, but never up till the point where this gets tedious
And best of all: there are countless moments of surprise, when the story takes a turn for the unexpected
So, yes, this is still a classic, and yes, it's still up there among the best games ever (although I personally would grant it a top-five place or so, the top-three spots taken by more recent "classics")
For my scorings, I give them as I conceived the game during my actual playthrough, so not taking into account it's a ten year old game
Gameplay: 27/30 (there are some frustrating puzzles and some weird moments with the gravity-gun but everything else is sheer genius)Grahics: 15/20 (the outer vistas are great, the rest is showing its age)Sound: 9/10Longelivety: 8/10 (no multiplayer, but the game has tons of singleplayer gameplay)Steam integration: 10/10 (it comes with trading cards and 33 achievements, most of which really add something to game, if only to explore different ways to achieve things - the way achievements should work imo)Technical: 9/10 (runs very smoothly and I got no crashes, but sometimes hangs for a couple of seconds on loading screens)Personal appreciation: 10/10Overall: 88/100

												This one of the best first person shooter games I've ever played, plain and simple
Half Life 2 begins 20 years after the original Half Life
As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine
You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine
Half Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it
If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now
The game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters
You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles
 Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane
For a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing
Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters
The game for the most part is pretty easy
I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire
Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult
The game took me 10 hours to finish
I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny
Apart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value
The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs
In the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game
It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer
This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life
I experienced zero problems while playing the game
I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing
This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems
Final Rating:9
5/10 -  A Must own and must playIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review

												Half-Life 2 takes a minimilist approach to story development, but delivers a rich, atmospheric, and engaging world that sucks you right in
Combined with novel gameplay elemetns (one of the first mainstream games to make proper use of physics in gameplay), an ensemble of likeable characters—topped off with the much loved Alyx Vance, and well paced combat, this helps to make Half-Life 2 an all-time classic

												DOOM (2016) is a first person shooter developed by Bethesda and ID Software, meant to pay homage to the original series of Doom games from the 90s, which it does so incredibly well
Gameplay      The gameplay in this game is incredibly fluid, all the guns have impact too them
That with the amazing enemy variety and fantastic soundtract by Mick Gordon all together make the gameplay feel extremely fun! The atmosphere of both the UAC and Hell are spectacular
   The game introduces a new mechanic called "Glory Kills" basically demons that are staggered can be killed in spectacular fashion, that as well as the challenges, collectibles and secrets through out the levels will have you searching all over for the hidden levels from the original DOOM, this and the large amount of levels combined leads up to atleast 11-14 hours of gameplay
The levels in DOOM are great in the fact that most of them aren't linear, unlike most FPS games
Although the AI can be a bit dumb at times, sometimes getting stuck somewhere or being a bit slow in some sections, nothing too serious though
The gameplay may also get repetitive at times
STORY      Believe it or not this game does have a story, while the story may seem a bit drab or boring to you at first it gets much better later on in the game, as the story will suprisingly hold your attention and is quite interesting once you understand it, my problem though is that the story ended a bit, sudden as it seemed it was only to set up the base for a second game or maybe DLC
 GRAPHICS       DOOM(2016) is a beautiful game, the graphics engine and the lighting give a wonderful atmosphere to the game, especially in Hell
The glow and other visual effects make the game look beautiful
Another plus is that it is very well optimized, I could run it at Ultra just around the specs required at a near steady 60FPS
AUDIO AND MUSIC      The music in DOOM is amazing in the fact of how well it fits the levels and combat
The little solos you hear every time you commence a glory kill make the game feel dynamic with the music, Mick Gordon delivered his music and he did so perfectly
     The weapons all sound like they have force in them, leading for more fun and immersive gameplay, the sound of minigun bullets tearing through the flesh of a Hell Knight is so satisfying
MULTIPLAYER      From what I heard the multiplayer in the Beta was bad, but I'm glad to tell you thats simply not the case anymore
The multiplayer in DOOM (2016) is very fun, with all the different unlocks and vast amount of freedom you have on how you customize your marine for combat
Player progression feels fair and fun as you level up fairly quickly early on
That with the large amount of game modes and maps make the multiplayer very fun
A large part of the multiplayer is playing as the demons themselves, being incredibly powerful and killing most players in a few hits, forcing players to work together to bring down the beast, or run
The coolest part is you can choose which demon you get to be when you do become that Demon
  Another large aspect of the multiplayer is SNAPMAP, a tool for anyone in the community to easily make their own levels with lots of freedom on how to do so
There are tons of player made missions, I've played a few myself they are very fun and I reccommend you check it out
OVERALL All together DOOM (2016) is a fantastic game that is full of replay value just to get the achievements and secrets throughout the levels, that with the massive amount of content from the multiplayer may have you playing for a while! All in all I give DOOM(2016) a  9/10  the fantastic visuals and music along with the gameplay make this game an amazing experience!

												Portal was my first ever Valve game, and it holds the test of time very well
The puzzles still make me think even after numerous playthroughs, and if you have yet to play it, I definitely suggest you do
			
Posted: 9 June
												This is one of the best games on Steam without a doubt
The plot is original and the gameplay is amazing
The only downside is that it is kind of short
I would have enjoyed it being longer like Portal 2
I have 27 hours, with that much time you could have finished the game 4-5 times, but most of the time I have was spent towards achievement hunting
Great game 15/10

												Portal is a first person action game of logic and strategy developed by Valve in 2007 and released in a package called The Orange Box 
The player wakes up in a glass room , the Aperture Science development center, where he is subjected to a series of experiments until 





well I will not spoil the  game 



Each experiment is guided by Glados voice, the mainframe development center computer
Glados is one of the best virtual characters in recent years
That computer has more personality than many humans from other games
Throughout the game the player acquires a portal gun
This gun allows you to create portals, to enter and exit portals in order to go forward in the game, which requires solving logic puzzles to advance
You will  acquire a good sense of physics, position and movement
The game is a marvel of Valves creativity
Many would prefer to kill zombies in left 4 dead , but personally, I think games like Portal are those who write history
The game lasts a few hours and when it finishes,  with music and lyrics, it makes you want to stand and applaud
No other game in recent years has touched me so much when it ended
It is an ode to creativity
Its sequel , Portal 2, expands the concept of the game and makes it much longer, making it a standalone game
The Portal 2 was named Game of the Year in 2011 for various publications
The game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360 before being ported to MAC OSX
Now that I've finished the review I want my cake ! 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ESPAÑOL----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Portal es un videojuego de lógica y estrategia en primera persona desarrollado por Valve en 2007 y lanzado en un paquete llamado Orange Box
El jugador despierta en una sala de cristal, el centro de desarrollo de Aperture Science, donde es sometido a una serie de experimentos hasta que …… no les voy a arruinar el juego



En cada experimento lo va guiando una voz, que es Glados, la computadora central del centro de desarrollo
Glados es uno de los mejores personajes virtuales de los últimos años
Esta computadora tiene más personalidad que muchos humanos de otros juegos
A lo largo del juego el jugador adquiere una pistola de portales
Esta pistola de portales le permite generar portales para entrar y salir por donde le es posible e ir avanzando en el juego, que requiere resolver acertijos lógicos para seguir adelante
Para ello hay que adquirir un buen sentido de la física, la posición y el movimiento
El juego es una maravilla de la creatividad de Valve
Quizas muchos prefieran matar zombies como en el left 4 dead, pero personalmente creo que juegos como el Portal son los que escriben la historia
Finalmente al terminar en unas pocas horas, con musica y letra, dan ganas de pararse y aplaudir
Ningun juego posterior a portal me emocionó tanto
Es una oda a la creatividad
Su secuela, el Portal 2 amplía el concepto del juego y lo hace mucho más largo, convirtiéndolo en un juego independiente
El Portal 2 fue nombrado Juego del Año en 2011 por diversas publicaciones
El juego se lanzó para PC bajo Windows, PS3 y XBOX 360 para luego ser portado a MAC OSX
Ahora que terminé el review quiero mi torta!

The first Portal is for sure shorter, has less story and features than the sequel
Though it has something


the mistery, the charm, the feel of menace, elegant sci-fi scent and terrific GLaDOS who hasn't gone over the top yet
Valve, put your sorry Dota 2 down and please make games like this just like you don't care

												Excellent, unique, creative, and amusing
It's both challenging enough puzzles to be interesting, and short enough to not be tedious

Posted: 6 November, 2015
												Portal, rather than a game, can be considered a metaphor of life
We wake up every morning with a commanding voice that, like it or not, pushes us to face trials increasingly difficult to get a prize
A voice that we find strange and that we don't know if we could trust
A voice that can come from the outside but also from our own unconscious
We never know if the final prize is real but we are armed of portals
But what are the portals if not the ability to be able to see the world from different perspectives? The portal is the human ability to abstract being able to immerse himself in aspects of the world that had been hidden by the limitations of the senses
Ok, if you're already confused, I understand
Just buy the damn game
			
Posted: 13 June
10/10Pros  You really fall in love with the art style and dark, industrial setting
Also the lighting is absolutely gorgeous
(seriously, look at those sunsets at The Hound Pits pub)  The map design is brilliant with dozens of optional routes to take and ways to complete objectives
(After playing some missions for the 4th time I was still finding pathways I hadn't taken before)  You're completely free to play how you would like to - never be detected, set off every alarm there is, kill everyone with crazy rat swarms and traumatise a child or keep your hands super clean
Or just completely wing it
 As there are not endless cutscenes and the game is split into missions, it's really replayable
It's fun to try a new playthrough of the game completely different to your last one and I do feel this game should be replayed to fully appreciate the different mechanics and everything the game has to offer
Cons  "SHOULD WE GATHER FOR WHISKEY AND CIGARS TONIGHT?" will drive you insane after the 20th time
 If you don't save often and are going for a stealth, no-kills run, YOU'RE SCREWED
The game can be buggy and the controls can mess up especially when going for non-lethal takedowns
So just save a LOT if you care about the acheivements
 Yeah, the storyline is pretty short but is thankfully made up for in gameplay
Also do me a favour; read notes, listen to audiologs, use the heart on everyone, look through keyholes to overhear conversations
It adds a lot more to the game!

												The bold artistic design, the memorable steampunk world, the awesome open-ended gameplay, the compelling abilities, the colorful characters, and above all, the freedom of choice -- these are the things that mark Dishonored as one of the best remarkable games of recent years

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Dishonored Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Stealth; Atmospheric; First-Person; Dark; RPG; Action My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-40 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates REVIEWDishonored is a riveting, immersive, and downright pleasurable experience
 Decent graphics with superb artistic direction and a fitting soundtrack set the ambiance
 There is a captivating world to explore, rife with a subtle-but-present wealth of lore and history
 The gameplay can range from stealthy-pacifist style to murderous-warrior style, or somewhere in between; it is easy to find a playstyle that suits your preferences
 There is much to like
The atmosphere of the game is really its heart and soul
 The gameworld is masterfully crafted to be immersive and intriguing as you explore your way through the campaign
 Wandering through side passages and windows, you not only find collectibles and items but also notes and books which provide lore and background information
 This supplements the primary storyline and few sidequests that compose the main narrative
 That narrative being enticing and well-told, although not without a few clichés
The gameplay is structured to offer varying, branching options to choose from as you progress toward your goal
 In each level, there are various paths to take and various ways to take them
You could blow open the front door and slaughter everyone or you can slip through an attic window and never allow your presence to be known
 A lot of games try to offer this, but Dishonored is exceptional in how balanced the gameplay is to truly allow for both stealth and loud options
 It does lean slightly toward stealth, undoubtedly, but you really have a lot of freedom to get creative in how you want to go about each mission
Another premiere aspect of the game, tying together the atmosphere and gameplay, is the evolving gameworld
 Depending on your methods of completing earlier missions, as you get deeper into the campaign the gameworld changes to reflect how your actions have impacted society
 The effects are ultimately rather subtle, but contribute to further highlight the outstanding atmosphere of the game
The various styles of play and mission paths combined with achievements and collectibles make for some good replay value and decent playtime
 If you explore and immerse yourself in the lore, the game can be quite substantial; if you bulldoze through the main campaign, the game can be quite short
 Also the DLC can add a decent amount of content, so the GOTY edition is probably a good bet if you are looking to maximize gameplay hours
Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Dishonored is a true memorable game
It does everything right
You have a diverse arsenal of weapons and powers at your disposal in your story of revenge
As Corvo Attano, you put the mask of an assassin in a city tormented by chaos
Your way of dealing with problems will influence the city, since killing will take chaos to new levels or being a pacifist will get you a happy ending
Level design is well thought, so being the good guy is not impossible but rewarding, while being the bad guy is really fun
The chaotic play style is the one where you'll fully enjoy your ablities and their upgrades, but as you progress that way, things get harder, as the game adapts to you to be challenging
Assassinating your targets is fun, but handlling things peacefully is actually more attractive, as you'll deal with fascinating NPC's 
If you'll take your time to explore, you'll get to know an engorssing world
Overall, this game is a gem that deserves everyones attention and while it is kind of short(I didn't wanted it to end) the score of 9
4 does it justice

												The world of Dishonored is fantastic; it is so rich and well-established by way of in-game books, notes, overheard dialogue and even just little scenes upon which you can stumble
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=303411450 Some people call Corvo, the protagonist, boring and characterless, but what's facinating is the effect that your actions - and by extension, Corvo - has on those around him
People treat you differently by way of subtle changes in speech or tone and the lasting effect on one particular character is nothing short of brilliant
As far as gameplay goes, Dishonored isn't perfect
The stealth mechanics are pretty close to perfect, with leaning around corners, clearly visible alert warnings and a multitude of clever ways to get around without being seen, http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=304088002but it falls apart a bit in the combat
Corvo is heralded as a master of arms, able to 'beat three men at once', as a guard can be heard saying
Ironically, fighting more than one person at a time can be infuriatingly difficult
And that's on moderate settings
Because almost all NPCs use a combination of sword and pistol, you can cross swords only to be shot at point blank range by someone you can't stop, they can kick you; an unblockable attack that deals as much damage as a bullet, or they can just swing their sword as you jump backwards out of range and hit you anyway
Their sword range is about three times the length of their sword and you must block every single hit
The killy death tools are nicely varied, allowing for very stylish kills with grenades, crossbow bolts and shrapnel mines, and that's not even touching on the supernatural powers
Adding them, the game becomes a flowing action of combat adding a clever third dimension to swordplay (at least the way I fight)
Aside from just jumping and teleporting high, time manipulation, rat control and blasts of wind are just some of the tricks you can use
Admittedly, you'll probably find one or two powers that you use more than the others, but the options are there to experiment
While the story can be a bit predictable, it serves as a good framing device to take you across the breadth of Dunwall, killing and stalking people of all kinds
Also all of the cutscenes are skippable for those who want to try speedruns
The DLC is an interesting topic, allowing a new perspective on the story as well as some different powers and amazing sprawling levels
The downside of these slow, stealth-based games is they can be lacking in F**k Yeah moments, but Dishonored makes up for that in lasting enjoyment, http://steamcommunity

												Dishonored is a first person stealth action game were you play as Corvo Attano
He is the bodyguard of the Empress of the Isles but you are framed for her murder and now have to become an assassin to seek revenge and save her daughter who was kidnapped in the process
You are freed from prison by the Loyalists who are a resistance group that seek to take the city of Dunwall back
Your first night out you are visited by a mysterious character called The Outsider while you sleep
He burns his mark on your hand and imbues you with special powers to help you through your missions
These missions can be completed in a variety of ways
You can sneak through all the levels without killing anyone or go ahead and kill them all
Why not try a little of both if you feel like it
The only thing is the more you kill the more chaos will ensue
With more chaos you’ll see more rats and more plagued citizens
There are also small side missions you can complete to earn other goodies to help you out
Your weapons consist of a small sword, a crossbow, or your bare hands which can silently take out your enemies or help you in moments of confrontation
Another thing you can do is peek through keyholes to see what may be on the other side which can help you choose how you will accomplish things
You are also given a choice of ten supernatural powers which five are active and five are passive
You will need to find runes to unlock more powers or upgrade them
There are also 40 different bone charms to help enhance your powers or abilities
The supporting cast were well voiced and had many likable and unlikable characters
Everyone was well voiced which always helps add to the immersion
The story was pretty good but I just never really understood what the whole purpose of the Outsider was
I’m not sure if I missed something in the end but I felt all he really did was give you some powers and then never explain why
I also felt a there really wasn’t much to see since most of the game was basically in one area
Overall Dishonored was a great game to play and would love to see a sequel perhaps that may explain more about the Outsider
Maybe even add more missions to flesh the game out some more just not ones that make it feel like it’s just filler
If you haven’t played Dishonored yet then now is the time since the game can be picked up for cheap and it’s worth the money
Bear Rating: 9/10

												Not the most difficult stealth game but perhaps one of coolest


Dishonored is set in a world that resembles Victorian London, but with an odd asortment of technology that looks like it came straight out of a HG Well sci-fi novel: It is somehow familiar and alien at the same time
The visuals are pretty good as is the story, and the game mechanics are easy to pick up
The AI is generally quite good, except for a minor issue with leaning 



basically the AI will not spot you unless you could be seen when not leaning
This means occassionally you can lean around a corner and look someone right in the eyes and they wont see you
Not that this is a big issue because you soon unlock special powers that make 'leaning' seem prosaic
With the addition of magical talismans and very cool gadgets the game does become somewhat easy even on the hardest difficulty, but it somehow manages to remain a lot of fun
The missions are very well done, often allowing many different ways to succeed
You can be the cat burglar or the ghost killer, or maybe you want to possess the minds of men and beast to help gain access to somewhere new? It is up to you
Add to this many different routes in and out of every place and you have the feeling of really being free to do things your way rather than being herded by the gameIn the end, whilst I would not classify it as the greatest stealth game ever made, it is certainly one I recommend to stealth game lovers without any hesitation

												Postal 2 is exactly what you make of it
Yes, it can be a gruesome, unsavory, albeit cartoony, experience, and the game does push you to that end most of the time, but it can also be a open world game that allows you to explore a satirical world filled with both hilarious situations and expectations that speak volumes about paranoid, and in many ways complacent, mid-2000s America
In many ways, it shows how trivial the concerns of the time actually were in the grand scheme of things
Postal 2 needs to be given more credit for pushing the envelope for games; what was once considered taboo was torn apart and amplified in this game
Wholly recommended as an experience

												The prequel to Animal Crossing (Orig
Doubutsu no Mori, released in 2001 for the Nintendo 64), Postal 2 is an experimental first look at how Animal Crossing would eventually expand
Explore a large, bustling town where each NPC has their own schedule, and you can perform menial-but-fun tasks in any way you wish
Featuring many food items, as well as the ability to use the signature 'shovel' item from Animal Crossing, this game has endless possibility for fun
Spend hours gathering all of certain kinds of items, just to say that you did! Fans of Animal Crossing will not be disappointed - I give this game an 11 out of Shigeru Miyamoto

												(Pre-Construction Update)War in PlanetSide 2 isn't exactly hell, though your very first experience of it might be
You create your sexy character and pick a neat faction
Then you're unceremoniously dropped, literally from space, right into the biggest battle the game can find, surrounded by enemies and tanks and pew pews and anything else that happens to be around, with a life expectancy measured in milliseconds
Somehow beat the odds and things don't get better
You stagger from death upon death in a haze of confusion and unexplained icons, not as some ultimate soldier, but simply one more fleck of a gristle in a planet-sized meat grinder that never-ever stops churning
At some point in time, you will even be run over by a tank

probably driven by someone on your team

named Kevin

*scoff*It's nothing personal, though
PS2 is far too busy for that
First off, In most shooters, 16 players counts as a party; more advanced ones might push the limit to 32, or 64
In Sony's epic F2P, you're dealing with at the most 2000 players per continent! Thankfully not all on screen at once, but locked in a three-way tug of war that doesn't simply take cues from the likes of Call of Duty and Battlefield, but has a pretty damn good way of stealing their thunder
Those games ultimately win out in terms of feel, but PlanetSide 2, even though being comparable is a stunning achievement when compared to the standards of your average action MMO, is easily one of the most ambitious online games ever - and setting aside some launch issues, one that lives up to its impossible promises
Fighting in an open world does feels strange - not as intimidating as you'd expect, but far more than just a salesman gimmick
For the most part, standard first-person shooter rules apply
Shooting is skill-based rather than reliant on arbitrary levels
If you don't want to be shot, you get behind cover
Returning fire can be done easily from hip-fire, but you generally want to take advantage of weapon sights and sniper scopes to deal out more accurate shots and hit distant enemies
It's the basic rules of a shooter
The twist here is that, instead of existing as isolated maps, battlegrounds emerge organically as boundaries shift
Today, that bridge over a canyon is simply a handy route between outposts
Tomorrow, it might be a vast ocean of tanks, with infantry crawling all over the scenery like ants
Being in an open world, anyone who wants to take part can do exactly that
There is a loading screen, but no queues, no arbitrary restrictions on numbers or how much you're allowed to bring into battle - not overt ones, anyway

An Instant Action button will spirit over anyone who requests a teleport, but you can just as easily spot something happening and head over under your own will
The longer fights go on, the more people will be drawn to them
Sunderers are brought in as mobile respawn points, fighters strafe the ground and battle for air superiority, tanks take up positions and all hell breaks loose until one side seizes victory
If you're outnumbered, too bad
Reinforcements may arrive, or not
War isn't always played fair man
The sheer scale of the battles is stunning - to the point that, while it makes sense for PlanetSide to be a F2P game, it takes longer for that to fully sink in
Sony hasn't so much embraced the model as given it a back-breaking bear-hug, almost to the point of creating a hidden mini-game called "What's the Catch?" Without paying a single penny, you get *shocker* all five soldier classes and access to mech suits, full access to all continents, all of the vehicles, no equipment restrictions, as many pew pews as you want and the ability to join and start your own guilds (Outfits)
Never are you made to feel like less of a player for not paying a subscription fee or for earning any equipment you need by saving up in-game currency
It's a similar system to League of Legends or Tribes Ascend, just on an MMO-base with (thank god) less sexualizing of the females/overpowered-jetpacks
The most important purchases are, as ever, boosts that speed up your team's in-game resource generation and cooler-looking guns which are used to shoot people in the head for the crime of wearing the wrong colour armour in a shnazzy style
These are slightly expensive tho, with newer guns costing around £4/$5 each (500-700 Sony Points I think on PS4)
Your starting load-out IS respectable though - and while I'm sure it's not deliberate, any temptation to spend a fortune in the store is swiftly dampened by most of its gear being bland variations on stock themes like 'AR' and 'Pistol'
There's nothing as iconic as the Tribes spinfusor, and nothing particularly sexy if you're not into efficiency
In a nice touch, you're allowed to borrow any weapon for a half-hour field test before investing your cash/points (which I find rather neat)
In a straight fight between two players of equal skill and time played, it's true that the one who's paid will usually come out on top - if only because upgrades can only be bought with in-game credits, and outright buying a gun leaves many more of them to spend there
The sheer scale of PlanetSide 2's battles does a lot to prevent any slide into "P2W territory" though
Whatever your gear and however many upgrades you have, you're only one soldier in a rock-paper-scissors showdown - where paper and scissors are represented by the sniper over on that hill and his tank friend
Anywho, whatever role you're playing, the action is very solid; a little stop-start by the way PlanetSide 2's body armour usually makes tissue paper look like a trimmed mithril armor set selling for 40k on the GE, but more than adequate
The only significant failings are in accessibility and readability
There's a simple tutorial, an Interface that comes across as an alien control panel and hundreds of excessive blinking lights and labels apparently harbouring an active grudge against the poor colorblind
It's a rather challenging newbie experience for a game that does have a tricky learning curve, but whose raw basics really aren't that complicated
Oh, similar confusion ALSO sneaks into the graphics! Textures are busy, combined with the oddly muted faction colours, which can make it hard to spot enemies at even close-range, or to react fast enough to anything
The Vanu are particular offenders here, with their purple colours blending into much of the scenery, though the Terran Republic's combination of powerful red with murky grey comes a close second
(If you play Terran, they also earn bonus confusion points for internally using red to flag up enemies
Cognitive dissonance can kill!) I'd like to have seen PlanetSide 2 take a few more cues from the likes of Tribes Ascend and even Team Fortress 2 in terms of its general readability, colour choice and silhouettes
Back to war itself
Out in the field, combat unsurprisingly varies dramatically depending on your class - which you can change at will
Either at reload stations or between lives, if you get bored or your team needs something, be it
A Heavy Assault soldier's life is one of explosives and endless streams of hot lead
Infiltrators work under shadows and use sniper rifles
Light Assault troopers bop around on jetpacks going pew pew
The more points you put into a class and its gear, the more efficient you get with it, so it pays to focus
Do it for the pew pews man
At last, lone wolf players are likely out of luck; well, not entirely
It's possible to play solo
You can join groups as you travel, be added to squads at the touch of a key, and contribute to raids and defence alongside everyone else
PS2's gigantically-scaled firefights put rather tight limitations on what any individual can accomplish alone, and being a cog in the silent machine is rarely a rewarding career
To make the most of PlanetSide 2, you just gotta gather some friends on a Friday night and set your own goals for the battlefield
I salute you!

												EDIT: Construction update is out now, if you've ever wanted to try this game out for the first time, or ever thought about trying it out again after burning out, NOW IS THE TIME TO PICK IT UP
Granted, It's a brand new system so it's a bit janky, but there's already been a huge influx of people so the fights have been amazing
I would put more into this review here, but Joshino has just made a great video that explains the new situation better than I can
TL:DR is this: If you've ever wanted to try out the game, now is the time
Recently got back into playing this game, and have been having a blast
Here's some things I've noticed:* The new tutorial continent is exactly what they needed for the game, it's a small scale version of the actual continents that mostly keeps the newer players "safe" from veterans, excluding Smurfs, since you must be under BR15 to be able to spawn there
It's still not a full tutorial, but at least it's a controlled environment to learn the ropes
* The cert grind is also much easier than before, with ribbon bonuses (first 5 of which are doubled), weapon medals, directives etc
* Alerts are no longer the deciding factor for locking a continent with the new Victory Point system
Never did like basically getting the boot every time an alert ended, whether you won or not
When it comes to FPS, nothing comes even close to what this game comes to offer when it comes to the sheer scale of battles, and the only other thing that I can think of that comes close to the sense of scale that Planetside 2 offers would be Guild Wars 2's World V World
It's free to try out, so the only thing you lose is time
Some tips for new players:* Stick to the beginner continent until you hit BR15
You can always leave and come back before then if you want to test the deeper waters, but once you're past that you cannot go back
Take advantage of the smaller scale zones to familiarize yourself with the mechanics before diving headfirst into the zergs
* Try out *everything* before you buy it
There are two ways of doing this, VR training and Trials
VR training lets you use any combination of gear and attachments for no cost, but only in VR training (unless you unlock the stuff with certs/DBC while in there) They have target ranges for vehicles, infantry, air, complete with range markings for infantry
Take advantage of this
See how each gun works, how it kicks from recoil, cone of fire, and try out how each attachment effects how it fires
Only problem with VR training is that none of the targets move, they're just static and don't truly show how they work in a real fight
That's why Trials exist, so you can use a weapon, albiet just base without attachments, in a real fight for a few hours before spending those hard earned certs on them
* Lastly, Planetside 2 is a game about numbers more than it is a shooter, so go in with friends and find a good outfit
Best way to find an outfit is to join an alert platoon, usually run by an outfit, and essentially trial running them
Most outfits recruit this way, so don't be afraid to ask about them while running with them
You'll find the game much more enjoyable while in an outfit, if only to have people to talk to while running with randoms or while participating in organized operations
Hope this helps at least some people with starting out

												Looking to try out this game? It is free to play, so you should definitely give it a shot
Now here's what you'll need to know:Are you good at battlefield, call of duty, counterstrike, or other first person shooters? If so, good for you, unfortunately that doesn't neccesarily translate into this game that well
I actually started this game being not very good at any FPS's and have gotten considerably better, to where i can comfortably say i am a decent player in this game
The game is so NOT user friendly, that it's learning curve has been called a "learning cliff" by the game's own producer, David Carey
It is something that is always being worked on however
Now, a little about the actual gameplayI have never ever played a game that offered me this type, this range, this level of gameplay
You have the option to pick from different classes, and choose different guns for those classes
With some effort, you can be the driver or even pilot of one of many different vehicles in the game
As stated before, the game is free to play, and does a good job of doing so
All of the weapons in the game can be bought with the in game currency you build up as you play
Real money can be used to buy these guns, as well as cosmetics such as helmets for your character or different camo's
I personally feel like there is something for everyone in the game; if you like to snipe, you can snipe! You can jetpack around as a light assault, or go gung-ho as a heavy assault! There are so many different things to do
The game takes a decent chunk of time to get into and get better at playing, but in just a few months it became my favorite game
I found a super fun group of people who invited me right in and now i play with as much as i can
There are always periods of time where the game has many (and i mean many) issues that make it difficult to play
And although the community is quick to blame SOE (Sony Online Entertainment) and demand fixes, SOE has truly created a masterpiece with this game
As long as there are servers, as long as i am a gamer, as long as i can, i will continue to play planetside, and would more than reccomend it to anybody reading this review

												Edit: The Planetside 2 Elite Soldier Bundle is sweet!You spawn as an infiltrator
 You steath into the enemy base, pull off some solid snake bs, nobody sees you
 Exposions all around panic everywhere
 You hack the enemy base turret and start blowing up the enemy with thier own defences
 Suddenly! You explode! Ahhh darn they got you! but wait! You were teamkilled by a rank 1 NC Heavy on Connery named asdfghjkl
At first your mad, but then it dawns on you that he is actually


A tactical genius!  He knew that you were gonna die anyways, so he denied the enemy points
 By shooting his rocket at the stationary base defense, instead of those small hard to hit infintry scattered around the ground
 He insured something was getting done while denying an extreme menace kill to the enemy
On NC Connery every teamkill has a tactical significance no matter how big or how small
 They had your best intrest in mind when they shot you in the face

												This game is everything I could've wanted from a MMOFPS, and for good reason
 Battles are massive, epic, and get the blood pumping like no other FPS I have played before
 The sheer beauty of battle is unmatched by any other shooter I've experienced
 Combat mechanics, customization, and leveling are all done very well, as the advantages they give are not game changing, and they can all be unlocked without purchase
 (Excluding purely cosmetic items, they are for purchase only)  Squad mechanics are extremely deep, and are the most polished I've seen out of any game; it allows for levels of strategy I've never before seen in a shooter, and is all too fun creating a warpath with your buddies
 Planetside 2 used to be extremely unoptimized, and was the bane of all but high end cards; however, thanks to some recent optimizations, I am easily running a solid 60 frames on ultra settings with a single GTX 660
 As for the negatives, this game is very heavily reliant on team work
 If your faction, squad, and individual soldiers are not all on the same page, it can quite easily ruin battles
 My suggestion: form squads with your buddies, whip out your headset, and take command
 Overall, Planetside 2 is quite easily the most polished F2P shooter available on steam, perhaps even surpassing TF2
 If you have a computer that can handle it, definitely give PS2 a shot, it is worth it

												This is one of the most awesome FPS avaiable right now
Why? Let me tell you why!First of all, this is the biggest true MMoFPS right now, true - I mean - nearly 2000 players at once at one map, without any loading screens (appear only if you are at once spawning in cartain location), hundreds vehicles at once, epic battles where we can fight agaist 200 players with another 200 players on our side
Are you playing claustrophobic Call of Duty or small Battlefield? Well, this game isn't for you
Here you have 2000 players on the map, which has a size of 8 by 8 kilometers, it's much more than just small maps in CoD where 16vs16 is normal, or 32vs32 in BF
Here you have 500vs500, and such battles are kinda normal
Battle without any rounds, battlescreens, resets
Whole worlds is live and fighting 24h, all day and all night
Also this is pure F2P game - everything in the game you can test FOR FREE in Virtual Training mode
Everything, even 90% of premium gear
So, before ingame points transaction or before microtransations you can test everything as long as you want
Cool? Cool!How about pay-to-win or pay-to-play? Planetside 2 is one of most pure F2P shooters
Each weapon bought for $ has the same stats and the same modifications as its free counterpart
Even if you are 5 lvl and fighting in great battles this cool pre-unlocked weapon doesn't make you a god - this weapons ins't killing 50 enemies at once
And has just 50 people is a typical branch of the enemy squad in this game! FIRST SKILL, THAN P2P
Also, you can't buy any character perks for $ - only skill is something that determines whether you are good or noob
Three fractions
Three huge maps (8x8 km)
Near 2000 players per map
Hundreds of vehicles
48-players squads
No rounds
Free to Play
This game


is my dream
And dreams comes true!

												Alright, i think the game has been out long enough and panned out enough to write a propper review of it
Planetside 2 like the original is a First Person Shooter MMO
It is set on a world known as Axuraxis and battles are fought across 4 very very large continents
It has three factions, The Terran Republic which is the "Government" for say, loyalists and a professional army
Their guns and technology are all centered on speed over heavy damage and versitility
They possess the fastest Aircraft, Tanks, and guns in the game
The Second faction, The New Conglomerate, are a band of Rebels or so called Freedom Fighters
Their theme is that of a rebel band who used to be miners and workers who have repurposed their tools for weapons to fight the power
Their technology is focesed on Defense and Damage
They possess the Hardest hitting weapons and vehicles in the game at the cost of a considerable slower Rate of fire for their weapons and Slow movement for their vehicles  compared to the other 2 factions
The Third faction is The Vanu Soveirnty, Like the New conglomerate this faction is also a rebel faction that split off from the Terran republic
However, they do not fight for an idea of "freedom" like the NC does
These rebels have found left over alien technology on Auraxis and have converted them into their own use
They are much like a Cult, trying to spread "Truth and Enlightenment" to the other factions
Their faction is focused on Alien weaponry and Versitility
They do not do  quite as much damage as the NC nor are they as fast as the TR, but for that sacrifice they possess extremely versitile weapons and vehicles
Their Main Battle Tank the "Magrider" is a hover tank with the ability to strafe and scale mountains that the NC and TR's treaded counter parts simply can not do
The weapons they use are unique in how they fire, suffering from very little bullet drop like traditional firearms but as the cost of much more horizontal recoil or "Sway"
The game is a never ending Ground and Air war that is persistant
Unlike modern Shooters such as Battlefield or Call of Duty, there are no "Levels"
It is fought on a gigantic map, the battlefield changing each time you take a base and move to the next
It also offers the feeling of a "real" war
It is commonplace to find battles involving 200 or more people, hordes of infantry advancing across the landscape with Tanks behind them and Aircraft battleing above them
It is the only game of its kind to offer this unique experience of being part of a war and it is glorious
As for the bad parts of the game, It does unfortunately have a Cash shop and it does allow those who pay real money to unlock new weapons and abilities without earning the XP (or certs as they are called) to get them
However on a game with the scope of battles being on such a massive scale, you do not tend to notice this
There are no weapons that are "overpowered" and ruin the game because you dont want to spend real money
They are all rather suprisingly well balanced, each having their ups and downs
Luckily as well, unlike most Free to play games with a cash shop, it is very possible to progress and unlock items without spending a literal eternity to do it
Unlike other free to play games as well, it is by far one of the most beautiful and good looking shooters on the market
The Quality of its graphics and engine beg the question "why is this not a 60 dollar game like BF or CoD"
In all if you are looking to feel like you are part of a real war that actually matters and to experience what no other FPS to date has successfully captured, it is most certainly worth the download, if only to try it
Whether you like to be a shock trooper infantryman, a tanker, a dog fighter or even just a support role such as ferrying troops to the front line in a transport, this game has it for you
As Unbiasedly as possible 10/10, may the war never end

												So, it's been a while now, huh? I was a kid when Half-life was released, and of course, I've played it all through, maybe dozen of times
But only now, when I'm at the half-life age myself, with wife, two kids, a job where I need to speak to people ten hours per day


I finally got it
Every day when I don't need to speak seems as a blessing
So, people, cut your jokes about mouthless Gordon
He just choose the right job
But, there is always a price

Cons:-In a facility practically overflowing with deadly weaponry, only one scientist thought to actually arm himself
-I've become deathly paranoid about laboratories
Any time I'm in one, I start checking under the tables for headcrabs

												Half Life is a game that shocked the gaming industry back in 1998
It might've not been the first of its kind, but it was certainly one of the best
The graphics, inferior compared to today's photorealistic games, were still amazing when it came out
You play as Doctor Gordon Freeman, a scientist working for the mysterious Black Mesa corporation
After discovering an alien planet known as Xen, several experiments are conducted to bring back specimens from this new world
As you come to work one day, everything is normal- except for a test involving a teleportation to Xen, and a suspicious man in a suit warning about unforseen consequences
The team ignores this, and it would cost them nearly everything
The experiment fails, and all hell breaks loose as Xen creatures teleport into the Black Mesa facility, killing anyone and anything
You wake up, during the aftermath of this event
Determined to escape, you fight your way through the facility, all the way to Xen
To find out the rest, you have to play the game
And believe me, every single second of this game is worth it

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE 1: Related ContentAlso see my:Half-Life 2 ReviewHalf-Life: Opposing Force ReviewHalf-Life: Blue Shift ReviewBlack Mesa ReviewNOTE 2:I review games to help fellow gamers decide whether they should purchase a game or not
 With that said, although I consider Half-Life as a classical MASTERPIECE and possibly one of the greatest games of all time, I will still list down game mechanics from the past that some people may not enjoy today
Think of it like this: everyone enjoys flying modern-day commercial jets like the 747, but it doesn't mean however that everyone would like to fly in a DC-3 built in the 1940s despite it being labeled as the 'most significant transport aircraft' in history
INTRODUCTION:Half-Life is a narrative-driven linear first-person shooter (FPS) action game and is the debut (and signature) title of Valve
 Hailed as one of the greatest games of all time winning dozens of awards on release, Half-Life revolutionized the FPS genre in a way that no other title has done since Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake
This game has since been the industry standard on how to make a perfect FPS game which combines realistic gameplay, fun puzzles mechanics, a narrative-driven single-player experience with fast-paced multiplayer action
The game follows the story of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist working for the Black Mesa Research Facility that is involved in Weapons Development, Research on Teleportation Technology and occasional cloning of a Security Guard named Barney Calhoun
 When an experiment with an unknown alien crystal results in a catastrophic accident that opened a portal to an alien dimension named 'Xen', Gordon Freeman, wearing the H
E
V
Suit, must now travel across the entire Black Mesa facility to reach the Lambda Complex where he must enter a portal to Xen and kill the creature that is keeping the portal open for the alien invaders
Fight against Invading alien monsters and, at the same time, US Military operatives who are attempting to stop the invasion but is also trying to silence any surviving 'witnesses' of the Black Mesa incident
LEGACY OF HALF-LIFE (PROS):+ First FPS game to fully incorporate a Narrative-Driven story (as opposed to the industry standard of maze gallery shooters which was the Wolfenstein 3D / Doom mechanic)+ Excellent level designs+ Realistic combat mechanics (may be not as realistic now in 2015, but 17 years ago it was)+ Fun puzzles+ Great sound effects+ First FPS game to incorporate scripted sequences for its level transitions rather than cut-scenes+ Relatively advanced AI (back in 1998), with enemies actively dodging, tactically retreating and often times baiting you into an ambush
+ Fun fast-paced multiplayer action that set the foundations for Counter-Strike which started as a mere mod of Half-Life+ Mods; although Half-Life is not the first video game to be modded, it is the first to have several such mods become their own full games that still retain their Half-Life heritage+ Challenging difficulty modes (but this is a given since most old-school shooters were challenging)OLD GAME MECHANICS THAT NEW GENERATION OF GAMERS MAY NOT LIKE (CONS):- Perpetual sprint with optional walking by pressing “Shift” (as opposed to today's standard which is the reverse)- No objective tracker (players may forget what they were doing especially if they haven't played in a while)- Melee weapon needs to be equipped rather than bound to a hotkey (though CS:GO players won't have a problem with this)CONCLUSION:MASTERPIECE is the only word that best describes Half-Life in my opinion
 Although some of its mechanics may not necessarily be applicable in today's (2015) standard, the same can still be considered as part of its charm, much like how most of us still enjoy watching old-school movies and TV shows
WORTH IT?:MUST BUY AND MUST HAVE
I, however, do recommend you purchase the Half-Life Anthology if you already have Half-Life 2 but if you don't have it, get Half-Life Complete
ADDITIONAL INFO (Not necessary for the review):The advent of Half-Life was a turning point in gaming history, most notably, the First-person shooter genre
 Before this game, the only FPS standard to be followed was Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake, with the first two being plotless maze shooters and Quake being the first to implement a backstory but still retained the maze-like levels
With Half-Life, developers saw a potential for FPS games to combine intense action and gunplay with effective narrative story-telling through leniar levels (which is heavily abused by some FPS games today) and realistic game mechanics (a title, which most people agree, was held by the Metal Gear Solid franchise, a third-person action game)Let’s put this in an analogy: Wolfenstein 3D is the Wheel (basically invented the mainstream FPS genre), Doom is the Horse-Drawn Carriage (Doom made FPS games extremely popular, accessible and widespread), Quake is the Steam Engine (Quake bridge the gap between plotless maze shooters and  plot driven FPS games Credit: Steam User RGX12 for pointing this out) and Half-Life is the Ford Model T Car (Half-Life set the standard for modern day FPS games who's basic and essential features still survives today

												I remember watching gameplay during E3 2013 and thinking it looked like just another "generic FPS with the Wolfenstein brand slapped on"
Here I am a year later eating those words, as Wolfenstein: The New Order is most probably my game of the year for 2014
Serious Sam style over-the-top one-man-army gameplay that feels amazing, with a meaty arsenal of weapons (all of which can be dual-wielded) and a heavy reliance on health and armour pickups as opposed to health regeneration
The alternate post-WW2 setting is also incredibly well realised, with varied and interesting locales that stay interesting over the course of the games 8-10 hour length
 Not to mention the game's soundtrack featuring Nazi-fied versions of famous real world songs is worth a look on its own
Combined with a surprisingly well told story featuring characters that you'll actually care about (with special mention going to Brian Bloom's performance as BJ Blazkowicz) makes this the freshest single player FPS I've played this generation
Hands down
If you're even remotely interested in this game, pick it up
I hope you'll be as blown away as I was

												+ Partially destructible environments+ Absolutely jaw-dropping, stunning soundtrack; does wonders to set the mood and keep you immersed in the game+ Voice-acting was borderline flawless, and the dialogue superbly scripted+ Authentic German and other languages pervasive throughout the game+ Tons and tons of lore-friendly articles and collectibles throughout+ A hidden, Wolfenstein 3D minigame that almost deserves a review of its own accord; the nostalgia was overwhelming+ Interesting, creative, and lore-friendly weapon designs+ Facial animations, particularly the protagonist, were done very well and did much to convey the nuances of emotional expression+ So much attention to detail, in every respect+ Weapon customizations, while somewhat sparse, were a delight and really enriched the gameplay+ Developers really seemed to capture the feel of the Nazis, and really nailed the Nazi rhetoric in a way that felt authentic+ The narrative was well-delivered, meticulously thought-out, and shattered my expectations with an intense emotional depth+ Gunplay, melee, and stealth mechanics were all solid and well-designed (though, didn't sport much in the way of innovation)- There are times that you will lament the absence of an objective marker; easy to get turned around in some levels- Poor environmental textures- Moving down ladders is a massive hazard and a minor design flaw- Minor fetch quests in the Resistance's 'secret base' are good for enriching the plot and character developement, but could have been better implemented in that it noticeably breaks up the pacing of the game and felt tedious above all elseLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit

												If you played the first level - you will get that old Wolfenstein feeling back
And to be fair - no, its NOT that fun, It can be overwhelming to be thrown into the action from the start, and a bit exhausting cause "here we are again", killing Nazis and blowing up everything in our way
We've been there already
Its not a bad chapter, but it is slightly different than the rest of the game
ON PURPOSE
The real New Order actually starts after that level
Everything will change, the story, the characters, the tempo, Blasko himself, the timeline (14 years between 1st and 2nd level) and suddenly game will develop depth in every aspect
And that depth hasn't been seen in old Wolfie games at all
You will start to care for the story (it still is about Nazis dominating the world but hey you cant change that premise), you will develop the interest for the people around you, you will start to notice all the little pieces of information thrown around the levels, and you will see the narrative of the game going only upwards
Right until the end
And what an ending it is
The New Order tried and succeded  to tell us a story
It still is crazy fun to shoot and kill, but this time - it seems like there really is a bigger purpose
Shooting is great, stealth has its ups and downs, but overall - the flow is just right
One of the most overlooked games
Big recommendation

If that alone doesn't convince you to buy this game, Wolfenstein: The New Order has a great story, realistic graphics, and rewarding cutscenes

												Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is six hours of a prank getting out of hand
You play as B
J
, a man who's last name I can never spell right without looking it up
B
J
and his partner Wesley must sneak into Castle Wolfenstein and steal the documents that contain the location of Deathhead's compound
Unfortunately they didn't bring their lederhosen and steins so their cover was blown right away
B
J
and Wesley are imprisoned by the infamous Rudi Jager, the second in command to Helga Von Schabbs who is the leader of the SS paranormal division
But B
J
escapes with the help of a lead pipe and then once again goes on a rampage while reciting poetry because live journal hasn't been invented yet
Old Blood is a prequel to 'The New Order
' taking place in 1946, so you get to see more of that neat WW2 stuff that you only got a glimpse of during the prologue to the New Order
But because of that it feels kind of limited in what you can see save for a new enemy later on, but basically everything you saw in the prologue of The New Order is what you're going to be running into during Old Blood
Combat has always been Wolfenstein's strong point, for obvious reasons
Although there's an emphasis on stealth with basic but useful sneaking mechanics as well as the return of commanders that can bring in reinforcements with alerted
It sort of gets in the way of the gunplay in Old Fart
There's this weight of aggression and viciousness when fighting the angry men with stylish uniforms, where you have to think cautiously if you want to go on the offensive or stay on defense
But there are so many sequences where they encourage stealth, I just kind of started ignoring stealth just to get in some of that sweet sweet gun play
I suggest playing the game on Uber to get the full experience
It's not really all that hard, but it just forces you to play smarter, going out of your way to ambush and outmaneuver your enemy, it's obvious  that you'll get shot more the closer you get, mix that with the damage increase for Uber and you're basically risking getting punched in the face by a very upset Mike Tyson, except his fists are bullets and you are a baby
The game is shorter than the first, I got six hours out of it on the hardest difficulty, but it usually goes on sale
I mean I  Stole it from a sleeping man
 got it on sale
But if you're going to ask me
“Dirk, you handsome man with no flaws
Which one do I pick between New Order and Old Blood?” I would tell you to get New Order and also thank you for the compliment
It's not a bad game, but you'll get more bang for your buck if you get New Order instead, considering it's basically twice as long as Old Blood is
Hufflepuff: The Old Wizard, gets 7 large Aryan men speaking in poetry out of, I dunno, 8? Lincoln Logs were invented by Frank Lloyd Wright's son

												There's really not much to say here, but there's enough to bother writing a review
Ultimately, if you liked The New Order, you'll probably like this too, because it's basically the same formula, hence being a standalone expansion
If you didn't like The New Order, there's not a lot here to change your mind
If you don't know what Wolfenstein is at all (what are you, some kind of commie?), here's the scoop: You kill Nazis
Lots of Nazis
So many Nazis that there's a point in the game where Winston Churchill himself rises from his wheelchair, clad with sciencey robot legs, and goes "Damn, son, that's a lot of Nazis"
That doesn't actually happen (or at least I'm assuming it doesn't; if it does then screw Machine Games for stealing my idea before I thought of it, and I'm sorry for the spoilers), I'm just giving Machine Games ideas for the next Wolfenstein
The Churchill part, not the Nazis part
You really do kill a lot of Nazis
You can sneak past them, you can gun them all down, nobody really cares as long as you kill them all, and pick up some gold along the way because Nazis are well known for hiding their gold in sewer grates in their prison facilities
So what's the problem, then? That sounds great - how could any red blooded freedom fighter not like it? Well, the big issue is ID Tech 5
The thing about ID Tech 5 is that it was a fantastic concept for its time, allowing the underpowered PS3 and 360 to have decent looking textures by streaming them from massive single texture files with the idea that they could have unique textures for everything using that, instead of just repeating textures
For console owners, this meant RAGE was one of the better looking games on those platforms
The problem is, PC owners never had an issue with that, and even at the time of release of RAGE most games had generally better texture quality, because the megatexture approach ultimately means a sacrifice of quantity over quality for the sake of keeping file sizes down (not that it does much, since even this game is a whopping 30+ GB)
What this means for The Old Blood is that while the game is perfectly capable of producing beautiful graphics when it's in control of the situation, the moment you start looking around and admiring the scenery you start running into things like this, even on the highest possible settings
http://imgur
com/a/TqWFA Now, these aren't necessarily "bad" textures, they're just underwhelming, and they ultimately completely undermine the purpose of megatextures
The idea is presumably that since everything looks "unique", there's more incentive to look around and admire the scenery due to the added realism
But what's the point if everything you see when you go off the beaten path just looks like it's still using textures that were taken from Doom 3? Nevermind the fact that if you play this game in the stealthy way you inevitably end up spending a lot of time hiding behind walls, giving you plenty of time to notice just how crummy they look (and in the third screenshot with the switchbox, you're frequently forced to stand there in a fixed viewpoint holding the Use key until the door activates, forcing you to look at those textures no matter how you choose to play the game)
And despite the fact that the textures are so underwhelming, the game still has pretty bad performance issues, with people with GTX 970s and high-power processors struggling to meet 60 FPS (which the game is capped at, due to engine limits, from what I'm aware of - which is still rather silly since there are plenty of other engines that go well past made both before and after ID Tech 5)
I personally manage around 40-60 FPS most of the time on a GTX 970 and an i5 3570k OC'd to 4
4 GHz with the game running at the highest settings (pushed a little further, since for some reason even setting the game to Ultra doesn't fully activate some of the graphical functions), which is passable, but doesn't really seem necessary
Ultimately, the graphics in this game aren't anything that couldn't be done more or less in an engine like Unreal 3 or 4 with double the performance, and ID Tech 5 just seems like a total waste that's only still being used because they don't want to admit what a failure it is
Now that we've entered the PS4 and the Xbone generation, these textures aren't even that spectacular by console standards
I don't know what engine I would recommend instead, but anything but ID Tech 5 would be fine by me
In the end, this isn't a negative review, it's more of a rant
The game is still just as fun as it was in The New Order, and if you have the PC to handle it I would absolutely recommend it
But I really, really hate ID Tech 5 and I want it to die
It was awful in RAGE, it was awful in The Evil Within, it was awful in The New Order, and now it's still awful in The Old Blood

												Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is an adventure FPS game, developed by MachineGames, and then published by Bethesda
This game was released in early 2015 for PC, PS4 and Xbox One
It was released as a standalone expansion pack for Wolfenstein: The New Order, which was released in 2014
You play the role of a war veteran by the name of Blazkowicz, also known as B
J
 The game play has almost no changes from the New Order
You play through the game in the first person perspective, as you navigate through levels of Nazi bases, compounds and castles
As with The New Order, you have a health monitor, and armour monitors
You are able to increase these beyond their "Maximum" capacity by going into "Overload" mode, by collecting armour scraps and health packs which are scattered around all of the levels
The Old Blood includes all of the weapons found in the first game, and the return of your trusty pipe
I really enjoyed that this game allows you to take a stealthy approach to a few of the levels if you so desired to; although that's not usually the Wolfenstein way
The badass mechanic of being able to dual wield certain weapons makes a return too, I just love carrying around two assault rifles, there is literally nothing more daunting than that for an enemy I can imagine
 Also as with the New Order, as you progress through the game you will unlock perks as rewards for completing certain challenges, for instance one of the challenges requires you to kill a specific amount of enemies with your assault rifle, once you do, you are rewarded with being able to carry more ammunition for the weapon, I find this to be a really interesting way of being able to upgrade your character without leaving the player to have to do it themselves - and also encourages the player to maybe change their play style a little bit too
The graphics in The Old Blood are identical to The New Order, it's made in the same engine, and the realistic graphics are stunning, sadly though, we still have the same problems with texture poppins
All of the enemy soldiers are really nicely designed; the lighting is perfect throughout the whole game
 The story is a prequel to The New Order, you are sent on a mission to infiltrate Castle Wolfenstein to obtain a document which has the location of General Wilhelm in it
You meet some intriguing characters along the way; one of my favorites would have to be the German brute, Rudi
This game sets up The New Order if you want to play them chronologically, but really I still felt the full effect of the story playing them in the order that they were released
 There is also an element of decision making in some of the scenes too; the games gives you choices as to who lives and who survives as you progress further - something which a lot of FPS games miss
The Old Blood is fully voice acted with the same actors as the original game; you cannot fault any of it, it's just very well done
It was a little bit of a shame when doing a stealth mission that enemy guards don't really pay any attention to any noise you make when moving around though
I found the game to be pretty easy when playing on the medium settings; the hardest level I found to get past, would have to be level one, there is a huge amount of stealth involved, and you have to time everything perfectly or else you just get wrecked
I was quite surprised that they started out on such a high difficulty, but once you get past that level, there isn't any real tough parts to the game, the gun play is simple to get a hang of, and you'll be slaughtering Nazi’s with ease by the last levels
 However, there are options to ramp up the difficulty to absurd amounts, something which people may want to try out if they are FPS veterans
All of the levels in The Old Blood have various ways of traversing and progressing throughout
There are also a large amount of collectibles to find, and plenty of documents, letters, and other little bits of interactive items to discover which adds another level of story and lore to the game
I was also happy to see a couple of Easter eggs included in the game too
You are able to explore pretty much everywhere on most levels, and there is reason to, whether it be for the above mentioned collectables, extra ammo or health packs (because you WILL need them)
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood only took me just under four hours to complete; granted this is a standalone expansion; and isn't actually priced as a full release title, I was still a little unhappy that it was only four hours long
However, there is a lot of replay ability in the fact that you can ramp up the difficulty; and you may even just want to start the game on a higher difficulty since you can always drop it down should you start hitting a brick wall - that may well get you another few hours out of it; and also if you start hunting for the achievements and collectables, you may be able to get around ten hours of content from this game
I had no major technical problems, but even my rig was not able to churn out this game on full settings on a 4k resolution
I dropped it down to 1080 and stuck the settings on full and was able to get a steady 60 FPS most of the time
There were moments where it dropped to around 50 fps in some scenes, however this is to be expected with the quality of graphics and how much it had to render such as water/underwater scenes
 There are a few guides online as to how configure the settings to get the best graphical display in comparison with performance which you should check out, since this game is a demanding one on your rigs
To sum up, I had a lot of fun whilst playing The Old Blood; it does a lot of things right, much like The New Order and I really cannot wait to see what this series has next
The only downside I feel was the length of the story, so if you can pick this game up on sale, you have a real must buy, however I am still going to recommend it because it is just more of the same good stuff from the previous game
FPS fans should not miss out on this series reboot
Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up

												Well Had to beat the whole game in one sitting because when i tried to exit, the game called me a weenie


 in general such an awesome game
10/10			
Posted: 8 May, 2015
												The Old Blood is a standalone title that is a prequel to the 2014's Wolfenstein: The New Order
It can be considered by some an "expansion pack", but the DL size alone (almost 40 GB)  and fair length for its price point makes it a worthwhile purchase, especially if you enjoyed The New Order
If you're reading this and haven't played TNO, it's perfectly fine to play this first
There are no repeat levels from New Order and its an entirely new experience
On the 3rd highest difficulty (out of 5), it took me 7 hours to complete the main campaign
I did not find all the collectibles, have not touched a challenge mode, and did not complete all Nightmare levels
I reckon I can get 10-20 hours out of this game and even longer if I decide to play on "Uber"
Pros:+ More New Order style gameplay
+ Challenge mode adds replayability
+ Technologically  and artistically sound
Graphics, sound, voice acting, music, are all well done
+ Nightmare levels are a great homage to the roots of the series
+ Level design is smart and encourages exploration
+ Stealth mechanics allow more options than just guns blazing
+ A fair challenge
Excellent FPS mechanics
+ Memorable characters
Cons:- Enemies are samey
- While the stealth approach options are welcome, it lacks some fine tuning
- End boss is kind of cliche and an annoying fight, not b/c of challenge, stylistically speaking
If you have not played/do not own The New Order, I would recommend picking this up in a package deal along with it
TNO is in my top 3 games of 2014 and while I can't see myself ranking this that high for 2015, its a great additional chapter to that story

												EDIT: Killing Floor 2 is now fully released
I've been playing Killing Floor for years and it is without a doubt one of my favourite games here
+ The combat and carnage is unparalleled: explosions, dismemberment, and headshots look and sound great+ The class and perk system is incredibly robust: classes have unique roles, pros/cons, levelling is addictive+ Huge variety of weapons and maps adds a ton of replayability+ Best free seasonal updates of any game out thereFair warning, this is a skill-based game and it is difficult
Newcomers should start on Normal difficulty to learn the ropes and have fun
Playing on Suicidal and Hell On Earth requires a lot of experience, working as a team, and in-depth knowledge of game mechanics
For many people however - myself included - this is the real draw of the game
If you put in the time, playing on HoE with 5 other experienced players all working together is some of the most fun you can have online
There is also nothing more exhilarating than being the last one alive on Wave 10 knowing your entire team is watching and relying on you to stay alive
Highly recommended
			
Posted: 20 April, 2014
												In my 40 years of video game experience I feel Killing Floor is one of the best FPS games ever made
   The depth of the game is great
 As much as the game focuses on multiplayer  and teamwork and the game shines in those respects

the solo side of the game is perfectly balanced to make it a great experience also
       As you progress in difficulty the money gets less and it becomes harder to make sure you have the weapons you need when you need them, but as you progress in level your weapons become cheaper and more powerful
 The enemy is varied and as you get in higher difficulties you need to develop the tactics to take the tough ones down safely
 Many tactical skills can  be employed beyond defending one area and who is best suited to kill what depending on choice of class
 Situational tactics like target priority and when to run and how to "kite", knowing when you come round a corner to come face to face with a crowd of enemy, just what ones you want to smack once and keep going, kill outright or just keep on keepin' on
  Add to that an active modding community with extra maps, game types, mod weapons, games and modded monsters


free for download
     Not that you have to play it that serious either, many people just find a level they are happy with and just kill stuff for fun


that is one of the great things about the game 


you can play it at any level you desire, but the challenge is there if you seek it
      Things I see as a big plus
            NO PvP  - you will not get "spys" or cheaters spoiling other peoples fun
 There is one modded game type GunGame that is Player vs Player, but the normal game dose not
             NO set enemy spawns, in games like some of the ghost recon type games, splinter cell types is that once you figure out a way it gets boring and tedious
 This game is a complete open environment and the enemy can spawn just about anyplace in relation to player position, so even a game played the same way can have different combinations of enemy at any one time
     For reference, other games I consider top notch FPS  -  Unreal Tournament, Quake 3 and Team Arena, BF2142   I consider Killing Floor better than them all
 2000 hours in 6 months speaks for itself



along with 600 hrs in the free SDK making new maps
  If you like FPS and don't own it, you owe it to yourself to get it
 I have spent $1000's over the years on games that were little better than drink coasters


the money I spent on this game has been the best entertainment value of my life!!edit - as of Nov 2015 3000 hours in game and 2000 hours in the SDK with 36 workshop submissions, most of those original new maps
 An additional 1000 hours on alt accounts for map testing
  Even with KF2 out this game is still well worth getting!Nov 23 2016 Nominated for "Test of Time" award

												Don't usually comment or write reviews, but when a game is this old and still brings out free content u have to give them credit, in today's sad monetized gaming industry of Season passes, online passes, launch day dlc, early access, etc
I got into KF pretty late, around couple yrs ago
The first 5 mins I thought this is the biggest pile of crap I've ever purchased
Graphics are ugly, wave after wave in the same smallish map?!?! Why on earth are ppl still playing this game? I put it in my trash list
The following day I had a strange urge to try it again, for whatever reason I don't know
I soon realised this game is not about arcadey run n shoot n regen health bs
This game's depth is about u as a team player and improving yr skills to take on bosses and tight situations
Reading the danger signs, when to run when to hold ground
You won't suddenly level up and get a powerful weapon, u only progress with improving yr gameplay
The weapon mechanics are simply amazing
WARNING: after playing with no aim cursor and using only ironsights all other cursor games will suck
Then there is the community made content
More guns, maps, zeds, bosses




I have over 1500hrs entertainment time and I only paid $5
I think I bought some dlc just to support devs but its not enough for what they've achieved
I don't usually buy newly released games, the ones I've bought I've regret
But when KF2 comes out



just take my money, take it
Please
TLDR: Buy the game
There's not many devs that care about their product

												After playing a total of 126 hrs, I could honestly say this is my favorite zombie FPS style game
The game is incredibly fun and takes strategy to master, especially when attempting to play on the Hell on Earth difficulty
New weapons and free maps come out frequently which help keep the game interesting but being charged to own the latest and greatest weapon packs can be a bit of bummer

Like all zombie based games, it tends to become repetitious
Luckily, having the option to increase the difficulty, play objective modes, and strive for seasonal achievements gives players more challenges/options to keep the interest in playing alive
 If I had to rate the game, I would rate it a 9
5/10

With a very good amount of achievements, maps, weapons and enemies
Great game to play with friends
I strongly advise to buy it, this game will give you thousands of hours of fun

"Probably the best zombie co-op shooter out there"Temporarly placed between Left4Dead and Left4Dead2 it shows up permanently improved graphics, maps, skins and weapons
It has a great fan community and is still evolving nevertheless KF2 is already been announced
The main difference to L4D is the concept not to fight some hordes, but just a certain amount of 9 different special infected (ZEDs) each of the 10 waves on the same map
Then comes the Boss called the patriarch which is incredible stronger and send some of his children for support
Your character is improvable by long time playing measured in 7 different perks
So you will achieve mastery in many different ways after a while
That doesn't mean your personal player skills are not needed
Instead you must begin to analyze the ZED mechanics in higher difficulties and how the perks work perfectly together
There are 2 ways: Camping  or Kiting to beat the maps
Camping means holdout in a tight place and withstand all over the waves the ZEDs
Kiting means running in circles on a route and takeout one ZED after another
Kiting is more time intense but could be also more fun
The kill animations are absolutely great (at least in the uncut version)
Heads are exploding, can be decapitivated
Burning them bodies with flamethrower (firebug) let them coal
 Demolitian has pipebombs and blow up everything that comes to close
On the other side some Zeds have a rage mode where they don't stop chasing you until they killed you
It's totally challenging and depends on the whole team skills if you survive or not
There's a high amount of 280 Achievements atm
Still raising at each seasonal event
You have to await these events to unlock them all
Each map has 4 map achievements from "normal" to "hell on earth", KFO - interesting objective maps, some kill achievements and special gimmicks, unlockable new character and Tripwire cross game supporting achievement policy
All fun
One little negative is the complex server browser in MP which confuses in the first moment
But after a while you will get used to it
Don't miss this great game that isn't still boring after 1k hours playtime
(helping some friends with achievements)
I recommend you to buy somekind of complete pack in order to get a whole bunch of the most important DLC guns and skins included
It just cost you a little more
 I know, some people swear L4D2 is even better and more atmospheric
But you can try to be the master in both games

Pros-Cheap-Easy to complete 100% Game now has many difficult achievements-Steam integration for easy multiplayer with friendsCons-Repetitive-Recycled bosses-Unskippable dialogue/cinematics Devs have listened and changed this in an update, thanks! SummaryTo be honest you're probably not going to get much better for the price, and for the first 2 or so hours, this game is pretty damn fun
However, after day ~50, it starts to go downhill
It just feels like the game drags on and on, and you begin to see the same establishing shots of the same map far too many times, and the farmer starts repeating himself
A lot
Probably best played in short bursts
EDIT: Just nominated this game for "Best use of a farm animal" in the Steam awards, can't think of a game more deserving!

I remember 2 of my favorite servers: RUSSIA,NL
ZOMBIES
I remember when I only came up with his nick - Killer!!!
Oh there was a time, of course
As on many servers it was hard to connect
For they were Packed,people played for days in this game
Now online on the servers fell
There are almost no people
I remember the night Kachi(raising the level)
As we if I am not mistaken 4 one player raised 30 levels per night
Oh it was the best time I've ever spent

Black Female Nazis are not included
Basically, this is what Call of Duty should've returned to with its release of Call of Duty: WW2
Fantasic game! Basically, you play out three stories in one Campaign; Soviet (1941-1943), British (1942-1944), and American (1944-1945)
This game is more historically accurate than Sledgehammer's promiseThis game is what Call of Duty is all about
This is coming from a fan that his first COD wasn't MW or BO2, but was Call of Duty: Finest Hour on GameCube back in 2004
Pros:No supply dropsNo PC bull****No Exo suitsNo KillstreaksNo mircotransactionsNo DLC'sNo whiny 12 year oldsNo Black Female NazisCons:Multiplayer is not so active

												Honestly, it's good
It's a nice blasty shootmonster game for people with decent computers
Athough it doesn't outright replace the original game (it's still too much the same to) it's a solid and faithful sequel - to the point where it too gets repetitive after prolonged play
Even if everything is shinier and faster, it still keeps to the KF spirit
It's not quiiiiite as tactical as the first game, since the pace of gameplay is quite faster and the maps are generally narrower
It is however much, much smoother and pleasing to the eye, as they traded the grimy, groundhouse horror aesthetic of the first game for a more shiny, sci-fi look
Every character has a unique voice now too, and there's actually more characters who aren't stodgy, corny British men this time around
People kvetched about cosmetic items and crates when they were first introduced but they're not really a problem; you can ignore them, or you can buy a couple cheap items off the community market that suit your fancy


or you can buy keys and open crates
Hey, game development isn't cheap anymore
There's two things I could really complain about
The Survivalist perk is supposed to be a jack-of-all-trades, but it isn't really that good as a result
They also reuse assets on multiple maps, which would be fine if the game wasn't aiming to be so detailed, because said assets don't fit every map they're in
Italian warning signs in a Texian embassy, Danish banners pleading for help in the middle of Paris, that sort of thing
Still, developers Tripwire Interactive are committed to supporting and expanding the game for years to come, so I can overlook one or two relatively minor mistakes

Early Access Review
								+ Improved FPS mechanics from RO2 onwards+ Melee combat completely reworked (somewhat in the vein of Chivalry)As a Berserker with 37+ mil exp (and 700+ KF1 hours in total), even this small selection of KF2's new features were everything I could have wanted from a KF sequel and more
It's pretty telling of the industry when a Beta (with a currently modest amount of content) feels more substantial and polished than most of the "AAA" games of last year
			
Posted: 21 April, 2015
Early Access Review
Return of the Patriarch + Microtransaction thoughts below the review!It's been a long time coming, and was it worth the wait? Oh yes, it was
I loved the first Killing Floor, so I was very excited to see a second one
While I normally do not buy into these early access titles, how could I say no to Tripwire?So, let's get started
The GameplayAt the writing of this review, there is currently 4 classes with about 4 weapons for each, as well as a few off-perk weapons like the Katana or the Flamethrower
You can use ANY weapon at any time, just like the first
The weapon you use will give you points for that class, so say you have a medic pistol with a commando rifle? You will be able to rack up points for medic using the healing function whilst using the rifle to earn yourself the commando points
ZED time is still prominant, and it is so, so satisfying
The visuals will run into a sin-city like look, with only red standing out amongst the black, gray and white filtered backgrounds and characters
Most weapons have a reasonably large amount of kick, but this further emphasizes the need to have trigger discipline
What makes it different from the first?At the moment, you can see the obvious
The graphics upgrade, the animations, and of course the enviroment designs
However, in this game there are tons of small things that all compile into what sets this game apart
You can shoot out lights, blood is persistent, and there are TONS of different animations, both for players and zeds
Enemies flinch when shot, and it varies heavily on what weapon you are using
Shooting a clot in a shoulder with a pistol will only make him flinch a tiny bit, but upping the ante and shooting him in the chest with a rifle will cause him to violently flail backwards and nearly lose his balance
You can shoot off several parts of their body, head wounds will start small and slowly wear their flesh away until there is only a meaty remnant that looks nothing like what it once did until that satisfying head pop
Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING feels much more alive and less clunky than the first, from the reload animations to the death animations
Should you buy into it?At it's current state, it's hard to say
You will get 4 perks and limited weaponry, with only 3 maps to spare
As it stand, there is much more content in the first game
However, if you buy into the early access, you are not only supporting Tripwire, but you give yourself a chance to watch this game bloom
You get to experience a game that has lots of love in it, and you can see that Tripwire cares about this game
Yes, it has bugs
Yes, there are glitches
No, there is no buyers remorse from me
If you expect a full game, you may want to lower your expectations, but this is certainly not a bad way to start off a early access game
The CharactersWow
You have about 10 characters at the moment, including a female one
These characters are all unique, and have their own voices
They will talk a LOT, and this is not a bad thing
They will call out ammo, kevlar, and weapons
They will talk to each other with idle banter whilst you're shopping at the trader, and they will also pitch a few jokes
There are a few stereotypes, but it adds to the quirky and goofy traits they all have, and they even have things you can add to them, like gas masks or face masks
You can also change their clothing colour, hair colour and a few other neat features absent in the first game
The ZedsThere are 3 different clots, and so far I don't see much of a difference between them
However, they behave much like the same game, spare their animations
They will oftentimes hold you just as that gorefast is charging, or the fleshpound is roid raging
The gorefasts move fast, and are tall hulks that you do NOT want to get close to
The siren is short and blends into groups, often hiding behind clots or bigger enemies
The stalkers are nearly invisible, and are disturbingly quiet
The skrakes and fleshpounds make roars when they enter, that strikes that scene of "oh no" into you
And the final boss is HARD
This game makes the zeds feel more alive than ever, and I love every second of it
My final thoughtsAll in all, this game is a newborn
It shows promise, and it has loving parents, as Tripwire has shown itself to be
I can see this game becoming just as, if not more, of a classic game as the first one
The game feels much smoother, much faster paced, and it has a few moments in it that will make you jump and scream when that clot turns you around and holds onto you as a fleshpound is nearing you
I would highly reccomend this, even to those who like to wait to see if early access games grow at all
Time will tell, but I firmly believe in Tripwire
8/10, at it's current state, with the only thing bringing it down is the lack of weaponry and classes, however both of which have been promised to have their numbers bolstered, so this review will be updated as the game grows
Return of the PatriarchWell, this has been interesting
A new class, an in-game store, skins and crates all kind of thrown all in
Maybe I haven't been playing this game enough, but I'm going to change that
So, with that said, let's move on
The PatriarchI'll just say right off the bat that this guy isn't as tough as I thought he would be
His attack range isn't as amazing on easier difficulties and will generally tend to focus on the group rather than a single person, making his kill potential relatively lower than Hans
He still uses his signature stimpacks to survive after a certain amount of damage is taken, and still only has three
It seems with each one he takes, the health he gains is less than before, which doesn't make him insanely strong
However, he cloaks a lot more often than the Patriarch from the first game, but is also extremely loud when he moves, making it relatively easy to pinpoint a location as a non-commando player
Furthermore, just because he is easier, does not mean he is not fun to play against
I have had countless laughs against the Patriatch with friends from his sometimes erratic behavior and his obsession with getting right in your face before unlcoaking
I believe he could do with some buffing, though, to bring him a bit more onto terms with Hans
GunslingerA pistol enthusiasts dream, what more could you want? The Gunslinger has a wide array of weapons, though this is mostly because every weapon he can buy has a dial wield function
Two deagles, revolvers, or 1911's? Oh, the choices
He is a relatively mobile class that enjoys the benefits of being able to harvest weak zeds very easily, and using the stacks he earns from farming these smaller zeds to tackle the bigger ones with tons of damage
Plus he has style in his reloads, so go give him a try already
The MicrotransactionsOh boy
Anyone else remember Payday 2? Neither do I
In the wake of Payday 2's rather controversial move to introduce microtransactions into the game, Tripwire has done the same, and this community outcry has been quite large
However, let us remember that the first game also had similar marketing, just in the form of DLC packs for skins
Skins, people, skins that don't give any stat boosts or mobility, just make your character stand out a bit more
While I do agree that releasing these micros in the aftermath of the Payday incident, I do not believe that we should be reacting as harshly as we are
Let us remember that Tripwire has yet to release any weapons OR characters that we have had to pay for, and that they have done this practice in the past with the first Killing Floor
tldr; Do I think they should have released them when they did? No
Should they even be in the game? Sure
Do I forsee this getting out of hand? No

Out of all the things my sister and I did, this is the strongest memory

												Great game, You said Battlefield? You said COD? You said CSGO?pfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff


I can prove you then when you say that these games are best
Can you launch your games on a laptop with Intel Atom? Nooo
If you do not have new hardware, these games can fail to start, and even if it does, you may feel discomfort with your FPS
You said 30 FPS is normal? No
To play FPS shooter and not feel discomfort in the game you need AT LEAST 60 FPS
Ok? you can say that I haven't money for a new processor, graphics card
ButYou said about great graphics and physics
If you often play in FPS shooters, you can know how quickly action happening on the screen
You say that you can enjoy the graphics during your play? I am no because it really everymilisecond action
Ok that's not problem
What happens if you want to play a shooter with your friends when you travel or in camp?I don't know how you setting the Peer-to-peer network to play Battlefield :DFor this game it's easy to connect
So are you still doubt that the game is cool? Than buy it and try, also rep my recommendation :DYou can also write me to offer me to buy game which you like and I write a review

There was a time where snipers camped and didn't run around quick scoping
There was a time where submachine gunners ran around and didn't camp in corners
There was a time where thermal scopes didn't exist and smokes actually did someting
There was a time where tanks roamed the battlefield and dominated over everyone
There was a time where 2-3 bullets actually killed you instead of 10-12
There was a time where shotguns weren't OP
There was a time where 12 year olds didn't sleep with your mom
There was a time where squeakers didn't dominate over people
There was a time where trolls didn't anger over-sensitive people

Remember how you could play as a US soldier in Japan and a Soviet in the Eastern Front? Remember when Gary Oldman voiced Reznov? Remember how brutal it was to see Japs and Krauts getting blown up and seeing their body parts fly around? Remember how it had a good story, likable characters and a awesome soundtrack? Remember how you would listen to the Russian Theme over and over again? That is World at War

 Unique and memorable setting combining modern age and medieval times
There's not an ounce of happiness in this universe, just demon organs and especially brutal weapons
Grotesque and dark levels look and feel depressing, filled with monsters and very high speed gameplay
Quality shooter that was a step up from the already magnificient Doom
 World of Quake I still don't know do i like the world of this game or not
It's raw, the levels look all the same
A human military base at the beginning of each episode which houses a portal that takes us to medieval-themed levels
Castles and temples filled with secrets and monsters that kill you in matter of seconds
All my "problems" with this game are just in the overall look of the game, and they're just preferences
This world just isn't my thing, everything else is spot-on, though the lore is a bit too similar to Doom
Instead of hell, this time we're facing a mysterious hostile creature codenamed "Quake", and his army
Levels are again like mazes with their complex layouts, filled with secrets
4 episodes featuring 7-8 levels consisting of clever level design, arena-like open areas and tight, twisty corridors, underwater areas, jumping traps and various enviromental traps
If you have played the original Dooms, you have an idea about the levels
It's just taken a bit further here
Every episode has a secret level, accessed through a certain secret from the normal levels
Secret levels also have some distinct gameplay mechanics, like low gravity
One fun thing about choosing the difficulty that i have to mention: Instead of choosing it from the menu while starting a game, we begin the game by facing three portals labelled easy-medium-hard
But there's a fourth one, the hardest difficulty is actually hidden
I always found it a fun remark, you're already facing a puzzle even trying to find how to play game in the hardest possible difficulty
Whoever came up with that, my hat is off to you, sir
My itchy trigger finger Gameplay itself is fantastic! Especially on the harder difficulties the enemies put up a good fight (but not enough, since they're all dead now!)
Controls respond tightly and weapons offer a lot of variety
Every weapon is needed, you won't survive with just running around with the machine gun, err, the nail gun i mean
Like in Doom(s), the ammo is scarce, that alone forces you to use different weapons all the time
No regenerative health, no covers, only skill
Remember watch out with your grenade launcher, they really do bounce off from walls
Easy to clear corners with and even easier to commit a suicide, especially in hectic moments
Overall the weapons feel brutal and powerful, making the action feel fun and enjoyable to play
 The aforementioned nail gun for example
It's a completely different thing to fire a submachine gun compared to an high powered nail gun spitting out big sharp nails
As a melee weapon we have an axe and the lightning gun is amazing
Mowing down the hordes as the BFG does, if not even faster
Blast from the shotgun sound and feel heavy, nails hurt and grenades devastate everything around them
Bosses are also a bit different, there's usually a certain mechanic involved rather than purely shooting them to death
There isn't those epic fights with a boss in this game, they're over quick and usually they're just standing still
Another thing that i'm having mixed feelings about
It's very anti-climax when you finally reach the boss after slaying hordes of demons, but on the other hand, it's a nice twist and something else than the usual shootout

I played this through Zdoom, and with graphical mods
It's old, the vanilla looks horrible
It didn't look that good even back then
So do yourself a favor and get the  graphical mods if you play this
Should you buy it? YES! it's one of the classics that defined modern shooters

												The game itself gets all thumbs up, it's a true classic and one of the best games of all time
You don't get this sort of frenzied action and complex level design anymore, and it's wonderfully dark and gloomy
The soundtrack, made by Nine Inch Nails in the Downward Spiral era, is absolutely fantastic, one of the best soundtracks of all time, incredibly dark and eerie
The graphics look outdated to say the least, but that CD soundtrack didn't age a day, quite the contrary
Alone, the game's darkness can't really impress anymore, but with the soundtrack it really comes to life
And there's the problem
This Steam version comes without the soundtrack
It doesn't even have any
Selling Quake without its epic soundtrack is ridiculous, because it's such an important part of it
I haven't seen any well visible warning on the store page that informs you about this, so it's borderline fraud
There seem to be workarounds if you are willing to download it from the internet (probably illegal)
But the as-is version sold here gets a BIG thumbs down

Quake (Original) Rating = 10/10
Quake (Steam Port) Rating = 5/10 (Due to missing soundtrack)
That aside, how Quake beats modern games:Quake doesn't cost $59
00USD for ROW and $89
99USD for Australia
Quake doesn't entail a 100Gb+ Download, even when it's purchased from retail stores
Quake doesn't start with dozens of unskippable dev/publisher/external studio/hardware manufacturer/proprietary technology logos
Quake doesn't have unskippable & useless tutorials (Press "FIRE" to kill bad guys
 Press "JUMP"  to jump, etc)
Quake isn't a lazy console port, with no settings, 720p lock, 30FPS lock & poor/no optimization
Quake's expansion packs are not Multi-Player only
Quake's main content isn't locked away behind DLC paywalls
Quake supports Keyboard and mouse and doesn't "Require" a console controller to play, as the devs took PC players into account, rather than being purely console centric
You don't get a hallway level split up with dozens of pointless cutscenes (which are usually 30FPS pre-rendered cutscenes with audo/video desync issues, and bloat the games filesize)
You can explore instead of getting the "you are leaving the mission area" warning with 10 second countdown to mission failure, when you so much as look off the beaten path
Quake doesn't require 3rd party game clients pairing with Steam (like Uplay)
Quake isn't laden with as many forms/versions of intrusive, anti-consumer  DRM the greedy publishers can think of, which the filthy pirate scum bypass in less than a week, leaving the legit customers to wrestle with the tons of bundled crapware, causing instabilities, hogging valuable resources, straining hardware and increasing the game's system requirements to run
Quake's best weapons don't require paid DLC to access
No massive EULA, all in legal jargon to skim through, and having no choice but to either accept all terms unconditionally, or not play at all
 Effectively selling your soul to the publisher and only renting the game instead of owning your copy
In Quake, you are not hampered by dumbass NPC's that walk into your gunfire triggering a mission fail, because "Friendly Fire will not be tolerated!"
And thank god for all of that!!!https://www
youtube
com/watch?v=W1ZtBCpo0eU*Note: This video is not mine, and not from my Youtube Channel
 It is a great analogy of what would happen if Quake was made today and is worth watching
 Kudos to the people that made this video!Use the ultimate Quake patch to restore the music
 A word of warning if you are Australian
Getting caught downloading the soundtrack will land you on a piracy charge
 This is  because the Australian Federal Government is butthurt about Australia being labeled the number one country on earth per-capita for piracy and copyright infringement
 Turnbull and the LNP are bending over for the the MPAA and RIAA by nullifying "Fair use" exemptions, monitoring and retaining data from Australian IP's, blocking Websites & P2P Ports in an ever increasing amount, and making examples of those busted with extremely aggressive prosecution tactics, and insanely high sentences
Use a VPN and change your DNS on your router (to 8
8
8
8 and 8
8

4 respectively), if downloading the Quake soundtrack in Australia
As I, myself am Australian I can't link the Ultimate Quake Patch here in this review

Probably best Far West-shooter everCall of Juarez: Gunslinger is the fourth installment in a series of shooters dedicated to the Far West, developed by the excellent Polish team Techland and distributed by Ubisoft
Well, some may argue it's only the third real Call of Juarez game, since the previous one, Call of Juarez: The Cartel, did have a rather different and more modern-day background
As The Cartel did not get a particularly positive reaction, many thought the series had went off-track
But they were far from the truth: with Gunslinger, Techland has for me made not only the best game in the series, but probable the best Far West-shooter ever
A bold statement, so let me explain in detail
The concept of the game is original and well thought-off
You play as the bounty-hunter Silas Greaves, who tells his story in a Far West-saloon to a bunch of regular customers
As his story unfolds, it soon becomes clear Silas has a penchant to exagerrate some parts of it, which is why his  story is more and more questioned by his audience
This idea of "truth or false" is cleverly catched upon by the collectible items that are to be found throughout the game
These "nuggets of truth" give a fairly detailed amount of information on the history of the Far West, its main protagonists and some lesser-known historical facts
 The entire game provides prove of the love of Techland's crew for this setting: every bit of it, from the very easy to manage menu's right up to the credits, bathes in a unique Old West-style
There are countless references to the history of 19th-century America, and to the influence this period had on later arts such as literature and, ofcourse, movies
As for the actual gameplay: it leans more towards an arcade shooter than towards a tactical or realistic game
There is a fair arsenal of weapony, each with some characteristics of their own, but most enemies go down easily and swiftly
What makes the shooting really fun, is the idea of the "combo": whenever you manage to shoot several enemies in a row, a multiplier comes into play, so that your experience-points go up that much faster
Getting one more kill in a row so becomes a goal of its own
Since experience-points are connected to a clever system of levelling-up and gaining interesting skills, getting longer kill-streaks soons becomes a true challenge
Added to these are two special effects: bullet-time, triggered by special shots like headshots or piercing shots, and the "sense of death", which allows you to dodge bullets at the last moment
Boss fights come in two types: normal ones against more powerful foes, but also as typical Old West-duels, in which a totally different method of playing is needed
These feel a bit trial-and-error at first, but after some practice, still can provide their share of the fun
And they provide great links to several Westerns, starring the great Hollywood-heroes of decades ago
Graphically, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger is very good-looking
The game uses a comics-style with cel-shaded graphics, loosely comparable to the Borderlands-series
Enemy-animations are fairly standard, and enemies don't come in that much varieties
However, these are minor criticisms, since the game comes at a very acceptable price, although it has the scope and content of a true AAA-title
After finishing the main story (which took me about 8 hours), there's a New Game Plus-mode, very useful to collect the XP needed in order to unlock all of the skills, and a True West-difficulty, in which most of the HUD is disabled
Very entertaining is the Arcade-mode, in which ten of the games' maps can be replayed with as sole objectivity to get as much points as possible by making very long kill-streaks
Since the Steam-integration also comprises global leaderbords, tihs is great fun as I tried to get up the rankings a bit
Gameplay: 26/30Graphics: 17/20Sound: 8/10Technical stability: 9/10Longelivety: 8/10 (thanks to the several difficulty-levels and the Arcade mode)Steam Integration: 10/10 (really perfectly done, with a great bunch of achievements that let you discover several special aspects of the game - and do try to collect all of the "nuggets of truth"!)Personal appreciation: 10/10 (I just LOVE this game)Overall score: 88/100Call of Juarez: Gunslinger is one the best games I've yet played this year
It's a great, arcade-type shooter, with much more content hidden just below the surface
It's unique low-price makes this a must-buy!			
Posted: 30 November, 2013
												A fun Western-themed FPS that doesn't take itself too seriously
Good graphics, lots of action, sneaky AI, historical "Nuggets of Truth" and a bit of good ol' humor to round out the play! Playing through several versions of the same scenario was another unique feature of this game
Definitely worth it!

BITESIZE:SIMILAR TO: n/aWHAT TO EXPECT: Western themed FPS
 AAA comicbook style graphics
Great story
 Amazing voice-overs
 Three game modes
 Singleplayer only
 Slow-mo mechanic
Skill-trees
ACHIEVEMENTS: DIFFICULT
But rewarding
STATUS: COMPLETE
WHEN TO BUY:  A DECENT SALE
More info below



THE LOWDOWN:Call of Juarez Gunslinger is a western themed FPS with a story-driven campaign and, arcade and dueling modes
 You take on the role of Silas Greaves a cowboy turned bounty hunter who must take on an assortment of robbers, thieves and legendery outlaws in order to track down and kill the gang responsible for murdering your brothers
 A deeply immersive story links together fourteen campaign levels, with high production value cutscenes, writing and voice-over dialogue
 Gameplay consists of running through linear but detailed levels, shooting enemies as they come into view inbetween hiding behind cover
 The higher your score the quicker your level rises, the faster skills can be chosen from three styles of gunslinger
 The more enemies killed, the more slow-mo time is generated, best used when outnumbered or outgunned
 Difficult duels that rely on focus and fast reflexes take place at the end of some levels, against one or two infamous outlaws
 Together with accuracy these same skills are needed for the arcade and dueling modes, with take out chunks of the campaign to replayed again but with a twist
THE GOOD:+ Amazingly written & voiced, authentic western story
+ Superb graphic novel-style cutscenes and shaded in-game graphics
+ Well-suited western/country style audio & soundtrack
+ Good amount of varied locations and enemies
+ Three skill trees: rifleman, pistolero and shotgunner; one for each style of play to specialize your gunplay
+ Great use of shooting-based QTEs/slow-mo mechanic to help you during the hardest firefights
 The more you kill the more you can slow time
+ Uplay 'not' required
+ Not an easy game to beat on harder difficulties
+ A few areas have gatling guns! :)THE BAD:- Duels can be a very frustrating experience
 Until you get to grips with the mechanics
- Arcade mode is essentially a rip-off of the levels from the campaign played like you would have an arcade game, a few decades ago
 Fun but a derivation of the campaign levels
- 100% completion will require several playthroughs (two to three) and multiple sessions for arcade and dueling mode
- Small and linear level design
- Not an easy game to beat on harder difficulties
AND THE ORDINARY:* All modes are singleplayer only
 Good for some
 Not so for others
 Depends where your preferences lie
* Nice use of flashbacks to retell story allows for some levels to be partly replayed in a different manner
* Campaign of fourteen missions are fairly similar in terms of gameplay, even if locations are graphically varied
* Heavy on spoken narration
 Can be skipped
 Mostly
* Multiple playthroughs needed (at least 2 for some achievements
)  Good if you enjoy the game
 Not so much if you were only planning one playthrough
* Basic enemy AI provides decent enemy behaviour which becomes predictable however
* Enemy spawns are almost identical every-time you restart a section
 VERDICT:Call of Juarez Gunslinger is worthy of being called a AAA title
 Having beaten the campaign on Hard and True West difficulties from my point of view the game's campaign is excellent
 A good size, with a good amount of variation and layouts
 Indeed everything about the game is stylish
 Top draw
 With high production values, amazing story, colourful visuals and outstanding voice and audio
 Together these elements provide as good a western experience as you will discover on PC
 One I found to be highly immersive
 I particularly loved the wonderful soundrack
 So if you're a secret redneck/hillbilly like me, youll probably also enjoy it
Gameplay is fast, fluid and well-paced and the clever use of storytelling, fairly varied level design [given their linearity] works well with the three distinct skill-trees and authetic era weapons
 While QTEs/slow-mo shooting mechanics are helpful to inexperienced players adding another dimension to gunplay, keep the experience interesting
 To the point that it should be an FPS that everyone plays
 At least once
 However its not all plain sailing
 Ive found it difficult to put a finger on why exactly so many gamers give up on this game
I did the first time I tried it
 I imagine that some players just  lose interest in playing
Maybe it is the linear nature of levels, the low technology level of weapons, the dated setting, or just the nature of gunplay
 Im not sure but there is something here that stops some gamers from getting the most out of this gem
 I guess some players may just feel that the true nature of gameplay is slow and plodding
 Maybe despite the initial easy learning curve, players find the difficulty ramps too fast
 If players don't get used to the game's slow-mo mechanics, learn when to make good use of cover, then they will die alot and frequently
 And then there are the Hard and True West difficulties which will really need an investment of time and practice
 The hardest levels require maxed out skills, good knowledge of the map and gameplay mechanics but above all else, fast and accurate reflexes
 Duels against known outlaws can also be a frustrating experience
Until the mechanics are understood
 Even with tutorials this is not a trivial thing and will take alot of repeated tries until the whole dynamic suddenly clicks
The Arcade and Duel modes are good enough to be tried at least a few times
 Yet looking at my friends list most give up after playing a few levels
 The arcade mode is essentially a rip-off of the levels from the campaign with the aim to get the the highest kill chain possible without missing one
 These also have a separate smaller skill-tree for each gun-slinging style, so if you don't like repeated play to level up again then you wont like this mode
 Duel mode comprises of fifteen stand-offs between the player and bosses from the campaign
 Where the ultimate goal is to beat every one without drawing first - easier said than done
 A word on achievements
 The game possesses more difficult than easy ones
Definitely one of the harder games to complete
 So if you're planning to complete the game I would suggest you know what you're in for
 Despite these negatives I would whole-heartly recommend the game to gamers who are after an FPS with a western ambience
 For what it is, its excellent
 Just be aware that you and this game just may not click, which would be a shame and a waste if you do happen to get it
 If you're still unsure then wait for a hefty sale and get it then
 However if you have the tenacity, patience and reflexes to get the most out of this game, I dare say you will not regret it one bit

												YEEEEE HAAAWWW! Call of Juarez Gunslinger is a Wild West FPS where you take control of Silas Greaves
Greaves is a legendary bounty hunter who has fought the best the Wild West has to offer and in the year 1910 he enters a Saloon in Abilene, Kansas
Greaves tells the patrons of the Saloon about his encounters with the legends of the West and it is these stories that you play
As a huge fan of Red Dead Redemption searching for more good Western games (something that is seemingly hard to come by) this game delivered a fun burst of Western fun that just makes me want more
+Great cel shaded graphics+Incredibly fun gameplay including frequent slow motion segments (bullet-time)+Good combo system which rewards you for keeping the combo going+Well designed environments+Fight some of the best of the West, many of whom will be well-known names if you have an interest in all things Western+Great skill trees which add more gameplay mechanics and introduce new weapons+Three different types of main weapon, each with its own playstyle+Terrific voice acting+Interesting characters and story made even better by the use of an unreliable narrator+Super fun boss fights in the form of duels (even a threeway standoff)+Some good humour every now and then+Intelligent AI who behave similarly to how you would expect real people to behave, i

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Call of Juarez®: Gunslinger Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: FPS; Western; Story-Driven; Linear; Good Fun My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 3-8 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Novelty seekers; Strong narrative advocates; Arcade gamers REVIEWCall of Juarez®: Gunslinger is a superb game that offers a rich blend of exciting gameplay, intriguing storytelling, and a pleasurable atmosphere
The levels are narrow and the mechanics are simple, but the overall experience is downright riotous
It is designed to simultaneously feel comfortingly familiar and adventurously fresh
Put simply: it is a very easy-to-digest FPS game that boasts a strong and unique identity
Both established fans of the genre and those who are generally on the fence would be wise to give this game strong consideration
Call of Juarez®: Gunslinger embraces the Wild West  of the late 19th and early 20th century for its setting and atmosphere, with a jovial emphasis on the “Wild” part
The graphic style is in the same vein as that of Borderlands, although slightly more realistic; but the overall ambiance is definitely more focused on fun than realism
And the narrative is great
It is funny and compelling, it flows at a very enjoyable pace, and it touches on “real” folktales from the Wild West era
But more than that, the style of storytelling used in the game is exceptionally well-crafted and delivered near perfectly, with excellent voice acting
It comes together to establish an outstanding presentation
As for the actual gameplay, it is admittedly quite limited compared to some modern FPS games
There isn’t much variety to your arsenal, enemies, or to the level designs
However, there are great fundamentals inherent to the game
The gameplay is fun
It really is
There is pretty much nonstop action, and the firefights are always exciting
The game features a slow-mo power aspect, or as it is frequently called, “bullet-time
” And you are rewarded for scoring high combos during the firefights by receiving more bullet-time energy and exponentially more experience points
As you gain levels from those experience points, you can unlock passive abilities that make you more deadly
It is a simple system, but it is rewarding
As for the levels, they don’t allow much exploration or alternate pathing, and are mostly narrow
But since the game is highly story-driven, it is a fitting design choice
Probably the most defining feature of the game, (and franchise), is the dueling minigame
It can be frustrating at first, but after you learn some of the intricacies it becomes easy and pretty fun
There are duels peppered throughout the campaign in the form of boss encounters, and there is also an auxiliary duel mode in a score-attack style
The dueling feature is a leading contributor of the game’s charming and unique identity
The game runs on a checkpoint system where the checkpoints are both frequent and effective
There is also a level-select option that lets you replay certain levels at any time
As always, I would still prefer the option to save manually; but in Call of Juarez®: Gunslinger the system used is quite adequate and due to the linear nature of the levels, will never set you back more than a minute
It all adds up to an undoubtedly enjoyable experience
It isn’t a very long or sizable game by any means, but the campaign is very fun and has decent replay value
I can easily recommend this to all fans of the genre, big and small, new and old
If it looks like something you would enjoy, it probably is

Posted: 9 January, 2014
												Sit down, son
You just stumbled upon the page of the best shooter ever made
Pay some respect
Before the days of shooters that holds your hand and aim for you, that regenerate your health and show you what to do like a baby, there was this
Unreal Tournament 2004 - the most brutal, adrenalin-fueled shooter since Quake 3 Arena, a game so fast-paced its guaranteed you'll burn your eyes from not blinking for so long
They say we only use 20% of our brains - well, if you play this game on the hardest difficulty, you'll be using 100% i assure you
Holy hell son, this game uses so much of your brain it pretty much even cures autism
This game is filled with so much testosterone you have to shave your beard every forty minutes of gametime
Gameplay wise, this game is delicious
With an amazing arsenal of creative, varied and badass weapons, its certified there is a gun for everyone and every situation - sniper rifles that shoot lightning bolts, a triple rocket launcher, jesus christ did i mention a shotgun that shoots grenades too? (The Flak Cannon, considered the number 1 best gun of all times by PC Gamer)
Also, with the ability of limitless dodging, walljumping and even double-jumping, the potential for amazing acrobatic moves to evade your enemy's attacks are so great not even Dante from Devil May Cry can keep up
Yep: he cries every night because he cant be as badass as you, when you're playing this game
But this is the bare basic - to survive in the Online arenas, you better be backflipping over your enemies and giving them an instagib headshot while upside down
That's how you play this
However, to be good you have to have absolute keyboard coordination and aiming abilities - it aint easy to do those moves while scoring headshots airborne
Its so hardcore, they say ninjas have to play this game to graduate in Ninja School as their last test
I'm not even kidding
The maps are varied, from skyscrapers reaching space and low-grav to gothic dungeons, futuristic egyptian pyramids to spaceships blasting in hyperspace - there are over 140 maps in this game (thats almost 5 times more than any CoD), ranging from Deathmatch maps to Capture the Flag, Double Domination, Onslaught (Battlefield-esque map node domination), Assault (from the original UT) and even Bombing Run (Its soccer
WITH GUNS)
And kid, that's not even taking into account the thousands of maps released by fans - that's right, the modding community is huge for this game
(No DLC crap, no
You get all those maps and access to mod maps for free
Welcome to oldschool shooters)The soundtrack and graphics certainly do not falter
We get badass tracks like the one in DM-Asbestos, and others have more epic orchestral music (for actual epic scenes: assaulting an alien mothership to save Earth) and the graphics, for their time, were considered to be amazing (Even modern games, like Killing Floor, use this game engine as base)
The visual and audio presentation certainly do not lack, but to this day this game isnt known for having pretty trees, its known for being the best shooter of all times and god damn it does it right
Together with the classic Unreal Tournament and Quake 3 Arena, Unreal Tournament 2004 is known by shooter veterans worldwide to be the best competitive shooter experience that ever existed
Think you're ready for that? Take off the Angry Birds shirt, the Casual of Duty cap and get ready for a terrific head-hunting experience with the game that INVENTED Double-Kills, Headshots and Killing-Sprees (that all games rip-off nowadays)
Final Score: 10/10

Posted: 9 October, 2013
												In my opinion, this is the single greatest arena first person shooter of all time
When it comes to competitive play, absolutely nothing beats this game
This game itches absolutely every desire I have for an arena shooter perfectly
From the fast paced movement to the weapons sandbox, it plays like a dream
No other game thus far has impressed me as much as Epic has with this game
The dodging system adds skill that compliments other skills such as tactical skill and aiming skill
One of the biggest complaints I have with modern games on PC is a lack of features
This game features a full editing kit, great community driven content, a hub to display that content and a plethora of other features that hardly any other games have in comparison
Yes, that does include a FoV slider
The thing that all FPS games should have no matter what
If this game were to only be available by going to E-Bay and paying $200 for it, I would in a heartbeat
If you're a fan of arena shooter games like Quake, you're really missing out if you haven't played this
If you want to try out arena shooters for the first time, this is your best choice
I have personally bought this game for a good few people simply because of how much I believe in it
Get it now

												A true classic that will be remembered for thousands of years
Reigns over Quake III as possibly the best shooter of the previous millennium
These games, particularly UT, UT 2004, Quake III, and a few others really need to see a resurgence in player counts
Modern devs just can't make an arena shooter, though they try
They're too wrapped up in Perks and microtransactions and hiding content behind grinds and paywalls
That is no way to balance a game
The rocket launcher and flak cannon are calling you
Add me to your friends list and destroy

												This is my --------------->>> FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIME <<<-----------------Nothing else even comes close
Absolutely gorgeous aesthetic, brilliant weapon design, fast-paced and satisfying action
The BOTS in this game are GENUINELY INTELLIGENT!  And you can let their difficulty AUTO-ADJUST to fit EXACTLY at your skill level!  Bots should be standard in FPS imo
 ESPECIALLY MULTIPLAYER!  The player should NEVER be slave to what others want to play
 No players, no game in multiplayer gaming
 This is why I can still play Unreal Tournament when and how I want FOREVER!  And I have done exactly that so far
Other than brilliant base gameplay, you have TONS of amazing mods for this game that are most often COMBINABLE AND CUSTOMIZABLE!  Tailor the experience to EXACTLY what you want!  I love it
Fantastic map designs and creative weapons with MORE functionality than most shooters
 Two fire modes such as the Flak Cannon the fires a shotgun-blast of bouncing flak pellets OR an impact grenade that sprays some flak pellets on impact!  Maps in space and space stations, maps in medieval castles, so much variety in map choices and a few extremely unique ones!  Not to mention the variety of game modes which include team deathmatch, free-for-all, capture-the-flag, domination (point capture-and-hold mode), and best of all ASSAULT!Assault game mode still belongs to Unreal Tournament
 This is the originator of that mode
 Accomplish one objective after another as a team and with such variety in maps and objectives to do it!  Like some brilliant combination of linear, singleplayer shooters and competitive multiplayer!  Cooperative and competitive at the same time!I wish I could play this with friends to share the joy, but bots keep the experience alive forever!

												This is the first game created by Gearbox - the legendary developers behind Borderlands and Brothers in Arms
Opposing Forces is the first expansion to Half Life
Released in 1999, exactly a year after the original game
Personally i like it just as much as the original Half Life, and in my book, original Half Life is in top 10
It consists of 12 chapters, but don't let that fool you cause it's not nearly as long as the original Half Life
6 hours is as much as you can get from it
That said, the game has it's own identity
For example, just like any half life game, this one has a tutorial
Gearbox decided to have a bit of fun with it, since you start out in the boot camp
It's a typical training mission, but a nicely done training mission
Had a lot of army stereotypes and FMJ references
Unlike Blue Shift (2nd expansion), this game actually tried to add some things of its own
Night vision googles instead of the flashlight
Sniper instead of the crossbow
Pistol with a laser pointer instead of the revolver
Wrench and a knife instead of the crowbar 2 new alien weapons - one is like a bazooka, the other has infinite ammo (shoots lightning balls)
Instead of long jumps, your protagonist climbs on ropes
1 new Black Mesa prototype weapon, that teleports you to Xen
The location you get teleported in generally have a lot of loot
1 completely new weapon, not just an alternative model - a machine gun (M249 SAW)
There are new alien types as well
Also, throughout the game, you will encounter your comrades, the most important ones are medic and engineer
Medic can patch you up, while the engineer can drill through doors
As for the story, neither Blue Shirt nor Opposing Forces are canon
That said, Opposing Forces has a lot of cameos
I personally wouldn't have minded to have it in the official lore
Deep inside it's still the same game, but at least they tried to add a few things here and there
Like i said, it has it's own identity
I highly recommend it

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE:Also see my:  Half Life (1) Review Half-Life 2 ReviewHalf-Life: Blue Shift ReviewBlack Mesa ReviewINTRODUCTION:Half-Life: Opposing Force (also known as Government Cover-up Simulator 1999 or Call of Half-Life: Black Mesa Warfare) is a first-person action shooter game that serves as the first expansion to the critically acclaimed and award-winning Half-Life by Valve
Unlike Half-Life however, this title was made by Valve alongside Gearbox Software
Interestingly, unlike Half-Life, the player will see the Black Mesa incident through the eyes of a U
S
Marine(the Military enemies in the first game)
PLOT (No Spoilers)The player takes the role of Commander…(I mean)…Corporal Shephard, a U
S
Marine with the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit who were sent to the Black Mesa Complex for an unknown operation
While en route inside an Osprey to the Complex, Shephard and his team are attacked by Xen air-borne units forcing the Osprey to crash knocking him out
Follow Shephard in his trek across the massive Black Mesa Complex in an attempt to escape while uncovering a government cover-up that would pitch Shephard against U
S
Black Operations Units, Xen forces, and a new alien threat called Race X
PROS:+ New enemy types with unique abilities and weapons (instead of just rehashing the materials of the main game)+ Fun and interesting new weapons such as the Displacer Cannon and Shock Roach+ Well made action-packed story which shows players a different side of the Black Mesa Incident+ Introduction of new game mechanics such as Rope Climbing, Secondary heavy melee attacks, Grappling hooks (Barnacle hook?), Night vision and Portal guns that send you (or your target) to another dimension (See Displacer Cannon above)+ Possibly the first FPS game to implement a Military Squad game mechanic+ Entertaining Tutorial with cultural references+ Story intersects with some important Half-Life 1 events+ Good voice acting for its time+ Andrian Shephard is possibly a descendant of Jack (protagonist of Bioshock) due to his uncanny ability to wield a Wrench in battle against Black Ops Soldiers and Aliens
CONS:- Relatively short game with me clocking around 5 hours of game time on hard mode
- New squad mechanics is clunky (I can actually forgive this since it’s possibly the first squad mechanic on an FPS game)- Puzzles are not that satisfying to solve- Final chapter leading to the final boss feels rushed and underdeveloped- Unsatisfying and easy final bossCONCLUSION:GREAT EXPANSION that I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED specially for those who played the first Half-Life game and I say this because it is littered with several subtle nods from the main game
 WORTH IT?MUST BUY AND MUST HAVE
 I, however, do recommend you purchase the Half-Life Anthology if you already have Half-Life 2 but if you do not have it, get Half-Life Complete
FINAL NOTES:Opposing Force is a good example on how to make an expansion; it introduces new game mechanics, new enemies, new weapons and all the while delivering a new story that still being closely related to the main Half-Life plot

												Making an expansion pack to Half Life was no small task
But Gearbox was more than willing to set the bar
Opposing Force is fundamentally a similar experience to Half Life 1
But it expanded on it's core foundation in numerous ways
There are new actually interesting weapons, friendly squad members who serve different non-combat roles and a few other things
But what Opposing Force does well is it continues the legacy left by Half Life 1
It has consistantly good pacing and like Half Life dynamically goes from low-key puzzle segments to high octane action horror
It's just so much fun to play it's an actual challenge for me to pick between playing either Half Life or Opposing Force
Since both games compliment each other so well
If you like Valve games, or even first person shooters
You owe it to yourself to play Opposing Force
It is one of those games that you just can't stop playing

												Oh man, oh man, oh man
I was both curious and a little worried after HL - how can a totally new person (Shephard corporal) lead the story, and how will the story go on without Gordon Freeman
As I mentioned in my HL review, I wasn't too happy with Half Life's pacing - the environmental changes that were supposed to delay you were all too random-like - it was just obvious that game mechanics with the sole purpose of slowing you down
It was really unreal
Similarly, it kind of bothered me that even though Gordon IS the archetype of the clever protagonist, the man of science who rises and fights back - it's just surreal that every other scientist is older than him, and can't protect themselves at all
Hell, Gordon was more capable of fighting than the guards, employed by Black Mesa
So, back to Opposing Force
You play with a soldier (not a bad guy, you don't need to kill scientists if you don't want to) , and your standard gear will be a Deser Eagle and a combat knife - I really liked how realistic this part is compared to Gordon's
The story and the character harmonizes, your character, and even HIS ACTIONS have their part and place in the story
Additionally, claimed by wiki it's his training, Shephard can climb ropes, which is an intresting mechanic in the game, and opens new dimensions in movement and game variety
And at this point I still have 3 great things to say about the game, but they are kind of interlope - first of all, the game introduces numerous new weapons - M249 (brutal machinegun), Displacer Cannon, Sniper rifle, the already mentioned Deser Eagle and then - New alien weapons! The rocket-launcher-like Spore Gun, the Shock Roach (my favourite) and the Barnacle Grapple
Second great thing is partly about Barnacle Grapple - it can be used as a good-ish melee weapon, but it's main usage is just crazy - it can stick to any organic surface, including some pods on the walls, that appeared along with the alien invasion
 You have a grapple that can be used to close distances and move around some parts of the map - it's just brilliant
The Second Great Thing is the creativity of level design
FINALLY the expansion, while being shorter than the base game, uses it's features much more frequently, while inserting these into the game almost flawlessly
There are not only  "push the box 3 metres to the right to jump" parts, there is a part when the same box needed to be used 3 times! I guess this is because they knew that after playing the base game, the player will know that they can be moved, and as s/he's accustomed with the feature, can use it in a more varied way
And the third great things is the overall game integrity
It's good, in my opinion way better than the base game was
 There is way less button pressing - once you need to free a medic to take care of the engineer, who can afterwards open a door with a flame cutter
Much intresting than pressing two buttons, isn't it?  Most blockades during the game are legit - a huge worm or pillars of flame in the waste burner(?)
Things that delay your progress won't just randomly happen, but your way goes through paths where they delaying elements DO exist, making - at least in my eye - Opposing Force a much more immersive game then the original story
(On the sidenote - bossfight was less monumental, but far less frustrating than repeadly missing jumps in the shower of electric discharges of Nihilanth)I won't throw numbers around, but while I felt Half-Life was fun/good,  I *loved* Opposing Force
I wholeheartedly recommend this purchase if you enjoyed the base game, and you're intrested in the expanded story

												Another expansion pack for the original HL, this time giving us a look into the "enemy side" and the way that the events of Black Mesa affected the Marine Corps called to "contain" the situation
The main character Corporal Adrian Sherpard is brought into the facility but things dont go like planned and all hell is broken loose
Another short game that complements the original story of Gordon Freeman, but the ending of this game leads me to believe that we might see more of this character in future installements of HL, so it might not be just an expansion pack game
9/10
			
Posted: 9 June
												Neat little expansion pack
The story follows one of the marines who were trying to kill Freeman in Half-Life but apparently all the bloodthirsty ones were in another squad
At various points Shephard, the protagonist in OpForce, temporarily links up with other marines and they frequently quip, "Government cover-ups were not in my job description" and they don't seem too happy about shooting up all the scientists
My favorite part was a funny little alien rocket / grenade (alternate fire) launcher you pick up midway through
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=942191660I don't know if there was just some glitch for me but the ending might be more horrifying than intended
Unlike with Freeman, G-Man doesn't offer Shephard an employment opportunity and only says he's going to put him somewhere he can do no harm but also no harm will come to him
Then the credits roll, the file says you have been Detained, and the screen goes black
But after the credits finish you can still see the HUD with your health/armor and you can still jump even though it's just a black screen
I only knew I was jumping because he still makes noise when he lands on the ground
Judging from footstep noise you can't move in any other direction either
What a fate
Trapped in a box in pitch darkness forever

												Nightdive has outdone themselves, Turok 2's remaster is near perfect
Turok 2 itself is an amazing game with impressive graphics for the N64, great sound design and brutal combat across huge levels
Now you take that winning receipe, put it on PC with proper controls, new graphical options, quality of life features, mod support, and 60FPS? You got something special
Not to mention the PC soundtrack is included as an option, a very nice touch
Beyond this, Nightdive has been supporting the game well with monthly updates that include tons of bugfixes, optimization and even new or requested features
To the point that they included an actual HORDE MODE multiplayer mode! I could spend the rest of this review praising how great and supportive of a developer they are, despite Turok being a niche product in of itself they have committed to making this the best it could be
At 20 Dollars, it sounds steep, but consider that unsupported, unremastered games go for 10-15 on steam
You're supporting a small niche developer that focuses on taking care of old forgotten games and you're paying for not only Turok 2 but every improvement and feature added onto it
I have spent money on worse

												Solid gameplay with decent controls and levels
The level designs will at times be tedious and there is a quite a bit of backtracking if you miss something the first time around
The port of this game is astounding and you can tell a lot of care was put into this port
Cool features like a cheat code that enables you to play the game like Super Hot, multiplayer, etc
As well as fixes and objective markers when near an objective (Something the game has benefited a huge amount from)
I can absolutely recommend this classic especially with such a beautiful port to steam

												Very impressive remaster
+ New visual effects+ Actual new gameplay mecanic that helps Turok during platforming (that one is impressive)+ MORE BLOOD than the already-violent original (more blood decals on surfaces than before too)+ Sharp, clear textures+ Game looks fantastic with Ambient Occlusion (and frankly with everything maxed)+ Reflections on water? What is this sorcery! It's awesome!+ DRAW DISTANCE! DRAW DISTANCE!+ Related to the above (draw distance increase), some parts of maps where enemies used to NOT see you (and you not seeing them) because of the Fog in the original will now shoot at you if you happen to be within range
It actually changes the dynamic of the game a little bit and it's great
There's a couple of places where more enemies than "normal" will shoot at you (especially guard Dinosoids from fixed posts at a distance) because they can now see you, but of course you can see them too
So it's a shooting craze in those map sections
+ You can actually choose between the N64 or the PC versions of the Soundtrack, I think I had a tear in my eye when I saw that
+ I THINK that there's some (very few) places where one or two enemies have been ADDED compared to the original
I'm playing my first game on Hard right now


it may be why
I might also be wrong


but I'm 100% confident that I've seen at least two locations in the first map (which I've completed by the time I write this review) where there was at least one extra enemy that just didn't exist there in the original
The best example I can give is right at the VERY beginning of the first map (Port of Adia)
There's a dinosoid spawning at the port right after the initial explosion occurs as you walk to the right
I remember clearly that in the original game there were NO enemies there at all (unless there WAS one but I just don't remember if I actually beat the game back then on Hard, or not


it might be because of the difficulty setting, but that would surprise me)
Anyway, the gist is that if they indeed ADDED some enemies here and there based on difficulty setting then that's AMAZING
More enemies means more things to shoot at, that's always a plus in my book!+ What can I say more? IT'S TUROK 2
+ Buy it
Thank you for reading if you did (also, remember, just buy it, you'll thank me later)

Posted: 4 March, 2014
												In 1997, John Romero of Ion Storm Dallas approached the producer of System Shock, Warren Spector, said "Make the game of your dreams
No limits" and the end result was the creation of Ion Storm Austin and their first game; Deus Ex
Deus Ex is a First-Person Shooter/Role Playing Game with a heavy emphasis on stealth and thinking carefully about your surroundings
The game provides you, from start to finish, with a number of ways to solve every single problem put in front of you
The level design is open ended enough for any method of completion
The game is inspired by Looking Glass Studio's System Shock and Thief and as a result, the freedom you have to approach and complete your objectives is simply staggering
You are given a huge world to explore, some tools you might want to use to complete your objectives and let loose upon your environment
Careful exploration is needed to uncover all of the hidden gadgets, secret tunnels and small story elements
The only time you will ever receive a Game Over is if you die
There are no penalties for doing things your way and the game dynamically changes as you play
People in the game may think differently of you if you don't do what they expect of you and may effect certain things as you progress through the story
Speaking of Story, the story of Deus Ex is one of a heavily political and conspiratorial nature
You play as JC Denton, an agent on his first day with the UNATCO, an organization that deals with the growing rise of foreign and domestic terrorism in the early 21st century
It does not take long however for JC to discover that he is merely a pawn in a huge political game that leans far beyond his own understanding
He will have to travel far and wide to gather the help he needs from unsuspecting allies
Hong Kong, Paris, New York City and various US locations will be visited, all of which have a fitting Tech-noir feel and stellar music to match
One listen of the music for Hong Kong and you'll never forget it
Being an Role-Playing Game as well as a shooter, Deus Ex allows you to customize your character to your preference
The game features a skill system that will allow you to improve JC in a number of fields
Like big guns? Master the Heavy Weapons skill and go in with the GEP Gun blowing people and locked doors to bits
Want to silently infiltrate every location with skill and precision? Master Computers and Lockpicking to open doors, hack security machines, ATM machines for money (if you don't find any bank account details lying around) and read e-mails for clues about the environment you're in
Another notable part of Deus Ex are its unforgettable characters
Every major character in the game has a well rounded personality with their own expectations of you
What you do in the world or tell them can affect how they treat you which might be crucial in your immediate future
There are boss battles in the game but some may be avoided entirely by learning information from other characters
If you do walk into a boss fight, you even have the choice of running right out the door behind them and not bother engaging them at all! When was the last time a game let you do that? Things might even happen to that character later on if you don't fight them
With all the above praise, Deus Ex is not without its small faults however
Some of the levels are huge and empty of detail, forcing long walks if you want to get anywhere specific in a short amount of time
The large empty levels also make the game feel a little devoid of life in some places
A lot of areas that look as if they should be full of people, are completely empty except for maybe two or three characters at once
With every conspiracy theory under the sun under the microscope in Deus Ex, you must learn to question everything and trust no one
 You may even find that things that this game was talking about in the Year 2000 are happening right now or have a very real possibility to happen at some point during our lifetimes; wealth and the increasing gap between the rich and the poor across the globe, omnipresent electronic surveillance, technical augmentations that can enhance the human race beyond what nature intended and much more
It's a roller-coaster ride of a game that everyone simply has to play to experience at least once
Your favourite game was probably inspired by this piece of art so do yourself a favour, set next weekend aside and play this game already
You will never leave the house without your tin-foil hat again!

And I remember when space invaders came out!You are doing yourself a terrible disservice by not trying out this game, even though by todays standards the graphaics may lack

but the substance, and the depth and ambiance is there
Dont let my lack of play time on steam fool you

and also so i could write a review of this game

												Where it all began
Can't believe that this was released on Windows 2000, 15 years ago! Still to this day we are gifted with excellent mods for it, currently Caustic Creative are developing a wonderful overhaul mod named Deus Ex: Revision (be sure  to check it out!)
This was one of my first childhood games, I can still remember certain stealth patterns to the levels
Really good to revisit from time to time and like I mentioned, mods really revitalise an old classic
JC Denton the badass! The question is, which ending did you choose?For those wondering, the storyline of the Deus Ex series is as follows;2027 – Human Revolution2029 – Mankind Divided2052 – Deus Ex2072 – Invisible WarSo the events of the original come AFTER the events of Human Revolution

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, INSTALL A MAP PATCH BEFORE YOU PLAY THE GAME! The GOTY Edition has older editions of the maps due to an archiving error at Ion Storm
There is an unofficial patch to restore the maps to the correct versions which fixes many things
Without it, many pathways are missing, bugs unfixed, and an entire ending looks like crap
http://www
dxm
be/navigator
php5?lang=en&content=202Deus Ex was a pioneer in the action RPG genre
It manages to tell a great story without ever forcing the story in the way of gameplay
There's a few unoficial patches that let you run this game better on modern PC's
There's a lot of good mods for this game, which is really good
GAMEPLAYDeus Ex's gameplay has aged a bit, although it's still very fun
Most notably, the game has a level of interactivity that has rarely been reached even by modern titles
The game isn't very linear, it more or less just nudges you in the right direction
The first few missions are kind of slow, so don't quit before you complete them
Pretty much all of the maps are large and expansive and have tons of items, enemies, and unique NPC's scattered around
There's a huge level of interactivity in the game world, which was a big selling point when this game came out
You have a variety of skills in the game that you can upgrade
You gain skill points by completing objectives or discovering hidden areas
You can also get "augmentations" to give your character new and unique abilities
Some people say that the shooting gameplay has aged - if that applies to you, remember to upgrade your weapon skills
It makes a huge difference
(You may want to install Shifter or Biomod to improve the gameplay, although I prefer the original
)PRESENTATIONThe graphics weren't paticularly amazing for the time (they weren't bad, either), but it manages to use what they had to create a wonderful atmosphere
They depict many run-down decrepit buildings littered with homeless, sick people to show a country on the edge of collapse
The music is great and really adds to the atmosphere
Every location has it's own unique soundtrack that fits great and adapts to what you are currently doing
This game has full voice acting along with tons of unique characters, so the voice acting quality will vary
All main characters will have at least decent voice acting
(If you want to augment your graphics even further, install the D3D10 renderer and New Vision)STORY (Don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything):Deus Ex takes place in a cyberpunk vision of the world where high-tech prosthetics and transhuman augmentations are commonplace
You are introduced to a memorable cast of characters
A great thing they do with their characters is that they take care in reminding you that they are still human beings and not just targets or objectives
It's all about uncovering ancient secrets and it's pretty cool in this aspect
Its story was great for the time - and even today it is rarely equaled in the philosophical depth it has
The gameplay was revolutionary, blending shooting and RPG elements
In summary, I'd definitely recommend this - it's a truly classic game
			
Posted: 7 September, 2013
												What can I say about Deus Ex, it has some of the best story telling in any game ever, and you definitely won't find another game that gives you as many options to complete it the way you want to, it has a perfect mix of RPG elements, stealth, combat, plot twists, has A TON of alternate story lines, and a lot of really fun augmentations, basically you haven't played a good RPG until you've played this
Do not let the Unreal Engine 1 graphics scare you, also know that it has some wonky AI at times, and some really hilarious voice acting, but fear not, there is still more details in this game then several modern games today combined
Kinda sad really that in the 11 years since, nobody has managed to come close to its artistry, forget matching or surpassing this gem

Son, you stepped on the grounds of one the best games ever made in this goddamn universe
Sit back
get the visa card, click the add to cart button and checkout
Grab a cola and play Unreal
Music that is crafted very carefully, with the beyond golden hands of Alexander Brandon, with the unique lightning effects that you rarely see now in games (Exept an exeption for Cube and Cube 2:Sauerbraten, those are really great), epic level design that is better in some bases than nows level design, powerful weapons and different environments make a  beyond epic-mega-super-ultra-penta   awesome atmosphere that is can only, but only, belong to Unreal
For an example when you escape the Vortex rikers, and you see HyLevels Falls right in front of your eyes, which is amazing
The gameplay featured brand new elements like dodging/faking death
etc


and is old school
which is good,The amount of replay-abillity is very high, as you can play co op or DM, or many other gamemodes, and thats also because the UnrealEditor is very open
you can make weapons to maps to player skins and many more


Unreal is a must play, must have
I obviously give it a 10/10

This is the one and only Unreal
This started one of the greatest franchises that also led to the now ever-increasing-in-popularity Unreal 3 engine
It's superb, not like newer games where they spoon-feed you tutorials that last an eternity and have pointless auto-aim features
It's just you and your gun against EVERYTHING
IT'S AWESOME

												Epic's best single player game
Criminally underrated
Criminally so
The use of music; large expansive levels, colors and sparse narrative give the game a meditative flavor; which is ironic considering how they went on to make gears of war

												In 1998, Unreal blew everyone's mind as the best looking game anyone had ever seen
The visuals were jaw dropping along with the beautiful dynamic music, unique weapons & enemies,  and versatile level design of its alien world
Combine all these and you've got an extremely atmospheric and stunning game
I feel lucky to have experienced it then and I long for the day when another game comes by and blows me away like Unreal did
At the beginning of the second level when you step outside the ship to see the vast open landscape with a beautiful waterfall, sky, birds flying above (which you can shoot down) and the epic ambient music kicks in-- that's one of the best moments in gaming history
Never before in a video game had anyone seen such a large open area as that, let alone so detailed and alive
Make no mistake about it, this is the most beautiful and atmospheric (old school) shooter with the best soundtrack you will ever play
Even today, nearly 20 years later, the game still looks amazing
 Just look at this fly-by intro of the game
 If that doesn't pique your interest and make you wanna play it, you should be ashamed to call yourself a gamer!This was Epic MegaGame's flagship title and the birth of the Unreal Engine; the most widely used and popular game engine to date
Today, roughly over 600 games are powered by the Unreal Engine including big hits like Borderlands 2, Bioshock Infinite, Mass Effect 2, Rocket League and the Batman series just to name a few
There's no denying this is one of the most important and influential releases ever

												I feel like this game never got the respect it deserved
It was overshadowed by its predecessors, like Wolfenstein, Doom, and Quake
It was overshadowed by Half-Life, which came out in the same year (1998- I suspect that's why it didn't earn GOTY)It was even overshadowed by its little brother, Unreal Tournament and has since become lost in the fray
But it's still here
It's unique
And without it, we wouldn't have Unreal Tournament or even the Unreal engine
But this game is amazing in its own right
The level design is spectacular
The gunplay is just plain funIt shows that games can be fun with no voice acting save for grunting

												Possibly the most elegant FPS devised
Every element serves a purpose
From the scraping dry laughter to the red glint of gems
Devil Daggers is lo-fi poetry in motion
The eponymous weapon combines doom 2's double barrel shotgun and Hyperblaster into a single devstating instrument of death
The movement system is straight out of Doom, Quake and Painkiller
Strafe running, strafe jumping, bunny hopping, it's all there
But don't let that speed go to your head
While you can accelerate faster, the enemy has higher top speeds
But their swarms cannot turn as fast
The demonic swarm also has exploitable behaviors, notably they will try to avoid your daggers
This allows you to carve paths of destruction, splitting the demonic hordes as you punch through
With sharp target prioritization, skillful shooting and the grace of a satanic, bullfighting ballerina you can eke out extra seconds of life as you climb the leaderboards
And speaking of the leaderboards, they have a wonderful demo feature
Every scoring run is recorded
Probably the best anti-cheat feature possible for a leaderboard, as well as a wealth of information and techniques
Sure to fall flat with the cinematic shooter crowd, this is a love letter to ID's glory days, right down to the gritty textures of the low poly models and the palettes that color them
There is no story to tell or goal to achieve except the tale of your own mastery
A total emphasis on skill, no margin for error and absolutely zero downtime (even death holds no loading screens) is this game's hallmark
Devil Daggers demands nothing less than your total attention, and while razor sharp reflexes will serve you well, you need to have an even sharper grasp of position and target priority
Hell has many lessons to teach
It communicates so well there is no need for a HUD
All the information you require is in the motion of your enemy, the sound of bone scraping on stone, your own momentum as you strafe the edges of this platform suspended in the void
Devil Daggers is a purposeful distillation of what made the greats so compelling
			
Posted: 25 June, 2016
												I wish the developer to raise enough funds to make a sequel with proper maps and not just one arena
The art style and sound design are simply flawless in this one
That could be the new Heretic

												Devil daggers is one of the few games to make me cry regularly

												Hell? I know hell
Hell is perfection
Hell is repeating the same steps a hundred times only so that you may die every time and the hundred and first time will make you die a little later
Maybe
Hell is knowing that at 35", the spider appears and you need to kill it before it gorges your precious treasure
And yet failing to do so just so many times
Hell is feeling pathetic and inadequate seeing how the best of the very best manage twelve minutes in the arena, while you barely get to third
Devil Daggers is going to hurt you
It is going to smack you around, it is going to humiliate, to taunt, to maim your feeling of being a good player
But you will endure
And you're going to love it
You will learn
Next time, you will survive longer
You will beat the person right above you, and one day you will get to the top
Through blood, guts, sweat and tears
			
Posted: 5 June, 2016
												I've seen many reviews referring to Devil Daggers as a bullet hell
"But why?" I said
"There's no projectiles other than the ones you shoot
" I started thinking about it; and I came to realize this:Instead of bullets, the squids shoot skulls at you
Instead of lazers, the spiders suck up your power gems and shoot spider eggs at you
At this point, I figured that Devil Daggers was a bullet hell without the bullets, and the game's graphics, gameplay, and audio represent that well
Bullet hell without the bullets is just hell
And God, do I love it so
			
Posted: 19 February, 2016
												Devil Daggers is EXACTLY the game that would be on a Law and Order gamer episode
			
Posted: 4 November, 2016
												I've read somewhere that gamers can reach a state of mind that is similar to the highest form of meditation
I feel like this game gave me a glimpse of that sensation
Just a few seconds in and the real world fades as you become one with this hellish realm and for the next few minutes that's all there is
In any run, your demise is but a few minutes away and this inevitable doom combined with the aesthetics enforce a sense of lovecraftian horror
You feel you're slowly losing your grip on the situation
You're being overwhelmed and in a frenzied, panicked last stand you'll eventually succumb to your inevitable fate
And when this happens, you're suddenly reminded of your physical body as it urges you to take breath
So you take that well deserved deep breath, and when you exhale, you say to yourself: '

Early Access Review
It doesn't take long in-game to get the appeal of Ravenfield
It's a simple concept of military sandbox shooter, yet executed in a way that nearly anyone who mildly enjoys FPS titles would find engaging and addictive
Essentially, there is a military battle occuring on medium-to-small scale prebuilt maps
It is only you and bots; there is no multiplayer what-so-ever
The landscape is dotted with 'zones' or 'bases' that you can capture and control, which then act as spawn points for whenever you are (frequently) killed
There are several cool vehicles that you can use seemlessly
The airplanes and helicopters take a quick bit of skill to operate, which is neat
You only control one soldier at a time (FPS-style), and as far as I can tell you can't give orders or anything like that
This is a run-and-gun affair
The only strategy that matters is the one you bring to the table
There is a map you can consult in real-time that shows the battle unfolding, and helps you develope your approach
The guns are standard military affair, and all feel different and lend different strategies
This is one of those titles that looked 'meh' to me in videos, but when I played it - I got it
Being a sandboxy type of game, your mileage will vary in how much fun you get out of it
There are not currently any missions or 'story mode' (apparently planned), so you have to enjoy simply going for the thrill of the win at this point in time
Pros:+Really engaging warfare on the FPS scale+AI units 'feel' and 'act' real and give this game legs to stand on+To me, 'single player only' is a good thing for SOME GAMES, and it works well here - so bravo for that+Graphics are clean and work well for this game; the performance seems great and I bet this can run on a toaster+Addicting gameplay that also offers some depth and strategic variation+Guns are all fun and play differently+Vehicles such as tanks, ATVs, helicopters, airplanes, boats, etc
that you can seemlessly operate+Slow motion mode+Battle customiaztion options; if you want (and your computer can handle it) hundreds of soldiers and mass chaos, great, or you can have just a few soldiers and much more strategy going on+This title has been in developement for a long time which gives me hope that chance of abandonment is low and there is a long bright future of work that will be done+Steam Workshop support is comingCons:-Yes, there are rough edges at this point in time-No music (which is kind of neat and makes the warfare feel more 'real', but it would be something I'd like to see in the future)-Controller support is here, but you still need the mouse for the menus - and really, you should probably think twice before buying this with the intent of controller only at this point (just my experience)Ravenfield is an ordinary concept executed extraordinarily well
Well worth full price if this is your kind of jam

Early Access Review
								I stumbled upon this game looking through a game queue, and I am glad that I have
If you like shooters with no nonsense, this is the game for you!The thing that stood out the most when going into my first battle was the simplicity of the game
There is no gaining levels, no buying weapons, and no attachments
(According to Steelraven7 - the sole developer, this was to keep the weaopns being used for what they are meant for)
You hop in and enjoy
You (and your computer) are the limit, not the game
The hype you get at the beginning of the match is based off of the experience of the game, and not the next thing you are trying to unlock
Another highlight of the game that I noticed later, when the two teams met up at a point to fight, was the use of physics
When a soldier is injured enough or is within the blast radius of a ballistic weopon, he will fall over or be sent hurdling 30 feet into the air
When vehicles wreck, they don't just break
They explode
Personel carriers will be blown sky high and lose their wheels when they run out of HP
Helicopters and planes will hilariously flail around in the air before exploding after making contact with the ground
Sea veichles explode and sink
The occupants of these vehicles will also be sent flopping through the air and/or on the ground with the game's ragdoll physics
The aforementioned aspect of no levels is another important piece of the game
The progress of the game is based off of your ability, rather than the equipment that you unlock
The game will let you decide how to progress, rather than take away equipment until you are "good enough to handle it
" To challenge yourself you can change the game's difficulty settings instead of drag yourself up the ladder of ranks that most games make you do
Ravenfield is a stark contrast to most other well known contemporary shooters
While those games try to make the game feel like a movie where you are the main character, this game lets you do and feel how you want, yet you are not the center of the experience
You can fight alongside your fellow blue or red soldiers, you can take to the skies with planes and dominate the air, you can use a helicopter to tease the ememies defenses, you can bulldose your way through enemy infantry with a tank, or you can group up with a few soldiers and hop in a personel carrier, all while being able to go wherever you choose on the map
There are no invisible walls, or voids, and the game is not limited to paths or buildings
The game is pure freedom
The developer keeps things interesting with frequent updates
With each update there is always at least one big change
When Beta 6 came out, the character models were changed from block characters to low-poly soldiers
An in-dev version of the most popular map, Archipelago, was also added
A temple map was also added
However, being a game in very early development, it has some problems that will need fixing in the future
The AI can be hit and miss sometimes
For instance, leaving the aircraft carrier on the Archipelago map
If you spawn many soldiers, they will crowd the dock part of the aircraft carriers to get into small boats
They do not have problems getting into the boats, but they do have issues driving the boats out of the ship
In this phenomenon, boats fill run into one another and become piled up like a stack of pancakes
AIs that are in land vehicles never fail to flatten you if you are within 20 feet of the spawn area
They do not look where they are going yet
They will always try to shoot you from across the map if they have seen you, even if there are more important things to shoot
This can be seen as funny for some players, or frustrating for others
The game also lacks a large amount of maps
Of course, the game will be updated to have more in the near future
The maps you get are good, but there only a few unique maps at the moment
As of right now though, you can download maps from other users or make maps for yourself with the map making tools if you are not satisfied by these maps
All in all, Ravenfield is unique, but also reminds me of simpler games
The game is a refreshing break from the grinding involved in many modern games
If you enjoyed the days when games were simple freedom, I garuntee you will like this game

												Shorter than expected, but unbelievably well crafted
Since it's free, the length isn't an issue
I must say though that I appreciate this mod more as a piece of art than I had fun playing it
You can expect Episode Two quality, although nothing out of the ordinary and no surprises
This is obviously just Chapter 1, so I can understand why it starts slowly and safely
I hope Chapter 2 is a little more 


spectacular? I guess? Again though, it's extremely well made, and there is no reason not to play it
Definitly the best looking thing made with Source
Looks even better in some parts than some of the CS:GO map remakes (which looks amazing themselves)

												DownFall is a fantastic little piece of Half-Life action
The problem is it's incredibly short - my playthrough took about 30 minutes and while YMMV, it won't get much longer than an hour or so
However, Marnamai does plan on releasing a continuation, which is great, because the ending cliffhanger really stung
But that's just a testament to how great DownFall is
The levels look, feel and flow really, really well
You've got some really strong gameplay, making great use of the Half-Life combat and exploration loop - you end up in some novel situations that you haven't played through before, have to engage enemies in different ways than you're used to, and the slow build-up in terms of weapons and enemies means even a novice player isn't going to get stuck
It also makes for great pacing
Overall, highly recommended
If you own HL2, go for it - if you don't, buy HL2 and then play this
It's worth it!			
Posted: 12 August
												Not much to say about this mod at the moment, since it's rather short, although it's supposed to get a couple new episodes in the future
Even then, after having played it, I feel it appropriate to write a review, as short as it might be
Half-Life 2: DownFall is a mod set after the events of Half-Life 2: Episode Two
While I'm not really fond of mods trying to continue Episode Two's story, considering the way they usually conflict with its ending, I can still appreciate them for their quality, and even their storytelling if it's good enough
In the case of DownFall, there's some minimal storytelling, and that's not bad; it feels somewhat similar to Lost Coast in that regard
As far as the gameplay goes, well, it's pretty much in typical Half-Life 2 fashion, nothing fancy there
I feel the pacing is pretty good, with some intense battles here and there
However, a few times I found myself confused as to what I was supposed to do, but I don't really blame the devs, since taking a good look at their level design, it seems they took a few cues from Valve's way of guiding the player; they just need to improve the implementation
To conclude, I'd say this is a pretty good mod, with a nice level of quality
It's not something I'd see as a continuation of Half-Life's story, but it still feels very fitting into the HL universe, like Lost Coast
So, in my view, this would be part of Half-Life's "Expanded Universe"
			
Posted: 8 September
												An awesome mod for sure
It's got great level design and is as fun as any main Half-Life game, but unfortunetly it's really short and ends on a cliffhanger
I hope to see it continued soon

												Oh, that's why it called downfall
Now I get it
Cool mod
I wish it would be continued
			
Posted: 3 September
												Felt like Half-life ended like Half-life
;)			
Posted: 17 April
												Downfall is a modification for Half-Life 2: Episode 2 that adds a few new singleplayer maps
Despite having a fairly unoriginal name there's clearly a lot of talent on display here
The maps look really nice and have lots of detail
There's plenty of Half-Life staples such as more exploratory moments coinciding right before big gunfights
There's lots of scripted triggers throughout that give the maps lots of life to them
The only issue is that it's unfinished
It's under an hour of gameplay total, and the mod ends on a cliffhanger promising more to come
I've played too many mods that ended like this that I'm still waiting on a follow up for
Only time will tell if there's really more planned, but for what they've released so far I can't wait
			
Posted: 23 April
												A great, but short mod that can be completed in roughly an hour
We drive by car, visit an outpost as well as go to a mine
Antlions, zombies, headcrabs and combine soldiers will all be at our throat during this short journey
The level design is great!I hope chapter 2 will be coming soon!

Short version: 83%Serious Sam can be considered the epitome of old-school FPS games: 100% pure action, non-linear levels filled with secrets, and hundreds upon hundreds of monsters to kill with a vast arsenal
Mindless first-person combat has rarely been this fun
Long version:When CroTeam, this small Croatian studio released Serious Sam: The First Encounter in 2001, probably even they didn’t think that their game will grow into one of the most successful indie FPS franchises
After all, on the surface, it looks like any other shooter from around 2000: half-linear levels where it is impossible to get lost yet have enough room to hide many secrets, all full of pickups to supply the player with health and ammo for the sizeable arsenal
The trick is that this simplicity hides excellent game mechanics
The action rarely stops, but it doesn’t try to tire out the player by not giving enough breathing room
The difficulty levels offer a balanced challenge to FPS newbies and grizzled veterans alike
(Just to illustrate: on ‘Serious’ difficulty, you meet over six thousand enemies during the course of the game
)The range of difficulties is only overshadowed by the available option in the engine itself
The Serious Engines were always famous of letting the player take control, but the first one really takes the top
Thanks to this awesome flexibility, the game ran on anything back then and looks surprisingly good even today, despite its old age
I’d lie if I said CroTeam put too much effort in the story: you play as Sam Stone, who was sent back to the source of all evil, ancient Egypt, to stop an alien warlord from eradicating humanity in the far future
Still, the writing is quite memorable, thanks to the corny one-liners and the overall nonsensical nature of some of the encounters that help to alleviate the stress after some especially adrenaline-pumping scenario
So, in a sense, the “story” does its job, like the rest of the game

												Definitely WAY ahead of its time, and still a great game to play if you feel like being on-edge and jumpy the entire time that you're playing :) The human-computer interaction is unique and like nothing I've ever seen before, the FPS action is intense, and the "scare factor" is there (You will soon dread the "clop clop clop" that announces the skeletons' approach)
Very worth the money, especially for its current price!

Posted: 7 June
												This game manages to start off even less tonally "serious" than the first one - if that's possible - but soon proves itself to have quite a bit more "depth" than its otherwise equally fun predecessor
Along with the endless and even more varied hordes of enemies, there's a tad more puzzle/problem-solving (granted, nothing that will tax all bar the feeblest of brains), and significantly more adventurous mapping and scenery
And slightly better graphics and a few more weapons, predictably enough
  Other than that, it's much the same deal as the First Encounter, only HARDER
Like, MUCH HARDER
It's quite literally "insane" at times in its difficulty, even on so-called Normal difficulty
Suffice it to say, if you enjoyed the original and aren't averse to an even greater challenge, purchase of this product is a bit of a no-brainer
Verdict: 9/10
			
Posted: 23 November, 2013
												As much as I liked The First Encounter, The Second Encounter is where it's at
Old school 3D shooter fun (not as old school as DOOM, of course) at its best
There's a difficulty for everyone
At the lowest setting, nobody should have a problem
At the highest setting, for the hardcore gamer in you, the game is still playable and tons of fun with hundreds if not thousands of enemies coming at you, all with their particular appearance, warning sound effect, powers and personality
You will rush for health and bullets, but always feel like you can overcome the odds and feel like a superhuman at the end of the day

Fast-paced and improves on the original // Best for those seeking an FPS throwback to simpler times+ Features three distinctive environments; a welcome change of pace compared to the first iteration+ Level design boasts a fair amount of variance, and the accessible areas are quite large; this helps to facilitate a lot of movement during firefights+ Game retains the polished gameplay of the original, with the improved level design adding to the overall experience+ As in the original, enemies attack in droves; spikes the difficulty, but keeps the adrenaline flowing+ Enemy mobs enjoy a slight increase in variation+ New monsters and somewhat better level design make for an experience that is less likely to feel tedious or redundant by the end of the game+ There are secrets aplenty, often behind hidden walls+ Visuals may not have aged well, but they are moderately impressive considering the year of release; compared to the first installment, there is a better use of color in the environment+ Solid, enjoyable gunplay mechanics- Weaponry remains much the same as in the original, with only three or four new additions to the player's arsenal- Online multiplayer appears no longer to be activeLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit

												I was actually going to do this review in order to complete those "Game Award Missions" but halfway through it, my childhood memories just flashed before my eyes leaving me with mixed feelings of joy and sorrow and all those feelings you know you feel but can't name, like everytime you think you hear a word calling your name or a smell from the past or when you finish an incredible game or a series that you wanted so badly to see its ending though at the same time never wanted it to end and like when you fall in love and this may be the reason I was feeling that way in the first place, this was one of the first games I played (along side with the Atari ones) and first one to ever be engraved into my mind and to my memories like a first lover does, which you will never ever forget about

Review Written on Thursday, February 11th, 2016 Review I wish all classic games were treated this way
The common two mistakes I see is complete laziness where DOSBox\ScummVM is used and nothing more or a game gets the Fable Anniversary treatment with new and improved graphics, but plays like crap
I personally only care about reliving the original Turok experience with all the bells and whistles this version offers (read the About This Game and Update History to learn more)
To any Turok fan criticizing the price because the game was released in 1997, I invite you to play both (N64+PC Classic) then try this version out because I promise you you'll never consider going back
For any non-Turok fans I recommend buying this game at $10
00 USD
There's really not much else for me to elaborate on other than saying checkout the Update History for this game because it's clear the developers really do love Turok
Edit: A Level Editor + Workshop Support was just incorporated and I wouldn't be shocked if Multiplayer is one day added since Turok 2 is being built from scratch (as this version of Turok was) on the same custom engine
Rating: 9
7/10 Pros:  No DOSBox\ScummVM nonsense
I got to relive the original Turok experience with tons of new game settings
A level editor is on the way
Mod SupportThe game has a fog reduction setting
This drove me crazy in the N64+Classic PC VersionsI finally got to play Turok in 1080p! Cons:  The price might be a deal breaker for non-Turok fans
If this is the case wait until the game goes on sale for $10
00Everyone has a different vision of how a game should be remastered
Thankfully it was remastered precisely to my expectations, but this might not be the case for you

												The best way to play Turok
The first time I really play Turok 1
I've always been a Turok 2 fan, and I gotta say, with modern control schemes It's a lot more enjoyable and killing enemies is still really satisfying
Graphically it has aged gracefully
Even the platforming sections are not as annoying as they were before but are still really bad
The keys to unlock new levels are hidden in some sadistic areas at times, and replaying the levels over and over again is frustrating
The difficulty is somewhat lower than the original, mainly because of the modern control scheme
Dying to an enemy is actually really rare and most death will be mainly due to bad platforming sections
The pricetag of 14
99 is honest, but when the sales are over, the game will raise it's pricetag to a less honest 19
99
The game is still great, and it definitely deserves 19
99 but it will be hard to convince someone to purchase Turok over, let's say, Resident Evil Rebirth
The gameplay shows it's age at times, but when you blast an enemy with the automatic shotgun and seeing him coughing up blood will never get old
The game is gory and it is absolutely satisfying to kill people in this game
Being lost in this huge map, looking for the key that is hidden on a hidden platform can be really frustrating but when you kill enemies, that's where the game really hits the spot
I recommend this game, but I recommend even more it's sequel, Turok 2
Since it's Turok 1 but better at every point
No more key hunting but objectives to do, you can dismember enemies (which is really awesome), a ridiculous amount of weapons etc


The port runs great, has tons of graphical settings and is very nice to look at
I can't thank enough Kaiser and the guys at Night Dive Studios for what they do

												Never have I EVER felt so happy about a Steam game
The music, the ambiance, it all literally brings tears to my eyes
This is a game I played when I was a kid
I got it when I was 7 and couldn't get past the first cave! I WAS TOO SCARED! When I finally did make it I felt like such a badass
Having my childhood returned to me in the form of my FAVORITE N64 game is SUCH an indescribable joy
I have played every Turok game from Dinosaur Hunter to, Seeds of Evil, Shadow of Oblivion and even Rage Wars, I still remember all the little hidden health packs and guns
Game runs smoothly and I am not a fan of the price but since this game holds a special place to me I will wear my nastalgia goggles and get it anyway
HOWEVER, unless you also have a pair of super awesome nastalgia goggles I would recommend waiting for a sale
A great blast from the past that should at least be played once by everyone who loves shooters

Early Access Review
								Holdfast: Nations At War was a long awaited game to succeed its closest predecessor in style - Mount and Blade Warband: Napoleonic Wars
It is set in the perilous reign of Napoleon Bonaparte, a French Emperor who managed to bring nations to their knees before a mighty coalition repulsed the tyrant and restored order to Europe
History lesson over
It is worth noting that despite the fact that I positively reviewed this game, it does have shortcomings, and unfortunately, they are quite critical to the feel of the game
I, personally, recommend it regardless


but if you were after a well-made game with relatively few flaws, this is not a title you should be looking at just yet
To start off with, the first thing you'll notice in this game is that the graphics are amazing
Keeping in mind that it was made by three developers who self-funded the project, it puts modern titles made by bigger companies to shame
The developers did an excellent job with everything about the visuals of this game, from adding realistic lighting, appealing textures, realistic weathers to which the environment realistically reacts and so much more
The gun smoke looks incredible and really helps to make the battles feel just that bit more immersive
The detail in the game is also incredible
The uniforms are designed very well, and look authentic to the era and the faction under which they are used
Weapons are historically accurate, and designed both differently and extremely well, with the French using the Charleville muskets - noticeably different to the British Brown Bess, and the officer's pistols also being accurate in design to that of their respective nation
Nothing in this game looks out of place
As well as looking, this game also feels very realistic
Aided immensely by the graphics and the detail that went into the authentic props and the battlefield carnage, the game also makes it surprisingly hard to identify friend from foe
This is not done in a game destroying way, but in that from a distance, you can see a soldier, but you cannot often make out his side
While the standard Red (British) and Blue (French) uniforms for line infantry are easy to understand, it is when you get Musicians, Sailors, and sharpshooters that you will find yourself firing at your own team
This is realistic, and such mistakes have happened in historical battles
The game also feels realistic with regards to how the weapons work
While reload times are not 30 seconds (because that would be boring) the sequence is accurate to that of the era, and how the weapons actually fire is too
You can be spread out in close quarter combat firing at each other with surprisingly few casualties - as it would have been like back in the day due the lack of reliability and accuracy of the weapons
This was the reason they used to fight in lines in the first place
And finally, the integration of Naval Battles and Coastal Siege etc was a very welcomed introduction
The cross over from land to Naval warfare all within one theatre of combat is wild, and extremely fun to take part in
The Naval battles do only feature small ships such as sloops, but they are well designed and take visible damage, as well as having many functional parts, and unlike Warband, the game can handle it
It is not glitchy and everything from the ship to the cannons to the muskets handle well
For all of its good points, though, there are things that let this game down, and they should be addressed, so as both to inform the buyer, and hopefully aid the developers in refining this so-far amazing project which they have undertaken
In no particular order, then, here are things about the game that I cannot praise: - The Melee
It uses a similar system to Warband in that there are 4 ways of block and attack (or two ways of attack for muskets) but the system is very badly made, and consequently, melee is unbelievably hard
Attack animations are slow, and not very responsive
Melee at the moment is a lot more down to luck than skill, unlike in Warband where skill was critical
This leads me on to responsiveness of controls in general
Switching from melee to shooting is slow, and sometimes does not work, which means that you cannot break your reload and will inevitably be killed as you can only walk while reloading a weapon
It would be nice to see this fixed, sooner rather than later
- No server filters
As of yet, you cannot filter out just the servers that you want, excluding those with high ping and no players, etc
For ease of use, this feature does need adding to the game, but while not convenient, it is not crippling to its quality
It is worth noting too, that sometimes the server player count is wrong, and will give the impression that there are a certain number of players on a server which is not true
It may be full, for example, or empty, and be showing 78 players in it
- No character customisation
This would be a much-appreciated feature to the game
I don't expect the choice of a female character if they are aiming for realism, but at least the option to do something with the appearance of your character would be welcomed by a lot of us
- Lack of nations and cavalry
The game has only got Navy and Infantry classes at the time of this review, and the only two nations available are France and the United Kingdom
The developers are working on adding more content to the game, though, so this isn't something that should put you off buying it
  - Lack of sub-classes in units, and descriptions of loadout etc
Finally, the only other disadvantage I can think of is that the spawn menu allows you to pick “Line officer”, “Line Infantry”, “Light Infantry”, “Rifles”, “Guards” etc, but there are no sub-options like there was in Mount and Blade: Warband
There is no way to play as a “Guard Captain” for example, or a “Rifleman Bugler” etc
This does feel quite limiting, and I hope that the developers will implement this feature soon
It would also be nice to see a description of each class’ loadout so we can assess the advantages and disadvantages of playing as one of them
As an extra level of detail, it would be good to have the option to change the loadout slightly where possible, say from a pistol as a sailor to a musket, which they would also have used
Overall, though, this game has done really well
It is only early days, and with a lot of support and feedback from the community, I feel like the developers can do a very good job of this title
You can tell that a lot of time and hard work went into the creation of it, and I am keen to see it succeed both for the developers and for the community
I would give this game a strong 7/10, for what we have is largely well made
It would just be so much better were the faults to be fixed, but of course, we must give them time
Thank you for taking the time to read my review

Early Access Review
The Good Stuff++Very active devs (A team of literally 3 guys) that constantly release bug fixes and updates and reply to user feedback to keep the game going
They're treating Early Access like it should be treated++An awesome community! Being as I bought this having played the Napoleonic Wars DLC for Warband for over 300 hours, I knew how good a community could be
I was expecting the same coming into this game and it is as good as I had hoped
Yes there's the occassional whiner or gamethrower, but in a game with 125-150 players it's expected there's at least one of those morons+Very nice graphics, colors are very vibrant and the characters look fairly sharp+Line battles, sieges and naval battles on 125-150 player servers+Multiple official servers that are always active plus fast respawns in the battle make it to where you are not sitting there for long when you are not engaged directly in combat, and therefore not bored waiting in a stale moment+Multiple unit types, each with their own specialties and design+Gunplay is very nice especially with the bullet drop
The weapons are for the most part historical accurate because they are somewhat more accurate than you'd think they'd beThe Ok Stuff=There's in game voice chat
You can imagine the chaos with 125 players talking at once for various reasons=I don't use it really and don't have trouble with it, but the artillery interface is difficult and confusing for some people to use=The interface for character voice commands (V key) is nice but also a little cluttered seeing as there's 50+ commands and it covers a chunk of the screen in the middleThe Bad Stuff-Certain controls are very slow to respond regardless of how good your computer is
(Crouching, melee attack, melee defense, reloading, and some minor ones)-When melee does work after a second or two, it's very buggy and rather random if you hit someone or get stabbed yourself
It's nowhere near as clean and sharp as the Napoleonic Wars DLCTL:DRA great alternate to the Napoleonic Wars DLC for Warband but the controls are rather unresponsive at times

Early Access Review
								my first game:I spawn as a carpenter on a large ship, with maybe twenty other people on it, in the middle of the ocean
We approach a fleet of British ships ready for a bloody fight
The boom of cannons and the ring of muskets deafen us as swarms of projectiles fly in our direction, smashing into our ship
We fire back, and watch with joy as the large metal balls from our cannons smash into the enemy
After about another minute of fighting, our ship is stuck between several of the enemy's
We are barraged until our ship slowly begins to sink into the water
The last few remaining crewmates boarded a nearby British ship, attempting to take control, but are quickly mowed down by musket-fire
I pushed a rowboat off of the ship, attempting to get away from the massive amount of bullets being shot in our direction
I watched as the rest of my crewmates were all easily killed
I hid in the water until the enemy boats had moved on to their next target, narrowly evaing death
I pulled myself up onto a lifeboat, looking for any other survivors in the debris
One man swam out of the wooden rubble and came aboard
I began to steer the boat toward a friendly ship
Suddenly, the man pulled out a violen and began to play the most beautiful songs, filling my ringing ears with wonderful tunes
We slowly made our way back towards the battle, all the way listening to his beautiful music
As we approached an enemy ship on out lifeboat, we drew our weapons, but were unable to get out of the way of the massive boat and were run over and killed
10/10 would die in a lifeboat listenting to music again

Early Access Review
								As somebody who has been active in the Napoleonic Wars Linebattle community for over 8 years now, starting back in Battlegrounds 2, and following Mount and Musket and M&B Napoleonic Wars, I was really looking forward to the early access release of Holdfast: Nations at War and from all what I have seen so far, I have not been disappointed although you can clearly see that the game is still in an Alpha Status
So let's start with a the pros & cons before going into the summary and recommendation:Pros:+ The games graphics are quite nice and enjoyable, especially on high graphic settings, although I must admit that the graphic style might not be liked by everybody
The graphic details especially  are really nice and show the devotion to the game by the developers
+ The game mechanics are, all in all, quite solid for an early access game compared to other early access games I have played so far
The game is playable and enjoyable, although you can clearly see that there is need for more updates, tuning and reworking things like the melee system
+ The different game modes are enjoyable and already have a high variation from 'Army Battle' - which is basically the Linebattle mode - over Siege, Coastal Siege or classic TDM to full Navy Battles where you fight ship against ship
Everybody who enjoys playing in the Napoleonic era can find a play style for himself
+ The great potential the game has to offer is also a positive argument for Holdfast in my opinion
Especially seeing the roadmap of the developers to include features like cavalry and more, I think that the game can become quite great
Although I am sure it is still a lot of work to include all the mentioned features and fixes, the current status of the game already shows the developers' devotion towards it
Cons- The game mechanics still show a kind of roughness, especially the melee system
There needs to be a reworking of this so that for example the melee fights become enjoyable and smooth
The hit-box detection can be quite frustrating at the moment when you hit an enemy on your screen but the hit is not counted, so your opponent doesn't take damage
The same goes for the Naval Battles where the end status of the ships is not taken into consideration for the round result - also the handling of the ships is quite weird in the sense of manoeuvring and hit reactions on enemy ships
These things need to be fixed soon, but I am confident that this is not a feasible goal
- The problem with high server latency is something that is currently being worked on but at the current state of the game it is quite a huge problem, because it makes playing on a full server nearly impossible
But as I said, the developers are currently working on this
- Some animations are missing or need some reworking, like for example the hit reaction in melee, which is missing at the moment
I would appreciate some reworking of the sword fighting animations since they look quite unnatural
Summary & RecommendationAll in all I can say Holdfast: Nations at War is a solid early access game in which you can learn the basic game mechanics and enjoy different game modes already with nice graphics
It is a great opportunity to get an impression of battles in the Napoleonic era although some things are tarnishing the game experience
The melee system needs reworking and attentive updates so it becomes smoother and more reactive towards the players mouse input, for example in blocking
Warband shows a very good example of how a smooth and quick melee system can work and I am sure the developers have this topic on their to-do-list
Still the very basic game mechanics are working and the game is not "unplayable" as some other reviews might suggest
For people like me, that enjoy the Napoleonic era in general, playing as a  Napoleonic soldier and fighting in melee or with a gunpowder weapon, may it be on land or on sea, it is an enjoyable experience already
Especially as soon as the high latency issue is fixed
But keep in mind that the game is still early access and some people might get frustrated by the weird hit-box detection or the very slow and unresponsive melee game play
If you expect to be frustrated by those current issues I would suggest you wait for further updates and development before you actually buy Holdfast
For everyone else I can recommend the game
As future updates release I will update the review

Early Access Review
								This video pretty sums up my experience with Holdfast https://www
youtube
com/watch?v=fCe4NXhxlfoFirst of all, this game has tons of protential and a lot of people are expecting way too much to be completed considering this is an alpha with its' first week of being released, and already the devs have done a lot
People need to understand that we pay for early access so devs recieve money to fund their game- that is the entire point of early access
It's good to know that they're using the money well, and I hope to see their dev team expand
On to the review
This game is pretty much the same as NW-Warband with the addition of enjoyable naval battles, naval sieges, better graphics and character animations
That isn't a bad thing, as Napoleonic Wars was perfect in its' own way, it's great to see a game that was left barren by the community be revived in Holdfast
I rejoined a regiment I left almost 3 years ago, and have been addicted to it since release
The problem is; this game will not survive under nostalgia
I seriously do hope that they can add far more than their planned tornuments, maybe in the far future, a coop campaign to play in all of Napoleons battles with your regiment and to fight against large AI armies could be a promising change of pace for those who don't always want a loose multiplayer experience and might want a fun campaign in their with characters
And should Holdfast be stuck in the Napoleonic wars? I don't think so, why not move this into multiple eras and fronts
The War of 1812, the American Revolution, the American Civil War, the 7 years war and so on
I'm sure once mods are enabled, people will attempt these anyway- but why not include them into the base game? Of course, this is all far out of the minds of the devs who are just trying to build upon the base game
Though I hope they read this and consider the massive possibilities of creating a huge game that people will come back to for years
I would not want to see this game fade like NW
Anyway, this is just my first review
Once the devs move this into beta, I'll make a final opinion on it
I recommend this ONLY IF you are willing to push through expected bugs from an early access game
These guys aren't AAA, they are a small team and have done a great job so far and are already active in fixing bugs
Buy at your own risk
If you aren't an NW player, then you may feel less inclined to play this until it has more content

								NOTE: I have been bug testing this game for the last 3 months, these opinions of the game are my own and I have not been paid to say them, the developers of the game have given me a key to bug test and help with stress tests other than that as of the 21st of september I'm just another player like everyone else, these are my honest opinions on the game
Holdfast: Nations at War is a beautiful Napoleonic Era game, the sounds are truly stunning and never fail to impress, I've been following this game for sometime now and have seen it develop so much! With new updates and content comming soon for this game this is for sure a good purchase for those who love this era! Pros:- Stunning graphics- Great community- Amazing sounds- Smooth gameplay (not so much animations)- Perfect shooting mechanics - Musicians!- Interesting maps- Nice admin commands once you learn how to use them- Easy to form formations- In game voice chat is a nice touch too- Nice developers- And lots more- Server Lobby Filters- Admin Panel!Cons:- Currently the melee is a little lacking but that will improve over time- Naval optimisations could be better- Some animations aren't very smoothFor £15 you can't go wrong! The game is for sure worth a buy and people should give the game a chance if they're unsure :)

												My wife passed away in 2008
It was a very difficult time for me and my son
I was working long hours and trying to raise my baby daughter
My son was just entering middle school
Life was hitting both of us hard
He was depressed most of the time
His grades started falling that year
I couldn't spend all too much time with him because of work
I had to stay at the office late most nights to pay for the nanny for my baby daughter
I bought him a playstation earlier that year
I was always into games, and I got the feeling he liked games too
He had a ds which he liked to play Kirby on
While I could never find the time to game, my coworker Stephen would always tell me about the current gems
He got me to buy my son Little Big Planet
Stephen would always talk to me about Fallout 3
He told me about the brilliant dialogue and character choices
I thought about buying it for my son, but he was still only 12 and he was still performing poorly in school
One day, Stephen started chatting me up about a new Fallout game that had come out- Fallout New Vegas
Right before Christmas (my son is 13 now) I decided to buy it for my son
He was thrilled and surprised
He had never had an fps
He told me he had played one once at a friends house but that was it
He rarely went to friends' houses anymore
That Christmas I got a raise at work
I spent the holiday relaxed with my kids
I was initially concerned when I saw all the racism, gambling, and alcohol and drug consumption in the game
The game even opened to a scene of the player being shot! On top of that, the game was very difficult
My son often made me trade off with him, but I did not do much better
Desert exploration was a deathwish! I had a little get-together on New Years and had some friends over and I used it as an opportunity for Stephen to help my son and I in the game
I had to get back to work, but my son's break from school hadn't ended yet
He stayed home and gamed while I sat at work and day-dreamed about New Vegas
I managed to find most of the songs from the game and I would listen to them on my computer at work
Heartaches By The Number, Get Me Some Money Too, and Blue Moon were and still are my favorites
At night when I would get home, we would eat dinner as a family and he would give me updates
We would smile and laugh and talk about some more adult themes
I found this game to be a great way to bond with my son
The week ended and my son went back to school
I told the nanny to try to help him manage his time with the game and homework
She made me pay her extra for that
At the end of the year, my son brought home his report card
All A's second semester! I was so proud of him
I would later buy him Fallout 3, and I would find more time to spend with my son and daughter
My son continued to do good in school
In High School, he got a job
I would help him buy new games, but he made his own money
He would have friends over and they would all play the new Call of Duty
I gave him my car in 2014
He said it was the happiest day of his life
My son is in college now
He calls me regularly
I help to pay for his needs, but he still has his old high school job
Now I try to spend quality time with my daughter
She is very smart and pretty
I've never missed one of her soccer games
She is very popular so she is always saying the night at her friends house
I eat dinner by myself, but I smile as I sit at our dinner table and I remember feeding my daughter, sitting on my lap, while my son talks to be about Caesar's Legion
After dinner, I sit at my computer and play New Vegas
It is the best game ever made
Maybe if Obsidian makes another Fallout game, I can have my son over again

Fallout: New Vegas, is it for you?If you are considering picking this game up, but not sure if you'll like it, here are some things I liked and disliked
What I liked:Character Customization:The amount of character customization is really up there
Virtually unlimeted posibilities when making a character
(Not as much as TES: Skyrim, but really close)
Mod Support:The modding community is very expansive for a game that has been out sinse Oct, 23 2010
If you can think of something, it probably exist!Open World:Depending on what version you buy (Standard or Ultamite edition), you will have plenty to do
Sights to see, things to shoot! Weaponry: Fallout: New Vegas is full of many types of weapons
Everything from M4 carbines to helicopter propeller swords! But don't forget that there are mods for anything you desire
Hardcore Mode:Want something more realistic to a real life apocolypse? Well Fallout: New Vegas has a "Hardcore" mode you!Multiple Playthroughs:There's not just one way to experience New Vegas, but four ways!What I disliked:Crashing:Fallout: New Vegas will crash on you at least once or twice
Whenever it does it can be anouying having to go back and redo quest that you've completed
Navmesh:Despite the occasional crash, the navmesh in this game works, but is a little sloppy
Sometimes NPCs will walk into walls and furniture
But it is easliy overlooked when you get further into the game
(You may even find it funny)PC abilities:This game is not the most demanding game for a PC, but can effect your overall experience of it
(I
E
glitching, FPS drops, and crashes)So what's the difference between the standard edition and the ultimate edition?     The ultimate edition is the standard game, but with all of the DLC will it
Yes it cost an extra $10
00 but is worth it compared to buying the standard edition for $9
99 and all the DLC for $22
94
 All-in-all:Fallout: New Vegas is a good solid game for the money
You'll find yourelf captivated by it's charm and want to play evenmore of it
It does get a little dull after a while, but does have a fantastic modding community
I would purchase the Ultimate Edition instead of the Standard, just my opinion
Steam does have The GECK in the tools section which will allow you to make mods for the game

												One of my all-time favourite games, I really enjoyed it and I spent many, many hours playing this
The huge amount of choices, factions and playstyles the game gives you, makes you want to experience every single one
The story may be a bit weak and the graphics a bit rusty (same engine as Fallout 3)
This is however beaten by an awesome gameplay (modable weapons!), a brilliant atmosphere set in sin city, nevada and its surroundings and also 4 high quality DLCs (I strongly recommend Lonesome Road, because of its story and revelations)

												The Wild West meets the Fallout Post Apocalyptic world and a great game is born
Fallout: New Vegas is an open world RPG set in a Post Apocalyptic world
Where Fallout 3 was set in D
C
this game is set the Mojave desert around the ruins of old Las Vegas
The theme throughout this game is a western one, but many different factions are present, each with their own unique (and often hilarious) style
And of course there is a power stuggle between a pre-war industrialist, Caesers legion and the New California Republic is under way and you are about to be thrown into the middle of it
What will you do?This game is filled with great characters, hilarious dialogue and so many entertaining quests that it would be hard to do them all in a single play through
The DLC adds many more hours of fun although it is quite varied in flavour and in value, but all of them are worth playing at least once
The exception might be Lonesome Road, which most people loved but I had some issues with, especially with one decision it forces you to take that I felt was not one any of my characters would ever have made
But Old World Blues may be my favourite DLC for any game ever
The first fifteen minutes had me crying with laughter
When you add the fact that the modding communty is adding more of everything, this game could provide several hundred hours of play time and still have things to offer

												Got addicted to every available substance, started scavenging to get more and more drugs to fight off the withdrawal
Punched a car sized scorpion and hid in a bathroom, drinking irradiated toilet water until I was close to death
Then I started playing Fallout: New Vegas and I thought it was pretty fun
Hits home with an easy 8/10

												This game is a very mediocre shooter in its design
- It's extremely linear
I don't know if I've ever played a more linear game
With the exception of going down and back out some corridors, it's basically just one big twisty line from beginning to end, and you feel very funneled
It doesn't even present you with the illusion that you're deciding which way to go
There's even a point in the plot where the character is complaining about not knowing where he is or where he's going, implying he's just wandering
But while your character is being supposedly aimless, you continue to follow the one, singular, only path and funnel conveniently directly where you need to go to advance the plot
And speaking of which--- The plot is very thin, very predictable
There are no surprises at all
- It doesn't reward exploration
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if there is any point in the entire game where you can slip off the beaten path, you should never take it
There's never anything interesting there
- All the enemies are super samey
There are fast zombies, and slow zombies, and that's it
The zombies also never do anything particularly clever
Even in Left 4 Dead, they had behavior which was interesting (leaping over obsticles in interesting ways, smashing through doors) but this game doesn't have any of that
Once you get the strategy for how to take them down you're pretty much covered and you're not going to squeeze much more entertainment out of the combat
- It's short
I got through it in about five hours and I'm a slow player
- The cave section is too dark
The point of having a VR headset is to have a lot of paripheral vision and to feel surrounded, but when you have to play without the ability to see anything except for a super thin beam from a flashlight, you might as well be playing with a mouse and keyboard because you experience the same tunnel vision
And despite all of that, the game is great and you should play it, because VR
I'm being serious
The immersion is great, the environments are decent enough to enjoy moving around in them, and they genuinely cared about making the controls comfortable in VR
History won't look kindly on this game
It won't age well at all
But if your goal is to play a game which is a full experience, which is not just a clumsy port of a non-VR game, then this is one of your very few options
I'm excited to see how many of these game elements will persist as VR game design matures, and how many will disappear forever, much like the early-generation idiosynchricies of the past, like Mario 64's camera controls or pressing B to jump or using the keyboard to look around in a shooter
To sum it up, if you're a VR enthusiast, buy this game

												Pros:-Large variety of guns-Story campaign (took me 3
6 hrs to beat the campaign)-Me and my wife(who just watched) enjoyed to narration of the campaign-Guns shoot accurately, if you line up the sights you'll get a headshot almost everytime
-Variety of scenery in the game, 3-4 very different areas: desert, cave, industrial, desert towns-Shooting tons of zombies in the faceCons:-Glitchy lights at times-Poppy textures/scenery at times-Constanly getting stuck on stuff when using trackpad locomotion-Short campaign? 3
5 hours on normal difficulty-Lots of things you want to pickup but cantOverall:I have not tried horde mode yet, but the campaign alone is worth at least $20
I still have some time to put into this title with multiplayer
I paid $32 and that price seems fair to me

												Most of the negative reviews for this game have been over the i7 wall, which has since been removed
If you're still giving them a negative review for this, because of some misplaced belief that their decision was "unforgivable", then please at least take the time to read this: https://www
reddit
com/r/Vive/comments/5h51dd/the_hard_truth_about_virtual_reality_development/
I bought my Vive months ago, but outside of showing it off to friends and family, I haven't really used it
Why? Because most of the content available for it so far has been little more than tech demos or wave-based shooters
They're fun for a little while, but they get old, fast
Arizona Sunshine is exactly what I want from a true VR game
It has a goal that you progress towards by moving around in and interacting with the world
And what a world! The game's atmosphere and art-style is great, and there have been several moments where I just stop and look around at the scene around me going "Wow"
To top it off the player narrator is actually funny enough to make you laugh and enjoy listening to
Combat can be intense, with occasional "challenges" being faced in levels coming in the form of a hord--usually associated with pulling levels or pressing buttons to activate something, an elevator or door, for example
There is a good variety of weapons scattered throughout the levels to up the fun, everything from different pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, and grenade launchers, to special in-place weapons like sniper rifles or a minigun
It all adds up to a very satisfying experience
This isn't a tech demo or yet another wave-based shooter showing the promise of what VR could be: it actually delivers on that promise
Well worth the money!

Arizona Sunshine is a story-oriented roomscale shooter for Vive and Rift
In the single-player campaign, which I spent about 5 hours exploring, the player steps into the shoes of the unnamed protagonist in the aftermath of an apparent zombie apocalypse
Hearing a garbled but recognizably human voice on the radio, he resolves to track it down, along with the safety it implies, through the eponymous Arizona countryside
Despite being a zombie shooter, the atmosphere isn't horror-laden nor filled with jump scares, although having one of the undead stumble up behind you in a pitch-black cave is guaranteed to wake you up a little
The zombies themselves consist of a diverse handful of base models, apparently randomly customized by movement speed, ranging from aimless stumbling to 28 Days Later, as well as a variety of addons: fungal growth, helmets/hardhats, body armor, and the like
Playing Arizona Sunshine actually gave me some insight into various zombie movies, in the sense that I found myself in danger of being overwhelmed, on multiple occasions, by a not-that-large group, simply by virtue of having to manage my movement, ammunition levels, reloading, and firing in multiple directions
The environments are well-executed and stylistically cohesive: you might take a hiking trail along the wall of a canyon to travel between two outdoor areas, thread your way between abandoned cars on a highway overpass, or play hide-and-seek with zombies in a deserted railyard
Although the player is generally "directed" via barriers, dead ends, or impassable terrain, it feels natural overall, and there's little risk of becoming lost
Locomotion occurs via a combination of meatspace movement and teleportation, with instant warping for stairs and ladders
Each teleport is limited to the distance of a few steps, and the player is (fairly enough, in my opinion) blocked from warping through objects, including movable parts of the environment, like car doors
Weapons are motion-controlled, as one would expect, and feature realistic aiming using the sights of the various guns
I felt that the aiming became unreliable quite a bit closer than I would have expected, but that may have been an intentional design choice, or I may just be worse than I think at sighting without the subconscious cues of a real weapon's weight and balance
Many of the items in the game are physically interactive, although not nearly as many as I would expect for a medium where the ability to handle things within the game space is one of the main differentiators from traditional games
Items that are significant in some way are clearly marked, once the player is close enough, helping to avoid the situation where that one item you need is hidden in plain sight as you search all around it
The game is unique, or nearly so, in that it takes a number of tropes from its traditional FPS predecessors and smoothly extends them into VR: the quickly-encountered locked door whose key just happens to be in the farthest accessible area, the agonizingly slow elevator/door/etc
that meanwhile attracts all nearby enemies, the vital piece of machinery whose handful of unique missing parts are scattered in opposite directions, the seemingly unconquerable hostile horde that appears just after the player acquires a powerful new weapon
As such, Arizona Sunshine is a great step into the arena of story-focused VR shooters, and a promising glimpse of the potential awaiting us

												I really have no idea what the people that leave negative reviews for this game are talking about
 Framerate issues? -  I've never had a single one
 It's too hard? - Practice or something, it's not a hard game
 The guns don't shoot straight? -  Of course they do
They never fix problems? -  There are hotfixes and updates very regularly
The graphics are bad? - I have no idea what you were expecting
The multiplayer doesn't work? - It didn't work great the first week or so, but it's been incredibly easy to connect and play since then
The flashlight isn't held correctly? - That's the tactical way to hold a flashlight, but if you don't like it, just hold the controller differently
The guns aren't loud enough?  - Turn up the volume
The game constantly crashes?  - It's never crashed once for me
I haven't seen a single complaint that makes sense to me
 In my opinion, this is a great game for VR, and definitely one of the best (and possibly THE best, depending on what you like) VR games out there
 I'm sure there will be those of you out there that will tell me that my opinion isn't better than anyone else's, and I agree
 I'm simply stating my own opinion and why the negative reviews I've seen don't make sense to me
 To me, this is a great game and I highly recommend it to anyone that has VR

												OMG OMG OMG!!!! I played this multiplayer horde mode and 2 player campaign and it was amazing
Best VR game yet!!!! Wish horde mode had other scenes though!!! Please add more! maybe one from each level!???!!!!! This is AAA!!!!!******2nd review***Ok so the hubby and I just BEAT the game doing 2 player Co-op
He was using oculus touch in one room, while I was on the Vive in the other,  and it was amazing
We couldn't stop playing, just took 5 min breaks between each level
 Super fun, I have never spent this much time in VR before
This gives me so much hope!!!!****3rd review,***as you can see we have put in over 60 hours with this game
The hubby and I and a few of his friends play horde mode alot after work
Takes some stress off
Super fun still
To be honest this is really the best (Full) VR game out there right now that I have played
I just can't wait for more games like this one to come out
 If you haven't played this game, you HAVE TO GET IT!!!!!!!

												So then, Arisona Sunshine


I want to be fair and tell you, dear potential customer, the truth
The game is relatively short and extremely linear
The map at times feels cheap and unpolished, while the last 2 chapters feel especially rushed and unfinished
There are bugs with light, texture clipping, and AI is dumb
I still recommend it
Why?It you can overlook the things at which the game falls short, you will have an experience like no other (so far!)
The unbelievable immersion, the original solutions to things that shouldn't really work in VR, the dynamic combat in the dead world of Arizona desert gifted me a desire to play it again, on an Apocalyptic difficulty
It at times feels like a Left 4 Dead on meth, even with bugs and unpolished areas
It made me want an open-world zombie apocalypse in VR; I will be waiting with a baited breath for DLC (and hopefully some changes to the levels which are substandard)!I would say that the fun I had - and the fun my friends will have when coming over to my place and trying this game out - is worth the 19
99 dollars I've spent on it
I will once again point out that the game is not without its flaws; yet, the dynamic battles, the beautiful landscapes, the voice acting that made me smile quite a few times and the atmosphere of solitude that slowly transforms into despair makes Arizona Sunshine, you guessed it, shine
Give it a try
P
S
Oh yes, one more thing
As a person that admires freedom, I tend to stay away from linear games; this, however, is one of the very few exceptions

												UpdateLooks like they removed their artificial lock in the game due to the backlash but this shouldn't of happened in the first place
I already got my refund but don't really want to turn around and hand them the $40 (CDN) back
Maybe once a steam sale hits or something, oh well, I vote with my wallet!----------------------------------------------------------------------The developer has LOCKED part of the game for 7th gen i7 owners ONLY and does not list this on the store page anywhere
I have a i5-2600k that runs the game and the "i7advanced settings" just fine, this CANNOT be allowed to happen to the computer game industry
From the 30 mins that I played the game was quite decent too
+ Nice and bright colours+ Pleasing atmostphre+ your character speaking out loud was a nice touch-------- Only had a few issues -------- Game crashed right after calibration- Some dead zombie parts strobing- Some jaggies/antialisasing issues where the sides and jaggies were white
- Gun felt very small as did your hands- Aiming felt a bit off, shots that felt straight were quite off
