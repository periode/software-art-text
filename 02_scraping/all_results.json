That person is not going to change and you can't expect him or her to be truthful... ever. They will always be fake.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps the most obvious impact that lying has on a relationship is the erosion of trust one person has in the other. Lies and trust cannot easily coexist; eventually the former will destroy the latter\n\nTrust is so essential for a strong and successful relationship that when it is lost, the chances of total collapse are very high.\n\nBeing told the truth, no matter what it may be, confers the feeling of respect upon the recipient. It proves to them that the other person places significant value upon the relationship and is not prepared to jeopardize it by deceiving them.\n\nWhile some truths will clearly put a relationship at risk, lies tend to be even more damaging. Telling someone the truth, even if you know it will hurt them, shows that you are willing to take responsibility for your actions; lying shows nothing of the sorts.\n\nOnce you uncover a lie for the first time, it is hard not to live in expectation of future untruths from that person. You begin to question what they are saying, passing their words through your internal alarm systems in order to detect any hint of dishonesty.\n\nThe problem is that having to be on perpetual high alert for bullshit puts a real strain on the interactions between the two of you.\u00a0\n\nWhen someone lies, they are essentially putting their own self interest before those of others. Their unwillingness to make a sacrifice for the greater, long term good of a relationship is another indicator that they do not place a high value on it.\n\nLies can also be an indication of more widespread selfishness and disregard for the other party, which can make them feel unloved and unwanted.\n\nAn often overlooked consequence of lying is that the perpetrator is also being untruthful to themselves. In attempting to conceal the truth from other people, they are refusing to reveal their genuine wants and desires to the world.\n\nIn essence, they are denying their true identity and seeking to be someone that they are not.\u00a0\n\nThe person doesn't exist. They are but a lie themselves, they are fake.\u00a0\n\n\nWhere lying becomes commonplace, no relationship can survive intact. Lying spells death to any relationship - be it love or a friendship. Lies are insidious and hurtful and destructive.", "Crossed paths in Central Park near the Great Lawn.  If you weren't with your man I would have approached you.

The questions are surging, the longing is unbearable, and you are still aching to find some relief. You are exhausted, but this is no ordinary exhaustion. It is sacred. It is the end of one world and the beginning of another. Stay close. In these moments, which may always arise in the heart of an open, sensitive human being, slow way down. Touch the earth, look up into the sky, listen to the song of the unseen. Dare to consider that things are not always as they appear. Today may not be the day for answers, but to finally let your heart break open to the vastness of the question. You are not a project to be solved and you were never unhealed. With eyes wide open, see that you could never lose the way. The unfolding of the heart is the work of a lifetime and there is no urgency on the path of love.\"\n-- Matt Licata", "I saw you you today . You were the very attractive lady with the red lipstick .
