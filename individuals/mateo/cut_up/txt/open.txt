PUBG is the type of game where it starts off with not caring too much if you die in the first few minutes (approx 90 players alive), after a little while and some reasonable loot and gear has been found, you would prefer not to die at this point but still not too fussed if you die (approx 60-70 players alive)
 After the 3rd/4th blue circle,You start to believe that you can achieve the impossible..
you could possibly win..
you'll taste the sweet fruits of victory..
(10 players remaining)..
you've made it to top 10...
but you still want more...
no more mistakes or joking around now..
you're close...
(last 2 players)..
you believe in this..
you can win
 But alas..
you make an idiotic mistake
 You end as #2....
that moment will haunt you forever..
This is what will happen every game, you'll feel rage, anger and above all serenity when you die because you know that the game is over...
until you start the next one
 Welcome to the battleground

For those of you getting severe FPS lag on Nvidia cards, try the following steps:(do this with the game closed)1
 Open Nvidia control panel2
 Go to 3D settings3
 Set the options for PUBG specifically (listed something like TSIgame)4
 Enable threaded optimization
Apparently adding " -USEALLAVAILABLECORES" to launch options (without the quotes) fixes it which is an option for people without Nvidia or its control panel
 Edit: It seems this is more or less helpful for potato CPUsEdit again: I have no idea whether or not this still works

I love this game
It's really fun and an amazing experience to play with friends
However, there are two things are that holding this game back
The streamers and the developers
Arguably, the streamers are the ones that made this game famous but as of right now, they are ruining it with the help of the developers
"There are two rules for success..
Number one, never reveal everything you know
"The Streamer
These are the people who cry and whine about stream sniping
I have to be completely honest, I feel sorry for these guys..
For being complete morons
If you're going to complain about stream snipers then whine to the developers otherwise you're not going to play their game anymore, you need to shut up and get out

I'm not usually a Battle Royal player, but this game is perfect for my play style
 ARMA is too "hard core" for meH1Z1 is too arcadeish for me
PUB fits right in between those two, and it is really well done
Looking forward to the next 6 months to see how the games progress with the optimization the devs will focus on
100% worth the price tag

First of bugs, bugs, bugs
Posted: 26 October
Fellow gamers and curious consumers, take this honest but probably biased and most importantly very unprofessional review as a friendly advice
Performance
- The developers promised that the PC version was being developed in parallel with the other versions and their words seem to hold ground, I am seeing almost limitless settings to choose from and the game performs very good on my rig (i7 4790 + GTX 970) on High-Very High mixed settings
 Surprisingly the Anti-Aliasing can only be set from Off to High, it doesn't specify what you are choosing (FXAA,SMAA), same thing goes for Shadows which can only be set from Very Low to Ultra High, I am not seeing TXAA or PCSS GameWorks and honestly I am glad about it
You can also customize the HUD Presets where you can turn off the damage numbers for example and generally reduce the amount of feedback you are getting on your screen
There is love displayed for the PC version and I am very thankful about that :) Controls
- I am playing as usual using Mouse and Keyboard and the controls seem responsive..
at least for me, as for controller support I don't know much (since I play almost all my games using M+K) other than there seems to be Xbox controller support...
as expected I guess
 Gameplay
- It is the first time Assassin's Creed goes RPG and loot-based (I don't count Unity and Syndicate despite them apprehending some watered down RPG elements) and I can't say if this is good or bad for the series since taste is subjective so you be the judge, however the game hasn't fully departed from its stealth and action-adventure roots
The previous Ubisoft mechanics are still present, some of them implemented in their own interesting and different but yet familiar way
 For example the horse carriage riding from Assassin's Creed Syndicate is present as a chariot racing minigame, or the drone/owl as your pet eagle etc
 There are some minor bugs and glitches here and there (at least what I have encountered so far) but in my book they are acceptable for a game of this scale and they don't really bother me that much
 However the AI needs some improvement because it can be really dumb sometimes and ruin the immersion for me, also some of the animations are weird and stiff, nothing game breaking but it would be nice if these issues get sorted out with a future patch
 Combat
- Now this is the biggest change in Origins, the combat has shifted from animation-based system (or unscripted QTE if you will) to a hitbox-based system and I repeat, taste is subjective so whether you will enjoy or hate the new combat system is up to you, but I can tell you this much, it plays and feels better than it looks
 Story
- Ubisoft over the last few years have been submissive (unfortunately) to a certain demographic and have been delivering some really lame story writing and shoving completely unneccessary modern political beliefs down our throats
 As a result of this, the ''charming and intriguing mystery'' as I like to call it that the previous Assassin's Creed stories built is gone
 I don't use this term often but I cringed through my entire playthrough of Assassin's Creed Syndicate and Watch_Dogs 2, both having the weakest writings in Ubisoft's catalog and their Disney bubbly characters with their over the top forced positivity made me sick, but hey Ubisoft, it's fine...
you do you
 I brought all that up because in this game they have ditched the Disney part at least, with Bayek being more mature, reliable and interesting than the previous sitcom toddlers Jacob and Marcus, however the rest...
well I won't go deeper than what you already know and have seen so far on YouTube due to spoiler issues so I will leave that experience and judgement to you
 Graphics
- Amazing graphics as expected with no downgrades whatsoever, what was shown on E3 is delivered here
 A joy to look at that beautifully rendered draw distance, and the beautiful color palette choice makes this game look absolutely stunning
 Ashraf Ismail and his team have really created the best looking Egypt themed game on the market currently
 Soundtrack
- I don't think the Assassin's Creed franchise has ever disappointed me in this regard, from trailers to ingame, the music has always been beautiful, eargasmic and most importantly fitting, and Ubisoft has delivered the all said points with this one as well
Thanks for taking the time to read this review but I would strongly recommend you read more detailed and professional reviews regarding the PC port (benchmarks), check gameplay footage on YouTube to see if the game appeals to your taste and make up your own mind instead of having your opinion swayed by ''game journalism-ing''
Posted: 31 October
I thought the other reviews were being hyperbolic but this game really does suffer some serious performance issues
 Maybe its the DRM, I don't know but this is the first game in a long time that I've seen give my PC problems even at lower settings
Posted: 31 October
The game itself is brilliant from what I have played but I stopped before my CPU consumed itself
I'm getitng 60% CPU usage on the Title screen
I-5 3
2ghz Quad Core8GB RamGTX 1080 Asus Strix (Oc'd)100% usage on all cores and 40% usage on GPU
60 FPS in the desert and 30 fps in towns and cities
Posted: 31 October
VMProject and Denuvo using 40% of CPU while we are playing this game haHAA clapChange that and I'll change the rate
Edit: Running on:intel i5 4690k @ 4
3GHzMSI nvidia GTX 97016GB ramSamsung SSD 850 EVOThe game is going on high settings except for AA wich is on low(in the cities go from 45-60fps), is sad to see that my gpu doesn't even go further 80% of usage and 70% power while the CPU is running all the time at 100%, not even BDO take that much CPU
Well, the game is really good on itself from what I've played, if it wasn't for that excessive use of CPU everybody would be happier, and if everybody is happier, that mean more sells wink wink
Posted: 27 October
TL;DR -- This game has LOTS of bells and whistles (open world size/depth, graphical prowess) and lots of polish, but the core mechanics (fighting, climbing, and stealth) are actually a step back from Syndicate
Detail --I have a really hard time choosing between the "Yes" and "No" answer to whether I recommend this game
 There are some things it does so well that it's just a joy to play; the environments are stunningly well-crafted and the graphics are gorgeous
 But there are also some features it's either completely missing or does so poorly it leaves me wanting to bang my head against the wall because they detract from what could have been such a better game
 It also runs very shakily, with regular, ugly frame drops
If you adore the series like me, then go ahead and pick this up
 You'll get enough out of it to make it worth a purchase (as I feel I did)
 But if you're not a fan then skip Origins unless you love Egyptian history
 This game won't convert you
 And I'd go even further to say that if you're lukewarm on the series, you probably want to skip this, too
 All it really does well is open world and soundtrack
 So unless one of those two are something you love in a game, you're probably not going to like Origins enough to spend $60 on it
I'm pretty stunned that there are a number of things this game actually does worse than its predecessor, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, which is a game that many consider to be one of the poorer entries in the series
For starters, free climbing is an absolute mess in Assassin's Creed Origins
 The reinvention they worked so hard on in Unity with the Free Climb Up and Free Climb Down buttons, and the perfection of that system into what I consider the smoothest free climbing in the series in Syndicate is completely gone from Origins, which instead has reverted to the absolutely terrible "One Button to Free Climb" system that birthed the frustrating moments of the worst game in the series (in my opinion), Assassin's Creed III
 Get ready to randomly jump off walls into the middle of 8 enemies in a courtyard when you're trying to stealth, or to begin climbing up the wall next to you when you're just trying to reposition yourself in the middle of a fight
 In addition to this, what you can climb is not really indicated visually anymore
 Some buildings have clear grooves that are not usable as handles, and there are statues that have no handholds whatsoever that are easily scaleable
 Some spaces seem to far to jump but you can with ease, others seem clearly in reach but are not
 It's completely arbitrary and leaves you feeling railroaded

Actively tanking the game's performance with extra anti-piracy methods is absolutely disgusting and inexcusable
Posted: 26 October
Cheap laptop with Geforce 940M: >runs becnhmark:
15 fps average
:c>enables adaptive resolution>runs bench
 again:
almost constant 30 fps, without big loses in quality
Posted: 4 November
So this installment is about as close to perfect as you could expect
 With about 35 hours in the game so far, I personally believe this is the best of the series
 The map is immense, the graphics stunning, and the story line is quite awesome
There are so many side quests, it's hard to decide which one to do next
 I found the underwater swimming easier to navigate this time around as well as the character movement
In short, it is very hard for me to find a solid complaint about this game that would not sound like nit-picking
Posted: 31 October
Bought and refunded
 Listen to everyone people
 My computer has more than enough for this game and my Fps was clipping down to 15 every 5 seconds or so
 After about 15-20 minutes in the lag and black screen flicker was too much to even get to enjoy playing the game
SO;Do not buy till they fix the anti piracy software (by removing it) because it will run like trash
The game it self seemed kind of fun for the five minutes I got to actually enjoy
Posted: 29 October
I'll just say it, I love this game
 If you've played Assassin's Creed games in the past, you pretty much know what to expect here
 It's not doing anything we haven't seen in other games or pushing any boundaries, but it's a ton of fun and well worth your time and money
Pros+ Beautiful world set in a truly interesting setting (ancient Egypt)
 It's a joy to get lost in exploring
 I've had many times where, on the way to a quest objective, I've run off to see what's going on over there and suddenly it's an hour later and I'm no closer to my quest objective
+ Open-world stealth done well, though not quite up to the outstanding MGSV
 I love assaulting forts, taking my time in picking off all the guards one by one
 Using Senu (your pet hawk) to scout is a neat way to prepare your infiltration
+ A TON of things to do
 Side quests are (mostly) well-written, varied, and fun
 The main story so far (I'm 20 hours into the game at the time of writing) is intriguing, and I'm excited to see where it leads
+ RPG-lite mechanics
 XP from kills, loot, ability points for new skills
 Again, nothing too complex but it fits the game well
Cons- Overall it feels like they played it safe and went for accessibility over complexity
 Like I said before, there's not much new here that we haven't seen
 - Melee combat can be clumsy
 I appreciate that they went away from the Batman style to a more dodge and position based combat system, but it doesn't feel entirely..
 finished
- Occasional graphics glitches
 I had to restart the game once, and it went away
- Uplay
 If you've enjoyed other Assassin's Creed games, and like the idea of exploring ancient Egypt, pick this game up

Let's see:-Game releases in Early Access with a lot of promise-As it does Larian constantly outdo them selves with updates-They vastly increase the complexity of the AI-Improve the progression in several ways-Give us two well developed and deep extra skill trees-Create a truly grand undead race with interesting mechanics-AGAINST ALL ODD include full voice acting for a game with the amount of dialogue-And include a fully orchestral soundtrackAnd the reviews for this masterpiece of a game are going down because some Russians got salty over the translations being delayed a bit
 This game lost it's Overwhelmingly Positive rating simply because they didn't manage to translate all of the 80,000 or so lines of dialogue in time for the release
 Seriously
EDIT: To everyone asking, the game is FULLY voice acted, every NPC, no matter how insignificant has a voice
 That is somewhere in the area of 80,000 voices lines, where a lot had to be recorded 8 times for each one of the player voices

Posted: 19 September
I'm 72 years old and these have been the best 20 hours of my life
EDIT::After playing through the game multiple times, including finishing it on Honour Mode, I have to say that my opinion of this game is even higher than it was after those first 20 hours
 After finishing this game, it feels like my life is complete and there's nothing left to live for
 This may be the last game I ever play and review I ever write
 I would like to thank Larian for filling a void that has been plaguing me for more than half a century
I found the main story as well as every single side quest/story to be fun and interesting
 There are no boring fetch quests as far as I can tell
 How you handle side quests and whether you complete them or not 'does' affect the ending; as such, they could be considered extensions of the main story
 (You could be unsatisfied with the ending if you just rush through and skip things
)You can build your characters any way you see fit and almost any build is completely viable
 If you don't like the way you built your characters, just wait until you complete Act 1 and you can rebuild them any way you want as frequently as you want all the way up to the very end of the game; this is very good for testing new things out
 By the end of the game my main character was a fire breathing Geo/Pyro battle mage that wielded a fire staff, used Warfare skills and showered my enemies in meteors with some necromancy for physical damage in case the enemy had too much resistance to those elements; she was pretty godly
 I plan on trying a solo Honour mode run next with a similar but more diverse build
 (I love the lizards
)For me, the best part of this game is the combat
 It's extremely well done and very fun
I can't really say any more than what the other reviews cover though
 Just know that if a fight seems absolutely impossible, that it really isn't
 I've gone into fights where half my party was annihilated before I got to do anything, yet I still emerged victorious
 There's always a way to win even if the enemy has you outnumbered and outleveled; just gotta think
Like many reviews state, there are still some bugs
 As far as I can tell, they are all minor
 After multiple play throughs on multiple difficulties I have not experienced any major bugs
 Nothing game breaking and nothing that really affected my gameplay much
The few bugs I've experienced: - Many unvoiced lines in Arx
 - Incorrect journal entries
 - Sometimes a character would act blind in combat even though they weren't (could't use any ranged skills, couldn't see around themselves, but this was rare and only lasted a single turn
) - Sometimes the enemy AI would derp out and they'd just run around or repeatedly climb up and down a ladder until they were out of AP
 - Custom undead characters do not receive the appropriate immunities, such as bleeding and suffocation
 (though I don't recall any of my characters ever being afflicted with Bleed..
) (Fane does receive these immunities) - Undead afflicted with Decay will not attempt to avoid poison puddles (Not sure if this is a bug or an oversight)
 - Altitude does not affect many player or enemy melee attacks
 (Entities 10+ meters above can be struck with melee
) But it does affect some skills, such as Dragon's Blaze, Laser Ray, charging skills, Battle Stomp, etc
 ..
 I think that's about it
 I'll add more if I remember them
Some reviews complain about enemies being omniscient and knowing all of your strengths and weaknesses (including whether you're undead or not), which is true, but it's also true for players
 Any player with Loremaster on one of their characters can examine any NPC or enemy to gain insight into their strengths and weaknesses
 Only one of your characters needs Loremaster
 If you examine with someone that doesn't have it, they use the skill level of whoever does, even if that person is dead
 (This even works on the final boss, at no point in the game is it unfair that enemies can spot your weaknesses
)So in summary, very fun game, great character customization, great combat, good story, a few minor bugs
 It can be challenging in some scenarios but it's supposed to be; that's at least half the fun
 I could mention the poor inventory management but countless reviews already cover that
Tip: Carry a couple pieces of +Thievery and +Loremaster gear with you to make sure you can pick any lock and identify any item
 There may be times when your base skill isn't sufficient
TL;DR: Recommended, as shown above
10/10 on the Completely Subjective, Arbitrary and Useless rating system

Early Access Review
You will love this game if..
- You like games that don't hold your hand- You like games that allow you freedom to customise your characters and experiences- You like games that TRULY reward exploration and investigation*Legit, if you don't sit there scrolling over the map looking for hidden chests, ladders, ledges, etc, you're doing it wrong*- You like high strategy, turn based combat that rewards forward thinking and planning- You like finding, using, selling or collecting loot- You have 1 or more friends that will play with you
 This game shines in multiplayerThe handful of little annoying bugs and glitches are completely and utterly outweighed by how captivating and enthralling this game is..
 And it's still in Early Access..
 I see a lot of complaints that the story isn't long enough, or really focusing on the bugs, lets get real
Bugs:- Sometimes your helmet will blink and flicker a bit- Sometimes your characters won't be within range, or have line of sight on a target they clearly should- Accuracy percentage seems to be a bit off, 80% chance to hit is more like 30%; anything under 90% is troubleThat's..
 About it..
Story is too short
 Well then play the rest of the game kid
 You can speed run the "story" in like 20 minutes if you wanted, the real fun comes from exploring the world and finding everything else there is to do
 I honestly can't believe how good this game is for an EA release and I can't wait for the full release come September
 Could not recommend highly enough
Things I would like to see in future:- More races
- More in depth customisation options for spells and abilities
 Think Champions Online or the Oblivion Spell-Creation
 (asking for a lot, I know)- A little control over what armour looks like on your character
 - More spells, more synergy between spells
 This is already great, but why stop at great
The more points I list, the more I realise I'm just asking for more of the game
 Give me more of the game mate

Early Access Review
If more game developers had HALF the talent and attention to detail that Larian does, the market wouldn't be so saturated with garbage today
 Larian is one of the best and the Divinity series proves it
 By far one of the best RPGs I've ever played
 KEEP IT UP
Posted: 23 September
I was tired of games that only tests your reaction skill
 I was tired of games that say it's 60 dollars, only to have randomized loot boxes or micro-transaction implemented later in time
 I was tired of games that were advertised to be wide as an ocean but ended up being shallow like a puddle
 Then Divinity Original Sin 2 came out
 Each encounter is well executed and designed flawlessly
 Enemy design
is varied and leaves my friend and I saying "WTF is that
" often
 Every time my friend finds some epic loot, we cannot wait to identify it to see who can make use of the item
 Quests are a joy to do and often leads you to find more quests that's filled with important decision making
 Every choice you make has an impact on the world and I have been sent to jail multiple times for making the wrong decision
 For $44
99 you are not buying a game but an experience
 An experience to truly go on an epic adventure
 Fights are never easy but once you learn the satisfaction of besting the enemy combatant that you failed to take down multiple times, you are left leaving for more glory
 (Currently playing on Tactician Mode) I am not sure if anyone is going to read this review since this is my very first review with a positive rating (My other review is for Fallout 4 CREATION CLUB so you already know what rating I gave) but if you are looking for a game with challenge, depth, and quality give this game a try
 I have been playing this game for over 102 hours and I have a feeling that this is only the beginning
Posted: 20 September
I just bought this game yesterday and today I've already clocked 21 hours on it
 I'm a grown man
 I have a job, responsibilities, things to do
 But all I did was sit in my damn chair in my underwear playing morning to night, stopping only to eat, sleep and use the toilet
 10/10 would let this game suck my life away again

Best strategy RPG in the 21st century
Beautifull story, wicked and funny as hell
Challenging, even on the lower difficulties

games like Baldurs gate, planescape torment and neverwiner nights

https://youtu
be/hXCCAYlSzYkExcellent remaster, feels like a new game
 Cutscene artwork in particular is a treat
 4k+/120hz+/uncapped fps & full control remapping
 Wonky FOV seems to adjust itself at times otherwise I have no complaints
 Only played intro but I'm quite impressed
 Own the original game on steam
 Wait for 30% loyalty discount
 Don't yet
 What's wrong with you

Really enjoyable remake
 The new art is beautiful
 It unsurprisingly retains the VO and soundtrack from the original 1999 release (which at times sounds a little lo-fi)
 I imagine people will complain about the controls, however I'd say when framed as a remake/remaster they've done an excellent job i.e
 it's all improved, it definitely wasn't perfect in the original
Just really happy to visit the world of Adelpha again, which is the main draw
 It still has all the same charm and humour, but in a shiny new package

Okay, so highly anticipated Outcast - Second Contact finally arrived
As a hardcore Outcast fan (the game is in my top3 along with Drakan and Dark Earth..
 weird list, huh
 =) , obviously, I feel myself a bit odd with new low-budget intro instead of awesome full CGI movie from original game
 And, obviously, I'd prefer all gameplay aspects to stay as they were, without any changes whatsoever
 And obviously I'm bothered by new Cutter Slade appearance, which, in my opinion, doesn't match well with voice and character
But it's not important
 Not important at all
Developers want to attract new audience for the game, I accept that
 New casual mechanics and weird blue annotations in dialogues are totally explainable in this context, even though I don't like it a bit
 I think, we (Outcast fans) should forgive these small flaws, and enjoy the awesomeness of Outcast universe, and it's still very much there
Posted: 14 November
to all fans or no fans ;)i have the original game in a box and dvd so i boght this one to first impressions r good

Alright listen, as much as I love the Grand Theft Auto series, and even though I enjoy this game a lot....
 I can honestly say with full confidence this game is the epitome of every disease you can think of
 The online mode is where this game really shines (or WOULD shine) other than the blockbuster-like story in single player mode, and crazy Trevor of course
 But see, that's just the problem....
 everybody plays the online mode, but it's so terrible, the community is toxic as f*ck, and the loading screens..
 for f*cks sake
 Hold on, Let me create this list of bullsh*t for you real quick:1
 Loading screens take forever.2
 One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen, literally feels like you're playing with 9 year old kids
 Not even joking.3
 Bored players who will constantly f*ck with you and ruin your fun so that you can't get anything done.4
 Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money, and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product, which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all, so it further proves that they just do it to be a d*ck.5

Things I Have Never Done in GTA Online: Used Hacks in Any Form Modded the Game (Single or Multiplayer) Been Given Hacked Money Asked for Hacked Money Glitched or Used Exploits
Cheated or Abused the Game Had any Software Installed that has been known to Interfere with Cheat DetectionThings I Have Done: Paid for GTAV on two platforms Spent over 350hours playing GTAOnline across two platforms Rarely spent any time in Public GTAOnline Sessions Bought all Previous Rockstar Games and Loved themSo in early December 2016 I was grinding hard in GTAOnline during a slow week
 I had decided to set myself goal of earning enough money through CEO Jobs and Biker Work to buy a Super Yacht
 After a few days of grinding I logged on and found I had been banned
 I checked my email and found an agressively vague non-specific email telling me I had violated Rockstars EULA and I had been banned from GTAOnline for one month
At first I was fairly okay with this, it was one month, and sometimes these things happen
 Then I found out that I had my character stats, profile, money and assets wiped out
 So I left a ticket on Rockstar social club querying this and attemping to appeal the ban and got back a generic reply that I had violated the EULA and the ban is final
 I have spent the last month sending in tickets, asking different questions trying to at the very least pinpoint what my violation of the terms of service was
 I have yet to recieve anything except identical replies, all giving me the exact same vague information that I had violated the EULA and had been banned and that all bans were final
 I tried calling up Rockstar technical support (which I only found the phone number for my country on Reddit - thanks to who ever posted that), and the person on the phone read me the EXACT same reply I got by email and then proceeded to hang up
 At the very least Rockstar has some horrible customer service
 At worst, they are deliberately obstructing and willfully ignoring the compaints of paying customers
 No automated ban system is flawless, and prior to this I would have agreed that people claiming false bans are just whining cheaters
 But now I believe that there is at least a minority of banned players who have been banned for no valid reason, have had hours upon hours of gameplay wiped and have no recourse to appeal the bans
 There are victory stories from before Rockstar updated their ban policy mid-2016 when people had been able to appeal the bans due to false-positives, and this at least shows that the automated ban system is flawed
 Let me be clear: I couldn't even find out what I did to earn the ban, let alone be given the chance to refute it
 Overall:So: if you want this game for singleplayer, go for it
 It's good
 Story isn't as tight as GTAIV but the gameplay has improved greatly
 But if you want to buy GTAV for Online only, think twice; because you may end up having hundreds of invested hours wiped out for no apparent reason, and have no way to even appeal or find out why

Over 1,000 hours on file and I get banned because a man with an airplane sticking out of his crotch locks me in place and dumps money on my head

You think every single review here is fake and they're all salty cheaters
 I thought so too
Recently, Rockstar decided to remove cash from players' accounts because "they have illegitimate money
"The last two weeks were really good for GTA:O with profitable events and discounts, making money wasn't so bad
But the moment they released Smuggler's Run trailer, they started purging accounts
They literally "stole" 8
7 million from me
 Some people lost 150k, some lost 20+ million
 This is not PC exclusive, people lost money on PS and XBOX too
I'm not saying all these people are innocent but i know i've been playing my *ss off (activity;280 hours past 2 weeks) but apperantly they don't like it when you earn too much
 I still have decent amount of money, but that doesn't change the fact that they stole cash from my account out of nowhere
 Too much real life parody there
I lost millions because of the business bugs, glitches
 (Supplies never arrive, 75k worth of supplies produce 63k worth of product, no production even though business is active etc..
)I lost millions because Import/Export bugs
 (Vehicle starts burning for no reason, sometimes 15 minute delivery timer reduces itself to 2-3 minutes
 When you're about to sell, a long loading screen then cars are gone or invisible,etc..
 )I lost hours, when you're done with a sale, sometimes you receive "Transaction Error, price is invalid
" or "Transaction error, too much activity in your account
" I'm sure that was suppose to be against modders
 Guess what
 I play legit, i get an error
 In the next session a modder's dropping 50k cash every 30 seconds
 What happened to my business
 I lost some of my product, recieved no money
 I can try selling it again and hope i won't get any errors this time
What about Rockstar Support
 They're worse than Nexon
Nexon doesn't give a sh*t
Rockstar doesn't give a sh*t plus they damage your in-game experience
I sent about six tickets, i got three different responses
 No, it's not because they ignore your ticket
 They have a support catalog or something where they copy&paste the best answer for your question
Please take a look at these reponses
 These are real
Response for the transaction errors
 "We're good, your connection is sh*t, go away" response; https://www.imageupload.co

jpgResponse for the lost Import/Export vehicles
 I don't know what to think about this;https://www.imageupload.co
uk/images/2017/08/27/review2
jpgReponse for the second lost Import/Export vehicles
 Now, there're a lot of scumbag youtube "content creators" out there
 They give people tips on "How to get free cash from Rockstar Support" you know, clickbait bullsh*t
Now, i get this treatment because of that
https://www.imageupload.co
uk/images/2017/08/27/review3
jpgThis is Rockstar Support for you
I've had similar issues last year, but they actually helped back then, sent me the money i lost and stuff
 I don't know what changed this year
"Oh, you've played 1800 hours, you got your money's worth
" That's not how it works
 That playtime includes loading screens, connection errors and my no-life grinding..
 They make truckloads of money from Shark Cards and they keep releasing new content
 But with every new update, the game gets more outrageous and exploitative
Shark Card prices weren't enough
 OpenIV scandal, ridiculous drip feeding content and now this
DLCs in this game are NOT free unless you play (grind) 5-6 hours a day
The fandoms on Rockstar forums are pathetic
This game is not worth it,even for single player
 They still haven't released a single thing for the single player
Do not support this corporate nonsense
I'd say it's a shame because the game is really good but nope, i have nothing good to say
Stay away from this company
Update: Now they constantly change vehicle stats, can you guess why
 They released a supercar that costs 2
4 million
 It was faster than anything else in it's class, but for a week
 It's third now
 Again, more exploitative behaviour from Rockstar.
If you have any doubts, read the review comments

OpenIV fiasco aside..
modding aside..
 cause we all know you guys f***ed up with that.
But, what really bothers me and alot of people is the unrealistic and downright criminal prices you expect people to pay for your Shark Cards
 $100 real money for $8Million in-game cash
When every new DLC costs $25Million-$40Million if you want all the vehicles, upgrades, unlocks..etc.
etc WTF good is $8Million
 Your price structure on everything from Shark Cards to Merch is bizarre and unbalanced - if you wonder why people mod and manipulate your game, its because nobody enjoys being blatantly ripped off
Irony here, when the 'ripping off' got to much for you guys, you threatened the very same people that mod your game to enhance it and who, at the same time, put food on your table and keep you with a job
STOP ripping off your customers and instead of fighting, why not listen to the community - expand the single player experience with some kind of worthwhile DLC, like people have been begging for
 Why not make servers that welcome modders and people that enjoy enhancing the game and getting even more value for money.and.
for gods sake.
STOP charging criminal-esqe, exorbitant prices for your poor value Shark Cards..
 ugh.
 just STOP, we are all embarrassed for you over the shameful greed you've shown..
and continue to show~

 Great game
 Came back on to have some fun with an old friend and to check out the new updates
 We did some CEO missions and drove around, deciding not to bother the other players and do our own thing
 I log off the game
 Five minutes later i receive an email stating i have violated the EULA and my account, character, and inventory have all been reset
 Years of work
 Gone
 I decided to give the game another chance after the same scenario had happened to my best friend before the reset was a thing, just to have it happen to me
 Don't get me wrong, we had a blast driving around, grinding up enough money to finally buy the vehicles and homes we wanted, then proceed to try the new modes as they came out like the racing, CEO, adversary modes
Posted: 30 August, 2016
Let me start at the beginning in order to accurately describe this atrocity that has happened to me a few months ago
 Just now decided to write a review after seeing the same thing has happened to so many others
 I bought GTAV on September 17th, 2013
 I waited in the pre-order line at gamestop because I was so damn hyped for this game
 I was only intending to play it on console until the PC version came out
 At this point I had no clue that there was going to be character swaps from console to PC
 I obtain level 72 on console
 Loving the game, couldn't be happier (except if the radio stations were better)
PC version release date is announced sometime in January 2015
 I immediately pre-order it in order to get the bonus money that was available as a pre-order incentive
 Upon release I transfer my character from console to PC and recieve my pre-order money
 I was so thrilled to finally be playing this great game on PC
 In the last year I put in 390 hours online in this game and achieved level 136 if I recall correctly
 Countless hours of heist grinding, job grinding, lots of shark cards bought
 Sitting at something like 11million dollars
 2 houses, 2 garages
 Everything I could ever want in the game
 I had things that weren't even obtainable anymore
 I was thrilled with where the game was going
 Then...
 I get bored; So I quit playing for 2 months
A friend asks me, "Hey come play GTA with me let's wreck some kids"
 Sure why not
 I get on for about an hour and we do just that, wreck some kids
 I log off for the night and log in the next day to a 10 day ban
 I was beyond baffled
 How could I be banned when I didn't do anything
 Surely rockstar support can help me
 So I call in an attempt to figure out what is going on
 I get fed a rehearsed line about bans being the result of online modding etc etc
 I ask for a supervisor, the supervisor says the same thing
 I ask for his supervisor
 He says there is no one above him available and I was unable to appeal my ban
 His reasons are as follows
"Just accept the 10 day ban
" "If you weren't really doing anything then in 10 days you can play again and nothing will be lost, just take a break"
 He neglects to tell me that the system was going to take all of my money and I would have to start over
 Grinding countless heists/jobs or buy a large sum shark card (which is ultimately what they wanted me to do)
I come back around 12 days later and play for a few hours
 Nothing out of the ordinary happens
 I then got off for the night
 The following day I got back on and was banned again
 This time for 30 days
 I think to myself "No &*%#ing way, this isn't possible"
 I call AGAIN and get the same rehearsed line AGAIN from both the first and second level of support (always ask for a supervisor)
 Except this time something was different
 This time I was being allowed to appeal my ban
 I thought for sure I would be exonerated of these allegations
 Nope
 I was told that I must have been hacking if their skynet system banned me
 That there is nothing they can do and that "evidence of illicit activity" was found on my account
 So I ask them to check again and they do
 Same result
 At this point I start thinking ahead
 "What happens when I get back from this 30 day ban
"
 "I'm just going to be banned again for the same false reason
"They reply, "that shouldn't happen sir"
 I reply, "Shoulda coulda woulda
 It's happened twice now so what makes next time any different
 No variables have changed
 If I record all of my gameplay from now on will that protect me
 If I am indeed banned upon return to your game can I use the footage as proof of my innocence
""Yes", I was told
 Not maybe, not "we're not sure"
 I was told "Yes, that will suffice"
So I did just that
 I recorded all of my gameplay
 Unfortunately "all" only ended up being roughly 2 hours the night I was unbanned after the 30 day ban because I was immediately banned permanently after logging off for that night
This is starting to get a little longer than I expected so I'll cut it short
 I tried to appeal the permament ban
 I thought "I have video that I didn't do anything, surely this time it will be different...
 they will have to unban me"
 NOPE
I'll just end my review here and link my evidence
 The videos of my gameplay and their final reply to me in my appeal where I linked them the videos
 https://www.youtube
com/playlist
list=PLVEBdTP7X4S3b5VYQEvV7WN_0xNOgAcOQhttp://imgur
com/a/WWIFQ TL;DR: ROCKSTAR CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS TERRIBLE AND IF YOU BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL BE BANNED BY SKYNET SIMPLY FOR BEING IN THE SAME LOBBY AS A SCRIPTER (WHICH WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN)
 Edit: According to various sources (denied by Rockstar when I called them today) I was banned for MSI Afterburner/RivaTuner
 This would make sense to me now that I think about it
 However my review remains unchanged because they are doing absolutely nothing to fix the issue
 I was told that I am not allowed to appeal my permanent ban because their system is flawless and does not falsely ban people for any reason
 The support supervisor (Kyle) even acknowledged that he had heard of the MSI/Riva complaint but that it was "false"
 So yeah I'm still in the same place I started
 Still will never support another Rockstar game for as long as I live
Posted: 3 September
GTA Online, the jack of all trades game which does everything quite well while staying a safe distance away from all forms of perfection
I currently have 4,617 hours of playtime logged in this game, most of it online or in the creator
Once this game made it out on PC, complete with a first person viewpoint, I felt as though my lifelong journey of discovering an entire world which I could live in and do whatever I desired was finally becoming a reality
I loved this game
LOVED this game
I've been playing since the top-down days of GTA 1, always dreaming of the time when I could experience this crazy alternate world 'from my own eyes
'However, having spent this much time in the game leaves me with one conclusion:
I simply cannot recommend this game
Not to anyone, not for any reason
Not ever
See, in a game which revolves around drugs, money, murder, and any manner of illegal activities, I kind of expect to be treated like a criminal inside of the game
I do not expect to be treated like a crimial outside of the game by the sorry excuse they have for tech support
On 08/29/17, well into week 3 of some amazing double payout bonuses and mere days away from the Smuggler's Run DLC, my few friends and I were spending many long hours playing away and racking up some serious money through all of our hard work
However, Rockstar decided that it was time to run another sweep looking for people who mod, glitch, cheat, hack, or exploit their game
Apparently it found very few of these people
Instead, it found a whole bunch of us legitimate players
Then it decided to punish us all wholesale, never once telling us why or how it came to this conclusion
Better still, many of these people with modded money didn't get affected at all
First we are met with a screen during the game's loading cycle stating 'we have determined that GTA$ and/or RP details on your account were adjusted by something out of your control and we have taken action to fix it
No additional action is required from you at this time
'Now, a lot of people will try to argue that they are completely legit 'except for that one time when..
'
I am not one of these people
I know what the public sessions are like in this game
It's because of this that I had only ever played in closed or solo sessions until very recently, with the same one or two known and trusted friends, for most of my online time
I had never played online on a console and had never transferred an online character
I routinely took screenshots of my online bank account just in case some modder somehow managed to get through to me and mess with my hard-earned cash
To this day I have yet to see a single glitched or modded GTA dollar go into my account
I would know if it went there
I do not place myself into situations where such a thing could happen and I keep a very close eye on what happens to my game
In addition I've never modded nor glitched GTA money, myself
I've never even duped a car
Honestly, I don't even know how to do any of this stuff
Rockstar apparently could not care any less about this as they had decided to 'take action' and steal $28,553,333 of my legitimate, hard-earned money
Right out of the blue, no explanation given
'Okay,' I think, 'their anti-cheat is confused with the double payouts we've gotten over these last few weeks
They'll figure it out, this'll get sorted out, everyone who had their legit cash removed will get it back
'
There's quite a lot of us, too
Look around the forums and message boards
Tons of us
Including about ten people whom I've just stared playing with mere days ago, which happens to be most of the people that I know in this game
Sadly, this does not appear to be the case
Rockstar's support number has a doofy automated thing saying to use their support website (which many of us have already attempted to use
)
Any attempt to mention this stolen money on said website will soon see the issue being flagged as being a 'cheat/exploit or banning issue
'
It may or may not also have an automated response from some soulless bot stating that "Your shared bank account in GTA Online was adjusted to remove illegitimately gained in-game money
"
Then the trouble ticket will be closed
End of story, slap across the face
'You cheated, we corrected it, get lost
'Like Hell
Not ONCE have I EVER done anything in this game to cheat
I HATE cheating
Had any modded money been dropped onto me I would have told them about it in a heartbeat
But Rockstar simply does not care about how legitimate we are
They are always in the right, we as players are always in the wrong
I'll probably never see that money back but that doesn't mean I'm going to stop sending them trouble tickets about it
I'm currently sitting at number four
They will keep hearing from me until they either fix their error or ban me
Nowhere has there been any official word from them about this
No 'we recognize that there was an issue' or 'we are currently looking into the matter
'
Nope, we're all dirty cheaters, go screw off somewhere else
As if it wasn't bad enough that they find any way they can to deplete our online bank accounts through normal play, now they're outright stealing it from a lot of us
All of the other rampant bugs in this game, both new and old, I could come to overlook (and there are quite a few of them
)

Posted: 28 September
Until the last update, I would have highly recommended this game, but sadly I would advise everyone to steer away from this game and any other future Take-Two/Rockstar game
 I think theifs is the best way to describe these companies
 I can confirm to those of you reading these reviews saying "surely they wouldn't be removing in game funds that people pay $80/60+ for
" that it is really happening
 I will split this review into two parts; Single Player and Multiplayer
 Singleplayer	The story and how it plays out for single player is possibly the best out there
 The story is fantasic, and there are very few missions that aren't fun to play
 Also, the implementation of an in-game stock market (although not the best thing ever) is really cool to me
 Pairing this with missions that allow you to manipulate this stock market, you can earn millions, even billions
 But this leads to the issue of there being nothing to spend it on
 Singleplayer mode for some reason does not get content from Rockstar's updates
 The only way you can access them is by grinding multiplayer for days to afford the likes of one car, however we will get to that
 Overall, Singleplayer is absolutely fantastic, except from the fact that after the story there is little to do unless you are interested in mods, in which case you will probably love this game for that
 Multiplayer	Oh yay, this train wreck
 Okay, so I have 1,151 hours on Steam for GTA V, with around 1,000 being for multiplayer
 I converted my stats from PS3 so likely have around double that
 I know what I am talking about with this game
 The multiplayer in this game is absolutely trash now
 I was always able to look past the grind in this game, but it has gotten to the point now where money is so hard to make, and things are so expensive that it is no longer fun
 At all

Early Access Review
I started a co-op factory with a close friend
 After a day of work, I stepped back, looked at what we built, and came to some realizations
Posted: 12 April
Early Access Review
Help for new players
Rule #1
 When you think you have enough iron, you don't
 Trust me
Rule #2
 When you have backups in your system, don't worry, you'll have shortages later
 Get more iron
Rule #3
 Leave enough room to expand without having to do crazy stuff with your belts
Rule #4
 When you have backups, start storing extras in chests
 You'll need it later
Rule #5
 Crap, I'm out of copper
 Get more copper
Rule #6
 Create entire factory towns for iron plates and copper plates, and build gear wheels and copper cables on site
 You'll thank me later
Rule #6
 Wait, there is automation for automation
 Flying robots
 Check
Rule #7
 Aliens love radars
 Don't put radars near things that matter (like your steam engines) unless you support them with a ton of turrets
Rule #7-a
 Flamethrowers are your friend for killing aliens
 Unless you're in the middle of your town, in which case they are not
Rule #8
 Take enough ammo with you when you go to fight aliens
 It's lots of fun to run out of ammo in the middle of a battle, and it goes quickly
Rule #9
 Don't stand on train tracks when trains are automated
Rule #10
 Blueprints are amazing
Rule #11
 Deconstruction planning forests is amazing
 Clear out wood and gain resources quickly
Rule #12
 Logistics robots change your world
Rule #12-a
 You always need more power
Rule #13
 Oh, there's a better way to build that
 Let me start over
 Again
Rule #14
 Wait, is that the sun coming up already
Rule #15
 Remember your family fondly
Rule #16
 Get more iron
Cracktorio is more accurate

Early Access Review
Early Access
 These words may now instantly turn you off a game after buggy games like DayZ or lack of content games like Killing Floor 2 but this game is truly different
 Never have I played an early access which is so well polished, bug free and complete that it feels like you arent buying an early version of the game, instead you are buying a complete game which will get a load of free DLC
You start crash landed on a planet with only a few machines and your mind
 You start mining some stone to build more miners but it takes too long, luckily you have a mining drill which will automatically mine for you, great
 But you need a way to power it so you mine some coal and power it
 But where is it going to be stored
 You cut down a few trees to build a chest to place it in and then you got your first set up complete
 But one machine will take ages and you got to mine more coal, copper and iron (as well as smelt it) too
 After some more mining and tree cutting you have a set-up which will mine all the ores you need
 But having to run around and place coal in is inefficient and having 6 different chests for each resource is messy
 Theres got to be a better way
 you say like an infomercial, well there is Kevin
 Inserters which will pick up items and place them behind the inserters and conveyer belts which move items
 After some fiddling around with this you make a set up which mines everything and stores it into one box
 But you still have to power everything with coal, is there a way to improve it
 Of course, there always is
 This is the basics of the game, you are constantly improving on what you have with the goal of making the factory as efficient and automated as possible
Combat  Although this seems weird in a factory building game, it is actually implement really well
 It keeps you on your toes and limits what you can do
 If you focus just on production you arent going to be able to fight off an attack which can wipe your factory out, forcing you to start again
 You cant skimp out on any factory or risk losing everything and the more you pollute, the more powerful enemies you will have to face, the more turrets you will have to place
 Weapons & defence  Fear not, you are also able to craft weapons and armour which will help you fight off enemies
 Pistols, Shotguns, Grenades, Mines, even personal defence robots which automatically fire at enemies
 But what about defence
 Do I just have simple iron and copper armour
 Nope, Power Armour
 Armour which you can install modules which can increase speed, generate shields, shoot enemies and more
 My personal favourite is the roboport which allows you to summon robots who can build blueprints and repair them, allowing me to set up a fortified base in seconds
Advance & interesting Technology  Later in the game you unlock more advance and interesting technology, some which allow you to automate object crafting extremely quickly which can further be improved by modules
 Robots which can be ordered to supply machines with crafting components so you never have to refill one again or robots which can build entire bases and repair them when they get damaged
 Cars, tanks, trains, ways to transport you and supplies around, allowing you to create separate bases with each having a different focus
 You are constantly unlocking more and more technology which will make you rethink your entire factory set-up
Gameplay  I am constantly put into the flow where I am completely focused which causes time to go by much faster than it feels like
 I am constantly fixing one thing only to find out another is broken, restructuring my factory to be more efficient, and fortifying my bases
 There is something quite satisfying about having a compact base which just works
 Multiplayer  This game features a full multiplayer co-op experience which works flawlessly
 The only thing more fun than building a factory by yourself is building it with your mates
 50 hours on one multiplayer game, and we havent even modded the game yet
This is seriously one of the most interesting games Ive played on steam, Ive already got well over my moneys worth and I have no intention of stopping
 I can't recommend this game enough to anyone who likes management games
Note: Killing Floor 2 is not a bad game at all, the way they are handling early acess is the problem

I got Factorio out of boredom
 You see, I'm sick, I got the flu so I'm home and none of my usual games are doing it for me
 So I got Factorio
 25 bucks, 350 MB
 The hell is this
 I feel I got robbed
 So I give it a whirl
 14 hours later I stumble into the kitchen for my first meal of the day
 Bloodshot eyes, head throbbing, ears buzzing with the sound of inserters doing their thing and then I go to sleep
 I can't sleep because all I dream about is building a better automated factory
 10/10 would ruin my life again

This isn't so much a game as it is a digital Zen Garden
 I've lost hours (400+ apparently) tweaking my factory
 Sometimes to make it look prettier
 Sometimes to rebuild it because I need space for yeah another stream of components
 Sometimes just because I've approached Zen and don't want to give it up
For every bottleneck in material flow you find and fix, you'll create two more
 And once you've got everything working perfectly, Your factory will be stalled because of resource exhaustion, spitters and bitters, or a new production option changes your resource needs
 If that sounds like the kind of challange you enjoy, this game will provide you rediculous value for your money

Factorio is a game that sneaks up on you
 You start out so simple, harvesting some coal and iron, chopping down a tree or two
 Then you plonk down a machine that starts mining iron ore for you, and you feed the result into a furnace
 You build more machines, then some inserters
 More machines, and it becomes easier to link up a few things with conveyor belts
Four hours later you look down on a factory system so complex you couldn't have designed it; and yet it grew so gradually, so organically, that at no point you felt overwhelmed
You look at the time - maybe ten more minutes; you want to quickly redesign this bit around your assemblers to fit in another conveyor belt
 It would speed up the production of green electronic circuits
Three hours later you realize that you should have been in bed for hours, but you can't stop now - you just build a tank and you really want to try it out on that alien base that has been growing way too much
Factorio is fun
 As simple as that

If you are looking for a game that requires you to manage your time, resources, power, and even amunition, look no further
 I have looked for a game like this for years
 A game that is survival, but you can thrive instead of just surviving by making robots and machines do everything for you
 I have already recomended this game to 5 or 6 of my friends
 If you have the money, and like using your brain to overcome problems and build things, BUY THIS GAME
The good-Great for unlimited play
 There is always more to do
-Multiplayer is super fun, and much less laggy then anticipated
-The enemy progression system is near perfect-Runs very well, even with over 300 robots all doing different things on the screen
-Very customisable world-Very smooth controls-The combat robots are awesome-Modules and suit upgrades out the wazoo-The logic systems and rail systems are very polished and well done-Most early access games I have played, I have found many bugs
 I have not found a single bug in this game
-The blueprint system is easy, efficiant, and well done
-Robots are very polished and do what they're supposed to very well
-Devs are awesome
-Best builder/tower defence game I have ever playedCould use some work-Vehicles are a little sub par, but still fun to use-Armor augmentatin system is a little broken
 I should not be able to run faster then a train, or take on a max level enemy base with a shotgun-Inserter speed is limited for extreme late game
 I found myself needing 2 or 3 fast inserters just to load enough copper into one assembler for wire-lack of enemy types-Water and lake boundries, and some way to clear them or build over them
-not many methods of producing powerThe Bad (most being fixed in updates coming soon most likely)-A lack of end game
 Once the rocket is launched, you have nothing else to progress too, aside from expanding your current base
 -Weapons

This game doesn't feel like a Early Access game at all
Addicting and very satisfying when your factory works
 I find myself staring at different parts of it for a few moments, it's captivating
 Also frustrating when you thought something would work and it doesn't, then you have to change your setup
I never built massive factories nor did I launch a rocket, but I still enjoy making my factory grow modestly
 Being attacked is an annoyance but wrecking the bugs' nests feels good..

This is basically a 1:1 port of the PS4 game, with all patches, DLCs and add-ons (which all add their impressive share of post-main story content)
SAO:HR follows a different continuity from the anime's canon
 See below
What I likeThe combat system is reactive, and actually gets better with time
There is a lot of content, even and especially once you clear the main story
It's in English AND it's voiced
 I am a simple man
You can party with and customize pretty much everybody, and you can influence a character's AI and actions through the feelings system
The cast is great and well-rounded
What I don't likeThe PC port is passable
 I hope you have a controller
 See a port review below
The game might seem too easy until you finish the main story
 It gets much harder when you hit Warriors of the Sky and Abyss of the Shrine Maiden
There's a lot of information, sometimes dumped all on you at once (especially post-main story)
 Fortunately, the game provides a means to re-read the tutorials as much as you want
It's a MMO-like: there's only one save, and most events aren't replayable (some of them are)
 It's not as bad on PC since you can copy-paste your save directory, but still
At some points, the translated text is completely replaced without keeping the original intent and meaning, failing at both translation and localization
 It's still better than what we got in Hollow Fragment
The affinity/affection system is a chore, as in all Aquria games before
 Exacerbated by the translation: the english text sometimes invites you to say Yes when you should have, in fact, said No
Regarding the portPC key bindings aren't ideal; this game was made and is still made for controllers
 You're going to be very frustrated if you use a keyboard
Borderless window resolution is locked, and windowed mode manages not to work with Borderless Gaming
 Full screen works as expected, however
Performance is okay
 Loading times are abysmal (same as PS4, really), but I haven't tried on a SSD yet
Gameverse continuity detailsSAO: Hollow Realization is a sequel to Infinity Moment, Hollow Fragment and Lost Song, all of which follow a different continuity from the anime series, and aren't ported to PC at time of writing
There are a lot of new characters and differences, including:Kirito did not defeat Heathcliff on floor 75 and abort SAO early: Heathcliff was defeated on floor 100 as the final boss, like he initially planned
 (Infinity Moment)Leafa, Sinon, Yuuki all join the SAO death game, for various reasons
 (Infinity Moment, Hollow Fragment)Strea, a MHCP like Yui, joins the gang after having her own arc
 (Infinity Moment)Philia, a self-proclaimed trasure hunter stuck in a closed-off dimension of SAO, met and was subsequently freed by Kirito
 (Hollow Fragment)Rain and Seven, idols in real life and in-game respectively, join the team
 In ALO, Rain saved Seven after Seven attempted to absorb everybody else, posing as the final boss
 (Lost Song)Hollow Realization also includes other characters that are technically part of the SAO universe, but not portrayed in the anime:Kizmel, a NPC close to Asuna and Kirito, from SAO: Progressive (manga and LN)Argo, an intel expert
 She's briefly seen in the anime, but has a somewhat larger role in the games
Alice and Eugeo, characters from Project Alicization, which follow the SAO light novel canon after Mother's Rosario
 Anime adaptation (SAO S3) in 2018
The SAO arc was covered in Infinity Moment and Hollow Fragment, and the ALO arc in Lost Song
The GGO arc did not happen yet but will in SAO: Fatal Bullet (2018), which follows this continuity
 Most of Sinon's backstory was already covered in Sinon's quests, howerer
Closing wordsConsole-exclusive ports are getting less and less bad, but there is still a ways to go
 It's nice to see Japanese console developers trying to get on the PC scene, but when it comes to port quality, BNEI/NBGI and partners are still lagging behind other publishers like Square-Enix
SAO:HR is by no means a triple A, and does have a substantial amount of fanservice, but it has way too much work and content behind it for me to classify it as a bad or fanservice-only game
I recommend it to people who:like the SAO universedon't mind heavy-handed fanservicelike visual novels or VN-style events, because there are a lot of thoseThe game has a fully-featured multiplayer mode, with PVP duels and mission/combat cooperation, which I will not review since I have no friends the game can be played solo in its entirety
Review revisions and erratumI originally posted that controllers do not work outside Big Picture mode
 That was false
 It does however need to be properly configured within Steam

 This is only true for the Warriors of the Sky part
 Warriors of the Sky was a game update that leads to Abyss of the Shrine Maiden, and Abyss of the Shrine Maiden is a DLC that is properly voiced

Posted: 30 October
After already 30 hours of gameplay non stop + streaming it, this is what I'm about to say
First of all, I'm a huge fan of bandai namco jrpg games
 Mostly been a huge fan of tales and god eater games and some other naruto game that are hack'n'slash one
I haven't bought any SAO games in my vita, so I only try AW vs SAO and SAO:HR on steam
Pros :- I love how every SAO game aren't 100% the same mechanism with the other SAO games
 The game isn't like the previous one that is available on steam, is not like an hack'n'slash only, but they try to make like some kind of a MMO game
 - The feel of being like playing with real players
 Since they try to create something that ressemble like a real MMO, is pretty impressive that you feel like you're in one even thought you're just playing the singleplayer for the story
 If you get into the game+story like I do, you can threat other npc players as if they were real players
 You'll see many in town, and also in area, you'll see them fight in group
 Of course is not perfect, you can't really choose a topic you want to talk to since they are just AI
 But you can interact with them, and while interacting with them more and more, you can create some kind of bond like a real MMO, that's how you make friend
- Big and interesting story, like many of bandai namco games such as the tales series, god eater, and even other SAO, you can guarantee that you'll have tons of hours before completing the story (unless you skip the dialogue)- Good amount of customization for your character, some people will say there isn't enough, but I find it pretty cool
 Plus, your clothes change depending on the armor you put
 Sadly sometimes you will feel that the armor name just don't fit on how it look xD
- Japanese voice, I know there is a huge debate in the anime about dub vs sub, both have their advantage, and everyone can have their own preference
 In my case, I love the japanese voicing more, which you have here
 Is not like many JRPG that you just read...read....read...
with some few sound like : "ah", "eh", "oh"
 But you actually hear the character speak, which is something I really enjoy from the tales and god eater games
 Since I'm not a big reader, just listening to the voice/reaction and reading the translate, it feel like watching an anime in subs, way more enjoyable then just reading
- Amazing map, as expected from bandai namco games
 Map pretty detail for a JRPG
 Of course is not comparable to many shooter game that require high graphic such as destiny 2 that just came out with amazing view/map, but for a JRPG, I'd say is pretty amazing
 The details on a rock or jumping between branch, you don't feel like much invisible wall
 Of course there will be some invisble wall, like an island surrounded by water, they won't let you start walking on water or swimming for 1 hours non stop
 If you play AW vs SAO, you'll see that the map is gigantic, amazing flight range, you can fly anywhere in one area, the only invisible wall are like the edge of an area
 While in many other game even in some online MMO, you'll feel invisible wall while trying to jump on a rock where your character jump higher then the height of the rock..
but you'll slide straight down @
@..
which doesn't happen in SAO:HR, where you can jump on every rock, even the one stick on wall as long as your jump is higher then the rock height
Cons :- Not for players that will just skip the story
 If you don't care about the story happening in SAO:HR and just want to play the game and kill monster
 I probably won't suggest this game for you
 Unlike AW vs SAO where the flight system is something really impressive and smooth compare to many other games, in this game, it will be your average killing mobs and visiting place where you can do in many other MMO or other games
- Not being use to control (since I suppose most people will be using a controller to play this game), the control can be pretty weird at first due to it not being your average hack'n'slash jrpg, but they try to make some kind of MMO
 I use a controller to play this game, and usually MMO are being play with a keyboard and mouse on keyboard
 Some that play MMO with a controller might be more at ease when they first start this game
 On keyboard you have a lots of button which you can set all kind of skills, while on a controller you have to hold button (which is not new) to do some kind of skill, but mostly the select button open you a bar of hotkey
 Now this is where it get a bit rough
 In some JRPG game, we use select a lots in the middle of a battle of course, like god eater where you need to use select to use healing or bullet change
 But in this game, since an MMO usually have a lots of skill, mostly when you advance on class, in here you can have all kind of skill, and there isn't enough button on a controller, so you might be force to press select for other skill + buff + potion
- Create your kirito
 The cool thing about most of bandai namco JRPG, is that there is voice with the character instead of just reading and hearing some few sound from your character
 The problem here is that, unlike AW vs SAO where you actually see the story of Kirito and his friends, and you can control any premade character, in this game you will be able to custom your character (which should be a pro)
 The thing is you will be kirito, that mean you will be the hero of the story of course
 I'm a girl, so I created a girl character, but in the story, your character will be speaking as kirito, so you'll have a man voice which can be kinda weird xD
 - Bad translate, if you understand at least a few decent word in japanese, you'll notice there is many mistake in the translate, including grammar or some few typo
 Question I've receive that isn't part of my pros and con:Q : Is the game worth the price
A : I'd say yes, I heard the game deluxe edition was 80$ when it first came out, of course is cheaper now since this game been 1 year old
 I always buy most of bandai game in full price, mostly because I'm a huge fan and I would love to see more of their game being imported in the western
 It really depend on you if you want to buy it in full price or on sales, afterall steam sale happen pretty often
 I buy it full price to support the compagny, and because how big the game is compare to many other games, you can see that they put tons of work into it
Q : Would you recommend this game for someone that never try a JRPG
A : Probably not SAO : HR to start with due to the fight mechanism being really different then many JRPG, I'll probably suggest to start with the tales one, or AW vs SAO, due to the flight system being really smooth and easy to control even while fighting
Q : If we don't like the anime, will we enjoy the game
A : To be fair, is kinda a hard question, I wouldn't say : because you don't like SAO you won't like any other thing related to SAO
 Just like god eater, I started from the game, I was a huge huge huge, a REALLY big fan of god eater, I'm also greatfull I got the chance to meet the creator of god eater as well (THANK YOU BANDAI), but the anime..
The anime wasn't as enjoyable as I expected
 I loved the character in the game, and I loved the small anime special "God eater prologue" that came before God eater the anime
 For SAO, it might be the same thing, just like people loving the VN but hating the anime (but that mostly due to poor adaptation)
 If you love JRPG game, but dislike the anime, you can always try the SAO games, there no harm, except only harming your wallet depending when you buy it
 But I find the game more enjoyable due to me liking the anime + movie + character
 But SAO game are mostly story focus, unlike naruto fighting game, you don't need to watch naruto to enjoy playing a naruto fighting game
 You'll probably put more time into the story in SAO games, so if you didn't enjoy the anime/LN, there is a huge chance you might not like the story in the game as well
Posted: 29 October
After some hours of playing I am ready to write my review
Some may dislike the game mainly because it's SAO..
 I do agree that if you don't like SAO to some degree you might not enjoy it AS much
The game runs fairly well; I have terrible specs for now generation's games and I can play this game perfectly fine
My primary specs are: I3 Core, GTX 645, 6GB Ram
I am running the game at 40fps (I haven't touched the settings since installed)Assuming most people reading this have way better specs than me since I've had my pc for like 7 years, you should be able to run the game well if that is one of the reasons you are reading reviews
The story is quite fascinating and it's not a game you can complete within a couple of hours which makes it enjoyable to grind
There are apparently a lot of people having issues with using controllers so that there is a con
I am using keyboard
The character creation isn't really good since it's very limited but I managed to create a fairly easy char that resembles Kiyotaka from COTE
(I'm going to update my review after further progession and understanding)

Have you ever wanted to swing your weapons around for countless hours, possibly the rest of your life
Do you enjoy seducing other women, including your cousin, while in a relationship
This is the game for you
Posted: 6 November
First of all, I'm a fan of the SAO stories (Read the books and watched the anime), however, this is the first game I've played of the series (Mostly because I don't own any consoles atm)
 The story is similar but it does goes on a tangent and follows it's own series of events
The story in the books/anime has many faults in terms of game mechanics, being a gamer myself it annoys me once I get out of the 'let's enjoy this story' and into 'game mode'
This game has some really good things, and some really bad ones
 Just like the story in the books, it leads me to believe that whoever designed it is not a gamer themselves
Good Aspects1
 The world
 They made a very believable MMO setting with NPCs acting like players would in the field and in town.2
 Unique NPCs
 You'll see them in town and in the field
 You can befriend them and eventually take them with you to the field or date them, etc.3
 Quest Board
 A good way of making Col (Currency) and getting some extra XP
 Hunting quests, boss quests, mob drops quests (which come mostly from the Unique NPCs and help towards befriending them).3
 The Sword Art system
 The active abilities are fun to combine in combat to use your combos and enhance your own playstyle
 Use a weapon (sword, dagger, axe, etc
) to raise your skill level with it, which will give you access to new arts and buffs that you can learn by spending skill points.4
 Multiplayer
 Is very simplistic
 Play with friends or strangers to grind for gear or levels.Grivances1
 NPC quests
 They are monotonous once you start getting a lot of them
 You pick them and then have to confirm every single one of them, even if they are 150+
 Is very annoying
 QoL (Quality of Life) would be to have a way to pick them and turn them in in-bulk
 2
 Buffs/Debuff Skills
 I rather have smaller buffs or debuffs turned into passive skills or reactive skills
 Than having to buff myself every 30 seconds
 And also they become completely useless towards end game
 As passives/reactives they wouldn't become as useless.3
 Controls
 Gamepads don't work well at the moment
 At least I couldn't get mine to work
 It took me a few hours, but I got used to using mouse + keyboard
 I don't think I'll use a gamepad even if they fix the issues at this point
 Another thing, with so many keys, there is no need for toggle keys
 It should be Optional, not enforced.4
 Difficulty
 It starts good and challenging, but it doesn't scale well
 I got to a point around lvl 20+ when I could one shot trash that should be my level, world bosses (the lvl95 and above) were beaten with ease, and Zone Boses were done in under a minute
 I went into the multiplayer at around lvl 30+ on Nightmare difficulty..
 they should rename it 'Stroll through the Park' difficulty
 Bosses do decent damage, they just need to be more spongey
Overall is a fun game, even with the grivances I have with it
 However, it also is a niche game
 Is not for everyone
I'm not done with it, I'll continue until I finish it

Posted: 27 October
Pros:+Solid port runs 4k 60fps (even in town which was locked only to 30fps on console) +Great story and full of side events represented in visual novel style+Nice Soundtracks+Many things to do +Combat is greatCons:- Controller configuration problemOverall:9
5/10Update:After playing 60h+End game content is big and it has it's own storyi noticed some bugs in game like:-Your character get stuck sometimes and cannot move (Seriously
 you'll be forced to exit)-The game does freeze during loading or when you switch back to the game after using another app

Hey
 Yeah you
Are you one of those people who watched Sword Art Online and afterwards thought: "Damn if only Kirito ended up with Lizbeth instead of Asuna, or maybe Sinon or Yukki...
 hell maybe even Leafa or Silica, because hey why not that's not weird at all"Well do I have the game for you.
 Where literally everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, around you can be your next Waifu
 -A more serious review-If you have not watched the anime I highly recommend you do so before even considering buying a game about it
 I say this because there is a LOT of talking in this game between the main characters, typical of games in this genre, and if you know nothing, you will quickly grow bored of it
 Just an FYI..
There is a lot to like in this game
 It successfully captures the SAO feel perfectly, even going as far as to have roaming parties of AI battling out in the wilderness, a nice touch that makes the game feel more alive
 The story, so far for me, is solid with plently of cutscenes and chatter between characters
 I have no problem with this personally and see it as a positive rather than a negative, although I will say the translation could of done with some improvement
 The art style and graphics are nice, it is a port so I didn't expect anything amazing although a remaster would of been appreciated
Combat is satisfying and diverse, choose any weapon you like and any role you like
 Wanna be a healer or tank, no problem
 Chaining skills and attacks with your companions is vital as it allows massive damage gains for quick slaying of harder mobs and bosses
As I hinted in the beginning there is an affection mechanic
 This is used to prioritize what your companions do while in the field, as in either focus on healing, buffing, attacking etc by rewarding them with a 'Good Job' when they do something you approve of while out in the field
 But this is also used to get closer to characters, and I mean WAY close, to the point you can literally take them to bed..
 for some pillow talk
 I have never seen this in a game before now and I find it a real positive point
 I actually care about my companions, something games fail nowadays
 You can take them for walks and do some casual dating, as well as gifting them presents which normally consists of new gear
 If there is more than that, I don't know about it yet..
There is a LOT of content here to enjoy and I can see myself putting in 100s of hours to do and see everything
 There is plenty to do, although I will point out there is a lot of the same thing to do
 Expect to be doing the same things over and over..
The game runs fine
 I have maxed out settings at 4k and the game runs perfectly, it's a nice change to see a decent port from consoles
 There is a small issue with getting your controller to work that can be easily resolved through the Steam controller settings
 I will mention a few negatives here, as the game is far from perfect
 The AI can be kinda stupid..
 and in some cases really stupid
 This makes most fights, outside of bosses, a little easy as they provide no challenge whatsoever
 This is a big problem, but one I can ignore

Played the game for a little, Pretty fun
Posted: 8 November
I love this game, it's the only one I have played this much
It has a touching story although it starts off really slowly in the beginning, being mostly fetch quests and bringing you around in all the areas to unlock dungeons for your MSQ
 But later the Heavensward story and especially the Stormblood story are really goddamn touching
 I started out with a friend of mine a year ago
 He started playing in 2010 when it first released and was an utter disaster
 but now, this game is indeed one of the best MMO's out there
 I don't mind paying 35 euros to play for 3 months
 And now after playing for a year myself i became a mentor
 Helping people who are just starting out in the game
 And don't hate on all mentors
 Some do it for the crown, but most still do it to help other
Now for the gameplay, it starts off slow with maybe like 1 to 10 skills total before you unlock the job for your class
But after a while hotbars tend to fill up
Graphics are good, even though I have to put them lower because of my older laptop (AMD Radeon HD 7600 graphics card)
 But the game still looks surprisingly nice
And lastly apart from alot of fetch quests you just have to watch out for RMT (Real Money Trading) bots in the 3 main cities
 Just report them and be on with your day
 Since if you do buy gil, the ingame currency from those sites you can get banned

The premier MMORPG on the market right now
 Even though the quest design is a fairly rote affair, the level of polish is top-notch, and immediately evident in the graphics, gameplay, and music
 The community is mostly friendly to new players, and the old content is completely doable even years later, ensuring you sink hours into this game before even thinking about the first expansion
 With the promise of much more to come, Final Fantasy XIV stands head and shoulders above everything else
 World of Warcraft

Hi, I am looking to get into this game, but I am curious on the gear customization
 Can I change the look of gear, but keep the stats
 For example, GW2's wardrobe system
 Can I customize each peice or what
is the gil cap for the free trial 20, 30, or 100k atm
 seen multiple posts in different places at different times, and the official site just says theres a cap with no specific number that i can see
So, it wants me to enter a CD-Key in order to try the Trial Version
Help
Posted: 5 June
So I have bought this game on 05/25/17 and have been only playing this game till 06/04/2017 with an accumulate of 139 hours
Update: 06/22/2017 accumulated about 235 hours and I have payed a month of my Subscription :)
 I am reupdating this for the Summer Sale for people who want to try this game and also for the StormBlood DLC update
 Positive:-Noob Friendly-Tons of content (heavensword content might be needed if u want to max to 60)-Chocobo-The godlike music-Multiple classes to choose from
-The community seems better than most MMO'S that I have played
-New DLC for more new content
-Heavily Story relient
 Most mmos have faied to make a decent story line but this game manged to pull it off
-Fun with friends
-Options to change your HUD settings
-Dungeons/Trials/Raids
 Probably the best thing in this MMO with each bosses being unique and it does require everyone to cooperate
Update: Graphics: Even with a Low end PC you can still run this game smoothly
 For Medium-High End PC the game looks gorgeous from Cutscenes to the most simplest flower it looks amazing
Free Companies: Aka guilds- If you can find a dedicated Company you can obtain tons of benefits and some can help you run dungeons
 (Just joined one so not much info there)Enternal Bondings:
So there is something called the enternal bonding (sorry if I am saying it wrong)
 Which are marriages
 With an actual Wedding
Why not lol
 Not fully detailed about this but I find it kinda suprising to have in an MMO bc this is the first I have heard about in an MMO
Fates: Open World Events that can award you EXP if you can find a good amount of people to run with
 (Gotten popular since a StormBlood Update)]-Tons of Mini games that can let you obtain costumes/mounts and cards for tripletriad(Similar to Gwent)Gear: Pretty easy to obtain high end gear that can be obtained from Raids and other methods
 Also Relic/Anima Weapons (aka legendary weapons) for a specified class that could take you probably days to weeks to obtain the highest stat
(Looks pretty cool)Classes: Not sure if I was specific with classes in this game, You will have a single character with multiple classes to change into
 There are 9 DPS,,3 Tanks,3Healers, 7 Crafters, and a class to obtain ores/fishing
 This helps prevent anylack of endgame content
 And they can be all maxed out to lv 70
Negative:- Past 50+ the story just feels somewhat dreadfully long, It's mostly for you to unlock more dungeons and trials (bosses), But the story starts to take a much better turn after 
-Targeting system when your in a 24 vs 24 vs 24 PvP Match
 (still figuring out how to fix/improve on that) update:
Targeting is difficult because being able to just find the target you want to click will end up clicking your own teamate
 Even the random targeting system is random sometimes not sure how it works
 (still figuring it out)
Update: Ok its pretty difficult for me to even find any negatives in this game
 It doesn't mean its flawless
-lv 1-40: This could drop off alot of people playing this game from probably the story or the amount of content unavailable until you reach lv 50
Neutral:-Monthly Payment: Even I didn't know about this but, It is possible to pay your monthly subscription with Steam Credits
 And yes you can pay through steam if you have purchased the game from steam and its connected to your final fantasy account
 There is constant update and content just given through this game so I can see why its monthly and I can say its worth it
-Servers, I don't really have any problem with this but if your in an empty server and your asking for help, it might be difficult for you
 So its better to do some research
 You will que up with other people in different servers if your doing dungeons or any other instances
Also a paywall if your planning to transfer servers with your character
-Leveling: Took me about maybe 50-70 hour just to max out 1 of my classes to lv 50 then an additional 12-18 hours to max out to 60
 I don't have any problems with this but sometimes I felt that the gap between 50-60 just makes you want to murder your own chocobo
 But its generally worth it if you reach end game
-The story: This is probably the most important
 The story took me about approximetly 2-4 days just from the standard edition
 I haven't finished Heavensward and that took me about another 2-3 days just to finish 60%
 The point being is that YOU will feel rushed and proably feel like skipping cutscenes,texts and other moments in the story
 The cutscenes are amazing and the story is good but It felt like the mistake being is that I rushed it just to reach end game
 The story could probably take you a month or 2 if your mostly on and half the time
 Which is good
Update:-Queue times: This just happened at the Launch of stormblood probably because the amount of Players switching from Tank to DPS
 Of crouse it isn't an issue if you are either a healer/tank or if your group at least one of the 2
 The Queue times could sometimes average around 20-30 minutes
 (Square Enix might plan to fix this issue so this might not be an issue later on
)-Pricing: Not going too complain but for most people they might be stingy about this, If your planning to buy this game I would extremely suggest you to get the complete edition for the standard and stormblood(comes with heavensward) that will be about 55-60$
 Reason is because if you were to buy this game individually (like I did) your going to pay more
Free trial: I want to suggest you to play on the free trial before starting this off but it feels like its going to be difficult to get into until you reach the first dungeon trial at 20
 I want people more people to play this game but some of my friends dropped from the free
trial probably because they didn't have any dedicated commitment from leveling 1-19
 The Free Trial is capped at lv 30 but I get the feeling you still won't be able to experience all the features in this game
 But you can max out to 30 before purchasing the game
Updated:I am probably missing out more information about this game than I am right now but majority of it is positive
This game is highly underated and I wish that people would at least try the game at see the amount of potential this game has
 To be honest this game feels like what WoW became popularr when Wrath of the Litch King was released
(Not a hate rant)
 This game feels like it has more content than GW2 endgame
 Both are amazing MMO's but, Final Fantasy 14 feels like the MMO that I was missing in my life
 If Square Enix keeps up the constant updates I am willing to keep playing
Rating: 10/10

Ruined my life
 Five stars

I've lost control of my life
Posted: 18 November, 2014
I gave up WoW (or World of Warcraft) For this game
 Why
 You only need one character to play every class
 The classes build off of eachother to add diversity to your play style as well as to upgade into more role focused jobs
 You can craft your own gear, you can make your own food and you can play 90% of the game ALL BY YOURSELF
 You don't have to be in a guild or part of a click
 The people who play this game are shockingly friendly and supportive
 Dungeons are part of a finder in game
 The story line is epic and the cinematics are breathtakeing
 The opening video almost had me in tears just because I knew what was happening without any words
 Square has really outdone themselves with this title and I can't wait to see how they wow me with FFXV
Edit: As per a commented question, The sub options come in 30/90/180 day increments and can be set up as recurring (thanks Pasty858)
 180 days is roughly $78
Also, anyone who would like to share in the recruit a friend benefits, message me
SO
 Its been a while since I've played
 after logging over 200 hours that weren't counted on here, and doing everything short of Savage content, I have to say that I never thought I would play a game that would tug my heart strings so much again
 But this game
 The most recent MSQ line just keeps the punches coming
 It was amazing
 If you love FF games, you must give this one at least a one month (or 14day) trial period

9/10 - Would Manderville again
This review was written based on version 3
0Pros:Consistent, large patches about every 3 months
Gorgeous graphics engine
 Deep crafting system
Probably the best storytelling in an MMO I've ever seen (but it does take 30+ hour to really get into the meat of it)One of the most friendly gaming communities around
Cross-platform play with the PS3 and PS4, excellent controller support for PC
Possible to play casually and still enjoy/experience the game with hardcore friends
Hildebrand - Game doesn't take itself too seriously and just has fun
Neutral:Game doesn't reinvent the MMO wheel
 It is a pretty standard "theme park" MMO
 That being said, it is extremely polished and everything in the game is executed very well
Subscription model, I was almost tempted to put this in the Pros column
 One of the few games to do this model well in a sea of F2P MMOs
Cons:Tens of hours of monotonous fetch quests sprinkled throughout the game
 Usual MMO fare
Long PvP queues, slightly unbalanced
 (Not enough people play PvP)Endgame content can be very grindy at times
 (Ex: Relic Weapons, and "Run the same 2 dungeons over and over to get currency to buy gear"
)Gil sellers - I realize this happens in pretty much every MMO
 This didn't make the list because it happens, it is strictly on the list because of advertising chat spam
 On an average day you will see a lot of messages (unless you're like me and are so fed up with it you go /away)
 Expect the spam to be cranked up to 11 whenever a large piece of content is released
 I really feel SE could implement better countermeasures with respect to advertising
 It does seem worse than in many of it's other AAA MMO competitors
 On a side note, I'm told the JP servers are practically gil seller free
 I've never tested this myself however
 Overall, not a huge con, but an annoyance none the less
 
Posted: 19 January, 2015
I've never been an MMO player
 Briefly played Tera - liked it but found progression slow - and briefly WoW - disliked the combat, just felt like button mashing
 I also played Mabinogi for a short while and really disliked the game's mechanics
 One day I felt the urge to play one and I knew a friend was planning to start this so I bought it but neither of us started
 9 days ago a friend of mine was looking for people who wanted to start and I decided that if it was in my steam list I may as well try it out
 I am now 95
9 hours in according to steam and I love it
 I've just hit level 50 and got my Paladin armour and I'm still looking at all the content coming up
 As I speak server is going down to patch even more content into the game
 So here's the detailed review:StoryThe story is a good one as far as MMOs go (based on my limited experience)
 I'd equate it to WoW in some ways as FFXIV builds off of an already established lore but is still extremely easy for new players to get into
 I don't want to say much about it but Square Enix really put work into making a good story
 It teeters a bit at times, especially around the middle (lv30-40 is a bit slow) but it's very enjoyable if you get into it
ClassesCombat classes are fairly traditional: tank, support, ranged DPS and melee DPS
 Still within these wider definitions, each individual class is fairly unique
 To add to this you are not restricted to the classes that you pick at the beginning of the game
 You will unlock the ability to train any and all classses as you wish which allows for a lot of flexibility
 But "Oh, the grind " you say
 Nope, all classes trained beyond the first receive exp gain bonuses which really speeds up the process
 This is alongside the quick levelling options which I'll discuss in a later section
 There's more though
 All combat classses have a progression called a "Job" which is earned by reaching a certain point in the story, getting a class to lv30 and the corresponding second class to lv15, and then finishing the job quest
 It's actually really easy to do and it encourages you to try a different role
All combat classes are unique and don't overlap much at all which is great
As for crafting classes, there's a fair few of them and I have limited experience of them right now but crafting itself isn't just sit there and wait for things to appear
 There's an active process and is fairly enjoyable
 Just like the combat classes, new skills are unlocked and it becomes a sort of strategic minigame
 Quick synthesis for bulk items is available as well so you don't have to do it for each item
Still I can see crafting becoming tedious
 repetitive and boring at some point but that's no different from any other mmo
 Also, unlike the combat classes, the crafting classes aren't really unique
CombatThe combat system is targetted, which honestly I was sceptical about when first going in as I'm not a big fan of targetted combat but it grows on you
 This is mostly to do with how the game feels since you really have to think about movement, positioning, skill orders, skill timing etc
 from more or less the beginning of the game
 This is a big deal and playing the first 20 or so levels in WoW feels boring and just mashing buttons in a certain order
 The 2
5sec global cooldown adds to the strategic element of it too
 You have more time to think and decide what move would be appropriate, but you also have a longer window to be punished for choosing the wrong skill
 I honestly think this is way more fun and interesting compared to other games with a much smaller global cooldown
Another important point is that this game is very controller friendly
 It's on the PS3/PS4 with cross platform support so that would be why
 I personally play with a controller and it feels very smooth
 I don't feel too overwhelmed with skills and I've unlocked all of them for my job with 3 cross skills in use as well (I have 2 full hotbars but it's very easy to switch between them)
 It's down to preference in the end but the option is really nice to have
LevellingThere are so many different ways to level it's crazy
 Though the main story quest is compulsory, there are loads of side quests available
If you think quests are repetitive you can switch over to doing FATES which are events that spawn that give gil (money) and experience to everyone that completes them based on the level of participation
If that's boring there are many different dungeons to do with solid exp gain on all of them
 Duty roullete will give you bonus exp once a day so deffo worth doing that
No
 Then you can do levequests which are contracts to do certain things in certain places which you can get by using one of your levequest allowances (which refill regularly)
 Levequests are available to crafting classes too and are considered the fastest ways to level them
Still not enough
 Then Guildhests might be for you
 These are very similar to levequests but you're put into a duty (instance) with a party and asked to do it as a group
 There's a daily bonus on guildhest roullete as well so that's good
Also, the first time you do a certain dungeon, levequest or guildhest you'll be granted bonus exp which is always a definite plus
Still too slow
 Not enough content
 Too repetitive
 Well if you're that hard to please then I guess I should tell you that there are these things called logs which grant bonus exp for doing certain things
 A hunting log will ask you to kill x number of y, while a crafting log will give you the list of everything you can craft
 The king of all these is the challenge log which refreshes weekly and gives you a lot of exp for completing tasks like "complete 3 dungeons" or "complete 5 levequests"
Honestly there are so many different ways to level that players can pick something that suits them and though some can get repetitive they're fun for the most part
EndgameYou only need to google the game to see the amount of post lv50 content
 The game's been out for about a year and there are things constantly being added
 The first expansion is coming out soon so keep an eye out for that
 Most people will tell you that lv50 is just the beginning, and they're probably right
 I'm only just getting into the endgame and I look forward to everything coming up.PriceWell
 This is the one major downside I see to the game
 It's very expensive
 Though nothing new for an mmo, it is a pretty heavy financial commitment compared to most other steam games out there
 Especially considering you can get Tera, Mabinogi, and loads of other mmos for free now
 You can buy gametime online from other sellers for a bit cheaper but it's still expensive
 I suggest playing the trial to give you a better understanding of whether you'll enjoy it
 I highly suggest it and will be playing it, but I can appreciate that a few years ago I could never afford to play a game like this
ConclusionI honestly think this is the first mmo to seriously impress me with its ability to keep you interested
 It doesn't overwhelm you, nor does it leave you with nothing to do
 Bosses are often really cool and have interesting mechanics, even from an early point in the game
 I really do feel that besides the price this game is practically perfect
 It's a great game - buy it if you can

Like a dealer pushing drugs, a friend referred me to this game as part of an elaborate scheme to get a mount
 I haven't seen my family in months

Posted: 6 July, 2015
I was a WoW player
 I played every expansion, I did HC/Mythic raiding, I spent thousands of hours playing it
 If I could go back and get this on launch day instead, I would do it in a heart beat
If you are an MMO players, this
is hands down the best MMO on the market
I've played every major MMO since Ultima Online back in the 90s
 FFXIV has every element you could want in an MMO and executes them extremely well
The class system, all classes being available on a single character, is amazing
 No alts, not that you can't have them, you just don't need them
The story is captivating, you actually want to read the quests and see what happens rather than just click through to get the objectives
Speak of quests, there are a ton, even without the myriad of side quests, and only completeing the main story, you can reach level cap on a class
 Then roll in dungeons, raids, leves, hunting logs, challenge log, etc etc etc there is never a shortage of things to do, and they have made all of them entertaining
If you like MMOs even a little bit, stop reading and click the buy button
 Really, stop
Why are you still reading
 Stop it
 Go play FFXIV, seriously

Final Fantasy XIV, the original one, was a mess
 The servers were terrible, payments were unfair and confusing, and the game just made it so difficult for you to enjoy
 Square Enix realised, "holy hell, this is bad" and revamped the game, leading to the release of A Realm Reborn
 And boy did they do good
A Realm Reborn is not only a more polished FF XIV, it is a new game
 It offers so much more than the original
 Better service, better gameplay, more engrossing quests, everything an MMO can offer is in this game
 A Realm Reborn is by far the best Final Fantasy of the last console generation, and it is perhaps the best FF I have ever played
 It stays true to it's roots, but still manages to not be a total copy cat of previous FF games
 It borrows alot from the orginal series, when Final Fantasy was at it's best, but adds a sense of freshness so that FF new-comers could pick up the game and play it as their first FF and still have a wonderful experience
Detail is where this game excells
 The amount of effort into making this as refined as possible is staggering
 You could honestly sit at the character creation screen for an hour, picking the tiniest things about your hero
 The environments are fantastic, and it's hard to believe that an MMO looks this good
 As well as being the best Final Fantasy in years, it is also groundbreaking in the MMO genre
 It offers so much to the genre as a whole, it has made a name for it's self as one of the greatest MMOs in recent years
 It is addicting
 It is enchanting
 It is simply bliss
Square Enix have really made me regain my faith in them, and I hope that they let future Final Fantasies learn from A Realm Reborn
 I cannot wait until more content is added into the game, and clock in a few more hours
 Get yourself this game now, even just for the free trial, it's worth it
 Even if you're a hardcore FF fan, or a newcomer looking for a game to start with
 This is the one
+ Essentially has it all
 Near enough limitless gameplay hours+ Environments look stunning, attention to detail is incredible+ Smooth gameplay, easy to learn mechanics+ Makes great homage to previous Final Fantasy games- A lot of fetch quests- Occasional bug here and there10/10
 This is a fantastic game
 Get it
 Now

Early Access Review
If you're thinking of buying this game, stop hesitating and purchase it, immediately
I started an isolated research facility on a frozen wasteland, as a 74-year-old sociopathic scientist called Geckulon Decktar; I researched robotics to begin with, and constructed some automatons to handle the menial tasks like cleaning, cooking and hauling, etc, leaving me free to conduct my research
 All was well- until a band of vagrants laid siege to my settlement
 I barely survived and resolved to increase my security, installing several auto-turrets around my perimeter
 This would keep the ruffians at bay for a time, but I needed a longer term solution- so I turned my focus to bionic enhancements
 I wanted to turn the human form into the ultimate living weapon
 When a faction of slavers passed through my frozen wasteland, I did not hesitate to inspect their wares
 I wanted a slave, but not just any slave- he should be foreboding, brutal, savage
 And there I found him- His name was Skint Mcgruff
 He was a feared crime lord when they captured him, infamous for killing and then devouring the people who wronged him
 I paid the slavers their due and took Skint in
 I fed him (alas, not human meat, but nutrient paste, made from potatoes- poor fare, but such is life in the frozen wastes) and I clothed him
 By now I was confident in my ability to improve upon the human form, and so I presented the idea to him the very next day
 He was keen- particularly about the notion of having retractable claws- and so the work began
 My medical droid handled most of the surgery, but I crafted the bionic components myself
 It was a long and gruelling process, but eventually, he was complete
 More machine now than man, I felt it necessary to rename him..
 to symbolise his departure from prosaic humanity to something more, and thus I named him C.A.N.N.I.B.A
L (Cybernetic Armoured Neutraliser with Neurally Integrated Bionic Attack Limbs)
 He is my pride and joy..
 bionic eyes that can see even in the dark, bionic legs that allow him to sprint faster than a cheetah, and retractable claws with which to tear out the throats of my foes, and of course, I give him leave to feast on their corpses afterward as a reward
 Now, I can conduct my research in peace..

Early Access Review
I felt like I had to share my experiences with RimWorld so far ..
	So I had just established my young but promising new colony, Ashton (a quite ironical name in the end ..
)
 The basic needs were all covered, everyone had a nice place to sleep, decent clothing, enough to eat and time to relax
 The people of Ashton were prosperous
 They lived in harmony with nature and each other
 Their wide fields provided them with plenty of food and they sold the surplus to the passing by caravans
Now and then a few warriors of a near tribe, the Pig Face Men, attacked the settlement, but the people of Ashton were safe, relying on the strength of their automated defence systems
 And so the colony grew and I thought: This is it, I finally have a colony which doesn't collapse after a few hours
As if ..
Remember when I told you about the harmony between the people and with nature
 I meant there were no rivalries between the colonists, most were friends and there even was a married couple, Tali and Waltz
The harmony with nature also seems pretty coherent; the people relied mostly on their crops, eating only those animals which died by natural causes (e.g
 old age or other animals), so the animal population in the near forests remained stable
 So far so good
 But taking those dead animals in meant of course someone had to leave the safe area of Ashton and wander through the wilds
 Normally that wouldn't have been a problem, everyone was equipped with guns and armor of the Pig Face Men so they were quite ready to take on anything coming in their way
 But then came the tortoise
	Waltz left Ashton to get the still fresh corpse of a chinchilla which had been killed by some other animal
 So Waltz has just grabbed it, when a tortoise nearby turned mad
 I thought ok, those aren't that fast, Waltz will be able to safely carry the chinchilla inside and the turrets will take care of the tortoise
Nope
I'm not quite sure what exactly happened, maybe this animal was on speed or something like thak
 Anyway, when it saw Waltz it charged at him at a horrifying pace
 Waltz had just lifted his weapon when this damn creature reached and hurt him badly
 However, its hard shell was no match for Waltz' gun
 And so he came back home, injured but happy, that now there was even more meat than expected
 But the wraith of the tortoise was unforgiving
 The bite wounds in his upper body infected themselves
 The medical treatment didn't work and he got weaker and weaker
 If the infection at least would've been in one of his limbs, that might had saved him, but you can't just amputate someones chest
At last he couldn't fight any longer, the infection overwhelmed him
 Tali, his wife, carved his story in the sides of his sarcophagus
 The burial ceremony was heartbreaking
 Everyone had come: Tali, his sister Julia, his friends Vas, Jones, Stephan, Boyd and Leia, Vas' tame wolf Nevile and Bacon 1 and Bacon 2
 In the light of the evening sun they all waved a last goodbye to their fallen husband, brother and friend, before the people of Ashton went to bed
 With Waltz dead or not, they had to cary on
But apparently it was all too much for Tali, not very surprising if you think about it
 There was only this one little problem: She was a pyromaniac
 When the rest of the colony slept, she left her big and empty bed
 Driven crazy by grief, she did the only thing able to ease her pain
 She set the forest on fire
 Finally, exhausted almost to unconciousness, she fell back into her bed again
While she slept, the others, waken by the crackling fire, desperately tried to put out the flames which already started to spread over to the buildings
 But they simply weren't enough, they could either try to save the buildings or the forest, not both
 Of course they tended to the buildings, to the food storage to be exact
 However it gave the fire the chance to spread through the forest, completely sorrounding the settlement
In the end it was all too much
Tali died in her own fire that she refused to extinguish, Jones and Boyd followed when they collapsed in the infernal heat
 And then, when no hope was left, the gods, the ancestors, the Flying Spaghetti Monster or whatever thi people of Ashton believed in, heard their cries
 Rain started falling down, putting out the fire
 But it was too late
 More than three quarters of the colony had been taken by the flames
 Vas, Stephan and Leia were unconcious
 Julia was the only one still able to stand
 She did what she could, but with all the medicine burned she had no chance
 Leia died first, Vas second
 This caused his wolf Nevile, who had been laying loyal by his side, to turn mad like the damn tortoise and he ripped the still unconcious Stehpan into pieces before he went on attacking a herd of muffalos (some kind of marshmellow like buffalos) which was his end
Traumatised Julia, who managed to flee when Stephan was killed, wandered through the burnt ruins of Ashton
 Blackened stone walls and pieces of charcoal everywhere
 All the food they stored for the winter was gone, the fields empty
 With no medicine left and her own wounds hurting worse and worse, Julia found a last smokeleaf joint in one of the destroyed buildings
 She leant against her brother's sarcophagus and lit it
 So she didn't feel anything when the Pig Face Men attacked
 With the solar panels a loss to the flames, the turrets didn't react when Ashton's last inhabitant finally exhaled her last breath
12 / 10 - Creates more immersive storys than many RPGs; looking forward to my next colony (and possibly its desastrous destruction ..
)
Thanks for reading if you made it this far :-)

Early Access Review
I'm not one to write reviews for games - especially games that are in early access
 So, I'll classify RimWorld as a lifestyle instead of a game
 I was an original kickstarter backer and have played this game (almost) daily for the last 3 years with an estimated 1000 hours of playtime (before the game was avaible on Steam)
 So yes, I'll recommend this game and give it a positive review
 The best way that I can describe RimWorld is the aesthetics of Prison Architect mixed with elements of Dwarf Fortress set in a Firefly styled Universe
 In it's heart, it's a colony simulation game where you take control of colonists who are on a planet away from "civilization"
 You make the decisions to equip, shelter, feed, and protect your colony from the environmental dangers and enemy factions
 Sure, the game is still in Early Access (Alpha 14 at the time of posting), but there are a ton of replayability and mechanics to learn as well as different difficulties and multiple AI types to "guide" your gameplay
 The game is relatively bug free and nicely balanced in the vanilla game
 The modding community is healthy and a lot of really solid mods have been released and updated
With that said, the game may be a little daunting for new players
 There are a lot of elements and core mechanics to the game that take some time to learn
 My suggestion to this is to play the game on a reduced difficulty and learn from your mistakes
 When your colony dies, restart a new map and learn from your mistakes
 Losing is fun
All in all, it's worth the $30 - even if $30 is expensive for an indie game
 I mean, you can cure asthma by replacing a colonist's lungs
 As I said before, I did purchase the game through kickstarter, but the developer added me to the game as a character - so I didn't technically get this game for free, but I did a bit of a bonus

Early Access Review
You're reading the reviews thinking: "Damn, some of these people have like 300+ hours on this, they must really like it
" Then you're looking at the price thinking: "That much
" Definitely worth it in my opinion
 And I've only played for 20 hours (and have gotten not too much done, because there is so much to do)
It's the best base-building survival I've played yet
 You get attached enough to some of your colonists that you become sad if anything happens to them
 You can build your colony however you want to
 Think of it like a top-down minecraft
 You're not limited on how you want to build your base at all, except you can't build multi-leveled buildings
 (Two-story)
Every colonist has their own personality
 IE: My hunter Lumine is probably one of my most useful colonists
 She can snipe targets from long distances with perfect headshots
 However, Lumine is staggeringly ugly and has an annoying voice
 So my colonists don't really like her much
My surgeon Toni has been through so much
 She has gotten her leg and arm ripped off, so I've operated on her and given her a metal arm and leg
 She is literally Edward Elric, except instead of fighting Scar she is healing Scars
 Different Survival Elements
 You need to keep your colonists cool when it's hot, and warm when it's cold
 You can do this in different ways such as crafting them the right clothing, and having heaters/coolers
 Your colonists need to eat
 You can have them eat raw humans and animals like savages, or you can have them butcher animals, and cook different meals so that they can stay healthy
 You need to build a freezer so that your food won't deteriorate
 You need a medical room for the best effective chances of successful operations and treatment
 You'll need to build wind turbines and solar generators so you can give power to the things in your base that require it
 You need to build a research bench and research new..
 well, basically everything
 So the game doesn't just give you everything that's available
 You have to work for it
 In the regular mode of the base game, you start off with 3 colonists
 And you stick with them for a while and think: "When am I going to get more
 This is kind of slow since I only have 3 people
" Next thing you know, you have like 10 people who are all doing their own jobs
 Be it people you recruited, or people who fell from cargo pods from space
And I've only been talking about your base
 This game has an entirely randomly generated world that your colony is in
 Which means trade caravans will visit you, different tribes will visit you
 You can visit them by forming caravans of your own
 You can even raid other bases
 You can eventually build comms equipment to contact different trading ships that are in orbit, or the different outposts nearby
 And you will get raided by a lot of different outposts as well, which means you will have to set up defences
 You can take prisoners and either recruit them, release them, eat them, or harvest them for their organs
 Yep
 Don't want those perfectly good kidneys to go to waste now do we
 If you don't want to take prisoners, you can have your colonist slit the injured guys throat
 It's cold, man
 They just walk right up to the injured fella and either shoot them until they die, or brutally stab them to death
Now one important thing that this game offers which any good game offers: Mods
To me, mods fill the important content that the developers have not added yet
 More turrets, more organized menus, more furniture, more everything
 Even the option to show visitors hospitality so that you can better establish friendship, or even recruit them to your colony
I can't imagine playing the game without some of the mods that I have installed
 Not that the vanilla game is bad, it's just that some of the mods are so useful and necessary that I wouldn't want to play without them
 And none of the mods I have are cheats either
 You need to use your valuable recourses in order to craft everything, including objects from mods
 So definitely check the workshop out once you get the game
 The only negative that I have so far isn't very much a negative of the game but just me being a little whiner
Sometimes, some of the random events are very highly not in your favor, and completely unfair
 Which will result in you reloading an autosave or main save, just to prevent the event from happening
 When you reload a save, that event that played out gets replaced with a different random event
 So you're getting raided by a bunch of people while half your colonists have severe illnesses
 No worries
 Just reload a save
 It's saved my colony a bunch of times
 Sometimes I've let some of my colonists die and I've continued the game, but most of the time I just reload an autosave to prevent their deaths
 It's an easy way to cheat the system
 Overall, it's a great game
 There is a reason you're seeing people with hundreds of hours on it
 Every single player's game is different
 Different bases, different colonists
 So many outcomes
 It's why you see so many people posting their stories on their reviews
 It's a game that I didn't even know I wanted until I played it
 Amazing community
 Especially the modding community
 It's making the game so much more than it already is
 10/10 would have one of my rookie hunters shoot at a hare 40 times point blank, only to miss, give up, and go stargaze
 Oh and don't let your colonists go on a mental breakdown
 ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE THE PYROMANIC TRAIT
 My god
 Freakin Engie, literally sets fire to everything she helped build
 Try to arrest them or reload a save
 They will burn everything, slaughter your cats/dogs, fight your own colonists, and wreak havoc as much as the random evented angry hares that can destroy your entire colony if you're not prepared
 I probably missed a lot in my review
 But hey, you will discover that yourself once you play it
 So what are you waiting for

Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony
 Do you want to:1
 Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers
 YOU CAN DO THAT.2
 Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join
 YOU CAN DO THAT.3
 Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist
 YOU CAN DO THAT.4
 Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice
 YOU CAN DO THAT.5
 Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter
 YOU CAN DO THAT
Really, what else do you need in a game

I started quite innocently at a save, three wonderful colonists
 Things were going well, I got some growth up and my happy colonists were making friends with the visitors
 My farms were doing exeptionally well, and after not too long, I had over one thousand in Rice, Potatoes and corn
 In addition to quite a lot of strawberries
 All of this in my refridgerated room
 I figured I didn't have to worry about food for a long while
I was wrong
I got the fine idea of buying a hen and a rooster from a traveller, thinking eggs would make some fine additions to my food storage
 I made a barn and made sure all the animals had access to food
Focusing on other things, I completely forgot about the animals for a while
 Until all of a sudden there were 30 chickens
 I was a little shocked about the rate in which they'd grown, and started a hay farm to give them an alternate food source that didn't ruin me
 This would all be good and dandy in no time
 I was wrong
By the time I'd gotten the hay sowed and partially grown, I was down to less than 500 of all vegetables
 And to top it off, a blight was around the corner and completely destroyed all my crops
I had to start over
 Completely panicked, I slaughtered some chickens
 At this point, it was 70+
 So I figured taking 25 of them to the slaughterhouse would give me some time
I was very wrong
 Desperately looking for a way out, I had to slaughter another 20 something chickens
 Now they were approaching 70 again
 I was just hoping for a caravan to show up so that I could sell some chickens and buy some veggies
I got some hay grown and decided to cut off the chickens access to all other food sources
 Now they were getting past 80
 But I had some hay, hoping it would work out, I kept at it
 I didn't mind the chickens for a while, until I noticed that some of them were starving
 By then, I'd gotten my veggie count back up a few hundreds
 I let the chicken into my pantry
 And forgot about it
Some time later and A LOT of chickens later, a caravan finally appear, so I figure, finally, time to sell some chickens
 Let's check how many I've got

I enjoy Dwarf Fortress
 But I felt disconnected with my dwarves
 Honestly, 80 dwarves in one fort, and I'm supposed to care about how my Baron feels
Then I tried RimWorld
 I got it October 20th of 2016
 And
 I pretty much played it for near 20 hour stretches
 Until that Sunday night when I realized, "I have work on Monday
"My first colony was thrown together in something of a huff as I didn't know what I was really doing, but the game is very straightforward so once I figured things out (and the ingame helper is a nice touch, Devs
 Kudos), I was grooving
My two main colonists were a fighter and doctor, plus a crafter
 They got along
 All was well
 Between the mining, expanding, animal taming, it all felt very easily managable
 There were a few mistakes, but the colony thrived
Until he came along
 The pyromaniac
 He would occassionally start fires, usually after being rebuffed by the good female doctor who had her eyes on someone else
 Often this would lead to him being arrested and thrown into a cell
 If the fires were set away from the compound, then that was fine
It kept getting to the point everyone was tired of his abrasive attitude and having to put out his fires
 Literally
 His mood would always tank after the tribal and pirate raids, yet he seemed ecstatic when it came to lobbing his molotov cocktails at the would be attackers
Then IT landed
 An AI Core
 The crafter had gone out to retrieve something, and that triggered the core
 Out slothed a slow moving, minigun armed slug
 Everyone went on alert and was ready to fight, armed with the pistol, rifle, and knife that remained
 The fighter died in a hail of bullets
 He died
 Blown literally into pieces infront of the good doctor
 She went berserk, broken at the sight of her lover ripped to pieces
 For all of the 5 seconds of rage the slug allowed before she was mowed down as well
The crafter turned tail and ran
 Fear had overtaken him
 He dashed into the recesses of the compound
 The pyro had long since lost his mind, laughing and setting fires, about the colony, then in the compound
 The first to burn up were the dearly dismembered lovers
 The crafter tried to fight back the impending flames by was consumed
As the slug advanced, our moronic miscreant looked to the slug, then back to the flames..
 It was a simple choice in his mind
 The loving, warm embrace of a firey death
 The single thing he loved more than anything else in his life
 A deep laugh emanting from the depth of his core as he leapt into the raging inferno....
 Meanwhile I'm sitting here watching this all unfold sipping a red bull like, "..
 THIS IS FREAKING AWESOME
" Rolled another colony and was up till 5:30am the next day still playing
 This repeated ad nasuem all weekend in a variety of scenarios, now enabled by some mods, because hey, themed plays are fun
 Especially the Cannibal Run
 Oh man
 That was..
 That was really bad
Then monday morning I show up to work looking like I'd been partying all weekend: "Dude are you okay

The Forest is hands down the best Alpha game I have ever purchased
 With that being said, i'd like to list the pros and cons of the gamePROS:-Open world sandbox survival done rightWhen I first got this game, I thought it would just be another one of those build a castle and live forever kind of games
 I was wrong, thankfully
 In The Forest, you can build incredible structures, but the enemies make your life difficult regardless of how good your defenses are
 Want to eat but your food reserves are low
 Too bad
 There's a raiding party of 6 cannibals outside yelling at you about your destruction of the environment
 The more you cut down trees and kil cannibals, the more enemies will come for you

================================https://www.youtube
com/user/fdreviews================================Journal Entry 1 After crash landing I have gathered all resources at the plane, walked a short distance from the crash and found a nice hill to build fire and setup camp
 Journal Entry 2 I went down to the beach and started fishing, found lots of beer bottles in the sand, I even found a tent pitched on the beach..
 where is everyone
 Journal Entry 3 While setting up camp I saw a group of 3 tribesmen doing a beach patrol in the area where I was fishing, I didn't engage only observed them
 Its getting dark now and I know now that im not alone
 I'm not sure of these tribesmen's intentions but Its starting to rain and I need to build a shelter
 I'm going to the woods to collect some logs
Journal Entry 4 While heading back with a fresh cut log I noticed multiple lit torches heading towards my camp, about 12 of them from what I counted, Indeed it appears there are many more tribesmen than I originally thought
 They appear to be scanning my camp looking for survivors
Journal Entry 5 After observing the tribesmen for 10 or so mins I approached one of the females of the pack, she stared at me in shock for about 30 seconds then screamed and ran away
 She did not attack..
 perhaps they are a friendly people after all
 Journal Entry 6 I should have just left them alone, apparently the female ran back to get the rest of the tribe...
 I was attacked and chased, I was able to kill three of them before accidentally backing up off a cliff and falling to (what I thought was my death)
 Journal Entry 7 I have awoken in a cave of hanging bodies, I am badly injured from my cliff fall and only have my terribly lit Bic lighter to guide my way through the cave...
 this may be my last journal entry as I am starving and going to die soon...
 Thank you..

WOW
Got out of the plane and ran away as quickly as I could(first time I played they attacked the plane like 3 minutes in the game) So I figured they were attracted by the crash
 Found a quiet place, I built a shelter and made a fire
 Cooked a rabbit, but it started raining so I couldn't keep the fire up, so I found some berries and luckely, they were not poisenous
 Went to sleep woke up early morning and there was 3 naked guys stalking me outside, they attacked me and I ended up slaying all of them
 I built one statue with their heads and legs
Later in the morning, 3 other naked guys came near my shelter, I burned the statue and they ran away
 They came back 5 minutes later with 3 more
 I couldn't handle their attacks, so they kidnapped me
 I woke up in a dark cave with only a lighter to show me the way
 I heared a distant shouting that scared the living crap out of me and I saw about 30 passengers hanged upside down above me
I tried to find my way out of the cave, I almost couldn't see anything and I could hear them, I know they were watching me
 Then after a lot of stress and sweating, I found the exit
 I was so glad to finally see the sun, then some extremelly weird texture rendering just started spawning trees, flowers and life in front of me
 Then went on a run trying to find my shelter but I was very low health
 Got cold
 I got jumped on by a naked girl who were on top of a tree
 She took me by surprise, I shouted in real life, I saw my cat running out of the room scared of me
Finally, I take a close look at the naked girl just before she gives me the final blow, the last comment I have before to die: '' Hey
 I can see her tities''
I survived 2 days
This game has a lot of bugs, they still have a ton of work to do on this game
 But if you are not the kind of person that expect a finished game when you play an early release, you know this game is going to be great
 Keep supporting it, make your friends play it and this could be without a doubt the best survival game ever

This game has oodles of potential
 Nothing more romantic than strolling down a sunset beach being chased by a bunch of naked cannibals
 Makes you feel like a celebrity
Depending on your nature I would suggest, if you are patient: You don't mind set backs,and have a good sense of humour
 Get it now
 It's pretty awesome even with all the flaws
 Regular updates mean you're generally not stuck too long with one issue.
 of course with each update you'll generally stumble upon something else to perplex you.
 think of it as hurdles.
 But everything looks pretty so that's okay
 If you don't enjoy being murdered by flying tables, eaten by land sharks, dislike leviatating geese, backwards rabbits and other such oddities then I suggest you wait it out till the game is more developed

EDIT: Looks like the reviews that were on top that shouldn't have been are now downvoted
 Thank you everyone for supporting good reviews and motivating the few that do so to continue making quality reviews
***THIS IS A PRE-ALPHA
 This review and the final game are subject to change**Main Menu & Optionshttp://imgur
com/a/DqypyThe Forest is a unique survival game that pits the player against a bunch of mutants in a forest
 Chopping down trees, foraging food and staying warm are just some of the survival aspects that can be found within this game
 [4
5/5] Gameplay - For an early access game, you're spoiled for choice when it comes to building
 It's interesting to note that every plane crash/new game puts you in a different location, at a different time of hour
 I found pleasure in cutting down the trees in the game, as well as carving off the flesh of animals and wearing it as armour
 The backpack system is pretty neat, especially how it's laid out
 What's interesting is how you can get infected from having blood on your body, and needing to wash it off
 I thought that was a pretty neat feature
 Stealth actually works if you aren't already seen, and I've snuck up on my fair share of mutants and initiating...
[3
5/5] Combat - NO, there are no conventional guns (only a flare gun) and never will be (although bows are something that might be implemented I hope)
 I can see how that would ruin gameplay
 Now that's out of the way, I feel as though this could be improved or at least more forgiving
 It takes a considerable amount of hits to kill each one, so it's best to tackle one at a time or run if there's a group
 The mutants are pretty aggressive when in close proximity, and god forbit you attack one and more will come
 Whether or not this is a feature or a bug is beyond me, but in it's current state I can say it's not as fleshed out as I would have thought
 In addition, blocking is not implemented, or if it is I don't know what the controls are because..
[3
5/5] Controls - Are not shown anywhere
 Yeah this game doesn't hold your hand (which is great, but at the very least provide a control scheme or something
) I checked the options menu as well as the in-game survival guide for instructions but to no avail
 Hopefully they do patch this into the game, and I will update the review accordingly
 From what I've deduced from button mashing and relying on other games for a template, the controls are pretty accessible
 In the future I wouldn't mind rebinding them however
 On the forums, I hear of mouse input going awry or latency issues, but I haven't experienced any as of yet so I cannot comment on that
 What I can comment on though is the..
[4
5/5] AI - Which I might say is very polished
 I didn't expect much from the alpha, but everything the developers said about them was true
 Sadly I haven't seen any mutants other than the naked female/male and tribes ones, no "ugly mofos" as of yet (probably due to a distinct fear of delving into these caverns)

Early Access Review
TL:DRIt's worth the money in it's current state
Fiddly building system that allows for very intricate base building
Story is optional
 No need to due anything story related in order to get all game content
Regular updates
Beautiful game
Interesting crafting system
You get to kill cannibals in ever more interesting ways
 (This is worth $15 alone)You get to hunt animals, use skins for crafting, and mount heads on wall of your house
Co-opEven in it's current state, EA, I feel I've gotten more than my moneys worth out of the game
 I haven't finished the game yet, but I've seen videos of people who have
 I'm more interested in base building and waging war on cannibals
 There isn't much of a story
 Your plane crashes, kid is abducted by cannibals, you need to save him
 That's all there is to it
 No quests or anything like that
 As you explore you find pictures drawn by kids, and photos, and empty camps that show others have been here before you
 You need to put forth a good effort to piece together a story
 Almost like a detective
 Find the clues to explain the situation
 It's there if you want it, but seems to be something the devs threw in there as an afterthought
 It's well done imo though
As for the base building
 It's a bit fiddly, and takes some effort to make a really intricate base
 The system of base building allows you to build very complex bases though
 Which is great for when you get a large group of cannibals attacking your base you can make all kinds of fun ways to trap or funnel them into choke points for maximum cannibal crushing carnage
 After every update all the trees you've cut down will respawn
 So getting a bunch of trees suddenly appearing right through the middle of your house is a possibility
 Make sure you build your base around the trees you've cut down, just leave the stumps and build around them
 Cutting the trees that are growing through structures will destroy the structure
The crafting system is fun imo
 No crazy animations or wait times for making rope, molotovs, axes, spears, etc
 Just open the inventory and start combining ingredients
 Certain herbs can be combined to restore health/stam
 Combine 2 deer skin with rope and cloth to make a waterskin
 Feathers and sticks to make arrows
 Add cloth and booze to arrows to make fire arrows
 A watch+coins+booze+circuit board to make a bomb
 Add sap for a sticky bomb
 Pretty simple
 Once you add an item to the crafting mat in the inventory (just right click something to add it to the crafting mat, no clicking and dragging nonsense), a stick for example, a list appears telling you every item you can make using a stick
 A bow, spear, upgraded spear, snowshoes, arrows, club, etc
 It doesn't tell you which ingredients, or how many you will need to make each item though
 So trial and error, or google, is needed
 It's kinda fun
 Almost like a mini game
No voice acting, hand holding, tutorial (besides a very simplistic manual that explains the very basics), or anything like that
 As soon as you wake up in the crashed plane you have the freedom to do whatever it is you want
 No time constraints or anything like that
 This is what i love about the game
 Nothing is worse than having a 30 minute opening tutorial to explain that you have to eat/sleep/drink in order to survive
 Also, no stupid plot points that open up more content
 Like doing a certain part of the story in order to craft fire arrows or whatever
The game is still being worked on with regular updates
 Bug fixes and more content, like craftable/findable items, come every 15 days I think it is
 Something like that
 There are a few items that have no use
 Snowshoes for example
 I would imagine that you will need them in the snow areas, but in the games current state they aren't needed at all
 I see this as a good thing
 It means there's alot more tweaking and game mechanics to be implemented
There is co-op but I've never played it
 Therefore, I will leave this out of the review
 Plenty of other reviews cover this subject I'm sure
At the end of the day, it all comes down to if it's worth the money or not
 In it's current state, I have gotten my moneys worth of enjoyment out of the game many times over
 With more content and updates being added on a regular schedule It will only get more enjoyable

I highly recommend this game to anyone who can tolerate nudity and gore
 This can be just a survival game as you can turn the cannibals off on the main menu, but to me the cannibals are the meat and potatoes of this game and I find myself sorely missing them should they not come visit me a couple of times a day
 The AI in this game is honestly the best Ive encountered
 The game now features different types of cannibals with tribes that will fight if you watch silently, but will mostly unite in their hatred of the guy deforesting their land, (you)
 The cannibals will still throw a couple of punches at each other if theres enough of them around however
 There are starving cannibals who will try to stalk you to find out where you live and try to scavenge off any kills you make, scouts for larger tribes who will often simply run away to alert others of your locations, hunting parties (though Im pretty sure theyre only hunting you), and cannibals just trying to live out their lives in peace that you can finding sleeping in camps or caves
 Cannibals will duck and roll to evade attacks, climb trees to escape, light tennis balls on fire and throw them at you, wreck your base if youre not careful, but theyll also do things like drop effigies which you can catch them praying at if left uninterrupted, theyll drag their wounded out of battle if they can, and will run off to retrieve others if you let them escape

How many people have you seen in the review section with 100 hours
 That's right
 But I'm not just going to be one of those people who just says, "Yeah, its ok i guess," hinting at their 10000 hours
 Before I go into the review, I would like to give some context
 So, I bought this game around v0
03, and I spent a lot of time just base building, not really caving 'cause I be a wus
 Finally, a while later, I saw the game was at v0.29
 That was when I added 80 hours to my game time
I know the location of every useful item, I have gotten down into the sinkhole, found and alternate route to the katana, ect
 I have enjoyed every last bit
 I'm a bit bored, and waiting till v0
31 to see what it brings, but for know, I will just review
Pros-Can run on a potato, but expect some VERY scaled down resouldtion
 I mean like 520x420
 But that is an extreme
-Can be very smexy, at 1080p with ultra settings, it is truely gorgeous, but you need a supercomputer
-The building system is very flexable
 There is very little snapping, and that is somehing I like
-I know it was added forever ago, but multiplayer was probaly the most beneficial thing to this game
 Ever
-It's fifteen f*cking dollars
 FOR ALL OF THIS
-Still in alpha stages, so more could be added
 (Though I have played more hours of this than there are hours of Dishonored's campaign, so its already worth my money
)-Great community, unless you join a game with a five-year-old who says, "Your in big trouble," and kicks you from game
 That legitimately happened before I wrote this review
 Srsly
 Give me a reason
-Multitude of collectable items
-Interesting lore, or so I think
 There is no wiki page, so you have to explore and find all the burial sites and photos to figure it out yourself
 I could be way wrong
 Look at the end of this review for my personal opnion on the story
-Devs are fantabulous
 Thats not a word
Cons-It is in alpha, so there is more to be desired
-When running The Forest on PotatOS 6
7 [Like that pun :3= 
] and you have it in low res mode, it is so pixelated, my friend thought that a tennis ball was a lemon, and proudly proclaimed, "This is my lemon
"-Feels a but empty once you have gotten to the sinkhole
 So don't rush to get in there
-The inventory system is set up so you can carry a certain amount of a certain item
 It is always the same
 The katana goes to the upper-left, the rebreather next to it, you can only carry 5 dynamite, ect
 The downside in this I find is the lack of inventory management
 It might just be me, but I relish in the orginazational pleasure of shifting item around in my inventory to make room for new ones
 Maybe it is just me and I'm a weirdo, but it's a con for me so it's on the list
-Want an axe for a weapon
 No..
 well, tough luck
 Katana is a bit later game so..
-I like a heavy focus on the range of items and fauna to be found in a game
 The game is doing better, but my soul is a void, so keep adding to fill it devs :3=Lore- The sinkhole is called a cetone` in the patch notes, which is a Mayan word for abyss
 These cetone`s formed in the yucatun peninsula in Mexico
 This said, the area is not an island, but is blocked of by a mountainous region, indicating it is the southern yucatan peninsula
 The compass points north to the mountains, so it must take place in the southern region of Guatamala
 The Cetone`s were worshiped by the Mayans
 This must mean that the massive Cetone` in the middle of the map was a hub of mayan civilization, as the cetone` there is many times bigger than any one in our knowledge, as they are generally only 30 feet deep
 Perhaps a strange a race had hid in these caves and slowly mutated over time to adapt to cannibalistic dietary habits
 As the Mayans discovered the place, they also discovered its unruly inhabitants
 Perhaps that was why the Mayans disappeared
 As memory faded of the hellish place, the sinkhole was rediscovered and put on the front pages of caving magazines worldwide
 As you explore, you can see evidence of early 20th century spelunking equipment
 After the explorers never returned, the incident was forgotten, and became a sort of bermuda triangle
 In 1982, a family went on a boat trip to explore the region
 They lost thier son and looked for him
 It is assumed he was eaten
 The grave near the yacht may show that one of the parents died by starvation
 The final parent is gone without trace
 The several campgrounds indicate people who explored the region, not believing the rumors of cannibals
 A film crew's camp can also be found by Goose Lake
 James Blanc (you) and Timmy Blanc (your relative) crash in the forest
 The Virginias, or six-legged female mutants, are the only cannibals with genitalia, indicated that the malformed cannibal babies surrounding them are its offspring
Like this review so others can see and revise my theories

This is a review of the offline game
This game has been one of the best games I have ever played
 I have been playing games for over
25 years and haven't experienced a game this epic
 I'd like to share one of my quests
I had just finished my first base on a peninsula
 It had a bed and some storage containers and was starting to feel pretty safe
 I hadn't seen many dangerous Dino other that dilos (the ones that killed the fat guy in Jurassic park)
 I had stockpiled some goods and decided I would go try to tame something worth taming
I found a raptor in a valley surrounded by rocks and decided he was gonna be my buddy
 The taming process was pretty intense so it really made me want to keep my Raptor safe
 I saddled him up and decided to give him a go
 He was amazing, we ran around killing everything
 After about 30 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest
 We ran through the night and in the morning i realized how extra lost i was and got worried
 I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around
 After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were
 Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed me

Since most people are bashing the PvP servers for the griefing, I feel like someone should answer that and also talk a bit about the PvE servers
Right now I got close to 130 hours in the game, about half of that on PvP servers and half of that on PvE, all official ones
 All the thing people say about the griefers is true, they'll kill your dinos, steal your stuff, abuse your body and destroy your house as soon as you go to sleep
 In fact a lot of tribes organize group to play past midnight for the sole reason of hunting sleeping players
 And that's the keyword here TRIBES
 If you're playing on a PvP server you gotta keep in mind that you're not supposed to do it at your pace and take your time building your little Tatch hut with it's little thatch fence with your Raptor and a couple of Dilos
 Slowly learning the game by yourself, taking everything in, eventually upgrading to Wood and then Stone and so forth
I'm sorry but I got to burst your bubble right now: If you plan on playing in a PvP server you gotta take this game seriously
 You either find a group of friends to play with you or you join a Tribe as soon as possible
 If you play alone you might find a hidden spot where your stuf will be safe one or two nights, maybe even a week, but alone you're doomed to be found, robbed and killed
 And like many others said, have the work of a whole week go down the drain
 If you're joining a PvP server you're doing it for Tribe warfare and let me assure you, thing can get really intense, really epic pretty fast
 With eagles swooping down to grab enemies and droping them from high altitues to their deaths, or tactical droping Raptors inside their base to wreak havok, T-Rexes working as battering rams at the enemies gates while rockets fly at them, auto-turrets spewing bullets at your Carno army, Sabretooths leaping over walls
 It is a beauty to behold
But you'll only experience that if you join one of the dominating tribes on your server or work on creating a strong Tribe of your own
 Otherwise you'll just be cattle for them, nothing else
 They'll keep you from taming dinos by killing them mid proccess, block caverns so only they can harvest the resources, literally kidnap you to use you as a blood bag Mad Max style and so on
I get why so much people hate that, after all they're just being preayed upon, they're not participating in all the fun that is Tribe Wars
 But the only way to Tribe Wars be so much fun is allowing all this kind of freedom the game has right now, they gotta allow people to be complete a-holes because during wars that's what you gotta be
 If they put too many safety nets to keep people who wanna do PvP only when THEY wanna do PvP the game would be boring and stale
But if everything I said right now put you off, don't be
 First of all because you don't really need PvP for this game to be fun
 There's a TON of stuff to do in PvE servers or offline if you just wanna do everything at your pace
 I got a bit tired of all the pressure on PvP servers and have been playing in a PvE for around 60 hours right now
 And I still only got only a Wood base with some Dinos, just hit level 45, and I feel like I'll never run out of things to do because the devs just keep adding and adding stuff almost each day
 People are also very helpful on PvE servers, they'll give you a hand when you have problems with a Rex, help you gather Prime meat when you're taming a Carnivore, give you tips and materials
 At least on my server I got absolutely nothing to complain about them
And if you're still one of the guys who wanna grow at your pace and only participate on PvP when you're ready, REJOICE
 Because they'll soon add War Declaration to PvE servers, so tribes can actually go at war when they feel like it, without all the griefing to new players who want just to keep to themselves
As a closing statement, I'd like to congratulate the Devs
 They're doing a terrific job
 Optimization is alreayd a LOT better, still not there yet, but much better
 The content is fantastic and it just keeps coming
 Bugs are rarer and rarer, in fact I don't even remember the last time I experienced one
An all around great game that I fully recommend if you're into dinossaurs and survival games
 Oh, and it's also pretty cheap

Early Access Review
I have over 200 hours into the game, compared to a lot of ARK players i'm still a noob so if you aren't ready to turn this into a full time job, don't even bother thinking about getting this game
 I'll explain why this game is a full time job later on, but basically it punishes any player that can't or won't play it 24/7
 First I'll talk about the PvE
 I started playing PvE on a private server with friends and had tons of fun discovering everything there is to enjoy
 We started on The Center, the biggest and in my opinion the coolest of the three maps
 The beginning is the hardest part for new players
 Every dino you meet can easily kill a noob, even the spitter dinos
 It can be annoying running around naked and getting killed by raptors, but stick with it and find your friends and build a safe place
 Once you get the base built, the game gets so much more fun
 Every new dino you find is cool, and it so fun the first time you get all your friends together and explore a cave
 The most dangerous foes we encountered in PvE were the alpha predators
 Our base got killed multiple times by alpha raptors, but it was fun because it showed us that even though we had a big base with spike walls and gaurd towers, there was still a threat out there that had to be beaten
 Ofcourse once you build a metal base nothing can break it anymore and once you tame flying mounts you don't have to worry about dangerous expeditions so late game it got boring
 We basically got to the point that nothing PvE had to throw at us outside of boss battles was a challenge, and even fighting bosses had no point because what would we use the tek gear to kill
 Harder versions of that boss
 That's why we decided to turn to PvP to see if that was better late game
Pro tip, don't PvP
 This game is designed in such a way that the big tribes that are on top stay on top
 New tribes and new players just get pooped on in every single way unless they join an alpha and become a resource harvesting slave
 Let's walk through all the reason PvP is horrible.1
) Alpha tribes
 They wipe the server once or twice a week and completly blow up any new players base and kill their dinos
 They own the server, they won't let anyone else even enjoy the game.2
) Unless you're alpha, you don't get a base, they might let you live in a thatch hut
 Refer to reason 1
) 3
) Unless you're alpha, you don't get to tame dinos, they might let you tame dodos
 Refer to reason 1
)4
) Unless you're alpha, you don't get to upgrade any of your gear
 Alphas block all loot drops (the good ones anyway) and fill all the caves with auto-turrets to gun down anyone that tries to explore them.5
) Alpha tribes are literally impossible for smaller tribes to fight
 They have huge metal bases with hundreds and hunderds of turrets and plants that will mow you down if you so much as look at it wrong
 Rockets get shot down in mid air by these turrets, and you won't get close enough to plant c4
 You won't be able to bring dinos to tank the turret either, refer to 1
)6
) Offline-raiding
 Just imagine working for 2-3 weeks building a pretty cool base completely surrounded by plant-x and taming about 20 dinos then logging on to see a smoking crater where you base was
 You don't get to save any of your gear, you don't get to save any of your dinos, you don't even get to fight back, it's all just gone
 This happens all the time, and honestly offline-raid protection should be baseline on all servers.7
) Battlemetrics
 Alpha tribes and griefers use this website to figure out if you are online or not
 If you log off for some reason, sleep or work or whatever, then they will know and they will raid you
 They can even get text alerts that tell them the second you have logged off or on, or if anything else unusual is going on on "their" server
 Basically, this site and sites like it are cancer
 Also, it doesn't tell them your in game name, but you steam name, that means even if you make another character they will know it's you

Early Access Review
Note: At least 1000 of my hours were spent on Official Servers
 Thus my review will pertain to Official Servers
Ark Survival Evolved is a game that will make you feel many things
Initially you will feel frustration at your helplessness as you spawn nude on a beach at level one and can barely fend off the smallest of dinosaurs
Then you will meet people, these people will either be total jerks and just kill you over and over, or they will be really chill, and you'll form a tribe with them
You will spend countless hours with these people: farming materials, taming dinosaurs, and build bases
You will grow more and more in power
You will be meeting other players either passing through the server or settling down
You will know all the other tribes on the server that are worth knowing (i.e
 the big tribes or friendly tribes)
You will come across numerous other cultures as you find Chinese tribes and Spanish tribes, French and German, all while growing more and more powerful
You will on occassion have a set back, but at this point you're on a roll and now the games mechanics, have a good group of friends, and objectives that you have given yourself
You will feel happy with what you have accomplished
But there is a downside
There must always be conflict, while it can be delayed for long periods of time, it will eventually come
And so another tribe will pick a fight with you
Your tribe will fight their tribe, and you may lose or you may win
Either way you've invested a lot into this server and these friends, so you'll never give up
Some other tribes will jointhe fight, picking sides
The winning side will probably kill all the dinos, take all the mats, and kill everyone on the losing side
Thus you have won your first war
You are now a power on the server worth being reckoned with
Soon enough, you'll get in an even bigger war as the losing side draws more and more people to aide them and you respond by getting more as well
Now the entire server is split 50-50, and a great war mars the server for days as both sides are constantly wiping one anothers bases
Eventually you'll win though, and the other side will leave the server
They'll be fed up
As the enemies are now gone, you are happy once more
You hated them just as they hated you
Now a long period of peace has passed, a couple weeks
There is trouble brewing as a few of your allies are begin to grow wrestless and have infighting
Peace will try to be maintained through talks
But it will fail in the end, and more war will arise
This cycle will continue until only 2 tribes remain
These two tribes will be dominant in every regard: leadership, tactics, dinosaurs, and materials
Pitted against one another to see who will rule the server
You will fight your heart out against your former allies
You will destroy bases you'd once entered as a friend, now as an enemy
You will kill dinos whose names you helped come up with
You and your tribemates will be cycling out who gets to sleep because the battle will last over 24 hours
The fight will go on and on and on and on with no end
It will be exhilerating
Then you win
Then you are the supreme ruler of the server
You are standing over the ruins of your former allies as you have proved yourself to be the mightiest
But then it will hit you
The sadness
 As now all the people you had once known, months ago when you were just a little tribe starting out, will all be gone
Everyone you'd ever fought with and fought against are gone
While there is some joy in victory, it is very bitter as there is no one left to share it with
Your tribemates will still play, but it's not the same
Even if not in your tribe, you had a community
 Friends
 Foes
 Maybe even lovers
Now all that is gone
You will pass the ruins of these once great tribes and feel a hole in your heart
New people will always arrive to challenge you, but you'll always beat them down
Destroying any hope they had
You'll build fortresses that'll reach the Heavens and have so many dinos it'll cause server lag
You'll build Great Walls across vast territories in order to denote your power
Finally, you'll get bored and leave
Months will pass, and one day you'll see Ark still in your library and hop back on
You'll log back into your old server
Everything is different
New names, faces, bases, everything
Not a single structure you had built is left standing, not a single ruin
All of it is gone
The people on this server see you log in and ask if you want to join their tribe saying that 'Ark can be harsh for noobs', but you could never tell them
You could never tell them an entire servers history
The hundreds of thousands of hours of work you'd seen put in by that ancient world
The structures they couldn't ever even imagine
The wars you'd fought and people you'd met
You could never explain to them what it all had meant to you, for it is all now gone
In it's place is a new world, completely distinct from the original while maintaining a strong similarity
You will be both extremely happy at this new world, and profoundly sad about the world that was lost
Ark Survival Evolved will demand dozens of hours to just get the basics down and get priorities straight
To become a power on a server will take about a hundred hours
To conquer a server will take a couple hundred hours
To realize everything you lost and destroyed that you once held dear will take thousands of hours
To atone for everything you'd done to those you once called friends will take an eternity
If you'll pour time and effort, no game will ever make you feel as strongly about the decisions you've made than Ark: Survival Evolved
Beware that you may get addicted and lose your real social life and ambitions in exchange for this game
But you'll meet people you'd never have met otherwise, see things you never thought possible, commit acts that would make tyrants think you're true evil or saints believe you are the second coming of Jesus Christ
In the end, you'll feel stronger emotions then any you've ever felt from playing a game
10/10 Masterpiece

Early Access Review
First review i wrote for a game but it had to be done
This game is like Crack
 I've put a few hundred hours into this game and will probably put in a few hundred more
 The devs are constantly pushing out new content (to a point where all the server maintenance is starting to become annoying haha) and they are very involved with the community trough reddit etc
 Me and two friends of mine started off on a public server and had a really nice welcoming, A nearby chinese tribe gave us some stuff to start out and we we're hooked to the game pretty much instantly
 There were some big tribe wars going on on the server but we were left alone
A few weeks later
 we have a huge metal base with a 5 high stone wall perimiter around it and 5 more people joined our tribe
 All the big tribes but the chinese one left the server and got wiped out
 And it seemed peaceful At this point we already spent hundreds of hours taming different dinos (which each have their different role like gathering resources, carrying heavy loads, transportation, combat, you name it) and we eventually also tamed a few t-rexes and the stronger end game dino's
 You name them all and because of their different tasks and stat builds you become sort of attached to your dino's as well which makes the game even better
One week later
 Random (smaller tribes) are getting destroyed at night when they are offline
 all the buildings blown open resources stolen and dinos killed
 (take note some dinos can take over 10 hours to tame without kibble) At this point our base is more like a fortress we have over 70 organic turrets (think plants that split acid to hostiles) and 10 auto Gatlin turrets with loads of ammo in them
 And an army of all kinds of dino's over 50 including 5 t-rexes varying from lvl 150-200+ A fully metal layered base with different compartments with different resources in every room (makes it harder for raiders to get everything since they have to blow up more walls) The chinese tribe starts putting in random text in global chat in capital letters including our tribe name
 they have always helped us out we have made multiple trades with them for resources and called them allies
 The next day
 I log on
Everything is gone...
 all our dino's are dead every wall is blown up all our turrets taken out
 and our base is in ruins
 Hundreds of hours of building up Taming dino's training them taking them out on resource runs and working together with a tribe....gone...
The chinese tribe who helped us out from day one, Destroyed us.RIP
AtlasAbraxisNienTalonAeonMckittenMcCatMcMuffinMike the trikeBob the trikeArmageddonMorgothApocalypse AnkrahmunAnkaderpMuffinDeemDemonspawnSharkenatorLuluRammusRockeyStoneyScorpenatorMittenRappyOmegaMammutanWoollyMamenamenamenanCarnyBrontenatorAnd many more...
That empty hollow feeling seeing your base in ruins and all your tamed fed and cared for dino's dead
 I never had that before in a game
3 days later
 we set up camp a few miles west from our old base
 we had primitive tools and we were back to square one
 But we we're determined and longing for revenge...
 we broke down some old metal walls en made a small 4x4 room and set up the basic crafting stations
 We had good contact with a few of the smaller tribes nearby who we helped out countless of times
 now we needed their help
 we secretly banded together against the Chinese tribe and they gave us some of the harder to obtain resources like crystal and oil
We started mass producing grenades
I went out at night with a stash of metal tools a crossbow, arrows and food and approached their base
 The chinese built a enormous stone castle on the water where they stored most of their Egg farm dino's in
 I went to the beach
 swam underneath the base
 found a spot where i could hack away at their stone walls to get inside
 Found a good spot and made a start
 tribe members brought over grenades and we blew though the wall
 Out came charging a T-rex and 5 raptors at insane speed
 we started backing off while firing at them
 The water slowed them down
 Called for the rest of the tribe to head over
 we ended up fighting them on foot with primitive weapons
 After a long fight we took them out one by one and eventually they all lay dead
 That feeling of Vengeance is undescribable
 but we weren't satisfied
 We headed back into the dino pen and laid waste to their entire egg farm, we killed over 20 Stego's three mammoths and a few ankylo's, It was a massacre
 Fueled by the loss of our pets and friends
 Today, we're still fighting a guerrilla style war against the Chinese
 Constantly on the move hitting them where they expect it the least
Only a handfull of people remain on the server but we won't rest untill we have taken everything from them..
 like they did to so many others
Apoligies for the grammar mistakes etc
 English is not my native language

Early Access Review
THIS IS A DAY 1 REVIEW AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS THE DEVELOPMENT CONTINUESPROS+ Dinosaurs+ Sprawling land that looks and feels absolutely huge+ Ease of Understanding (controls, objectives, etc)+ Engram System (I really dig it)+ Simple Crafting (It's a no brainer to use and understand)+ Early Access Perks (cosmetic items which are dinky but cool)+ Loot Boxes
 + Taming and Mounts (epicness)+ Single Player (has been added
)+ Server Hosting Instructions have been shared+ PvE/PvP commands have been added for server hosting
CONS- Optimization: Needs massive improvement (which is happening
 it's a priority with the Devs atm)- Not enough servers to meet the current population- Not being able to connect to servers/being kicked out of servers- Sound issues (music/sound not turning down properly even when adjusted) - Lag issues across the board
 (Some experience it, some do not
)- Raptors (dude, they will own your butt unless you hit a hill or something
 Not really a Con, they're just d*cks)What little I've managed to play I have enjoyed and really look forward to pitching a tent and staying a good long while but I'm not going to sugarcoat my experience either
 There are a lot of problems right now but most of them are due to the Devs simply not pushing a bigger server test before they released -- They simply didn't anticipate the community that slammed their servers trying to play
I'm recommending it, but please keep in mind that this is a VERY Early Access game despite the fact that there is a lot about it that simply looks, and somewhat feels, polished (the dinosaurs are amazing)
 If you cannot or do not want to deal with the current CONS then you should wait at least a week and come back and check out the changes the Devs push otherwise I'm saying go ahead and drop the 24
89$USD and try your hand at playing
EDIT: 6/2 - Single Player and Hosting Commands have been added by the Devs

Early Access Review
I'm at a point where I'm about to hit 20 solid hours of gaming and feel I have a good enough grasp of the game to review it
 So here goes..
I'm 32 years old
 Been gaming since the Atari..
 been online since the early 90's
 Done everything from chat based roleplay to full blown massive MMO's
 I have a few hundred games on Steam and others on Origin, GoG, etc
Let me say that this is the FIRST time I have EVER seen a developer quite like this one
Make no mistake, this is an Early Access title
 So of course the launch was plagued with issues, and the server numbers didn't cover the 100,000+ players..
 BUT, the devs have made some of the most aggressive moves to resolve the issues that I've ever seen
In the first 24 hours of the game..
 we had over a dozen patches
 In the first 48 hours..
 I can't even count how many
 I recall yesterday having downloaded over 10 different patches through Steam
 Seemed like one every hour
 For me, that's HUGE
 A developer that actually TRIES to set the example and improve on their product
 You just don't see this type of response at all from an indie, or AAA team
That said..
 the game is pretty fun and exciting
 I'd describe it best as Rust, with dinosaurs
 Only the quality of the game is far superior being on the Unreal 4 engine
 The fps numbers may be pretty low for most users but chock that up to poor optimization (which is expected of an Early Access title only a few days into release)
In all, you can't go wrong picking this title up at this point
 Just make sure your system requirements meet the recommended and you should be fine

Early Access Review
At the time I write this, I have put about 3500 hours into this game
 I have been playing it for over a year now and have had a lot of ups and downs
 I play on a PvP server and I have had everything I had taken from me and all my tames killed many times
 I have worked my way back up over and over and have managed to secure my tribe as a beta tribe on a server and am in an alliance with the alpha tribe
Then Wild Card dropped Scortched Earth and the ability to transfer players and items into the server I play on
 My server did everything we could to protect ourselves and it paid off
 Then Wild Card made all the supply drops not effected by structures so they would still drop
 So, we blocked them all off with vaults
 Now Wild Card made it so the drops land on top of anything under them
 We don't have any defense against that
Why are we worried
 Because for the better part of the last year, many servers have been taken over completely my mega tribes
 Tribes that regularly hit server cap with who plays on the server
 Who farm servers of all their resources and have been unchecked because no one could farm enough resources to fight them on their own servers
 Now that they can travel from server to server, they are slowly working their way through all official servers and wiping the servers of everything
For people like myself who have dumped litterally thousands of hours into this game, we are doing all we can to defend, but we can only do so much as we can't be online all day everyday
 With the servers not being region locked, we have Chinese, Russian, and Australian tribes coming to our server during peak times for them, but the early morning hours for us
 Meaning, we have no one on to defend what we worked hard to make
 We now have to work in shifts, like it is a job, to defend what we have, all because Wild Card decided to open the arks up and have the players wipe the servers for them
When a large server falls, most of the players quit playing the game
 They move onto something else
 That is good for Wild Card, because then the servers become low population, so they can repurpose them or remove them and that saves them a lot of money
 They already made all they will make off of the players currently playing
 So, if they remove us, they can save on server costs and use that for more advertising to get more unsuspecting players into the game
Overall, Wild Card doesn't listen to their players unless those players are praising how great the game is
 The players that riducule the game, are ignored or banned due to rule violations
 Wild Card doesn't know what they are doing in terms of making a game that isn't completely broken nor do they know how to have a conversation with their player base that isn't just the positive things about the game
 They refuse to hear or even acknowledge there is anything wrong with their game and that is a huge problem
Bottom line, only get this game if you're going to play on unofficial servers or you like logging in and finding that everything you have is gone, yet again, and you get to punch a tree and start over
ADDED February 02, 2017:I mainly talked about the PvP on Official servers in the review above, so I am adding the other ways to play the game here to hopefully give a more well rounded review
Single Player is nice as well, but nothing is persistant
 So you need to increase a lot of rates in single player to make it fun
 Like, at stock, if taming something takes 6 hours, you need to be logged into the game for 6 hours to tame it
 If you exit, that timer pauses
 Breeding anything becomes too cumbersome without increasing rates because 4 real life days that pauses when you exit the day is just not possible
 Unless you want it taking 2 weeks to raise one thing
 I just use single player as a "creative mode" to spawn everything in and build to see what I would need for the server I actually play on
PvE is enjoyable but frustrating in a different way
 You can't build near others and as long as you close your doors, no one can take your things
 People can annoy you and get in your way and just be asshats to you, and you can't do anything to them because you can't fight them
 They can build walls around your base at the build limit so you can't get out or in

I played ARK
 I met a man named Jigger Jaw
 He was Level 13
 I was level 2
 We hit it off, and ended up becoming a tribe and hunting together
 All was well
 He made it to Level 14, I made it to Level 5
 But then, I saw a supply drop, in which he said he thought it was Level 15 needed to unlock it
 Sparking my curiosity, I told him I would check it out
 He stayed at the campfire and told me to watch out for the snake and frog-like creatures
 So I got to the supply drop, and I could open it
 I got many useful crafting items
 I turned back to go to our campfire, but red words of death appeared
 Jigger Jaw had been killed by a Level 80 dino
 Gasping, I ran back to camp to find him
 His remains were nowhere to be found, along with his killer
 I messaged him asking if he was around, but got no answer
 He had left
 Later I found his murderer around the beach, and knew I was not yet ready to face this foe
 But I was ready to survive
 For Jigger Jaw had taught me how to survive
 How to live
1000/10, friendships made

I honestly don't think I've played the game enough to justify if this is truly a great game but here are all my thoughts anyway..
I personally think this game is quite entertaining because I find mowing lawns (with a riding tractor) fun and enjoyable and sometimes feel like I haven't done enough
 But this game is far more than mowing a lawn
 Let's put down a list of great activities you can do in this game, some of which you can do in previous games too ie FS 15 and FS 13.1
 Running a crop farm
 Basically means you take out your planting machines (sowing machines, not to be confused with sewing) and cover a field in crops of variation, wait, then take out the according harvesting combine to pick it up and sell the collected crop.2
 Mowing lawns
 Yes if you really wanted, you can waste time mowing lawns, collecting grass and selling it OR using it to feed your animals to make a good profit.3
 Wood cutting
 You can take out whats called a "Dangle Head" tree cutter that will cut down and cut up a tree into logs to fit onto a wood trailer to transport them to a log cutting facility, or alternatively you can crunch up the logs into chips and sell them at the heating plant.4
 Taking care of animals
 This comes down from #2 where you can take care of cows, sheep, or pigs in order to produce manure from pigs and cows to help with #1
 Sheep only take water and grass in order to produce wool which can be transported to a spinnery for good profit
 Cows are a bit more difficult but quite rewarding in the long run but are fed a mixture of silage, grass, and straw along with water
 Pigs, to be honest, I don't mess with them only because I don't feel the need, but theres a whole guide explaining what you need to do with caring for animals
If you don't really find much of that appealling then lets go over some features that were added since FS 15.1
 Built in Mod Hub
 Yes this game offers a built in mod menu with a ton of mods made by the community.2
 Free dumping of crops or seed or whatever
 This means that if you got a trailer full of lets say, wheat, you can dump it pretty much where ever you want and pick it back up later, this applies to all things that can be put in a tipper.3
 Enhanced graphics
 I know that the graphics in most cases aren't that much different from FS 15 but there is a noticable improvement that makes the game feel more alive
 Plus better attention to detail when it comes to the tractors and equipment.4
 More tractors and equipment such as Fendt, Challenger, and Massey Ferguson
 And larger equipment such as the Amazone Condor sowing machine that has a massive span of 15m compared to earlier games such as FS 15 with the Horsche Pronto sower being the biggest in that game with having a span of only 9m
In conclusion, I think this game is great if you are looking to relax and learn a little bit on certain activities played by real farmers around the world
 Theres a ton more features that I can think of but would just make this review too long if I go more
Posted: 27 October, 2016
Pros+ Major +Mods for your game " I enjoy the realistic plant damage mod " Now when you run over your plant when its growing it will die wherever you run over
 They just added some more mods that make the suspension realistic
 I highly recommend
 Wooho They just added a Mustang GT too
 =)Major +Graphics are improved & lighting is a lot better
Major +Constant 60 fps running a 770 gtx..
Major +Now you can acquire jobs and make extra money from other local farmer that own fields in singleplayer
 They usually give you pretty expensive harvesters to play around with too
Major +Seamless keyboard , mouse +
Controller usage
 Flip back and forth between either
minor +MP mode to game with your fellow plant geeks
minor +They added trains
 They can haul tons of product for you to the Railroad market
minor +You can pick up crap and make money off it
 Amazing
minor +Shoot some hoops and once you get that 3 pointer you will unlock an achievement
minor +Sounds are more realistic minus the animal life
 Cons- Major -Limited number of workers doing automated task at once
 Shouldn't be any limit at all
 What if you want to run a really big farm
 minor -Sucks people who own previous FS 13 and 15 don't get some loyalty discount
 Maybe $5 off
minor -$35 this time the other FS13-15 were like 25 bucks
 Not a big deal but not a positive
minor -Jobs can take a little too long to complete "in my opinion"
minor -Music loud as hell even @ 10% setting
 Ohh well it's going off probably anyways.
 right
minor -The chickens sounds really crappy
 Make's me want to call KFC to haul their butts to the slaughter house
 That will be $9
99 for a 20 pack
Hope my review helps you decide on whether to get this game or not
Thanks for stopping by
10 Pros vs 6 Cons
 Please Be Respectful In The Comments =) And no I will not buy this game for beggers so dont ask..
 Nice try tho

Trolls you are warned and will be deleted very fast

I very rarely give out negative reviews and to be fair, FS2017 does not deserve a negative review if we consider it in isolation
 However, given that I own FS2015, I find it hard to justify my purchase of FS2017
 I gave a stellar review to FS2015 and this is a "slight" improvement over it - so if you don't own FS2015, you should definitely get this
 But yearly iterations of games with little added value has become a sort of trend in the gaming industry and it's not something I can justify myself encouraging

34 hours later I still think that buying this game was a better choice than Infinite Warfare
Never tought I'd have so much fun cutting virtual trees
10/10 would plow fields again

Why should I shoot people and steal cars when I have my farm
Posted: 12 November, 2016
10/10 Strongly recommended
A focus that I'll put on my comments here is that there is the ability to perform work on other farmers fields
 Having put a nice chunk of time into FS 2013 back in the year 2012, I had spent a lot of time performing chores, then setting the clock to run at 120x speed, while I waited to perform a harvest
 Eventually I could diversify the operation which could keep me busy longer, but it took a very long time to accumulate the equipment necessary
In 2017, money is very easy to acquire by performing work on other farmers fields
 So far I've put about 18+ hours into the game and I've already accumulated well over $300,000 in the first day of game time
 There's so much money to be made doing this that while there are reasons why I would want to advance time, such as accumulating a couple harvests to have enough food to get into animal tending, I don't feel the need to
By being able to pull in significant chunks of money fairly quickly, I am now quickly planning how I can get into logging and purchasing bigger fields alongside my plans for tending to animals
 In 2013, it was a long slog to get new machines that would make things a bit easier
 I'm sure some people exploited things or used cheats to make cash fast, but I wasn't on board with doing that myself
Overall I feel that the mission design allows the player to put time into the game and get easily apparent rewards that facilitates the player's quest to become more deeply acquainted with the various features of the game
Besides that, there have been huge upgrades to the graphics since 2013, which is to be expected but casual fans like myself who got on the FS train back in 2012 will be pleased with the new details and animations
 Zooming in on various machines while they work is a treat, with soil being deformed and pushed aside, or corn rows being drawn into a corn harvest header
 I also really like how machines get dirty and can even be cleaned by cleaning equipment that is operated by the player
 Even the interior cabins of machines will have dirty boot prints as you get in and out of them with dirty boots
 Controls wise, I've used KB+Mouse and found them to be great
 I am currently using an Xbox 360 controller while sitting on the couch using a TV instead of my monitor and it's even more enjoyable
 I have a G27 steering wheel setup but I enjoy sitting back on the couch with this game so I don't feel the need to deepen the simulation with that controller setup
 I'm glad that it supports that hardware if I feel so inclined in the future though
Overall, I find that these games really offer a deep experience of getting to know your farms, your equipment and building a farming empire
 The tutorials are very easy to understand (I didn't need most of them but I did some of them anyway) and I liked how they easily allowed me to perform the steps with the game's equipment so I could see what type of hardware I might buy and how I would use it for my in-game farm when I'm ready
 New players shouldn't have too much trouble if they have free time and some interest
 I find it's really neat to get involved with the farming simulator world, much more immersion than a lot of the shooters and other games which offer transient game experiences
I haven't tried multiplayer but it's a welcome addition
 From viewing YouTube videos it really appears to be a great way to play and something you might really enjoy
 I personally like coming home from work and loading up the farm and getting some stuff done whenever I want; without having to coordinate with friends
 So MP is less of a thing for me, but once again, a welcome feature
I tend to marvel at little things in the game, like using a front-end loader to pick up bales or using a shovel to scrape up a pile of something off of the ground
 The fact that the game simulates piles of materials is neat
 Although I find it slightly bothersome that I can't shift in my seat while using the virtual cockpits; it would be nice to shift around and see different angles while seated
 That would help operate multiple different types of machines
 Although being able to look around the cockpit is nice enough and popping in and out of third person isn't a problem anyway
This game really is a deep experience that rewards the player and gives a sense of satisfaction that most games can't
 It's also nice to play a game where the world is at peace and one's only worries is how will they spend their day at their beautiful farm

Improves on 15 in almost every way
Great graphics, lighting is much improved as is the design of the world, the new map looks brilliant and is much bigger than previous games
Tractors feel weighty and actually sound like they should (even down to the crunching of the mud underneath them)
Worker AI seems to be much better and you now receive a notification if a tractor gets stuck which is very useful
 The option of cruise mode is a welcome addition also
Multiplayer works great but unfortunately I couldn't get missions to work, I've now gathered that this is intentional, its a real shame as it makes the multiplayer much harder to earn decent money but I'm sure it'll be adressed eventually
Worth the 30 at the moment, much better than 15 and will surely swallow hundreds of hours of my time

In short, my wife wanted this game originally and I scoffed at the idea thinking it to be just a game of busy work, now 250+ hours in I'm amazed at how much I've enjoyed this game
We started playing FS15 to see if we'd like it and then moved to FS17 and it's so much more improved and that's saying a lot because FS15 is really good
Noteable improvements from FS15 to FS171) Hired workers do their jobs better but you still need to tend to them
If fields are too close together they will often jump from one field to the next when you don't want them too
They still get stuck periodically but overall do a better job of getting around obstacles
2) Being able to pick up items makes forestry possible now
I tried forestry in FS15 and lost my mind with frusration
With the new equipment and ability to grab items it's much better now3) User interface is much better now and lots more information in the game4) Much more depth to farm animals now and they can keep you very busy and be pretty profitable
5) More advance options for tending fields that can make things more realistic/challenging
For example, three stage fertilization, periodic plowing requirements6) The converyors are great if not a bit frustrating from time to time
You can put them pretty much anywhere and since you can tip anywhere it's easy to come up with creative solutions for moving crops around
I primarily use them for Silage at the Biogas plants and they are amazing for that
7) Built in mod management is just fantasic
Gripes:1) Silage on the Goldcrest valley map can be frustrating because the silos have glitches in them that create holes in the silage
This will cause you to get stuck sometimes
Also the silage doesn't always uncover and either requires you to hit it just right with a conveyor or hit it with a scoop
Silage will also get stuck in the walls sometimes and either require you to edit the files or use a mod to fix it
These are issues that could be fixed with a patch though
2) As great as the mod management is, I'd prefer it if when you need a mod when trying to connect to a server it would let you automatically download them in the game versus taking you out of the game to a webpage3) Would like to have hotkeys to quickly access certain parts of the information menus
For example, no hotkey now to quickly pull up the finances screen
4) There is no default way to store beets, potatoes or woodchips as there was in FS15
You can either dump them somewhere with a tipper or store them in a railroad drop off but none of these options will display your total owned amount in your summary screen depsite there being a quantity of 0 displayed
5) Would like to see more information for all owned crops that are stored in the silo AND trainyards as well as being able to designate a building that will count quantities of cropsOther obeservations:We run our own private server and initially I was annoyed because running a server requires the purchase of an additional license while almost every other game I've ran a server for includes a dedicated server app at no additional cost
The other downside of this is that you cannot run a dedicated server from a copy of the game purchased from Steam, it has to be a key that's redeemed directly through Giants (i.e
 purchased from Amazon, Humble, etc)
Despite these issues, the FS17 server is hands down the best game server that I've ever managed
It's all managed via a web interface and the server has lower requirements
In addition, it's easy to make changes, add mods and so much more
The server also allows you to upload/download any save games, has an iPhone/Android app to monitor the server and so many other nice features that it's easily worth the purchase of an additional license for all of the work and refinement that has been done
So to conclude, this game has really peaked my interest in simulation games and has quickly become one of my favorite titles in my library

Well what can i say about Farming Simulator 2017, amazing.
simple amazing
 After spending about 1800 hours in fs15 i can
say ive seen alot of interesting stuff, the great equipment, the modding, and the great community
 the moment i loaded up fs17 i noticed the vast improvement on graphic options, the ability to use Track Ir, and the Automatic setup and detection of gamepads and steering wheels
Loading into the game was incredibly fast, and there it was Goldcrest in all its glory, i spent about 45 minutes just driving around and taking in the sights, and driving the trains
As i started my career i noticed big improvment on drive quality of the vehicles,the environmental lighting and road noise....
road noise from the transition of hard pavement to the gravel dirt roads
 Every sound is different, from the combine reving high..
to the moment you begin to combine your crops and you hear the revs go deeper as you begin to swath
 all little details that make Fs17 great to begin with
 From inspecting fields and seeing that you can work to improve relationship with farmers that own fields and do work for then to bring the price down, so its cheaper for you to buy later on
 I spent a good ten minutes looking for a spot to fill my seeder when i realize i had to buy seed and purchase extra pallets of fertilizer, something that was left out of fs15 (except in Modding) this all adds to the overall experience of the game
 I have still alot to explore, and found that buying livestock you no longer have to click to buy animals but rather buy and transport them to your farm
 Fs17 has made leaps and bound in the Farming simulation catagory, I cant wait to see what else is in store for the future
 Great Job Giants Keep up the great work.Twitch

**NOTE: This review will constantly update to accomadate any new changes in my opinion, updates, etc
**INTRODUCTIONStardew Valley
I've heard a lot of things about this game
 A lot of extremely positive things
And I was doubtful
 Was Stardew Valley really that good
 I was afraid that people were just giving it attention because they didn't actually know what a good game was
 And as insulting as it may sound, in my defense, uhhm...
 Before buying the game I hadn't really seen what it looked like, or knew what it was about
 I just knew that it was published by the same company, Chucklefish, that had developed Starbound
 I had loved Starbound.
 So I was playing completely spoiler free
 Haven't watched any videos, no tips & tricks, just the information of a billion recommended reviews stuffed into my head
So I bought Stardew Valley, and had pretty high expectations
 If a game received THAT much popularity, it should be seriously good, right
WHAT STARDEW VALLEY ISPlop
 Into the world of Stardew Valley
 You completely start from the bottom, trailing after a tragedy and responsibility that's struck
 A farm, barely any money, and the mystery of a town left in your hands
 Whew
 That's really a lot when you think about it
 Boy, did I NOT know what I was getting myself into
At first,
it was kind of boring
 And any new game you buy will always be like that
 The beginning's all new and immersive, and the middle..
 kind of leaves you stuck
 And that's one of the most challenging parts for a lot of people: getting through that middle
 When you begin, you spot all the challenges you'll face, which is daunting, because you can instantly tell: you're going to have to freaking work hard to be a master at this game
The thing with Stardew Valley, It's all about exploration and management
 Discovering and figuring out secrets and a beautiful story was amazing
 Creative mechanics and powerful creativity had combined to produce a fabulous well-formed game that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth, and I'm going to tell you right now..
 it's totally addicting
 I bought the game a few days ago, and literally have played it all day since
 I've NEVER done that with a game before
 I found myself as a kid in a candy shop, gaping at all the different flavors, and being able to savor them all
 And now, in Year 3 of the game.
 I still have a lot more to discover
 The creator, ConcernedApe, was brilliant when coding this game
 He created all the aspects of Stardew Valley, and it took him ONLY four years
 How
 I've seen games that took ten years to develop..
 and they still had less than Stardew Valley
 (Thank you, commenters
)PLAYINGCompared to others, I've only played around 80 hours of the game thus far
 Buy Stardew Valley
 You really won't regret it
 This game is beautiful
 The music is whimsically lifting, and the soundtrack is wonderful
 It's a work of art
 You will find yourself falling in love with the characters, and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people, and who changes everyone for the better
Let me tell you this right now: the game rewards for the hard-working
And you might be thinking: "what in the world do I mean by that
"I literally mean what I say
 Stardew Valley is a game where you really have to manage things, yet, it allows you to explore the whole art of it
 Work hard as you play the game, and there are sweet rewards
 And I'm talking about rewards sweeter than all the candy in that candy shop
Here's the thing: you can take two routes with Stardew Valley
 You can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game, or you can immerse yourself in exploring the town and what the game has to offer, but with also missing the point that Stardew is a management farming game
Or, you can successfully find the balance between both
 But how
Stardew Valley allows you to store multiple accounts, which is fantastic
 I recommend exploring with your first account, and learning the ropes
 You seriously won't know anything yet, and will be like "OMFG" when you figure out there's a way that makes things one hundred times easier
 After that, create a second account, and start figuring out farm management and what the game has to offer
 I thought I was pretty boss with the second account, but I realized I could get a whole lot more with a third account since I now knew shortcuts and everything
 So I created a third account, and successfully balanced management and exploration
 Now I'm left in a spot where I can successfully thrive, and only continue to grow
THE PROS- Enchanting music that sings as you play- A simple yet fun art design that you can't help but fall in love with- Characters whom capture your heart- A shambled town that begins to thrive- Hidden secrets that you can't help but want to keep discovering- Amazing challenges that leave you wanting more- The awe of wandering through an amazingly formed game- Brilliant originality, which is incredibly difficult to find- A storyline that changes your perspective beautifully- Lots of fun, and I mean lots
- Mods created by the community to make your game more fun and immersive- however, I play without mods
THE CONS- As I said, the game rewards you for hard work
 But only for hard work
 It can be a grueling process, but it is extremely profitable
 Those who don't like putting effort into a game won't enjoy Stardew Valley as much as other games
- Time
 Stardew Valley takes a lot of time to play through
 It's a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on
- Repetitive
 The game can be grueling
 To reach certain goals you have to go through processes that you will SERIOUSLY hate
 But, in the end, it's definitely worth the labor
PLACES TO IMPROVE**NOTE: Some of these "improvements" may have spoilers, however, none of them reveal any actual information about the game and what happens, as it is common knowledge and will really not spoil anything
 This category talks about bugs and things that need to be fixed
 So if you haven't bought Stardew Valley, it's not too concerning, but you may read it if you wish
- According to MasterBlade's review, there was a crash that deleted all his/her's progress of 61 hours
 I haven't come across this problem, yet
- In the Egg Festival during the Egg Hunt, there is an egg in the right corner of a bush next to Mayor Lewis' house
 When you try to click on the egg, Jas' dialogue pops up, even though she has already walked off-screen
 I find this annoying, as the triggered text prevents you from moving, and thus, lose the Egg Hunt
 (I lost once because of that
 Not a big deal, but it may be for new players
)- In the Egg Festival there is also an out-of-bounds glitch
 If you go to the top area (where you would walk to the Community Center) and walk up to the very top barrier (to where you can't walk forward anymore)
 Then, go left, and you're out-of-bounds
WHY IT'S JUST STELLAR Stardew Valley offers a lot of things, and has changed the lives of many people
 Perhaps in peace, wonder, open-mindedness, the game gives a lot
 But I have one thing that's been bothering me for a long time..
 How in the damn world did one single person spit out a freaking awesome game
Even though it's a farming game, which is commonly found everywhere, it's original with its own spins
 It's extremely difficult to find a game that has such a captivating message that's been developed so well
 Stardew Valley is a lot of fun and awe, and it really draws a blank in your mind
Buy Stardew Valley
 At first, it might seem boring..
 but keep playing
 Trust me, the candies are still sweet
 And they really only get sweeter
Posted: 28 February, 2016
This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years
 I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory
 I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA
 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game
 Farming
 The farming is fantastic
 It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy
 Being able to design your farm any way you want it..
 yes please
 Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold..
 it's so enjoyable and addictive
 Fishing
 The fishing is outstanding
 From playing WoW and Runescape.
 or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun
 At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time
Mining and combat
 Mining and combat is incredible
 Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard
 (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder
) Social
 Social interactions are great
 Being able to become friends with the people in the town,
and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.
 what's not to like about that
 And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses
 The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice
 Main story
 The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you "complete" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did
 Yes, I was a tester for the game
 Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours
 It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this
 However you have to remember, I was a tester
 I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes
 I still love this game
 I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them
 And that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too
 ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game
 And that's true
 The experience that you have with this game IS amazing
 Minutes playing turn into hours
 Hours turn into "oh no it's time to sleep"
You will forget about time
 You will forget about sleep
 You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back
 So yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to "escape" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016
Posted: 28 February, 2016
I'm genuinely impressed an indie game of this scale made by one guy isn't stuck in an eternal early access, but is instead provided as the full package right off the bat
 This is how it was done a decade ago, and this is how it should still be done
Posted: 29 September, 2016
Can I just say thankyou to the developer of this game I suffer with depression and stardew valley gives me a reason to do somethng other than sleep it makes me feel like I have an impact of peoples lives (even if its only in game people)
 I have played 200+ hours playing this game that's 200 hours distracted from my real life problems
 I have oped(SP) in to be a beta tester, this is the first game I've ever done this with thanks to the developer for saying how to do that I really admire him for creating such a good game and hope he goes far in his career and he never loses the magic, Thankyou
Posted: 26 February, 2016
I spent three years building up hype, and I was still blown away
If you enjoyed Harvest Moon, Rune Factory or Animal Crossing - then get this
 It captures all the same things that made those games great, and it's the perfect game to play either casually or seriously
 There are so many different ways to earn money and they're all developed and fun, the hardest part is choosing which one to spend your time doing
The progression curve in the game is fantastic too
 Every day you'll feel like you're making progress but there's still always something to work towards and you won't 'beat it' after a couple of hours earning as much money as possible, as there's always something to spend your money on
 Even after 20 hours of playing, I feel like I'm nowhere near the endgame, and I could easily see myself playing through again and doing things differently
 I'm even doing a playthrough on YouTube and the progress feels dramatically different even in its early stages
I'm easily disappointed by games, so you can imagine my surprise when I was so impressed by a game made by one person
 Congratulations, ConcernedApe, you've made one of the best games I've ever played
Posted: 8 March, 2016
Overview
Stardew Valley is a game that borrows heavily from similar titles in the Harvest Moon series
 You start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables
 The game is simple in its understanding: build a farm, make profits, live your life
 What the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered
 You're left with the freedom to explore the town, its residence, mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time
 Sure, there are events to attend, festivals to see, men/women to romance and marry, kids to have, buildings to construct, fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay (Dragon Warrior, anyone
), but how and when you do those things is up to you
 In essence, the game offers you very similar things to do as a Harvest Moon game does: Build and upgrade your farm, plant crops, upgrade tools, mine in the never-ending dungeon for precious ore, go fishing, romance and get married...etc
 While some of your old favorites are back, new aspects have been introduced as well, but I won't spoil those in this review
 Let's just say there's a nice story that evolves over time
The freedom to do as you please is what makes this game, and Harvest Moon in general, so enjoyable
 It's a chance to mellow out, play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer
 What Stardew Valley does, it does right
 It's charming, cute and feels rewarding, even when all you're doing is cuttings weeds
 It doesn't pull any punches or try to be something its not; the developer had a goal in mind and Stardew Valley is a reflection of just that
 You can feel the effort, the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years
 Stardew Valley is a gem and worth looking at
 If you loved Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley
To date, Stardew Valley is a single player game, though the developer as mentioned some form of co-op or multiplayer availability in the future
 Pros
Character Customization - Always good, always wanted
Visuals - In the style of the SNES
 They're colorful detailed and a delight
 Game Pace - Fast, slow, or somewhere in the middle
 It's your call to make
 Content - There is a lot more to do than I first imagined
 There are many hidden layers inside the game as you progress the storyline
Cons
Combat - It's a tad basic since that isn't the core of the gameplay
 A single hack/n slash mechanic Citizens - I'd love to see more citizens (even temporary ones during the year) come and go to make the town feel more "alive"Overall, Stardew Valley is a pleasure
 I haven't put a ton of time into it (yet), but I easily see that happening
 It's fun, lighthearted and addictive
 As I said earlier in this review, if you've ever played Harvest Moon, you'll enjoy Stardew Valley
 It's worth checking out and I highly recommend it
 This will easily become one of my most played games on my list
 You won't be disappointed, so check it out

The new update promises to improve the quality of your marriage
 Doesnt work, my wife is still pretty upset I play Stardew Valley so much
Posted: 15 June, 2016
Ok so far from my game this is what I got:> farming for first week> mayor tells me to socialize with the townfolk> decide to talk to random people> lots of talking> finally think i met everyone> try to interact with trashcan> find a salad in trash, untouched> girl sees me digging in trash> girl gets grossed out from me digging in the trash> get mad, decide to follow her> catch her walking towards lake> turns out shes pretty> want to know how to marry her> find out that i can gift people> dont know what to gift> remembered i had salad from the trash that she saw me grab> give salad to her> she loves it> advance a year or two later> me and girl are marriedI don't understand women, both in this game and in real life
10/10 would dig in trash again 
Posted: 4 December, 2016
I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories
 She would always buy me the new one for Christmas, and we would play it all day, filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry
 Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum
 Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed
 It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work
 Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created
 I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game
 I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten
Posted: 19 June
There is a character in this game that is suffering from depression, it has helped me see my own illness and I have learned to deal with it in a much healthier way soley because of how my character interacts and helps them
 The characters in this game are beautiful, and not just in their artwork
 Their stories and the cutscenes have drawn me in more than just a regular farming game
 I was truely excited to marry Leah and nervous that she would turn me down (Even though she was at 10 hearts and I knew she wouldn't)
I have spent 80 hours in this game so far and I am in spring of year 3 waiting on my first child
 This game has kept my attention and I am looking forward to many more hours
 I give this game 10/10 rating

Early Access Review
So before i begin with this review : Yeah we all know Rust is a laggy piece of sh*t sometimes, so i won`t discuss this here
Pros- Great concept- Stunning graphics- Game mechanics are great- The combat system is good- The crafting system is very good- Weekly updates
 Which is one of the most important things for an Early Access game
- Good and serious developers, who listen to the community- Modding is easy, and the community has almost full access to modding- SkinsCons- Not optimised for extreme potato users, but that is not a main problem i.m
o- The community can be cancerous at times, but that is life
 Not everyone you meet will be nice or help you
- Server creation is a little complicated, but if you are stubborn enough you will learn how to do it / manage it

Early Access Review
I love this game, I built a house around a guys house and made him my prisoner, I fed him cans of tuna and cooked chicken when it was available, and some times I would drop in spare logs of wood(when they were available)
 The best part
 he talks to me, keeps telling me his clans going to raid my structure and save him.
 I simply respond with 
 It puts the lotion on its skin, or it gets the hose again and by hose I mean I dump charcoal on him
-Great game hope the servers come up soon, I think my pet may need to eat

Early Access Review
After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust
 I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped
 Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust)
 I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith
 After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear
 We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them
 I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it
 I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across
 A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow
 I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away
 When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones
 The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined
 Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start
 I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me
 It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking
 I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines
 He simply wrote "Sorry guys :D" This is the single problem that I have with games like this
 Why does it have to be "shoot-on-sight
" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us
 Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area
 But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets
 Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players
 All in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while
 I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game
 People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience

Early Access Review
Day 1I seem to have woken up on a mysterious island, I don't remember much
 All I have is a rock.
 I'm scared
There seems to be no sign of other humans
 I do not have any food or shelter yet, however, I was able to obtain a few logs by hitting a tree with this rock multiple times.
 What a mysterious island
Day 2I have found a chicken, some more wood, and a few stones, I was able to conceive an amateur, handmade axe, it only took a few seconds to make, so I was able to kill the chicken too
 I have also gathered a fairly large pile of wood, I might be able to build a makeshift shelter, but for now..
Tonight I feast
Day 3Today is the day, I will finally build a shelter, I can feel the warmth of a warm bed and fire already
 I haven't felt this good since I was a child, playing with my toys, I remember one toy more than most, it was called a "Steam", ahh, the good ol' days
I will be home soon
 I promise
Day 4I'm sorry
I have killed a man
It all happened so fast, he was holding a gun, I was debating on making peace with him, but he seemed the brutal sort
And all of his gear, it was..
 Enticing
He must have had a family, but I am becoming selfish it seems, I don't care about the man that I have killed
All that I can think of is one thing, not my family, not his family..
But tonight I feast
Day 5I've come across a small, abandoned town, there seems to be a lot of loot within the area
The only problem is that I obtain a heavy dose of radiation if I go into the barriers
I have a choice: Obtain what's necessary to survive and die from radiation, or live on how I am now.
 In poverty
I think I'll live
Just for a while longer
Day 6I saw a man today, outside of my cabin, he was naked and he had a rock.
 He seemed to have been yelling incomprehensible jibberish, he must be insane.
 I remember when I was like that
I still am in a way
Day 7I don't know what to do
The man that I saw yesterday came into my cabin while I was asleep, he held a rock to my head and struck.
My life flashed before my eyes, stupid reflex, I grabbed my journal
Remember when I said that I was coming home
 Sadly my dear, you'll have to meet me in heaven
I am bleeding out
 I am in god's hands now

READ THIS BEFORE BUYING
to avoid unwarranted neg reviews please be AWARE of whats going oncopied from another comment because im to lazy to typeOovee is the original publisher and stopped paying the Developer
The Dev, Pavel Zagrebelny, luckily owns the rights to the game engine and has done some work on it despite not being paid
For him to give us these updates, he had to go through a DIFFERENT PUBLISHER to get it out to us
The original Spintires will NEVER receive an update ever again as Oovee has taken the money from that game and started an entirely new business that has nothing to do with video games
The new publisher isn't just going to do all the work of setting everything up for this Dev and not make any money
 For sure you understand every business needs to make money, right
Now that Pavel Zagrebelny is working with a new publisher, you will start seeing regular updates to this game
 
Posted: 30 October
All of the people saying its the same game don't understand that the publishers screwed over the dev's, so the dev's could no longer work on Sinptires so they need to come out with a new game inorder to make updates, new gameplay and etc
I see the new graphics are new and better, you now need to unlock maps, new water phcis
 I find this game to be an updated verison or remastered game inorder to be albe to work on the game they loved
 I say that I would and did buy this game becuase they are updating and working on it
I understand those who feel like they were ripped off, but remeber they had to remake the game and new gracphics and everything
 
Posted: 5 November
After 28 hours of gameplay, completed all 9 challenges, completed 4 of 6 maps on hardcore, played on all of the maps, tried out some of the modded trucks from workshopCompared to the original Spintires:Pros:- Game is still fun- Graphics looks nicer- Game runs better- Challenge mode is pretty fun but short- Some new vehicles- Finally Cockpit view- Original maps got some nice reworks- Promises about updates and patchesCons:- There are no 13 new vehicles (only a few)- There are no new Sandbox Map (no new maps)- There is a cockpit view but it is ugly and mostly useless without working mirrors- There are no Map support in the workshop- Multiplayer crash issues
-
Fixed Update 2017/11/09- Wheel and Tire options are removed, Less truck attachments- Uncomfortable Winch and Cruise control- It still runs on 32bit- 60 Fps lock- Other bugsSummary:- Wait for patches, don't buy it until that- I don't recommend the game now- If they will patch the game I change this to Positive
Posted: 30 October
Seems like many people have bought this game just to moan that is "the same game as the original
"Also seems like many people felt they were entitled to a free copy of this game because they had the original NEWSFLASH GUYS, MOST REMASTERS AREN'T FREE IF YOU OWN THE GAME, WELCOME TO 2017This is literally 12
49 currently - buy it and support the developer who is now free to continue adding content to the game without being locked out by the publisher, as was the case with the original Spintires
Game itself is great, looks better than Spintires, has more content and feels much more polished, if you like the original, you'll like this, also has a new first person camera, which is okay but could use a bit more work
 Yes, the camera is still weird, at this point the camera is part of the charm I think, but perhaps an option for a traditional 'follow cam' would be a good addition for future content
 Overall, well worth its current 50% off price, perhaps a little steep for 24
99 but if you were at all interested in the original Spintires, this is the definitive version to buy
Posted: 30 October
Everything that made the original Spintires great, with several new layers of polish:+ Game looks nicer and has new graphical features (mud sticks to your tires now, water looks much more realistic, large trailers have hookups to the cab, to name a few), and sounds just as good
 The new music is kinda meh, first thing I did was disable it honestly
+ The game runs a lot smoother, haven't had any framerate hickups at all on a GeForce 750 ti
+ New developers = More money for Pavel (who deserves it) = More updates+ 6 all new maps, and a few more trucks and attachments
+ UI improvements look great+ I feel like the camera is a bit better now, and less likely to have you suddenly staring at the sky or be really zoomed in
 I could be wrong though and I'm just a bit better at it than before
 It still operates in the same way, if you were wondering
- Still not perfect though, could definitely benefit from more camera angles/styles, like a classic chase camera for easy driving along a road when you can go faster
- Interior view now exists, but..
 needs some work and is kind of ugly..
 Apply more polish here and it'll be great
- Kinda wished we could still play the old maps, but oh well
 I'm sure they'll be added as a mod
 EDIT: Some of the original maps remain, but under different names
+ Oh yeah, they're most likely going to add maps to the Steam Workshop soon, so yay for that
Overall, if you were a fan of the original, you will undoubtedly be a fan of this and should definitely support it
 If you are angry about it being the exact same game, educate yourself on the games history, and support the one guy who made the game rather than the dkheads who took his money and ran.8
5/10 would buy another walking-paced driving game for the greater good

After the debacle of OOvee it is great to see this game get a decent publisher
 It could have easily faded away which would have been a shame
 I do not and probably never will know the actual facts of what happened between Oovee and the developer, and I honestly don't care
 I am just glad that Spintires has finally got the release it deserves and will (hopefully) continue to recieve updates
 I have to commend Focus on stepping in and allowing this to happen
While some owners of the original may be peeved at having to repurchase what is essentialy the same game, I do not have a problem with it
 Focus having taken on the publishing of the game deserve some recompense and the discounted price they offer to owners of the original is more than fair as far as I am concerned
The improvements in the game are subtle but veteran drivers will notice them
 The physics are improved and the new water effects are great
 The sounds of the trucks and the environment have also had an overhaul
 The interface has had some minor improvements and the introduction of a tutorial will be welcomed by newcomers
An in-cab view has been added, but unfortunately in its current form it looks like a tacked on afterthought and is rubbish
 It looks like something out of an early 90's game and the mirrors do not work
 Hopefully this will be rectified in a future update
 This view is something I was looking forward to, but at the moment I just cant bring myself to use it without shaking my head and thinking how sad it is
The camera in the original was something that a lot of players did not like
 I personally never had a problem with it, but still used Spintires+ to improve the control of it
 The same camera mode has been retained in this version, but seems more restricted than the original, it can be a bit difficult to get it into the perfect position without it flicking off to another angle
 This is something that will most likely annoy many people but is hopefully another thing that gets improved with an update
 A 'free' camera mode would also be a welcome addition
The addition of 'challenges' is most welcome and is hopefully something that gets expanded on, and hopefully we get new 'official' maps and challenges with updates
 Workshop support is available from release with a few vehicles already present
 It would be nice to be able to install user created maps and challenges through the workshop and I hope this is something that the developer implements
Overall I thoroughly recommend Mudrunner
 If you do own the original but did not enjoy it or play it much then you will not find anything here to improve that situation
 If however you own the original and enjoyed it then I believe that it would be worthwhile purchasing this, it is the game that the original should have become
5/5 muddy tires
Posted: 30 October
Mud runner is recommended in my book if you are new to the series
 Many of the negative comments come from those who feel this game is a scam or an attempt to steal money with a re-skin
 If you read up on the history of the original Spintires the publisher screwed the dev and the dev was left with no way to update the game, he created
 He has since found a new publisher hence the release of Mud runner
 Should you buy it
+ If you are new to the series absolutely+ If you have a few friends to play with even better+ If you own Spintires and really loved it, yes + If you want to help the original dev who got screwed succeed with a new publisher, yes
Should you pass
-	If you did not much care for the original, then move on -	There have been tweaks to the game and the U.I
, but is it enough to pay an extra 15-30 dollars for
Posted: 1 November
This is just an update to the Original SpinTires
 It should never have been flogged off as a "new game"
but as Spintires is the only half decent Off-road game, I'll give it a chance
Pros:-The new challenge mode is fun-The trucks now sound much better- Mud is muddier
Cons:- It's Spintires with some sprinkles on it
- I paid money for an Updated Spintires
- Real Money
- I'm not rich you know
- Too enjoyable to ask for a refund
- THE CAMERA STILL SUCKS, YOU'VE HAD MONTHS TO FIX IT, AND YOU HAVEN'T
- Ever so slightly irritating Camera view

This is my first experience with the Spintires games; I never played the first one
 I'm not a car guy, not into the whole 4x4 thing, the concept of the game didn't even interest me plus the bad press on the first game didn't help the image
 Never gave the game much thought after that untill I saw a review of Mudrunners yesterday
 The guy playing was just having a blast, and I like the European/American Truck Simulator games so I thought "why not
"
Went through the tutorial (which needs a little more meat on it) and jumped into the campaign
 My first delivery attempt ended with my truck lying on its side in a river
 The second attempt ended with the same truck on its side in a creek
 Ok, this isn't working
 Grabbed one of the other trucks that I had found just sitting in the woods and tried again
 My third delivery attempt made it through
 WOOOOOO
 Mission complete but the other half of the map was still black
 Now how do I open that up
 And that's where the game got me
 All the "how" I was doing
 "How do I get there
" "How did I get stuck and now what the hell do I do about it
" "Do I run with bigger loads that are more difficult to get through or save myself some headache with smaller loads and just make more trips
" "Found a new garage, but how do I open that up
" It was only my first few hours into the game and I had already got my $30 worth out of it; I was having a blast
Yeah I struggled with the camera at first like most people probably do but I quickly adapted to it
 It doesn't bother me that it's difficult to position the camera at an angle high above and behind the vehicle because I rarely care what's far ahead of me
 What I need to know is what's underneath me and immediately in front of me and what are my tires doing
 The camera works very well for that
 My tires tell me everything I need to know and the camera gives me that information just fine
Most of the graphics are nice and I really enjoy the details I've noticed
 The mud building up on the tires and then washing off after going through water
 The mud and water splash on the sides of the vehicle, or the way the water flies off rapidly spinning tires
 The barely visible heat haze from the engine and the way the exhaust changes depending on engine damage
 The way the tires deform from the terrain and running over rocks/trees
 There's just some nice touches here
My first 10 hours have all been spent on the first map and I'm not done yet
 I got smart and used my Jeep to open the rest of the map up
 I discovered more logging camps and another garage
 I discovered how to open that garage and while trying to take a shortcut to the mill, I discovered disaster
 I got stuck
 The S T U C K type of stuck
 The tree ahead of me was just out of range of my winch and those on either side just kept trying to tip my load over
 I was so mired in the mud that I couldn't move an inch either forward or back
 Felt like a dinosaur in a tar pit
 That's when I discovered how to change vehicles and how to pull another vehicle free, but not without tipping the whole thing over and losing the load
 All that time trying to make it back was wasted, but I was still happy
 Why
 Because I finally discovered what that "Diff Lock" button does

You feel an evil presence watching you..
 This is the sort of game that you boot up thinking you'll spend an hour or two on, only to one day wake up face down on your keyboard surrounded by bottles and plates wondering where the past 3 weeks went
 100 hours in and I've still not defeated the current 'final' boss, something that's a mixture of the games' excellent difficulty curve, and a melancholy realisation that once I defeat him, my time with the game will naturally come to an end
 Primarily, Terraria is a sandbox game
 You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instruction, eventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the night, discover some form of corruption eating away at the world, encounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies
 Despite all this, you are given little direction, these are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wish, encountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace
 Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earlier, meaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle
 Although traditional RPG elements are largely absent, a discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeated, meaning if you don't progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesn't become more difficult
 In fact, the first boss doesn't spawn until you're suitably equipped with armour and health
 My hours in the game are split roughly equally between single and multiplayer
 Single player stands up on its own perfectly fine, but in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bosses, as the feeling of reaching new goals is shared, and the ammount of 'grinding' for materials is spread across multiple people
 It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrack, as if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expected
 Enemy design is exciting and unique, with floating eyes, possessed suits of armour, giant robotic worms, and a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances
 That being said, whoever on the design team is responsible for 'hellbats' has earned a special sort of hatred from myself..
All in all Terraria is an amazing experience from beginning to end, its tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its exploration, and fearful excitement at its combat
 It's a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories I've made, and to forge new ones
 It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubt, these hours I have spent were not wasted
 I heartily recommend that you purchase this game
Fortune and glory kid..

Honestly, I don't know why Terraria has so many haters
 This game literally has everything
 Fun to play, tons of things to do, bosses to kill, ofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friends, items to farm, a lot of stuff and decorations to build with, not to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the game, you can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new features, items, ect ..
When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it
 That's just how the game works
 Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting day, but it's also the perfect entertainment for your free time
 10/10
Posted: 8 July, 2015
You can be a werewolf riding a unicorn while shooting rainbows from a gun
 You can build teleporters, find a hair dresser in a spider cavern, and get a sword that shoots cats
 You can take on the lord of the moon using a yoyo, summon a sharknado minion that shoots sharks at your enemies, and find sky temples where air wyverns spawn
 You can buy a music box from a wizard and go record the music that you like the most so you can have it playing in your base whenever you want, and then you can go build a castle made entirely out of white marble
 It would seem the only thing Minecraft has over this game is 1 dimension
 Trust me, once you get used to it and start learning about the game, Terraria is simply one of the most satisfying sandbox experiences out there
 It may sound rude, but compared to this, Minecraft just has no imagination

UPDATED EDIT 7/6/2015: With the release of Update 1
3, Terraria has become three hundred times better
 Update 1
3 adds in loads of new items, monsters, bosses, events, and more
 The new bosses are a really big challenge and very cleverly done
 The addition of achievements is addicting to any player who loves to hunt achievements, like myself
 Including the new gamemode known as "Expert Mode" which is basically like turning the difficulty up to 'brutal'
 Lots of other changes as well, like new textures and sounds, and the new addition of world stats to keep track of how many of each type of monster you kill (Which now rewards you with banners)
 How I Found Out About "Terraria"I found out about Terraria the same way I use to always find games, YouTube
 I randomly came across a video called "Terraria"
 I took a look, and instantly fell in love with what I saw, and knew I had to have the game for myself
 It looked like a great combination of gerne' that I love to bits
 Being a Minecraft fan since the beggining of Alpha, I knew I MUST have it
Unfair First ImpressionsWhen ever you ask someone about Terraria, read a review, or watch a video, 95% of the time you hear "Minecraft clone" or "2D Minecraft"
 Which is incorrect on so many levels
 If you have heard this many times, and are thinking twice about actually playing Terraria, please read on as it is nothing like Minecraft
 Review Of Terraria Terraria is a very unique game for what it does
 There have been games like it in the past, but the amount of content and play ability is beyond anything I've ever seen before
 Terraria is a sandbox, RPG, action, etc
 2D game
 It does it's thing very well
 I haven't noticed any UI bugs, or ones that I have, are fixed almost instantly after the patch is released
 The gameplay it provides is not only smooth, it is addicting and fun
 The combat system in the game is perfect for me, and a lot of others
 There are so many enemy types in this game that are not copy paste, each one does their own thing and has their own weaknesses & strength's Example on the kind of enemies you could come across
 Normal walking/running enemies, that have a soul objective to charge you until death
 These may include enemies like the zombie or skeleton
As there are other enemies who will do the same thing, but in a different way (So not everything is copy/paste
)
 Like the slime enemy type, which come in many varieties, which will bounce towards you
 Or the spider enemy type, which will walk on the ground, but can also climb on the walls to get to you quicker
 Just to name a few
"Well, how do I defend myself against these enemies
"Good question
 Let's get that
Items & FurnitureThis is where Terraria gets big
 Even though the world's are limited, they provide so much that you could spend 800 hours of game time on a single small world and still have many things to do
In the world of Terraria, there are alternate versions of almost everything
 What I mean by this is, each world you have will not be the same
 For example, there is a 50/50 chance when loading a world to have the default version of something, or the alternate
 Such as the music that plays, there are different tracks for the same biomes, just depends on what random one you got
 Or for textures on things like, grass, and trees
 Also things like ore, in a default world you would have Copper as your basic ore, but in an alternate world, you'd have Tin as your basic ore
 What this does is really expands the play time someone can spend in Terraria
 Allowing a single person to play the game over and over, and never have the same experience
 Below the surface are loads of blocks, dirts, ores, and more
 Ore like Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, Silver, Platinum, Gold, Cobalt, etc
 And blocks like normal dirt, clay, stone, mud, cobwebs, and so many more
 You need these ores to make your weapons and armor
 You can find treasure deep underground, that holds many valuable things
 You can increase your maximum health by finding Life Crystals underground
The weapon range in this game is massive
 You even have magic weapons, like spell books, and mana weapons
 There are also bows, swords, pickaxes, axes, guns, lazers, cannons, familiars, and so much more
I won't get into to much detail here, but the amount of content in this game is massive, and it's still being updated
 Sure, Terraria has been through some rough times with updates, but when it gets an update, the update is full of new things and changes
 Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating)Overall, Terraria is a great game that you can spend hours of time in, and still be having fun in many years to come
 It's a steal for the price of $9
99, and especially when there is a sale that lowers the game to $2
00 or less
 This game is definitely a choice for sandbox gamers looking for an easy to slip into, addicting experience
 Pro's:+Loads of content for hours of game time
+Great combat system
+Smooth gameplay, that's easy to slip into
+Provides a good challenge
+Fun and creative boss battles
+Amazing side events that you cannot resist
+Achievements are addicting to those achievement hunters
+Expert & Hardcore modes add hundreds more hours of gameplay and possibility
Con's:-No infinite world option
 (Doesn't drop overall score - But can be annoying to some players)-No easy way to edit worlds before creation (Like choosing whether to have Crimson or Corruption)Overall Rating: Is about a 14
5/15 (Must Own

 I prefer Minecraft for the building and the survival
 Terraria has a good array of things you can use to build but I like to use Minecraft because of the complexity of machinery you can make using all the complicated gizmos and gadgets in it
 As for survival, it's exceptionally fun in Terraria but I like it in Minecraft as well due to the sheer size and randomness of a world
 In Terraria everything is more or less always the same; corruption/crimson, hell, space, etc
 but in Minecraft there are so many more places to choose from
 But all the same, Terraria can be fun too
So, opinions aside, due to our comparisons..
 TERRARIA WINS
..
right
 You see, it isn't about who has more of what
 It's about the way to play
 The way to enjoy it
 You enjoy building, being creative, making pixel art
 Play Minecraft, it's the perfect game for you
 Don't have much taste for being a super builder, but like adventuring, fighting, bosses, etcetera
 Play Terraria

This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated
 Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day
 And if that's not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machine
An alternate title for this game could be "Zen and the Art of Logistics"

Upon a winter's night quite coldI loaded up a game Steam soldThe trucking sim of much acclaimWhile thinking, what a stupid game
At first I tried to play my wayBy squishing peds and bringing painWhere are the cops
 I asked myselfTrying to earn my place in Hell
But time went on I grew boredI'd do one run and then ignoreThis game that theyd called 'Comfy Truck'And then move on without a-BUT WAIT
 I'm almost out of time
Just have some faith, I'll cross that line
But time was past and pay was dockedMy world was shattered, faith was rocked
Well just one more
 I grumbled lowI loaded up and hit the road"I've got it now
" as off I wentSoon to delete local content
Passed peaceful pastures in the nightI saw a sunrise blinding brightI guess this game's not all that badThough not the best I've ever had
Pop playing on the radioIn harmony with my VolvoThis siren sought to bring me sleepWhile consciousness I fought to keep
I showed up, docked and dropped my chargeAt a nondescriptive harbor yardJust one more time, said my girlfriendTomorrow you can play again
But no, I knew I couldn't stopThe needs of commerce never dropIf it be chemicals or steelI had to keep turning those wheels
So down the road I charged once moreThrough France, Poland and LuxembourgAnd soon a thought occurred to meCould this be what they call comfy
If slow and peaceful is your aimYou'll not do better than this gameNow just real quick here's a rundownSo youre running when you hit the ground
You move cargo from A to BI'd recommend quite hastilyIf you do well and earn your payThen manage other drivers days
And so with that ends my reviewI hope maybe youll try it tooIn here you'll find no gun or knifeBut I enjoy the trucking life
Posted: 14 December, 2016
As a retired truck driver of 40 years I never though I would end up playing a game about truck driving but I find it a pleasing experiance when I can travel the European roads which I traveled daily
 The experiance is so realistic I would recomend this game to all who would like a glimps of the life of a European trucker without all the grind and hardship which goes along with the job
 Congratulations SCS you have a realistic product even taking into account the suicidal AI
Posted: 2 October, 2014
My girlfriend didn't get why I loved this game
 Said I was a loser and a weirdo
 So I built my transport company into a million dollar empire just to show her what I'm capable of
 I haven't heard from her for a while

You know, it honestly feels like a joke at first
 Theres thousands of games out there  some offer compelling storylines, others offer non-stop thrills, and pretty much all of them let us escape the dull monotony and grind of daily life..
 And then theres Euro Truck Simulator 2
 Which, unsurprisingly, is a simulation game where you drive trucks around a crude rendition of Europe
 Okaaaay
 To emphasise the absurdity of things, you only need to look at the basic gameplay loop thats taking place here; you pick a job from a list of options in your area
 You go and hitch up your cargo
 Then you slowly trundle towards your destination, taking into account every road law and speed limit, and spending the great majority of your time on vast highways and never-ending strips of asphalt
 After dragging yourself to your destination for 20 to 30 real-time minutes, you drop off the cargo  and do the whole thing again
Suffice to say, then, that this isnt for everyone; theres a good chance a few of you have fell asleep merely reading the last paragraph
 If you do actually get to the point where you boot up the game for the first time, it even does a lot to try and immediately frighten you off..
 Youre instantly met with a plethora of menus that are incredibly overwhelming, allowing you to do everything from create a profile to adjusting your X-axis sensitivity for..
 Well, something
 The tutorial then doesnt help matters, basically stemming down to telling you Just drive the truck, and then buggering off and leaving you to work out how exactly you do that in the first place
 Yet give it a chance to get things rolling and  amazingly and most crucially  it really works
 Theres a bunch of reasons why this is the case, that go way beyond the primal satisfaction that comes with driving a hulking great big rig
 For one, theres an incredibly calming sense of slow progression constantly burning away in the background, with the sat-nav in the corner of your screen always slowly ticking down the miles left towards your destination
 Its surprisingly satisfying to watch the numbers keep dropping, and finally whittling a distance that seemed impossible to begin with down to nothing
 Secondly, there's the option to turn on your own music while driving, or even tune in to actual radio stations across Europe
 Set one of these up and hit the perfect moment, where the right song comes on as you watch the sun slowly rise and peep through the trees, and it all just feels Right
 Heck, take my word for it when I say that having AC/DCs Highway to Hell blasting out your speakers as youre racing down the road at max speed is something thats hard to beat
 If youre daring, you can even pop a video or TV show up in another window and zone out..
 But just like real life, the chances of you suddenly finding yourself wrapped round the nearest streetlight rapidly increase if you do this
 Still, its fun to try
 In the game, that is
 Theres also a healthy degree of strategy mixed in as well
 Your truck needs fuel and your driver needs rest, and managing the two becomes a delicate balancing act of effective time management, where you are constantly checking out your route and seeing how far you can push yourself before you literally fall asleep at the wheel
 While it takes way too long if youre not wishing to put yourself in a position of extreme bank debt (so much so it actually gets a little frustrating), you can even make enough money to hire other truckers to your cause
 Suddenly youre busy plotting out an empire, trucks roaming across all of Europe, and your hard work being rewarded with a skyrocketing bank account
 You can even make the core game more complicated, if youre that way inclined
 An automatic gearbox might be the obvious choice, but theres nothing stopping you from having to switch through all the gears manually, or even hooking a wheel up and going totally crazy
 The choice, as they say, is yours
Its also worth pointing out all the mods that are available to enhance or change things up  from the big changes to the little tweaks, theres a lot you can bolt on to the base experience
 Whether it be branding the sides of trucks with famous logos, or subtly changing the map and the way your truck handles, theres a lot you can tinker about with if things are starting to feel a little dry
 Special shout out to the mod that lets you personalise the inside of your truck  because theres something irresistible about decking out your cabin with a giant BB-8 and a bunch of other nerdy bits and bobs that fill up every empty space
 While not offered in the game or mods themselves (and I can't say I tried this myself), theres also means out there to take things online, hitting the road with truckers all over the world
 Chances are youll end up in a traffic jam trying to get a ferry to somewhere, but hey, whatever floats your boat
 In the end, whatever you choose to do and however seriously you take whats on offer, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is perhaps the definite chilled out experience; with everything always just coming back down to you and the open road
 Its the perfect game to unwind after a stressful day, where the challenge or intensity of most other games simply doesn't appeal, and that's what makes it something so much more than something to laugh at

Top-notch truck driving simulator
With support for TrackIR, wheels and pedals, this game has become a gem of the simulation genre
Before having tried it, it's hard to see why this game will be so addicting
I suspect much of that feeling comes from the progression from a lowly truck driver not even owning a truck to a multi-country Logistics company owning a hundred trucks and employing as many drivers
You "level up" various skills which improve the rewards you get from certain types of deliveries or open up more jobs such as longer distances or different categories of dangerous cargo
Driving the trucks is a pleasure
It's surprisingly therapeutic driving from city to city, obeying the road rules rather than smashing things up like a madman
That said, if you disable the speed-limiter in options (90kph) you can get a bit crazy, getting as high as 150kph+ on some routes, a bit of a thrill considering the cargo you have in tow
Speed cameras will become your enemy though
Unfortunately the AI of the other traffic can at times frustrate
In some instances such as in underpasses under freeways you can find intersections where the cars always fail to give way, probably because the intersection was not programmed correctly
Don't get me started on the kamikaze AI at roundabouts either
In any case, this is the most fun you can have driving a truck in a game
Having a controller or steering wheel would be highly recommended, and if you have head-tracking equipment it's icing on the cake

Much like my sentiments of Farming Simulator 2013, I fell in love with Euro Truck Simulator 2 and I have no idea why
 Mundane job simulators are overwhelmingly garbage, but a select few (including ETS2) are surprisingly compelling
There is no way I can think of to describe this game without sounding terribly drab
 Youre a truck driver, and are starting your own shipping company
 You have to drive according to the law, take rest breaks, buy fuel, pay for upkeep
 There is nothing on paper that should be exceptional about this game, yet for what it is, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is disturbingly enjoyable
 I recommend everyone to give it a try
Posted: 16 July, 2015
Euro Truck Simulator 2 isnt a game you play
 its a game that consumes you
 its a drug
 you dont buy this game knowing that you will loose your social life
 but ETS2 takes what it wants
 my entire family has abandoned me
 all thats left is my fleet of 50 trucks
 my girlfriend crys from our bed "turn off the game, its time to go to sleep" she dosnt understand
 its not a game
 I run a Multi-Million doller International trucking empire, sleeping is for the noobs
 this game recieves a perfect 10/10 from me, i have lost everything i have ever loved
 but, i do have 20 Volvo trucks now...

It's just one of those games you can turn on the radio (Game has an interface for internet radio) and just space out as you're driving through Europe's highways
 Great game, would recommend to every single person out there

Players choose their HQ's location in any of the game map's cities
 At first, the player can only take what are known as Quick jobsthese jobs involve making hired driver deliveries while employed by a delivery company, with a provided truck and all expenses (fuel, road tolls, ferry crossings) covered
 As the player earns money or takes bank loans, they can eventually afford to buy themselves a truck, acquire a home garage, and start making more money by delivering cargo using their own truck instead of just being a driver for hire
 Money earned in the game can be spent on upgrading or purchasing new trucks, hiring NPC drivers to take on deliveries, buying more garages and expanding the home garage to accommodate more trucks and drivers
The player gains experience points after each delivery
 A skill point is awarded after each level-up
 Skill points can be used to unlock deliveries that require different ADR classes, longer distance deliveries, special cargo loads, fragile cargo loads, deliveries that are urgent and eco-driving
 This progression allows the player to take on better paid jobs
The game features 77 cities in thirteen different countries, over twenty different types of cargo and over fifteen fictional European companies
The game also features a "Radio" feature, which allows players to play MP3 and OGG files
 It also allows the player to listen to Internet radio
Version 2 includes two new truck companies, Scania and Renault, with MAN returning from the original game
 DAF, Iveco, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo trucks were not officially licensed and had their names changed to DAV, Ivedo, Majestic and Valiant respectively
 Later updates included the official branding for the DAF XF,Volvo FH, Iveco Stralis and Mercedes-Benz Actros

This game made me so miserable 
 The writing can be as funny as heartbreaking The Voice acting is one of the greatest i've ever heard A lot of the time , the many side quest were as awesome or even better than the main story (That is already amazing )Pro : The whole game Con : Absolutely nothing It's one of the greatest gaming experience I've ever had in my 24 years on this earth

The Witcher 3: Honest ReviewMonsters
Posted: 25 June
I am 75 years old and really enjoyed this game
 In this game I could do all the things I was once able to do but in my twilight years can no longer do
 There should be more games like this for us seniors
 The graphics were exellent
 I very much dislike and dismiss the cartoon type graphics in most other games
 The visual aspects of the game were superb, realistic and sometimes even breathtaking
 The attention given to detail needs to be congratulated
 The storyline was only just satisfactory but this was complemented by all the interesting charecters involved
 Please continue to amaze us gamers with your excellent work
Posted: 6 June, 2015
The best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and second part of The Witcher
 You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better
- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,- Story, which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something what makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which makes from every single battle - an unforgettable memory,- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally something dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his misery
The Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions)
 Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them
All in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade)

Ignore me having 8 hours on this account, I finished the game twice and have 100+ hours on this game.QualityRatingReasonPerformance8
5/10You need a great PC to be able to run this game at maxed graphics, I got a steady 60 FPS on all ultra settings, with the occasional drop in the capital
Controls9/10Controls using a keyboard and mouse is weird, I had to get used to it
 Once you've learned the controls it feels natural though, it's not like there's any inconvenient keymapping
 I still recommend using a controller since it's a hell of a lot easier
 (I didn't use a controller since I'm not comfortable with it, it was still fine for me)
Ultility7/10Playable only on Windows.GameplayRatingReasonChallenge9
5/10If you play this game on easy, it's a walk in the park, you destroy everything you see, and Geralt is some sort of God who almost can't be killed
 On Death March however, everything else is a god and it's so hard to get further in the game
 I found this the most fun experience, for a reference; On Death March enemies have 80% more health and do 230% more damage, also you only gain 80% experience from everything whilst on this difficulty
Content10/10A big open world, with a lot of things to do, hours upon hours of content after you've finished the main story
 Side quests, collectibles, bounties, amazing DLC (some free some paid for)
 One of the few developers that give free DLC that aren't just reskins or anything, but actual quests
 Big + on CD PROJEKT RED for this Story10/10I compare stories like this with other amazing storylines like The Last Of Us, it doesn't even get close to how good the story of The Witcher is
 Such an indept story, amazing eye for detail, and I really got involved in the characters
Diversity10/10The main story gives you a whole lot to do, exploring the entire world, even going back to Kaer Morhen
 Whilst all the side activities give you even more to do (as I've said with content) all the bounties, collectibles, quests for armour, quests to help strangers, ''random'' events and DLC, you'll be busy for quite some time
DesignRatingReasonGraphics10/10The graphics are insane, I can't describe how good like they are, I suggest you search for some video's just reviewing the graphics if you really want to get an indept view of it, all I can say is that this game will be pleasant to watch / play
Sound10/10Amazing voice acting, amazing music, amazing ambient sounds
 Everything is just amazing really
 Great music whilst in combat as well, makes me want to keep dodging the enemy so the music doesn't stop, it really puts you in the right mood for this game.Mapping9
9/10I wish I could give this a 10, but it's really hard to call something perfect, but there's always little flaws with something like mapping, if I really wanted to start nit picking on them
 But the world of Witcher is amazing, it feels alive and even though it's a really big world, there's little details everywhere
Interface10/10The interface is solid, it looks great, and does what it's suppose to
 Not really anything else to add there
Final Score: 10/10Don't let the score fool you, it's not perfect, nothing is
 Yet this game is at the same time
 I love it, 99% of the people who played it love it
 Do you like killing monsters, a medieval setting, a great story line, or just a good looking game
 You'll definetly love it

So we got a game in 2015, the complaint of which for many people was overwhelming contentWe got a DLC for the game in 2015 which was better than all the games in the yearWe got a DLC for the game in 2016 which was better and had more content than most games in the yearThe base game and DLC together costed less than most AAA games of the yearA game that had an artistic vision, a game that wanted to push boundaries in terms of narrative and choice/consequence based decision making in a living and breathing open world, with characters that are memorable and relatable
 A game whose developers knew what gamers wanted
 WItcher 3 has launched CDPR into the league of great developers like Looking Glass, Rockstar, Valve, old-Bioware etc....
 My only complain with this game is that it made other modern games feel obsolete
This is the game of the generation by such a huge margin, it's not even funny

'There's nothing behind me
 I'm a Witcher, I'd have heard it
 Just like I can hear your heart
 Which is pounding..
 like a liar's
'Geralt of Rivia__________________________________________Introduction'The Witcher III: Wild Hunt has won so many awards and has been praised by so many people that its kind of impossible to miss or ignore this game
 Its the third part in the videogame series based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski and represents the end of the famous videogame trilogy of Geralt of Rivia, a.k
a the White Wolf or the Butcher of Blaviken
 To cut a long story short: The game lived up to every expectation I had and exceeded them with ease
 Even the games minigames are better than many full-price titles  yeah exactly, Im talking about you Gwent, you awful little drug that I cant get enough ofThe main story connects to the events of the second Witcher game 'Assassins of Kings and brings the overall story started in the first part to an end
 Witchers are infamous monster hunters, magically improved mutants that are simultanesously feared and needed in a world threatened by dark creatures, evil spirits and living nightmares
 Geralt of Rivia is a famous specimen of this kind and thought for a long time that his former friend and love, the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg, was already dead
 However during the recent events in Loc Muinne he learned that this was not the entire truth and so he decides to start a new journey to finally find answers to his questions
 A huge world with fascinating lore and characters awaits the White Wolf - the sheer quantity of places you can visit, persons you can talk to and monsters that have to be slain would be enough to
fit in several other games
 This world is not only packed with interesting stories, dialogues, quests, fearsome monsters and an insane amount of details behind every corner, moreover it is convincing and far away from all the happy fantasy clichs you've already seen a hundred times
 There is neither black nor white, just many shades of grey
 Elves are neither the glorious archers nor the kind tree people, humans not the friendly guys that accept every race the same and dwarfes are no gentle stone-loving miners
 In this world you have to make choices that you wont like and to live with the consequences
 Morally ambiguous is the description youre looking for
__________________________________________Graphics and AudioRegarding the technical aspects this game conquers Mount Olympus easily (despite the much complained 'technical downgrade) as it is one of the most beautiful RPGs Ive ever seen, with amazing sunsets/sunrises, spooky nights and gorgeous views over detailled landscapes full of nature and terror - this game is definitely gorgeous
 You want to see some examples
 Let me show you some screenshots taken from the game using only the additional E3FX and the free camera from the console:http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=639380403http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=657195325http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=626638385In addition to the stunning visuals there is also brilliant music and fantastic voice acting that will catch you during dialogues or pumps you up during the fights
 Together with the exquisite characters, the superb dialogues and all the deep little stories the game suceeds even more in creating a credible fantasy world
__________________________________________ConsSo now there's the question: Are there negative points at all
 Yeah some minor flaws: Talking to every person and looting every stash is kind of unsatisfying as there is no wide variety of things that you may accomplish or find this way, so after some time you will visit mostly the important places and persons while ignoring the rest
 Furthermore if everything else may be a 10/10 for me, the fighting mechanic is not as fantastic as the rest
 It has definitely improved since the second part but its still somewhat 'special' as it lacks unique aspects, a good feedback for the hits and suffers every now and then from targeting problems, camera angles, weird controls or some questionable hitboxes
 That now may sound worse than it actually is - from my point of view it's 'still' an 8 out of 10
 In addition I encountered some small visual glitches and sound errors during cutscenes but they were so small and disappeared after reloading, so I dont even care about this at all
 Compared to the games size and content there are nearly no problems at all and everything runs more than just smoothly for me
 To be honest there is only only real downside that I have with the game: My journey with Geralt will end some day and it set new standards regarding characters, lore and dialogues that future RPGs have to be compared with - and this will be a tough struggle for many of them
__________________________________________ConclusionSo in the end, would I recommend the game
 Yes  and no
 Its a fantastic RPG with an amazing amount of content, exquisite characters, dialogues and interesting stories, so Id recommend it for everyone who has even the slightest positive attitude towards RPGs or the fantasy genre in general
 However at the same time I wouldnt recommend the game for anyone who has only little time to spare, doesnt want to be immersed in a massive world full of lore or just wants to rush the story - this game needs time
 A lot of time
 However it pays off by providing a brilliant experience that will take you on a journey that youll never regret or forget..
or to be more precise let's call it 'a journey youd like to forget'
 Just to experience this masterpiece again from the start and to get these great feelings again (damn I even ignored the fast-travel option and turned off the minimap and the quest hints willingly for many hours (Ive been lost so many times) to enjoy the world and the quests even longer)
 I rate it gladly 9
5 out of 10 points
__________________________________________Let's end this review with another badass quote of the White Wolf:'I'm a Witcher
 Heard you wondering about my swords
 Well, one's for monsters, the other for humans
'
Posted: 2 June, 2016
This is the greatest game ive ever played in my life (ive been gaming since Pong/2600)
 My time played is bordering on embarassing, and its going to get worse with BaW just released
 This is my comfort game, whenever I am bored of another game, I can always come back to this one
 I also played through W1 and W2 multiple times (not on Steam) so I was foaming at the mouth for years, waiting for this game
I'm the kind of gamer where I need more than just a story, I want a great story, great loot/crafting/item management, great combat, and great character RPG skill building
 This game has it all, and its completely adjustable
 Only want the story and swinging your sword at monsters but dont want to get into crafting/alchemy/skills
 Just play it on the easiest and you can skip all of that, and just watch the story (Naughty dog/telltale style)
 You want to get hardcore and make all the crafting/oils/bombs/potions/thought into char build usefull
 Turn it on Death march and make all your desisions count and make all the battles extremely fun and tacticle
 4 of my 5 playthroughs are on DM and it is the true Witcher 3 experience
Games with great stories alone just dont cut it for me anymore
 A good example of this recently was Uncharted 4, dont get me wrong it had a great story, but after the Witcher I was bored to tears and still havent finished it
 In that game you do nothing but shoot at stuff and watch the story, which is fine for some people but not me
 In Witcher 3 you get a GOT quality of a story, including voice acting, animation, ect
 However when you want to take a break from that, visit one of the equally engaging side stories and monster hunts, go on scavenger hunts for treasure and 6 different sets specialized witcher gear, 4 of which have 5 tiers of upgrades
 Go visit question marks on the map for more side stories and treasures, hunt down rare ingredients for your potions/bombs/oils
 Theres all of that and I havent even talked about Gwent yet...
You will also be collecting cards rare and common through out the game world for an entire card game built from the ground up as a mini game within this game

Just spent an 8 hour session with a stranger who was willing enough to show me the ropes
 From a basic camp, we managed to establish a good base of operations growing crops, setting up spider lairs, bee hives and beefulo herds
 Definitely appreciate players such as Hxgvamp to take the time to teach a noob what to expect in this new lore

Just starting to build camp and get set up
I notice the camp is in the middle of a big forest
I point this out and helpfully comment on how wrong things go if a fire got out of control
 "Perhaps we should relocate for the sake of safety
""Lol don't be such a baby, make your own camp if you dont like it
""Fine I will make my own camp
 with Blackjack and Hookers
 and It'll be better
"Proceed to make own camp with afformentioned Blackjack and Hookers
Few days pass
Come back home after a hard days foraging to find all my Items have been nicked
I am now royally screwed, all my materials, tools ect
 gone
I know it was them
An evil plan for revenge hatches in my mind
 Wait till night time
 sneak over to other camp with torch in hand.Thefoolssuspectnothing

Set fire to one tree
Next tree catches fire
Whole forest ablaze in a matter seconds
They all either burn to death or are torn apart by the beasts in the dark as they flee in panic
Retrieve stolen items and also pillage corpses
I am now the king of this world and none can oppose me

UPDATE: This review is severially outdated and it will not be correct
 Sorry for this inconvience
When I first got my key, I got really exicted, To the point where I've gotten over 400+ Days on a world w/ my friends
 Here are some of the basic things you should keep in mind about while playing with your friends
Starting off:Once you start off you have 3 choices or gamemodes to play with your friends, Survival, Wilderness and EndlessSurvival: Basically same twist as if you payed endless just if everyone on the server is Dead, a counter goes down for someone to join (That is alive) or the whole world gets reset with the same generation presets
Wilderness:
When you join the server you spawn in a random location (Sometimes an island if your unlucky) and you need to find your group to set up camp
 Once you die or have died you are taken to the change character screen and respawn in a new location with your camera rotated in a different pos and if you look on your map there will be a small circle on where you've last died
 Keep in mind you die again that Circle updates to where you last died so try to get back to your stuff without dying
Endless: Ah, my favorite of all the gamemodes
 When you join the server you spawn in from a "Jury-Rigged Portal" And begin surviving
 If you die you become a ghost with the character traits of your character
 You can respawn if you haunt one of the following
 (Meat Effigy, Life giving amulet, Touch stone, Jury rigged portal and Tale-Tell heart) If you respawn from the "Jury-Rigged Portal or Tale-Tell heart" You will lose around 20 MAX Health Points
 You can get those lost hit points back from getting a booster shot which requires 3 Papyrus, 2 Healing Salves and 1 Stinger (YES STINGERS FINALLY HAVE A USE)Once you join the server (Depending on the size / max amount of players) You basically play regular Don't Starve, If join a larger server with more people there's a silm chance that you will be able to survive the up coming winter or Night
 Which can be difficult depending if PVP is on or not
 And Since armor has now been changed to take Less damage i
e Wood Armor = 80% (Reg ds) 60% (Dst) Marble = 95% (Reg Ds) 80% (Dst) Football helm = 80% (Reg dst) 60% (Dst)
Characters -Wilson:Pros -Grows a beardCons - None
Wilson is a character that i'm pretty sure everyone is going to see ALOT of since he's the first character and Really has no Downfalls even though it takes 19 days for Wilson to get his Homeless man beard it will protect you in winter
Willow:Pros -Doesn't Take fire damageStarts with a lighter (Infinte torch)Cons -When on low sanity Will cause lots of forest firesCan Grief other players Flamable walls / Crops
Willow is a good character for surviving the Winter and helping out your friends in DST
 But she can be used to be the most annoying person in the entire server
 She can run around starting massive forest fires and buring down vauable resources as well as causing LOTS of lag
Wolfgang:Pros -Gets stronger on a full stomachHas more hpCons - 1
5x the faster Hunger drain at full stomachMoves and deals less damage at a smaller stomachLoses more sanity in Night / AfternoonAh, Wolfgang more of a fighter than a gardener
 Wolfgang can be useful for tanking spiders nest and killing of those annoying Tall birds and getting there eggs the only downfall is If you have a lot of food toghether It's not going to last very long amongest 6 Players, If you are playing as wolf gang only "Power up" to full stomach when in need
 Don't just waste food to be a full stomache because food WILL be eaten fast
Wendy:Pros -Has a ghost sisterDoesn't lose much sanity in darkCons -Does -
25% Less damage than all charactersLoses 50 Sanity when spawning abigail inWendy is one of my personal favorite characters just to add a little challange to the game
 Even though she doesn't hit hard she losses NO Sanity in the Afternoon
 As well she can spawn her sister in after 2 - 4 Days by killing ANY Animal / Creature Near the flower
 She will lose 50 sanity for spawning he in even if another player kills something near the flower
 But the fun part is Abigail does Splash damage to mobs near her
 If you need to fight something send abigail (or your friends) to kill it
 If abilgail dies go pick her flower up, If you can't find it theres a minimap icon for it
WX78:Pros - Can eat ANY Food that is spoiled /
Stale and take no penalty
Can be charged by lightningCan eat gears to level up (Max 400 hp, 200 Hunger, 300 Sanity) Also gears give health, hunger and sanity back if eaten
Cons -Takes Damage in the rainStarts with low stats (100 hp, 100 hunger, 100 Sanity)WX78 Is a good character if you can get to a supply of gears fast as well your going to need to hunt down a pig village for an umbrella
 If you don't get an umbrealla right off the bat you will loss 0
25 of 1 Hp every 3 - 5 Seconds
 If your lucky enough and you make an umbrealla you won't have the chance of being struck by lightning which will cause you too lose 33 Sanity but Not freeze during winter and can glow like a torch the effect only lasts for one day so don't be adventuring in the middle of the night if the Radius of light is shrinking
 But can be benifical if you use if effectively
Wickerbottom:Pro -Starts off with all science machine reciepes unlocked
Able to craft her own booksStarts off with 2 Papyrus
Cons -Can't SleepTakes more penalty for eating Spoiled or Stale foodWickerbottom, The walking science machine, You can pretty much help your friends by going right to an achlemy engine instead of wasting the time of making an Science machine
 Even though you can't Sleep there are multiple ways of getting your sanity back up
 With the abiliy to make your own books
you have the power to instantly grow all crows and Plants, Spawn lots of birds and more for the cost of your sanity
 And yes I know this sounds like wickerbottom is a bad character, as long as you know how to get sanity back without murdering the flower population
The Rest of the characters have no been added while writing this review
Over all this is a great game and I recommend it to any and all players
EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED DON'T STARVE TO PLAY THIS YOU JUST NEED A DON'T STARVE TOGHETHER KEY
 PLEASE STOP ADDING ME

This is the one thing this game was missing, multiplayer
 And it is extremely well done
You can host your server from the game without the need for port forwarding, downloading extra server files etc
The way the servers handle mods is also great, if the server has a special server mod it is automatically transfered to your client (this is unnoticable), with the exception of some client side mods (UI related and such)..
All in all, if you love Don't Starve, you MUST get this expansion
Even if you don't have friends, you can play on public servers, the community is great out there
P.S
 I gave the extra copy to one of my friends already so please stop adding and asking if I can give you the extra copy
 (I write this only because I have recieved multiple friend requests from people who saw this review asking me if i could give them the extra copy)

Nothing is more satisfying than minding your own business (be it cooking or mining) and having your friend start screaming over Skype and have a death message pop up at the top of your screen
Posted: 2 April, 2015
Early Access Review
An interesting new twist on the original Don't Starve, it now proves to be quite a challenge
New features include: -Twice as many mouths to feed-People who eat their scarce rations without first cooking it-People who sit at home base and squawk for food like a baby bird to its mother-People who don't wear armour expecting to dodge every attack like an anime character-The ghosts of said people, draining everybody's sanity both in-game and real life-Terribly organised bases-Terribly organised chests-Stuff thrown everywhere by people who just plain despise organisation-People who draw treeguards into our designated tree farm-People who try to tank hounds-People who try to tank tentacles-People who try to tank ANYTHING-People who wander off and then scream when they get lost-People who wander off because they saw a "Truffala tree" (I'm looking at you, Jonah)-Twice the map sizes-Twice the treeguards-Twice the hounds-Twice the spiders-And most importantly, twice the starving to deathAnd I loved every single minute of it

South Park: The Fractured But Whole is not a terrible game by any stretch of the imagination
 But for a full 60$ game I really expected more
 I absolutely loved the previous game, The Stick of Truth, and naturally had high hopes for the sequel
However, TFBW just fails to deliver
 It absolutely has the South Park feel to it, with tons of humor and references
 The problem is that the game just can't coast by on that alone and the rest of the game is just..
 boring
 The story isn't particularly interesting and you never felt there was anything at stake, something to drive you along
 In the 20 or so hours it took me to play through the game I felt I spent most of my time fighting trash, searching for collectibles and doing fetch quests
 Only at the very end do you see anything in the way of stakes and it all ends with one of the worst final battles I've ever seen and an incredibly anti-climactic ending
There are also other issues I have with this game, the price being one of them
 At 60$ I expect more content than I received
 The game is very short, even with all the side content included
 And the inclusion of a very expensive season pass and day one DLC doesn't help either
 And of course the cherry on top is the fact that you have to use UPlay whether you want to or not
 Ubisoft..
 no one likes your stupid client
 Stop pushing it
And there are some technical issues as well
 I didn't have the black screen problem others have had, but I did have to play through the entire game with a very annoying grey bar at the top and bottom of the screen because my monitor uses a non-standard resolution
 Oddly enough, The Stick of Truth did not have this problem so I don't see why this game should have it
 The game is also very resource intensive, excessively so compared to the Stick of Truth
 And finally the game feels very much like a console port, this is glaringly obvious with the in game phone menus and the control scheme, particulary when trying to do the toilet challenges
In the end I suppose the game is worth a play if you loved the previous game, just wait for a steam sale, it isn't worth the full asking price
 But all things considered, if you haven't played the previous game I would suggest skipping this and picking up The Stick of Truth instead
 It's just a better game in every way
Final rating: 6
5/10
Posted: 21 October
I am confused about this game
 The critical reviews are overwhelmingly positive, stating that it's superior to The Stick of Truth in every way, but I couldn't disagree more and that is very disappointing
 The story-line is largely dull and though there are a few laughs here and there, the writing is much weaker than the previous game
 The cast of playable characters is much, much bigger, but the consequence of this is that each of them gets remarkably little time to say or do anything particularly memorable
This is clearly a poor console port
 The controls are odd in places to say the least, particularly the toilet challenges, to the point where your inputs are simply not registered - which cuts you off from successfully completing part of the content you paid for
Crafting is good, but the downside of this is that it makes 70% of loot drops redundant and worthless as you will almost always have artifacts that are superior that you personally made than what you were rewarded with for defeating a boss or completing a challenge
 This makes the achievement of success a bit lacklustre
The battle system is better than The Stick of Truth, but frustrating in a few ways
 You are only able to attack in one parallel axis with the vast majority of attacks
 I'm not sure why we're not able to attack from the vertical axis given the vast amount of freedom we now enjoy in combat
The music is weaker than the previous game and is not memorable
 I would imagine that most people can recall without having to think terribly hard what the battle tunes were in The Stick of Truth - I can't do that with clarity for this game
The game has quite a few bugs that absolutely should not be present given how long the game was in production and for how long the delays were before release
 The most common example of this is that the game has a tendency in places to soft-lock during combat or following a loading screen
 I also experienced a black screen at one point, where the game continued to run in the background, but I could not see where by characters were navigating to - forcing me to hard reset the game without being able to save
 I'm at the end of the game at the moment but cannot complete it due to a game breaking bug in a boss fight that has brought progress to a halt and until that bug is fixed I cannot finish the game
 That is simply rediculous for a AAA 50 game from a major publisher
The length of the game and therefore the value for money is also questionable
 To be clear, this is a very expensive game for what is a 20 hour RPG experience
 There should either be higher quality and a greater depth of content available or a lower cost
The forced inclusion fo Uplay, whether you want it or not, in order to play the game is another irritationt that I did not expect, considering this was not present for The Stick of Truth with the publisher remaining the same
All in all, I am not sure why they did not just ask Obsidian to make the sequal
 I'm fairly certain that they would have done a much superior job

Day one DLCUplay account is mandatoryNonsensical and paranoid 3rd party DRMMicrotransactions/uPlay coins (Via Upselling you Ubisoft games and forcing you to use their mediocre service)More than enough game breaking bugs at launchStuttering and audio glitches
Story quests locked behind a paywall, shame on you if you didn't buy Season PassDid I mention upselling you Ubisoft game and Uplay

Posted: 17 October
I wanted to recommend this game
 I really did..
 but I can't
 Let me stress South Park: The Fractured But Whole is a great game - even better than Stick of Truth
 The combat was expanded upon exponentially - the tactical nature of the grid-based combat requires so much more strategy and planning than the rather basic "been there, done that" nature of the combat in Stick of Truth
 The game world was expanded upon and is even more interesting, with plenty more secrets to find than before
 Every great thing Stick of Truth did, Fractured But Whole does even better
However, Fractured But Whole is only a good game when you play the version on consoles
 Sadly, it seems like Ubisoft gave this game the "Arkham Knight" treatment for this PC port
 Any enjoyment you could be having is ruined by a plethora of bugs, framerate issues, and other various problems
Let's go over the first, most glaring, and most often brought up problems - the DRM and Uplay
 Denuvo is infamous for causing players a various amount of problems during their experience
 Enough said about that
 As for Uplay, forcing people to download your own specific, barely funcioning service in order to play your game is a scumbag move, even more so when you use it as an exuse to lock much of the content of the game behind microtransactions
 Not to mention, in order to make this game work for Uplay, you have to link your Steam and Uplay accounts -
a process that can be rather confusing and unintuitive
That, however, I might be able to look past in order to enjoy the game, but Ubisoft royally screwed up this port
 If it's not the constant framerate issues or the abysmal loading times, it's the bugs
 Dear God, the bugs
 Often times, cutscenes will play without sound for no reason, characters will load incorrectly when entering a new area and you'll be unable to interact with them, and if you're really unlucky then the game will just crash on you without warning
 In fact, there's a very infamous bug that appears right as you start the game - the game won't load and will just display a black screen, and the only way to make the game continue as intended it to make it go into windowed mode
For the love of God, do not buy this game off Steam
 Literally any other version of this game is much better, and much more worth your time
Posted: 17 October
Posted: 17 October
Multiple layers of DRM, need to make a uplay account
 It launches on a black screen IF it launches, have to make it windowed mode to pass the black screen but then your UI is scattered around randomly and then there's a ladder in the first area with a bug that makes the game crash
 This will be my first ever Steam refund, sad to say
Posted: 23 October
Great story
 South Park never disappoints..
 However, Ubisoft does..
 I can't believe I paid 60 dollars for this buggy POS dumpster fire
 Everything from frame rate drops, sound file malfunctions, black screens, freezing, uplay, dlc and dlc ads
Ubisoft must have cut South Park studios one hell of a deal
 South Park sold out
 IMO Ubisoft and South Park studios gave a big middle finger to the gaming community
 I expected more, expected better..
 This is a $29
99 game at best
Kills me to say this..
 DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
Posted: 17 October
Game runs on Uplay (not steam), making the steam purchase obsolete (and overly complicated)
Would love to review the game but Steam and Uplay don't want to play in tandem
The Steam staff are not helpful, and refuse to refund a non working product all because i got a second copy of stick of truth during pre-purchase that i did not even want away
Will never buy a pre order steam again if this is how they are going to treat loyal customers
Steam and Ubistoft are thieves
Do not get this game for Steam
 It is daylight robbery
Update:Problem was resolved no thanks to the Steam staff at all
The game is great, but I'd suggest getting it on Ubisoft since Steam have no work ethic in their help department, and with needing Uplay to play this game does not need steam as a platform
 In short cut out the middle crook (steam) and get the Ubisoft games on Uplay it will save you time and might just make Steam think their choices in the future
Still a thumbs down report due to the long winded and useless service from the platform I brought it on
But do buy the game through Uplay it is worth it, the achievement prize system rocks too

As a huge fan of Shadow of Mordor, and the middle earth universe in general, I have been waiting 3 years for the sequel to SOM to come out, and whilst its not a bad game (I actually think its better than SOM), I don't feel that I can recomend it, at least now, based of the large number of issues I have with the game
First of I will start with the positives+ The game is much larger in scope than SOM with more areas to explore (Five in total, compared to SOM's two)+ A much better loot system that replaces the runes of the last game
 There is now armor and weapons
+ A better story, which feels more Lord of the rings than SOM's story+ More varied orcs with new attack patterns and new olog-hai (trolls)+ Large fortress battles+ A few new skills and improvements to the SOM formula, like auto picking up arrows and double jumpNow sadly onto the negatives, and I have alot of them :(- The game is very buggy at the moment and as far as I am aware there has not been a single patch released for the game on PC (I am not 100% sure)Twice have I failed fortress assaults because my character has glitched into the enviroment and I am unable to move
- The maps are actually smaller than the ones in SOM (but the total mass of all 5 maps is bigger than the 2 in SOM) and they just arn't very memorable
 Appart from the forts which vary a bit, 4 of the 5 maps are basically the same, with different skins over the top
 There are pretty much no memorable locations on any of the maps except the Minas Morgul map
- The controls still feel clunky, and the gamepad controls have too many actions on too few buttons
 For example, on an XB1 controller, A is to sprint, jump, climb jump, roll, volt over an enemy and a few more moves
 This means that when you are in combat you end up doing the wrong moves, like trying to volt an enemy instead of dodging an attack
 There are also too many enemies at once and its pretty much impossible to attack a certain one, the game will just attack anything it wants
- Far too many reused assets
 As a huge AC fan, I am used to seeing alot of reused assets going from game to game, and I don't have a problem with reusing assets, as long as there is enough new stuff to make it feel fresh
 The problem is that this game doesn't have enough
 The combat animations are 95% the same as SOM, the background music and combat music has been copied over from SOM, one of the 5 regions of the game is in the same region as one of SOM's maps with alot of reused textures and models
As someone who played SOM for over 200 hrs between PC and Xbox, I have to say this game starts to feel stale way to fast
- The end cutscene is hidden behind a grindwall
 To access the real ending of the game you are forced to defend your fortresses 20 times in a mode called "shadow wars" at the end of the main story
 After 2 or 3 assults it starts to get boring real fast, and every single attack feels pretty much the same

Tl'dr version: An amazing improvement upon the original, completely contaminated by some of the worst industry practices we have yet seen
 Make no mistake, if the consumer base does not stop this now, we will be seeing not only microtransactions in $60 games but further degradation of the base game for them to wring every last ounce of money from us
 DO NOT BUY THE LOOTBOXES
You can follow me, and see the rest of my work here:http://steamcommunity
com/id/StarSide/myworkshopfiles/
section=guidesElaborated version:Maybe from that you can already tell I will not just be talking about the base-game of Shadow of War for the whole review
 Most reviewers policy is to separate industry practices from the game to judge the game "on its own merits"
 Well, here's my issues with that
 If you are compromising the product on purpose, in order to drag the game out, or purposely tear the game apart in order for you sell us content later down the line, that is most definitely an already compromised (ethically and mechanically) product
 If WB had kept their grubby mitts of this game, I would most definitely have given this a positive review
 However, since that is not what they have done, this review will remain negative
 Microtransactions
Some in-depth analysis here
 Firstly, the infamous loot box situation
 You can buy orks from loots boxes, not just getting them out in the in-game world
 This completely breaks in-game immersion and the economy of the game
 You can either choose to ignore the loot boxes and go at it vanilla, where you're missing out on possible high-level minions, as the game was obviously intended, as the level of orks you find are introduced on a gradient; the higher level you are, the better orks you will find
 Additionally, what are essentially ads for the lootboxes keep popping up in game, where you are prompted to go and buy them
 Also, if you want any hope of being 'competitive' in the online game mode Shadow Wars, you'll need some super powerful orks, something the lootboxes have the slight possibility to help with
 Consequently, you will notice every dynamic in the game becomes centered around these things in some form of another:You want an high level ork
 Cough up
 You want to upgrade your weapons and armor
 You'll need additional gems to do that, cough up
You want to play multiplayer
 Better have some good orks, so cough up
Whether the game would have been constructed like this without the cancer that is WarnerBrothers getting their claws into the mechanics of the game is completely moot
 Now, with that out of the way, let's talk about the game.Story
You a lord of the rings lore fan
 This is going to be a rough ride
 The game, for better or for worse, plays fast and lose with the canon to such an extent you wonder why not just set this in the time of the silmerilian and call it a day
 However, if you can get past the desecration of established law (which I can), the story is actually quite compelling
 Following on the last game, Ranger Talion and his ancient dead elf-friendo Calimbrimbor have made a new ring of power, just like Saurons
 Great
 What could go wrong
 Turns out quite a lot actually
 What follows is an epic, continent spanning war between the 'Bright Lord' and Sauron
 All sorts of shenanigans ensue
 Just don't get too disappointed if you were expecting high-brow Shakespeare
 Movement and Combat
Like Shadows of Mordor but better
 Everything is back from the last game, but with added upppf
 Movement is buttery smooth, and really the game plays just like every other third-person openworld, Arkyum style game
 Speaking of which, the combat system is straight outta Batman, which isn't a bad thing
 Combat is fun and Talion's wraith powers are suitably beefed up from the last game
 The Nemesis system
I was going to add this to the last section however, it more or less is one of the most original ideas in the last decade in gaming
 Essentially, the Nemesis system allows every individual ork to remember you, and everything you've done to them
 Burn that ork captain in a fire, he might come for you later on
 This is extended to the 'meta game' aspect for creating armies
 Your generals might betray you, or save your life
 This creates some of the best dynamic stories in gaming really
 However, sometimes the betrayals get a little too common, and you'll find yourself trying to game the system in order to keep your orks on your side
 I won't say anything more, it really is something better to experience for yourself
 Sound
Not the best, not the worse
 Voice acting is passable, with a few exceptions
 Talion seems mostly asleep during his cutscenes, the voice actor is clearly phoning it in for his paycheck at this point
 On the other hand, Calimbrimbor is the star of the show
 His gravely tones are both charismatic and slightly scary, especially when he gets all shouty
 Combat noises are also quite good
 Swords ring and the screams of orks will pervade your ears constantly
 In this universe, all orks seem to have a slightly comical British cocny accent
 You'll either love it or hate it
 ConclusionNot concentrating on the poor industry behavior, this is a great game
 However, I will not simply segregate them out of the review, because this stuff definitely effects the end product
 Great game
 But make a statement and wait for this to get to a low price
 And DON'T, DON'T, DON'T buy those damn lootboxes

DO NOT ACCEPT THE TOS
 If you just click the accept button without clicking the check box it turns off the Microtransactions, marketplace, and people attacking your base while you are offline "multiplayer" there is NOTHING that tells you this is possible on the screen
I detail about this further here at the very start
 https://youtu
be/ur3-II1kvBEEdit: WB did change the game prerelease to no longer include losing your Uruks if you get raided while you are offline
 The other points still apply
 I wish there was a maybe option instead of recommend or not
 In light of how this game is packaged I had to click no
 Overall I am enjoying the game but it still needs optimization and all the loot box stuff removed
Posted: 11 October
Mololith has created a phenomenal game
 If you enjoyed the previous iteration, or any of the Arkham games, you'll probably like this one
 However, the MBA's at WB made a business decision to include Day 1 DLC and microtransactions
As a result I, too, am forced to make a business decision and give this game a thumbsdown, to be changed to a thumbs up upon removal or extreme gutting of the lootcrate system and an extreme price decrease on the DLC
 A Triple-A title should not cost $100 to access all of its features, and businesses need to start being punished for thinking they can make that the status quo
Good job, Monolith
Posted: 10 October
So First off i played this game offline and online
 atm 40+ hoursHowever there is a few things that is bad and a few things that is good
Update2
For once this will be a good point and update
With the first dlc released Slaughter Tribe they will be makeing Shadow wars Endless ( free update with or without additional dlc purchase )This is a good step in right direction hopefully they will solve aloot of the other problems as well later down the road
Lets take bad part first
Update3
Pitfight AI sometimes can be broken and the orcs just stand there for a minute and then suddenly go berzerk and kill some one
 possible bugg 
Update
After about 40-50 hours into the game i started getting aloot of IronWilled Orcs wich makes them Impossible to dominate
 This is no doubt a lockbox Mechanic wich is aimed at you haveing harder time to get a orc dominated
It was not in first game shadow of mordor for sure
IronWilled can be removed at a super low chance ( so far my chances have been 1 in 29 shames ) while you shame an orc but heres the kicker
If you shame an orc they have a chance to became deranged wich makes them lose their personality
Also ( if you have certain skill have
chance to make them a maniac wich can be quite insane strong but if ironwilled then they will proboly be hard time to deal with )Or in my case i ended up with aloot of very weak orcs and deranged and still ironwilled
Now this mechanic is aimed at you haveing a slower time to get orcs so you get bored and buy lootbox orcs i have no doubt in my mind about this
 This only happened later down in the game and well it sucks to be frank
I found some very cool orcs i wanted but since they IronWilled i cannot get them without risking them to become insane and lose all their personality
VERY poor game mechanic
So Monolith lied about a few things in their interviews and such
First of all they said there would be no advertisements on lootboxes ingame in a published interview
 But as soon as you open the game and anytime ingame you play and press escape advertisement for lootboxes shows up
 Wich is bad
Next Monolith promised everything that was in lootboxes was in open world
 This was also a lie
 You see in the lootboxes you get scrolls that can customize your orcs
 You do not get that in the open world only from lootboxes ( free or Pay boxes ) Below there is a few examples of what you get from lootboxes that is NOT in open world
Battle Training (raises a follower's level by 1)Archer Recruitment (grants a follower an Archer Gang)Hunter Recruitment (Grants a follower a Hunter Gang)Defender Recruitment (Grants a follower a Defender Gang)Mount Training (Grants a follower a caragor mount) Fire Training (Grants a follower a Fire Weapon)Epic Training: Mighty Savages (Grants a follower a boost to the effectiveness of nearby Savages)Poison Training (Grants a follower a Poison Weapon)Mount Training Legendary (Grants a follower a Defencive Graug)This list is INCOMPLETE we do not have all the traits scrolls here there is supposedly many many more locked inside the lootbox system and NOT avaible ingame
 Below is a link to the official forum where people asked that this be put into the game and not into lootboxes Monolith preatty much ignored it
https://community.wbgames
com/t5/General/Please-make-training-orders-and-reassignment-orders-avaliable/td-p/1656682Next part that is bad about the game is Lootboxes in a single player game was kinda over the line and poorly done IF everything was inside the game offline as well as in lootboxes then ok np but it is not
Other than micro transaction things the game suffers from a little bit repetive gameing syndrome you do aloooot of the same things over and over with very little changes
Now that was the bad parts
Lets go to the good parts
Game features a very well made graphics engine and Npcs are well cordinated for the most part
Story is good as far as i gotten and sound actors are good but maybe little bit low on volume and subtitles can be a hit and miss
Optimisation is welldone i tested on my laptop and on my pc and both worked great
have not encountered any buggs so far wich is good
Nemesis version 2 engine is awesome
 you will love it
Skill system is a little bit weaird at first glance but you get the hang of it later
You can respec free of charge at any given time great addition
Id say if it was not for the lootboxes this would be a perfect game
Now In conclusion If you do not mind microtransactions and some items being In Lootboxes only then you should buy this game
 However if you do have something against microtransaction or you suffer from addiction disorders or similar problems DO NOT buy this game due to sublime advertisements in the menus
I do not know if they will ban people who have fun with the game with mods or cheats or such but i hope they do not since this is a single player game
There is a multiplayer section of the game but its like not worth mentioning couse its very very basic and limited
anyways there you have my review
PS the amount of bad decisions monolith and warner bros made when releaseing this game made the game dirt cheap before it was even released i got my copy 65% off from a retailer on gold edition
you can proboly snag this game with gold edition 50% of at any given time from retailers or digital merchants

Pros:- Better movement across the large maps- Similar gameplay to its predecessor -- doesn't completely change the formula- Grindy, if you're like me, you may enjoy spending more time killing captains and leveling up than actually playing main quests- Massive landscapes with lots of impressive views- Fleshed out army building: More interaction on recruiting and leveling up dominated enemies
- Some really fun main quest battles that slightly deviate from the repetitive side quests- Tons of lore that is delivered via main menu, in-game, and cinematic videos
- Despite reports, I was getting relatively smooth gameplay ~40-60FPS from my Titan X Maxwell (NOT the newer Titan X Pascal) running 4K: 3840x2160 on ultra
 There was some choppiness when it came to assassin/ambush captain pop ins, otherwise been smooth
 Also, no crashes in my ~20 hours of play
Neutral:- Microtransactions -- there's a lot of strife over this, so instead of writing about it ad-nausem, I'll say this: Aside from the trolly T.O.S
 screen (desribed below), didn't affect my gameplay (I didn't purchase anything nor was I nagged in-game to purchase anything from it)
Cons:- The annoying T.O.S
 -- I accepted the Terms of Service, but didn't accept the collecting of data (checkbox)
 Now, everytime I start OR exit the game, the T.O.S
 screen pops back up wanting me to accept the data collection
 Instead, I have to accept and leave the checkmark box empty over and over and over and over and over
 Never in my gaming history have I had a T.O.S
 screen be that trolly
 - Lack of customization -- the swords/shiv/cloaks/rings etc
 are just stat upgrades
 You can't customize the character's look nor can you differentiate between a level 1 sword from a level 25 sword
- Predictable - captain assassin/ambush/betrayl pop-ins will mainly appear after sending death threats
 Doesn't feel like RNG, but rather staged gameplay to distract the player
- Climbing walls -- when it comes to arch-ways, the climbing becomes super wonky, particularly if you're climbing on the front-face and are attempting to drop inside of/underneath it
 Also, some of the wired "walkways" won't allow the player to move forward
 He'll go into the crouched position and stick at the beginning of the wire
- The AI -- you can sneak in front a generic enemy's face and assassinate them
 Or worse, they could be looking right at you and say, "Where did he go
"
 Some minor tweaks should fix this issue
- Repetitive -- the gameplay, so far, has become repetitive
 Very similar to Shadow of Mordor, but with a touch of Just Cause 3 style of play, where areas need to be "liberated" (captured), before the story continues
 Unfortunately, this becomes quite repetitive after about 15 hours
- The game size -- 100GB ladies and gentlemen
 That includes the game, the 4k DLC cinemas and the DLC high-res texture packs
 If you have a slower than 1 gigabit connection or have a data cap or have limited harddrive space..
 I'm sorry

com/m9gjJm0Glitches as of v1
01:- Captain loot -- Early on, I ended up getting a bow that I already had equipped at the time
 However, since it's a level 1, I couldn't dismantle it
 So I'm stuck with two level 1 bows with the same stats that I can't dismantle
- Broken Shelob memories - after solving ANY of the spider web puzzles, I get about 1-2 seconds of video before it rewinds, makes a loud pop and goes back to the gameplay: https://youtu
be/GbYwCjGYSUw ***This may only affect those who have the 4K DLC installed
***- Enemies respawn too quickly - After defeating a main quest/side quest/kill a captain, enemies will respawn in place within seconds
 This mainly affects the side quests and mini-fortress battles, where another captain may respawn in an area you just killed the mini-fortress captain
 Therefore, creating an endless captain respawn loop if you decide to kill the respawned captains
 It does affect the main quests, but to a smaller degree
 Regardless, enemies should respawn only after the area is left
 - Loading - Occasionally, the loading screen would hang
 When I alt+tab out and back into the game, it seamed to fix it
Other thoughts:Unfortunately, I feel that if you've played Shadow of Mordor, you've played Shadow of War
 The game is just way too similar to its predecessor (same overall gameplay, similar storyline, same level-up grind fest, same animations, same in-game assets, same captain strengthes/weakness, same captain menu, same generic enemies, mostly the same dominated mounts..
 etc)
 This game kind of feels like it should have been an expansion pack or DLC for Shadow of Mordor
 It's not so much a new game with some fresh new features, but an old game that's been fleshed out
 It feels like this: An author created a successful book
 The fans wanted a sequel
 The author takes his or her first book, adds in more detail, keeps everything else relatively the same, and releases it as a new sequel to the first
 Would you pay for that
 When it comes to Shadow of War, expect a different map with the same gameplay and a few minor game tweaks and army additions; otherwise, everything else just feels like icing on an already stale cake (I played Shadow of Mordor for 120+ hours, so I ate my fair share of this dessert already)
 Recommendations:- If you've never played Shadow of Mordor: Buy it
- If you've played Shadow of Mordor and loved it: Wait to buy it on discount
- If you've played Shadow of Mordor and were expecting a revitalized game with some new enemies, new assets/animations, more purpose than building an army, or a new storyline: Don't buy it
 Final thoughts:- Visuals - 9/10- Variety of Gameplay - 5/10- Fun Factor - 6
5/10 Overall: 6
5/10 -- slightly above average

Shadow of War is one of 2017s biggest disappointments for me
 While its Nemesis system is better than ever, the rest of the game provides a flawed and repetitive experience with some unpleasant practices integrated into the menu
Imagine a single player game that advertises its microtransactions and season pass every time you pause
 That may not sound too bad, but I easily spent at least forty percent of the game digging through the bloated and slow menu system
 I must have seen them hundreds of times
 In addition to that nonsense, you have the (microtransaction) Market section, filled with Gold and Mithril Chests that promise epic or legendary items and orcs
 Other things you can spend your premium currency on include experience boosts and Featured Friday Chests
 Not everything requires real money in the Market
 You can spend your Mirian (in-game currency) on somewhat useless Silver Chests and redeem rewards tied to the online component of the game (Online Vendettas and Sieges)
 Those delicious rewards trigger a glowing circle right next to the Market in the menu, you know, to make you click on it
 That way you can be exposed to more of their premium offerings since theyre all mixed in together
 Its just the other way the game is engineered to advertise its boxes to you
 There is some serious free-to-play mobile game design philosophy wrapping its glistening, bulging arms around Shadow of War
Now that weve covered that nasty part of the game, lets talk about the Nemesis system
 Its good and the orcs make it fun and interesting
 Youll run into and be killed by poet orcs, orcs that dont know how to stay dead, and orcs that will save you time and time again (to my horror, which Ill go over later)
 Their responses to the numerous situations that can occur within the game impressed me
 The voice actors put in some great performances as the orc and olog captains, especially when you earn the ability to shame them into insanity (highly recommended)
Unfortunately, the game overstays its welcome with its forgettable story and unlikable protagonists
 The elf ghost seems unable to say anything that doesnt involve the word Palintr and Talion doesnt really develop or seem interesting
 Shelob is apparently eye candy with her fine humanoid form and has a unexpectedly dumb storyline tied to her memories (one type of collectable in the game) that becomes apparent when you gather all of them
 The other characters in the game are a slightly better while the orcs are #1
 They have much more entertaining and interesting personalities than everyone else
The other big problem with Shadow of War comes in the form of highly repetitive and somewhat frustrating gameplay
 If youre the type that cant help collecting collectibles, then youre in for a boring and tedious ride
 One of the worst parts about hunting them down is having to climb a tower that activates a mini-game that involves scoping out the territory until your crosshair shrinks enough to discover it when youre close enough
 Some of them have interesting lore pieces attached and others, not so much
The combat varies greatly in its quality depending on the encounter
 You can easily find yourself spamming dodge or counter for extended periods of time if the captain has the right combination of immunities and traits
 Some enraged captains will endlessly lunge at you if theyre Enraged leaving no room to do anything else until they chill out
 Sometimes youre stuck kiting the enemy or youre facing a tank who keeps healing over and over again (dont waste your time and run away until youre at a higher level)
 Other times, youre being clever with all your tools and feeling pretty great about your conquest
 Then again, you could end up becoming uncomfortably intimate with the games horrible targeting and wasting a powerful attack on an unintended victim
 Its a somewhat common occurrence with groups
Other issues involve traversal and glitches
 Talion seems to have a fetish for climbing and will lovingly attach himself to any surface thats nearby when running around
 Ive accidentally started climbing up a wall, pillar, or structure when just trying to travel from point A to point B
 This problem happens frequently and with mounts too, especially graugs
 However, the inclusion of the double jump was a very good choice and was fun to use
 As for the glitches, I fell through the world once, witnessed silent speeches, and more
 For the most part, my 33 hours didnt have many technical problems and the loading times were fantastic on my HDD
 The mission design could have used a better touch too
 Too often would I be going out of bounds in an open-world game
 And its not a matter of running 1000m in the wrong direction, the arbitrary boundaries are poorly placed to the point of causing mission failure and having to restart
 Its aggravating to see that message pop up and doubly so when it causes a restart
 Let me use the environment to my advantage instead of forcing me in a weirdly confined space in a game where youre normally able to move freely
 Since orc speeches are unskippable, you can expect to hear plenty of repeated dialogue if you happen to run into a very difficult fight
The game has a weird grind going for it towards the end
 Recruiting orcs means not collecting sweet loot off their dead bodies so each one has an opportunity cost between an item or convert, making the purchase of chests more attractive
 Im glad I got the Act 1 Starter Pack for 50% off with the 500 real currency Mirian which helped me stay geared up
 Leveling up slows down too so again, Im glad I ended up with a handful of 2-hour 100% experience boosts
Lastly, I dont understand the balance in this game
 The combat balance seems off when it comes to the difficulty level
 Normal is too easy and Nemesis removes nearly all the hitstun that Normal difficulty has
 I found Nemesis to be an exercise in frustration since some missions could end up turning into huge difficulty spikes while repeating the mission on Normal made it a cakewalk
 You can tune the difficulty at any time, but nothing can fix that weird gap between the two
I lied, one more thing, before I forget
 That heroic orc that kept saving me wasted my time
 The upgrade system for items involving fulfilling some requirements that function like a mini-quest of sorts
 The legendary ones tend to favor recruiting very specific orcs of a certain level, tribe, and class
 This means staring at the Army section of the menu and going through the orcs until you find the right ones
 You might even have to pass time if you dont see any available
 Now when I found the right kind of orc twice, they didnt have the correct level
 My plan was to let them kill me so that they could level up and allow me to upgrade my items when I recruited them
 However, this one orc I recruited could not resist saving me and when he did, he delivered a one hit killing blow
In conclusion, the Nemesis system and great orc voice acting carry this game hard
 2
5 out of 5 stars would be awarded based on that and the positive aspects of combat alone
 Numerous things rubbed me the wrong way though and I cannot bring myself to recommend Shadow of War to anyone
 Maybe at 40-50% off
 Its a horribly bloated experience with a sluggish menu
 They needed to trim down a few things and go with refinement instead of having such a busy menu with too many functions
 Oh, I do like the Photo Mode
 Make sure to give that a shot

Shadow of War is fun until reaching the 4th and final act, which locks the ending of the game behind a monotonous and mindless grind
 A baffling decision that can only be explained by the developer/publisher trying to strongarm you into buying their expensive XP boosts and Orc followers in order to get closure for the story
 SHAME
Posted: 12 October
I'll keep my review simple
Also watch out for the spoilers(I rate this games features with plus and minus, 3 being the best/worst rating
)Pros:	++ ACT I & ACT II
+ 1 versus 1 combat is a pleasure, shame, because it doesn't happen too often
+++ Improved Nemesis system
++ Fortresses
 (unlocks at ACT II)+++ Pit Fights; There you order your followers to kill other orc captains in order to level up your fighter/follower
 (you also receive gear by winning fights)Really positive thing for this game, hope they would've focus more on this
 Like adding an online feature (like 1v1 other players)or customization for AI behaviour
(as watching these fights gets quite irritating after dozen of pit fights -- because of the Artificial Intelligence; turns out its horrendous)
 ++ Atmosphere and collectibles
++ SoundtrackCons:-- Feels like they rushed ACT III & IV (no real story behind these acts) and left the game without proper ending or late game grind
If the continuous sieges at ACT IV were intented as late game grind -- they have failed big time (besides min-maxing your fortresses)- Battling amidst multiple enemies can be/is frustrating when you try to focus your single target attacks to single enemy
(due to poor camera locking/focusing)- Climbing could be much more fluent, as it feels really clunky
- Spending long time listening to every new orc captain tell their mocks, threats and what-not -- as you can't skip it, well it starts to irritate slowly later on
-- Also turns out if you fight in Online Conquest your followers are gone for good if they die,don't do the same mistake as I did; if you can't afford to lose the followers, don't fight
*edit* Seems you lose them in *RANKED* Conquest, unranked doesn't count
--- Fortress sieges are real lackluster because the template is always the same: Capture few points (like Domination from CoD), kill few warchiefs and go slay the Overlord 1 v 1 -- then claim the fortress for yourself
 Spoiler: it gets boring real quick
Not to talk about the defending of fortresses: enemy AI is really terrible, in the end you may end up hunting some enemy warchief who is idling next to a wall doing nothing
 (happens quite often)Also you are unable to command your forces, they are at the mercy of a terrible AI -- too bad
-- Hoped it would have more regions than just these 5, also Minas Morgul isn't really active region in late game that is
Neutral:I wish the skill tree would've had more in-depth mechanics, but as it turned out it has very little to tell and feels hollow,however gearing in this game covers for this flaw by a little bit
Loot Boxes seems interesting but the variety of different loot boxes is just too slim to make me interested in
 (no cosmetics, nothing, just few different follower boxes, hope they do something about this)Also, as an AAA game I would've expected far more content, it feels like a lot at start, but later on you suddenly realize how little this game has to offer...
Overall for such game 60 dollars is too much I fear,there could've been so much more content and potential for this game,but they chose otherwise for some reason
I guess upcoming DLC's could cover for this flaw,until then I suggest waiting for sale
I'd give it a firm 7/10*edit*Some of you asked why I didn't give this game thumbs up;well I don't suggest you to buy this game for 60USD,as it doesn't offer enough content for the price;Story is short and leaves you graving for more,and the few side storylines it has to offer doesn't fill up the gap
Also I feel this game doesn't have real replayability -besides trying to beat it in Nemesis difficulty
If you feel you don't mind paying 60 USD for +40 hours of contentwith poor late game - go for it
My advice is to wait for GOTY or sale

Great game that improves on everythign Shadow of Mordor had, but paying 60$ for a full game only to find i need to spend more money for buy my way thru the game to the "real" ending is what made this a negative review
 :<
Posted: 31 May
Ok, so I'm more than halfway through Chapter 3 and I've seen enough to give an intelligent review
 In short, this game is good almost great
 I read all of the negative "professional" reviews and I feel like I've been playing an entirely different game then they did
 A couple things that keep kicking around in my head that I've heard them say is that the game does not respect your time
 I have found my experience to be the opposite of that
 The main missions can be played one after the other, without pointless fetch quests or some random "
" you must go discover
 The driving does take time, but what open world game doesnt make you traverse parts of it's land
 At least the fast travel works and only pushes a small amount of exploration onto the player
 If you love exploration however, there are plenty of places to go and see across all 3 maps
 You'll be rewarded one way or the other for taking the time to explore, but by no means is it necessary to progress the story
 The side quests I really enjoyed were the HVT (High Value Targets), it's a simple most wanted list that rewards you in currency for the kill
 The graphics are nice and the lighting from CryEngine 4 really does the scenery some justice
 The characters could have been done better, but when your staring at them from over 200M they do their job of portraying a soldier
 After playing The Witcher 3, I'm not sure we will see facial animations of that like until Cyberpunk 2077, so I simply just got over that short coming it did not impact my experience one bit
 Gunplay is solid and the guns feel responsive and require more skill than your COD guns
 They went for realism and as someone who has experience with firearms I can tell you they did great
 The sniping is the most engaging aspect and at higher difficulties (which I strongly recommend you to play at) is as real of a sniper experience as you can have
 Besides the sniping, I was almost even more impressed by the enemy AI
 They flanked and intelligently moved around structures and rarely ever came directly at me
 This again was at the higher difficulties, but nonetheless I've played plenty of shooters and nothing for me has compared to the level of intelligence this AI brings to the game
 In closure, the story is good enough, nothing that will blow you away, but I found it entertaining enough to want to keep progress and seeing how it would play out
 It does a solid job of setting up each mission and the mission variety is great
 It almost reminded me of Goldeneye 007 in its mission structure, don't ask me why lol
 I Havent really experienced any devastating bugs or glitches, but I am playing after the large patch that was issued recently
 The worst I've seen is that a few frags never exploded or the button to throw them bugged out
 If that's the worst then I'm fine with it, this is a sniper game after all and that part they nailed
If you like sniping sims then this is a game you have to check out
 Play it on at least Hard as the pure nature of this game benefits from that level of realism/challenge
 I hope this was helpful and good hunting

SummaryThe review section, oh dear
 Definitely not the game of 2017, but this is far, FAR from the disaster people make it out to be
 An extremely fun, challenging and rewarding game that I thoroughly enjoyed more than I should have
Unlock, upgrade and customise your gear to set out and traverse extremely large expansive maps
 Snipe enemies from afar, infiltrate secret bases, or use all out action to complete your objectives from any angle at any time
 If you aren't swayed by public opinions plus enjoy flawed yet fun games, snap this one up
 For COD fanboys and people who enjoy AAA chores, sorry this isn't for you
I'm Going InWho remembers the underrated IGI games
 Being a big fan of both, SGW3 feels like a true spiritual successor, so this title already tickles my pickle
Posted: 28 April
The professional review scores for this game are another example of games journalists/critics dogpiling extremely low scores on a AA game to balance out the unreasonably high scores they give AAA games with the same or greater flaws
 Is 'Sniper Ghost Warrior 3' one of the top games of 2017
 Of course not, it's a relatively generic open world headshot simulator with an awful campaign script / VO
 Is it a consistently fun gameplay experience that improves on its predecessors and illustrates a solid understanding by the developers of the experience its players are seeking
 Absolutely
 The weapons/gunplay here feel great, as does the movement and the rest of the gameplay in general
 Yes, the environments, story, and premise are as "B" tier as it gets, but if you came here simply to shoot a lot of guys in the head with weapons that feel good to aim and go boom then you will get your money's worth
Posted: 31 May
Pros:-Great sniping-Great movement-Decent weapon variety-Lots of replayability with a ton of side missions-Decent graphics-Good variety of mission layouts and plenty of options on how you want to approach a mission-Average story-Realistic and tactical game with bullet drop,wind and weapon recoil-Drone is polished and is fun to use to scout

Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 was a really good sequel to the other two predecessors
You can really feel, that City Interactive tried to implement things, which Sniper Ghost Warrior Fans wanted to see in the next game
One of these things were the tunnel'esque Levels from the predecessor and the Spotter, who always told you, who to shoot first
 They removed the spotter and developed 3 big areas, where you decide, who to shoot, when to shoot and how, or even IF you have to shoot
 That's where City Interactive copied the Formula, most of the Shooters nowadays have, and implemented a 3 class System; Sniper, Ghost and Warrior
 You get points on each style, when i
e killing someone with a sniper rifle, storming at the front with an assault rifle or sneaking from behind, avoiding detection and silently taking enemies out with the knife
You always get some points on each class during your missions, but you get more, when you act in a way
Also they implemented a very important feature for every Sniper Player: The paralax adjustment
Players from the predecessors know that issue: Always measure how far below the crosshair is the target
Aaand, you miss
 Always happened to me in Ghost Warrior 2 and it was annoying
In Ghost Warrior 3 you can now adjust your scope that it is aligned with the target you want to hit, even if it is Hundrets of metres away
 That is a big improvment on realism and fun; at least for my side
The Rifle-Repertoire is solid
 Nothing special, but enough to choose from
You get SVD's, 50
 cal Rifles, MSR's, SR-25's and more to choose from, but don't be surprised; due to copyright issues, the original or real names from the weapons aren't shown, so they have invented names
A thing which kills the immersion a little bit for me, but well, it not so bad for
Sure it is no Battlefield or Call of Duty, but you get Sniper Rifles for every range; 50 Cal's for long, MSR's for Mid-Range and VSS' for low ranges for example
Again nothing special but it gets the Job done
The same can be said to the sidearms and secondary weapons
Now we should come to the story
Even though City Interactive tried to invent a better storyline, they still failed to surpass the "cringey B-Movie'esque" Stories
 Every Ghost Warrior Player, who played the predecessors know, that the Ghost Warrior Games aren't known for their deep and meaningful stories, but at least the third part is not as cringey as the two games before
They tried to bring a touching story of two brothers in it, and for some moments you feel with them, if you are generous, but most of the time they stay dull
 The same can be said to the sidekicks; they stay dull and fulfill their roles in the story, but deep charater building is missing in that
 Don't expect an Metal Gear Solid, Deus Ex or The Last of Us
 Still, it is solid
The missions mostly are pretty repetitive: Gather intel, sneak into a building, killing a target, and the same again on an other level
 And the same can be said to the secondary missions
 Nothing special, but nothing bad either
 It gets the Job done
The AI is pretty dumb, but once alarmed they have an insane accuracy and kills you even hundrets of metres away with their Assault rifles
Now we should come to the last part: The Open World/Graphics/Sound
Graphics are thanks to the Cry Engine pretty good
 You have beautiful Sunrises/Sunsets, farsights on hills and amazing work of Details
 Especially the amount of Details to the rifles is pretty good, but the lack of character details is on the other hand dissapointing
You have 3 Areas, one urban/wood area, one Mountain, snowy area, and again a more woody area
All 3 are beatifull made, with outposts to eradicate, villages to visit and other points of interest to investigate, which is really fun to dive in thanks to the Cry Engine
Sounds are very good
 If you fire a shot, listening to footsteps, or staying in a forst, while a river is floating by, really catches the immersion of a living open world
All in all I really had a lot of fun in Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 and I don't regret Pre-Ordered that game
Veterans of the genre will find improvments, which were demanded from the community long ago, and thanks to the Open Style gamepaly and adjsutable difficulty even newbies can find some fun it, by running and gunning everyone down, or getting supported by long range shots
Even though it is still a Sniping game, and this should be the main focus to lay on; you will have fun, killing someone hundreds of metres away with a sniper rifle, or observing enemies wiht your scope, well to be a Sniper to be precise
Ghost Warrior Fans will love this game, but Battlefield/Call Of Duty-Players better stay away from that title
Posted: 7 May
To start things off, this is a game that I can't recommend at full price
 But if you like stealth games and sniping then it could still be a game worth renting or getting it later when it is on sale
So why can't I recommend it
Well first of all, the devs seem a bit unsure of what they wanted to do with the game, so there is not so much sniping as there is sneaking around with your silenced pistol
 It is in fact very similar to Far cry 3/4, but not as good as either of those
 You run around an open world, and there are these weird limitations that make npc's disappear after a certain range
 And this range varies from 150-700m
 For example, there was this one target at a cabin that I was planning on sniping from across a small lake
 So I send in the drone, mark everyone and set myself up
 But I was surprised to see that unable to see any of them
 And she did not load in until I got to about 150-200m
 Took a few steps back and she disappeared again
 So the number one feature of the game is ruined by these limitations, which really is a shame as the sniping is actually quite fun
Numerous crashes and relatively low performance for a game that does not have the most stunning graphics out there also does not help its already bad rep
 Had it been released in 2012 then it would have been acceptable overall, but it just feels outdated and in my opinon does not bring anything fresh or particularily interesting as a game experiece
 Which is a shame as I looked forward to it
Posted: 16 October
I'm not going to talk about the story, but the most important element in the game: distance
 I assume everyone play this game wants to experiance sinping a target over 1000 meters
 However, this game failed to deliver this experiance because of one problem: draw distance
 I want to make a 400m shot some place, not possible because the engine can't draw that far, even I marked the enemy with the drone
 I would like to ask the dev team, what the perpose of the scope a 32x magnification and 1000m distance adjusment when you can't see the target
With this single problem: I'm not really recommend this game because the title, is a bit misleading
 I would like to go back to SGW2 where I can made 1200m+ kills with a linear game play
Posted: 27 June
This game is just as terrible as any other City InterCraptive game ever made
I am Polish just like the City team
 I still recall the days of them making really crappy and very low budget titles which they were then selling at the newsagents for pennys
Now fast forward around 12yrs ahead and were getting Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 from them which budget was HUGE compared to anything they've ever done in the past
 Even with that in mind they still managed to mess this game up..
 after delaying it 3 times to "make sure it's as finished as possible"
 Yep, sure..
It simply is a buggy mess and not a game
 Map options aren't working at all, as all you can do with it is move it around and zoom in and out
 Setting a waypoint option is constantly greyed out which means you can't ever set it up on the map, doesn't matter whether you're using a controller or mouse & keyboard
 You can't turn the map legend either
 It's not greyed out like the waypoint option but you still can't use it
It is a sniper game yet enemies are disappearing completely if they're further away than around 250m from them which InterCraptive devs cite as the CryEngine limitation
 Funnily though at certain points in the game they're clearly visible from even as far as 500m away, but these places are really few
 How can you make a sniper game and make enemies in it disappear after a mere 250m
 That's just a total BS
They cited the CryEngine limiting it on pretty much every occasion, but how come I just finished Homefront: The Revolution and a while back replayed all three Crysis games which all also run on CryEngine and I was easily taking enemies out from distances greater than these 250m as they weren't disappearing :x
 That's simply BS as City InterCraptive is simply stuck in their era of making terribly low budget shooters and their dev team seems to simply be unexperienced and untalented and even a huge budget won't change it
On top of that they're literally mocking their customers :x
 I've made a thread about a sub-par performance on my i7 6700K coupled with GTX 1070 and all I've got in response was that it: "Works good on one of the devs laptops" with some stupid laughing emojis
Graphically while looking better than Ghost Warrior 2 it still seems like they're either using some sort of a terribly cut version of the CryEngine or, and that's more probable given that all their games are seriously unfinished and buggy, they don't have a clue on how to work with it
 It's not getting close to the graphical quality of Homefront or any of the Crysis games even by 10%
 Which is ridiculous given that it runs on a CryEngine version much newer than the one used in the 1st Crysis game which came out over 8yrs ago
I could keep on going with the list of other bugs in this game but I don't want to waste any more time on even writing about this piece of crap
Absolutely avoid this game if you can, even on super-duper sales
Posted: 16 May
Finished
Took my time and stealthed as much as possible, explored (but not enough) and can render my verdict
PROS: -Beautiful terrain
Having spent some time in Georgia, CI did at least attempt to convey that feel, at least
The big town with the wedding church
Yeah, that exists, almost a perfect match
-The path you take to accomplish your objective was not laid out for you
You had to plan your route well
Not just once did I have to backtrack to accomplish my task because I failed to properly scout the enemy situation or the impassibility of terrain
 That's a nice challenge
-Sound was well-done
 With so much taking place at night, sound was important, and saved me a few times
-Textures of buildings, guns and places was very good
-Lighting and shadows
Cryengine is good for these, and CI made good use of it
-The story
Some people say there was only the most basic story
This was true to an extent
However, what it does do well is hold the whole package together, and keep you enfranchised in what is happening to the people and yourself
For me, it inspired the desire to keep going and fight more of the good fight
Had they only cobbled a bunch of missions together, I might not have enjoyed it as much
-Frequent checkpoints (for reasons which I will detail under cons)
-Finally, the sniping mechanics
CI has done this to perfection in all Ghost Warrior games now, as well as in a game I wager many have not played,, but should: Enemy Front
They OWN sniping in the gaming world
CONS: -Character rendering was awful
Lydia and virtually every other NPC had a washed out, emotionsless, pastel look to their faces
Much more detail could have been done..
it's Cryengine 4
Go back and look what Crytek did in Crysis 3 with Cryengine 3
Their clothing was only slightly better detailed than the faces
-Several places my character got stuck in terrain or fell inside the geometry
Luckily my last checkpoints were recent
-At great distances, zooming in with the scope sometimes resulted in enemy soldiers disappearing
Thankfully it was a part-time bug or I would not have gotten my 563m record shot
-One of the patches took away my ability to repair rifle silencers
CI being who they have always been though, were super-responsive, and issued a rollback patch within 2 days
-The savegame bug
I only mention this because so many had it
Because of this, I ended every sesssion making a backup copy of the save file and config file
It turns out, I did not need it
I never once encountered this bug, thankfully
But thanks to my fellow gamers making this known, I would have been prepared
 Overall, this game was a blast
It is fairly unforgiving, and is definately in the more "realism" mode than Sniper Elite 4 (which I also enjoy very much)
Completing my missions did not always feel pre-ordained, and that is a good thing
The pros outweighed the cons and I think this is a must play

Massive improvement over Ghost warrior 2..
really not as bad as people are making out
 It's basically a sniper based Farcry
I like sniper games and I like Farcry
So this game gets my recommendation, though obviously not up to some peoples overly high expectations
The way I see it is, this game costs 40
 If you watch a movie at the cinema, you pay 10 minimum for a film that may or may not entertain you for 2 hours
 So if I can get at least 8 hours out of this then I can't really complain
I happily and quite easily spend 50 on a night in the pub (including taxi ride etc) and all I get out of it is a bad head in the morning
 So if you're anthing like me and value entertainment per  you can't really go wrong with this

Immersive & trying // Recommended for those that cherish depth & complexity*I recommend this particularly for its multiplayer
+ Extremely mod friendly; enjoys full support from the Steam Workshop+ Visuals & environmental design, save for a few issues here and there (i.e
 empty buildings), has largely aged well & looks fantastic+ Employs a deeply challenging level of realism+ Multiplayer is still very active; boasts a wonderful variety of gameplay & modded servers to choose from+ Long, content-packed single player campaign; player choices do affect potential endings, as there are several+ Time control is back from Arma 2; player can speed up the passage of time, which helps SIGNIFICANTLY to combat the monotony of walking/running very long distances between objectives+ Enormous map/playable area+ User-created scenarios & a very easy-to-use scenario creator+ Boasts incredibly varied gameplay mechanics; from piloting/driving myriad vehicles & gunships, to underwater missions, & everything in-between+ Map & squad mechanics are back; while they may feel clunky to use in a combat scenario, a little practice goes a long way & serves to open up a slew of options on the battlefield- Sound design is very hit & miss; some weapons sound identical to others, & vehicle sound effects tend to sound strangely muted- Dialogue is also hit & miss; while I found the voice-acting to be done largely well, some of the dialogue is a bit awful- Soundtrack often felt cheesy or inappropriate- Mission pacing often feels very uneven; I felt that it often leaned too far into the realm of the tedious in the interest of realism (shouldn't be a bad thing in theory, but for the pruposes of a video game, it can put players to sleep in some missions)- The initial learning curve is considerable, & the tutorial felt inadequate overall; mechanics are amazing on paper, but take an inordinate amount of time to masterLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit

This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things
 Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality
 There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release
One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s
As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon
 We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols
 Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower
There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower
 I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position
 But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed
As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered
 I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head
 I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols
 After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention
 I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive
Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command
 I had done it
 I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive
That is what this game is about

Oh man
 Where to even begin with this one
 It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that
 Arma 3 is a military simulator
 This is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved
 But its even more than that
 Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come
 At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim
 The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together
 New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter
 Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise
 There is no handholding here
 No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars
 If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched
 While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style

My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever
We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces
 I'm leading a team of 4 men
 We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back
 I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers
 Nothing
I run, my Autorifleman runs, my Medic runs
 But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across
Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through
 Remember the sniper scene
The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down
 He then takes two more in the chest
 The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here
He screams as he's being shot
 Crawling, drenched in his own blood
"SARGE
 YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT
 I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS
 C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME
 C'MON
 PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME

I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides
 I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides
 It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty
 Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life..
Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target
 Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision
 I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving
 The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life
 haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D

Having accumulated over 13400 hours in-game with Arma 3, I would certainly recommend it to others
 If you enjoy tactical shooters and playing online with friends, it's well worth a look; especially if you appreciate a high dose of military realism

Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this
You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have
 But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game
Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away
 You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly
Arma is a game which you can never called finished
 There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations
 Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem
I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back

One day my daughter came home from school and asked me "Have people actually travelled to the Moon
How is it possible
"Two years ago, I would have answered "yes, but I don't really know how
It's very complicated, with lots of math and science
You might learn about it in a physics class in 10 years time
"Instead, I answered "Here, let me show you
" and fired up Kerbal Space Program
We built a moon rocket and launched it, me steering and she hitting the separation detonation buttons when needed
30 minutes later we had landed on the moon
Thank you, Squad, for enabling me to give that answer

Love this game to bits
 - Developers output updates semi-often (couple months between them) and none of them ruin the game in any way
- Absurd amounts of content that make the game very well worth the hefty pricetag
- Mod-compatible (although they are not on the steam workshop)- A very friendly community
 Easily one of the best I've seen
- Well-polished physics that (hopefully) won't bug out on you much
 For a 3D physics-based game, it works astoundingly well
- If you're interested in the science and physics part of the game, it can be fairly math-based, which is probably good if you're into science and physics anyways
Issues:- Very hard to understand at first
 I'll admit to watching 3 let's plays about KSP before knowing how to play it
- UI and controls are a bit confusing
 They get more comfortable later on, but at the start it's frustrating
- Takes a good amount of previous knowledge
Get to know the game and it's really enjoyable
 I'd highly recommend going on youtube if you don't understand it

My 8 year old son broke away from Minecraft today
 He sat on my lap while we made a rocket
 He asked questions about rockets
 We made it into space and he asked, "Are we in space
" We came down and the friction caused our heat shield to glow
 His eyes were wide open as we slowed down
 We pressed the space bar to deploy our parachutes but were going too fast and our chutes failed
 We crashed and he asked if the kerbal was OK
 I said yes as I hit ESC and went back to the VAB and changed a few things
 A few minutes later, we landed our capsule safely and he had the biggest smile on his face
 I haven't heard a word about Minecraft since
 Thank you for making this wonderful game

Words alone cannot express how amazing KSP is
To be honest, this is not a game for everyone
If you are in the market for some fast-paced "space combat sim" with all kinds of weapons and big explosions, then this isn't what you are looking for
(Except for the big explosions..
 KSP has you covered there)
However, if you ever dreamed of actually being an astronaut, this is definitely for you
If you sometimes forget to breath when watching recordings of the Apollo moon landings, this is definitely for you
If precise, measured flying; careful planning; and delta-v budgeting are what drives you, this is definitely for you
If you want to learn about Orbital Mechanics and are dying to know what the Oberth Effect or a Hofman Transfer Orbit are, this is definitely for you
 If you like Physics, this is definitely for you
Optionally, if you just like building rediculously large rockets and watching them explode with glorious comedy when they fail catastrophically because you forgot ONE PART..
 then this is also definitely for you
Kerbal Space Program is challenging, fun, frustrating, mind boggling, huge, hilarious, complicated, deep, and just plain awesome
Posted: 15 June
"See that little grey circle in the night sky, impossibly far away
 You can go there
">Spend the next few hours building and testing rockets, trying to get one into orbit
 Laugh at all the explosions, and the ever-increasing body count
 Realize you have no idea how orbital mechanics work
>Research how actual rockets achieve an orbit, maybe watch a Youtube video
 Maybe take a step back and spend a few hundred hours just exploring your home planet with a plane or rover
>Get into orbit
 Realize you have no idea how to get to the moon
 Research a whole different type of orbital mechanics
>Get to the moon
 Realize parachutes don't work
>Land on the moon, more-or-less in one piece
 Realize there's another moon, a bunch of other planets, asteroids that you can capture and bring into orbit, resources that you can harvest into rocket-fuel on the surface of other planets, AND an amazing modding scene that can infinitely more gameplay

As a Physics student I never quite understood entirely Classical Mechanics till I met Jebediah Kerman
 He taght me everything, the real thing, he became de facto my true master and I couldn't be more grateful for what he did for me
 We became best buddies, he gave me courage to continue with my studies
 I can't recall how many long nights have we spent exploring other worlds completely drunk and having existencial talks
 Though, I never quite understood a damn word of what he said
 I love this guy to death
 I would die if something ever happened to him..
 RIP Jebediah (for the 42th time)

1st hour playing: WHAT DO I DO WHY IS IT BLOWING UP400th hour playing: If my calculations serve me right with this T/W ratio It will take me 1 minute 43 seconds to burn at my periapsis to reach duna insertion at which point I will get into an eliptical equatoral orbit and perform an aerobrake at 16km to get into a steady circular orbit and then I will descend with one of my 4 spaceplanes I took to go to the north pole at which I will set up base at my already existing rover while getting TAC resources to monitor life support and make sure my colony of 212 kerbals can live
11/10Edit because for some reason this gained popularity, proper review:Pros:Endless fun, so much to do
 Bored of building rockets
 Build a space plane
 Fed up of the mun
 Go to Duna
 Don't want to leave the atmosphere
 Build whatever you want
 The list goes on
Fantastic modding community and fantastic mods
 So much more expansion on an already amazing game
Fantastic community in general, some of the nicest people I've met have came from this game
 They are such a helpful bunch and I'm glad I'm with them
 They'll most likely love to help you
 There's also a bunch of fantastic YouTubers such as Scott Manley and others..
 (too many to name) :)YOU CAN LEARN STUFF FROM THIS AND GAIN NEW INTERESTS
 Before I played this I had no interest in space or space exploration whatsoever but now I actively follow space news and am quite knowledgable on the subject
 I have also learnt a fantastic deal of orbital mechanics just from playing and learning the game
Cons:The engine and optimisation
 This game uses Unity and it only uses 1 CPU core
 This can be a major problem if running a multicore with low clock speed
 The 32bit version of the game is a whole lot more stable but limits your RAM meaning that if you have a ton of mods you can run into a lot of crashes but thankfully there are mods out there such as ATM (Active Texture Management) and texture replacer to limit the amount of RAM the game uses
 64bit as of now is still pretty unstable with mods
The learning curve and tutorials
 The learning curve on this game is huge, I'm not complaining much about this one as rocket science isn't exactly easy is it
 You can learn from trial and error and it's how I learnt alot but some things you just have to read up about or watch a tutorial on youtube
 There isn't really much of a tutorial in game either
Conclusion: Buy it
 It's really fantastic

A great game if you know what you're doing
 If you don't know what you're doing, it becomes mindless fun involving explosions and terrified astronauts

To remove any doubts, this is by far THE best space simulator out there
 The Good Amazing learning experience Choose where you want to go, with what, when, and how
 HUGE planets to discover, literally, thousands upon thousands of kilometers to walk, drive, or fly your epic creations (or, if your not very creative, preset or other players' ships) Create awesome rockets, landers,ore collection/ astronaut housing bases on other planets, and spaceplanes, the way you want them Fun science mode to work your way up, earning "science" in order to get better equipment and rocket parts (I recommend for newish players who know at least basic orbits / how to get to the Mun) "Creative" mode where all parts are unlocked (great for testing and trying new things) "Career" mode for those really wanting a challenge (balance economy, science, and reputation for your own space organization, I recommend having a little more experience before jumping right in) The Career mode adds A LOT of purpose to the game, as well as adding new challenges such as having to make landings in certain locations, sending satellites in specific orbits, making space stations at specific altitudes, placing a flag on a certain body, collecting ore from a planet, etc
 They are still adding to this game..
 Additionally, there are several user created mods that really expand on the experience, adding new parts or game mechanics
 Built off of real physics
 One doesn't just lop space junk up into the sky; one must deliver that space junk the realistic and correct way, thus rendering Kepler and Newton proud
 (generally speaking, it allows one to see how actual launches and orbits work in the real world) Many other great aspects to this game (however, this would be a long list with all of them)The Bad Graphics aren't the best, however, they are still good and create a real sense of depth and can deliver a "lost-in-space" kind of a feel..
 It makes me feel so small compared to the vastness of our world
 Plus, the graphical style really fits the style of the overall game
Somewhat steep learning curve- It took me a while to learn to get to the "Mun
" After this achievement, it was a lot easier to get to Minmus after this
 It was difficult to get to Duna, however, once I got there, I have gradually learned enough to go pretty much anywhere and have made a permanent base on Laythe complete with science lab, crew pod and a brand spanking new air breathing engine jet transport, as well as a souped up Rover for them to drive
 I have been to almost all of the planets
 So basically, it takes time to get "good" at this game, but I assure you, it's rewarding and so spectacular to see how huge this world is (And this one is scaled down, too
)
 However, new tutorials should be very helpful for the beginner
not too much music (it's still good, just gets repetitive sometimes) (*ahem* devs please add more music)
Getting to further out planets can take a long time, because it is a little more difficult and takes more resourcefulness..
 (several hours if your like me and really take your time, especially if you send a 3 manned mission to Eeloo..
 [you'll get faster the more experience you get though])Overall, this is a wonderful simulator offering a lot of real science with fun, providing lots of hours of engaging gameplay
 I am so happy the developers have successfully brought this amazing game out of beta
 I have purchased this game so long ago, and the updates have vastly improved the game and have solved many of the problems I have dealt with
 Thank you for reading this book of a review, and I hope this really helps
 Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions, I have over 400 hours logged and played the demo for several hours
 I will try to get to them as soon as possible
 Happy Kerballing

I'm re-writing my review to go more in depth as to why this is not a hunting sim and more of a hunting arcade game
 I will also list some reasons why the game is "broken" and not getting good reviews at this time
 This game fails at being a simulator for many reasons and I'm sure I will not list all of them but I will do my best to point out the biggest issues my friends and I had
 Animals & AI- There are just too many animals honestly for this to be a simulator
 They are EVERYWHERE
 A hunting simulator should require a bit of patience and planning on the hunters behalf ,however, in this game you can just sprint around and wait until you hear a "warning call" from an animal then go into stealth mode and call it in or stalk it
 The worst thing about the AI I feel is that you can shoot at an animal and the other animals around it and yourself only run away a short distance and can be called right back after a very short time
 By very short I'm talking less than 10 seconds in some instances
 The game needs a longer "spook" timer and range
 Animals should run further away and be gone for 10-30 minutes
 There are also cases of animals running in circles right in front of you
 Weapon system/ballistics and shot placement- Something that gets me personally is that the ballistics in this game are completely made up and garbage, let me explain
 Animals in the game have an integrity bonus which is there to stop you from using larger more powerful weapons on smaller animals which is fine but the weapons they have that can cause you to get that 0% bonus are very off
 For example using a 
270 on deer will give you 0% integrity bonus
 This seems very silly to me as many people hunt deer with a 
270 and many even use a 30-06 these are both extreamely common deer hunting rifles
 Yet at the same time you can take that 
270 and shoot an elk in the head and have it bleed at a "very low" rate and have to track it for 10 minutes
 This should obviously be a critical wound
 Another big issue I have with this is that if you shoot an animal in the legs or any bone used in walking and it doesn't stop the animal from running
 I have shot a deer with that 
270 which they claim is just so overpowered for deer and gives you a 0% integrity bonus in 3 different legs and the pelvis bone and it was able to RUN from me
 Now for shot place-ment
 The game is overly picky about where you shoot an animal
 Taking that same overpowered 
270 that just ruins your deer to the point you get a 0% integrity bonus and shooting near the heart should drop the deer dead in it's tracks if it were so damaging but it doesn't and the deer will still run off and force you to track it
 You must shoot a direct shot into the heart to get that instant kill
In theory you should be able to take one of the biggest guns either the 7mm or the 
338 and shoot a deer in the neck and drop it on the spot but you can't you will still have to track it
 Finally shooting doesn't place bullet holes on animals
 It just doesn't make sense to me and it seems like they took everything they learned while making The Hunter Classic and tossed it out the window on this game
Night Hunting- Night hunting should not be in the game
 It is illegal in most places as well as hunting with artificial light
 They could fix this by not allowing you to shoot before/after certain hours in game while still allowing you to travel or track an already shot animal
 They could allow you to shoot an animal at night if you are attacked by it while traveling or tracking
Bugs- The game has a lot of bugs currently
 Some of them are minor and some are in my opinion game breaking
 A few bugs I can think of are a small window pop up that is blank and says Press F1 for more info
 The box blocks some of your view and is more of an annoyance than anything
 Weapons, callers, and such will disappear from your hands randomly
 This is really bad when you're changing from a caller to your rifle to kill that animal you just spent 20 minutes calling in only to find out your rifle is randomly missing
 Sometimes you will crouch to sneak around and just randomly die
 You might shoot an animal only to have it freeze in place this sounds silly but really breaks immersion
 You might kill an animal only to have it disappear in front of you
 You might shoot an animal to have it stop bleeding in the middle of tracking it
 At times you will buy something from the shop and it won't be in your storage or inventory, I feel this one sucks because things in the game are pretty expensive to begin with
 Your flashlight has no effect on animals
 Panning while looking in binoculars if very slow whiled zoomed out
 There are areas on the map which are bugged and will cause large mixed herds of animals to spawn at times there may be a mix of 50 animals in one area again this one breaks immersion
 In multiplayer only the host can interact with landmarks, claim outposts, and build stands
 Entering a stand while another player is in it will kill you
 Desync issues where people who join your game can't see animals and at times can see and shoot them but when they collect the animal they recieve no xp or money
 This is by no means a full list of bugs but it's long enough and I pointed out some of the more crucial ones that I am aware of
Now for the most heated and debated topic yet
 Microtransactions/DLC
 This company said back in the beggining they would not have "microtransactions"
 Which was great as The Hunter Classic had a ton and really turned people off
 They said this game would be a one time pay game
 So what happens shortly after launching the game
 They put out "DLC" instead
 You get people who say that microtransactions and DLC are two different things
 Myself and others will agree that they are the same thing under a different name when it comes down to it
 Paying for additional content
 Some say that microtransactions are typically small and/or temporary and are usually cheap and may give an advantage during gameplay and DLC is usually a fair amount of content like a new map or missions and once you pay for them they are permanent and can be pricey
 Now from my personal experience I have seen things from one category fall into the other countless times
 Skins, cosmetics, teleport stones, pets, and access to new areas in a game all permanent and being sold as microtransactions
 I have seen DLC sold anywhere from a large new map full of creatures and content (Ark: Scorched Earth for example) to a few weapons or skins in a pack
 So what do we have for "DLC" in The Hunter: Call of the Wild
 Tents and blinds for $3
99 which basically breaks down to $1
99 each
 I would hardly call it a "large" amount of content, it does give players an advantage to quickly be in an area, and also change the time of day so they can be in spawn zones when they spawn without much downtime
 This leads to my conclusion that if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it's a duck
 The issue here is that either one can be called the other
 I am quite sure the company knew they would be releasing DLC and should have said so
 You may call it what you like
 You may buy it if you like
 Many others will not
Long story short I suggest people stay away from this one for another 6 months or a year and check back to see if this company has got itself together
 Hopefully that is long enough as they have been very slow at bug fixes and seem to have no troubles getting out "DLC"
 We would all like to see this game succeed but it's currently in a questionable state

Nice game to kill a few hours and even a few deer and bison while your at it..
(Only if you master the ways of the hunter of course and dont stomp like bigfoot through the vegetation)
 Pretty realistic from what i can tell, i dont care to shoot animals IRL, but I'm happy to indescriminatley shoot any furball that moves in Hunter COTW
 The graphics and sounds are well executed and it is nice to walk through the long varying maps stalking your prey or just taking that opportunistic
shot at a deer grazing peacefully in the distance..
 BAM
 Spine shot, bambi is now offically venison..
That being said, when you have enough of all the trudging through the forrests and mountains, the recent ATV DLC is really a must have that should be part of the main game and not stand alone DLC
 And this is where I have to line up my sights and take a headshot at the dev team (Sorry, pun city i know..
cringe) 
 Damn you are a greedy bunch of..
The Tents,bivies and ATV DLC - This stuff simply should not be DLC - For the price of the main game, this should be included as standard
 I reluctantly bought the game at its price and also the DLC but i have been disappointed with the DLC and pricing
 Not a cool move guys..
especially the tents/bivies DLC
 The ATV DLC is barely excusable as it does
add another small dynamic to the game but even still, it shouldnt be DLC
 Surely offering new maps or enhanced weapons packs or better ATV, bivies etc but taking core elements out and charging as DLC is a bad bad move
Another major gripe is that there doesnt appear to be any Modded content available..
this game could be so much better if the community were able to build mods etc
 However the buisness plan appears to be" squeeze the customer", sad really as they have a good game that could probably grow so much more with modded support
 Do i recommend
No
 I cant recommend the game given the direction the devs went around mod support and DLC
 If you are into hunting IRL and are looking for a decent game, well then this is probably going to be for you anyway...
 But if you have a passing interest in this concept, then wait for another dev to release something similar or else at least wait for a sale as you will need the ATV DLC
 Hopefully another dev comes along and builds on the Hunter COTW concept without the greed and lack of mod support
 This is a nice game thats been well made and i would like to recommend but just feel like i cant given the greedy DLC move and lack of mod support

Disclosure - I am British, non-gun user, non-hunter and have no desire to ever do this IRL
This version of the franchise has been getting a bit of flack from buyers, especially after the first DLC, due to it seemingly straying away from it's original purpose which was to provide an alternative to those who are wouldn't be the most out of the pay per season model of the original game
I brought the game as this wave of negativity started, and it might have been justified in parts, there seemed to be a slightly cynical way in which the DLC was being put out
But, since then, personally I feel the Devs have been excellent in listening to feedback, adjusting the sale strategies and the regular patches have been coming in to get rid of the wrinkles and creases
PROS:Beautiful to look atGood implimentation of multiplayerPlenty to do for someone who dips in and outHas a good balance between sim and less serious game
CONS:Some missions can be a bit of a choreMake a few assuptions on only being played by people who already know about huntingThe animal types in the two maps are quite similar in style (minus the bears)
It's been nice to wander around a take a shot at antlered beasties every now and then, I feel like it's making a very bad user of mouse and keyboard get ever so slightly better without the pressure that most FPSs would have
I even feel a bit more confident going into a PUBG game after warming up on here for a bit (that feeling lasts about one round)
I get why there are some criticisms of the DLC, but I think that is being addressed, and for me the price of adding these packs is minimal to what I have happy sunk into games like Destiny etc
I am not saying the method they are using is perfect but it's not bank breaking and I think a few some who are being the most vocal about this stuff are probably being a bit over the top considering the very transistional period the games industry seems to be lumbering through
For me, the biggest negative has been sticking points with some of the missions
It's perfectly possible to just play without them but they have been good to show me some of the different things in the game to do (I would have never tried night hunting otherwise)
But there are some early missions that are exceptionally challenging to complete without items that take a considerable amount of time to level up enough to buy
There is still plenty to do while you wait but for me I just wanted to fire up the game, do a mission and the get back to work, playing something else
Once I unlocked a new more powerful rifle though this became less of an issue, mainly due to opening up the larger animals as sandbox prey
Future maps with a bit more landscape and animal variety would be the icing on the cake - as there were 2 included with the 25 pound base game I think an extra 7 for each would be fair for new ones but we'll have to wait an see
With the pretty nice photo mode too it doesn't just rely on the shooting of digital things, which is nice
 Hey, this game clearly isn't for everyone and I get the impression people will either get it regardless of review or not
And it's pretty packed with stuff so covering every aspect in a short(ish) review is tough
I brought it after looking at many, many free to play (with hidden costs), cheaply made and priced or more arcade-y style games - I feel I made a good choice
Now to just wait for that Just Cause/theHunter crossover game
(Isn't that just Farcry though
)

This will be detailed review by person who was hunting in Real Life and played almost all hunting sims for pc to date
If You want join our Hunting Club too: http://steamcommunity
com/groups/GPVHC--------------------------Preword:I hunted with my Dad years ago, just ..
 thank You Devs
 It is perfect software, not only Game, just bring more stuff and continue to develop, it's like on real hunting with my dad years, years ago
 Nothing can be compared to this game
 The Hunter, Cabela, Deer Hunter, Hunting unlimited, they died today
 Best hunting experience in history of computer gaming
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=873221433 It's completely relaxing just to hear pines waving on the wind somwhere over Rotwald area, listening to rain, storm, forest, just close eyes and have that short break on digital nature during day
 For real it's best audio-video application for PC and when it comes to give true nature feeling
Call of the Wild is beyond any competition for years
 It's great to turn this game on for a few minutes during workday and relax
 Not to mention You can easily spend hours and have enormous fun during hunting here
Night hunts or ability to seamless walk/trek/hunt/ in 24 hour cycle is great and going after wounded animal through dark forest is da bong
 Especially when you chase wounded 400 kg wild boar in dense forest around midnight..
Feelings , presentation and realism are above perfect
 If you have ever been on real hunt just buy it
 Game have some UI bugs in menu but it will be fixed with 1 or 2 patches
 No other problems
Shooting and tracking are real - it works exactly the same in Real life - some hunts are very easy some are long and no outcome - but for real hunter most important is respect for nature and harmony with it - this game as only one in pc gaming history gives that well
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=885527159 Night hunts are just thrilling - imagine rural field after harvests at midnight , full moon and you on the hunting tower watching pack of wild boars roaming the field after mouses and seeds 
Yes You have head lamp and if You miss vitals or hit [like in real life] big boar it can run good hundreds of meters after
Searching for animal at night are just amazing
 Check my uploaded screenshots to understand 
YES YOU CAN TURN OFF ALL HELPERS [ very detailed and lot of options to
choose from 
 ] and act like in RL
To say more i just forget after few minutes that im playing a game [35 years old here] and feel like in archive movie from one of my hunts in real life
 All works the same - animals reacts different , depends when bullet hits, etc
 Together with video-audio work of art presentation it makes amazing job
 No one ever bring so much real poetry in digital gaming presentation of nature than Expansive Worlds did here
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=885502542 This game have so many features that it will be very hard to describe them all
 And all of them are well tested and realized in the game
 If You ask yourself "is that feature is here
" - answer YES it is
 http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=885844967 If you are looking for ethic game about hunting to interest your kids or friends with hunting it's best title ever released
 There is no better PC program that can awake love to the nature than this game [and please all eco terrorists who don't even know what real hunting is about just shut up and keep chains around trees still
as simplest hunter did more to ecosystem and nature than band of ecologist through whole their life] 
Details are just breathtaking 
 Shoots are dependable by range, wind, position, after unlocking some skills and perks [ great by the way , very good mechanics and very real too 
 ] 
 Someone really knows how to present real hunting
And if you only have occasion just listen to Pines waving on strong wind at Rotwald mountians at first reserve
 Did i mention that leaves flying from trees depend on which driection wind is flowing
 Good
 http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=885526048 Forget about The Hunter - just sink into this title and beg Devs to develop it further [its just great joy to simply walk in this game] - personally i will pay for all DLC for it , and im sure we get some free dlcs too
You are like on real hunt here in Call of the WIlds , im playing on I5 Haswell, 16gb Ram and 1060 Geforce , all on ultra and high - and trust me - stable FPS around 50-60 , and DAT FEELING along with excellent sounds [you will hear very high range of nature sounds, different for each bush, plants, grass, day and night or even part of day or night ] 
 There is NO DIFFERENCE in visual or sound presentation with normal, real life hunt
Im completely shocked - Light in this game works like in real life too , you will almost feel wet cold mornings, warm sunsets, scary storms
 Just like in real life simple walking through woods [hello no one generic fragment of land, each is handplaced and designed like real life, no boring terrain all over the map]
About bugs - i havent noticed any in game about what is essential - hunting , tracking, playing 
There are small and very minor buggies with UI but it will be easily solved by small patches so really screw negative reviews
 If You are hunting in real life, if You love nature, if You hunted long ago, if You are interested in hunting, if You are looking for best looking game on PC , if You are looking for intelligent and enormous hunting application , if You are looking for enjoyable multiplayer hunts [not so embarassing like in the hunter online - all is really better here ] - JUST GO BUY and THANK Devs for realizing every hunter dream 
 http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=885651194 ABOUT "BUGS" : Shortly: Leave bugs to vegans and keep hunting and eating meat instead
Longer:And please stop listening people about shooting - it works exactly like in rl life - not only shooting [wind guess [after perk - eralier by observing nature], magnitude setup [after perk] but a way of the bullet mechanics after the hit
If someone never shoot on real hunt he just simple can't understand that hit which lands on "soft" part of the animal only wounds it and make a lot of pain and hunter is obliged to track it even 2 days with dogs
 If You want to score animal learn to shoot and read some hunting books
 Devs here are one of most dedicated and involved in gaming industry and their fame for long supporting of titles is well known, just look at older brother theHunter Classic
And i bet this wonderfull game, Call of the Wild will become it's successor
There are many "headshooters" from stupid fps games around here , who never hold and fire from real gun
 Trust me this game is as close to real shooting and hunting as it can be
 Not only visually [dat scopes GOD
 almost smell rubber near eye] , but what is most important from shooting mechanic
 There is Bullet drop, wind , calibre and power incorporated and very smart and real hit system
SO ALL OF YOU COD/CS SONS GO SCREW YOURSELF KIDOS
See You in the wilds 
Developers please keep this game supported and developed in next years as it's best and most realistic hunting experience ever created
 I will gladly pay for future DLCs, and remember about some freeLC too
 Just give us more of eveything in next years and we have a deal

Pros:Beautiful relaxing scenery to exploreHuge open world (50sq miles)Has multiplayer to play with your friendsSome nice free DLCCons:Can be tricky to find animals (but thats realism should be)Can't have mutliple save filesATV DLC should already be in the gameOverall:Perfect game if you love viewing beautiful scenery and appreciating nature but also being able to see and shoot up some animals
5/5 - Loved it so much that I also bought a copy for my friend :3My name is Coyote Peterson, be brave, stay wild
 I'll see you on the next adventure
Posted: 19 February
This is my first review of a game, but I though this game deserved a review as it's been getting a lot of negative reviews that are unwarranted in my opinion
 I live in South Africa and have been hunting a couple of times before and it's something I enjoy
 What I enjoy about hunting is that you go out into wide open spaces of beautiful nature
 You have to patiently stalk your prey, following spoor (tracks), looking at their dung, checking that you're not upwind
 It's not easy, and some days you can go the whole day without even getting close to having a shot at your prey
So in context of this game, I never thought I'd ever find or enjoy any hunting game that gives me the same thrill as I get in real life
 But I was wrong
 This game does really well in making you feel like you're in this beautiful nature reserve with some of the best graphics and sound design I've seen in a game
 It really is stunning
 I often just stare at a beautiful sunrise or a strong gust of wind blowing leaves off the trees around me
 The beautiful world you get to play in alone is worth the asking price for this game
The actual hunting part has been done extremely well
 In this game I've felt like it really is quite close to hunting in real life
 Patience is key
 Checking wind direction, following tracks, listening for your prey's sounds, looking at your prey's dung etc
 has been really well thought out and implemented
 It can take hours to find and hunt the prey you're looking for, but it feels worth it
 I've seen a lot of people complain about bugs in their reviews, and I have seen a couple, but none of them were game breaking in my opinion
 If that is what is holding you back from buying this game, then let me assure you, it's not that bad
 The bugs aren't that major, and I have to say that it runs extremely well on my machine
 My settings are all cranked up and I'm running a GeForce 970, 8GB RAM, Intel i5 2500k processor, and have experienced no lag or crashes
If you want a game to get lost in, that takes time and patience, that is beautiful and realistic, then give this a go
 I hope they bring out an African map in a future DLC

"No microtransactions anymore

 Content that was already in the old game no less
 This should've been free
Posted: 14 September
Where IRL meets fantasy gaming Really, the outdoors experience in this open world sand box hunting sim is so like being in the great outdoors that most sessions I forget Im gaming
 I often even forget the fact that Im looking for achievements in the game
 And, for a gamer who enjoys the thrill of capturing every single achievie, thats a big deal
 It is the total world immersion that makes the experience of COTW so impressive
 Ive only been playing for 3 weeks, but at the time of writing the review I have 60% of the achievements and almost 200 hours in game
 I am already the Hero of Hirschfelden and Lord of the Lakes because Ive explored the total area of both maps
 (*Mumbles to self in monologue-ing voice: I like that
 Yes I like that very much
) The missions are challenging enough that it will be awhile before I finish them all
 So, time in game is almost unlimited
 I cant see a stopping point yet
UPDATE: Edited to remove problem with using 2nd monitor, since the latest patch 1.11
2 this works just fine
 Thanks EW for the frequent updates & for listening to the community needs
 Story Lore/ Music & Sound:I often think of the game as a mountain climbing sim with hunting opportunities
 Of course, thats because Ive often wished for a sim for climbing mountains
 And, the challenge of discovering all the sights modeled after real-life geographical landforms: archipelago, butte, canyon, gorge, volcano, and much more, is all very alluring
 But, many natural points of interest are integrated into the maps, providing a history or lore to these fictional maps that matches their real-life counterparts
 You are able to climb every mountain in the game
 You can explore totem memorials and abandoned ruins and collect artifacts
 The sound effects immerse you in the outdoor world, and the music is lovely
 Every area of the map is crafted with painstaking detail that provides eye-catching splendor to each sunrise and sunset
Gameplay:Much of the fun gameplay comes in with tracking the animals, for hunting and for photography with the cinematic camera in the controls
 The controls are all very simple, and can be keymapped for ease of use
 I like the run toggle so you dont have to hold down W
 I changed the E use key to mouse 5, so that when Im tracking I can run toggle and use the mouse to navigate and click to read the tracks as Im running
 The overlay provides mapping and a codex that stores all your accumulated knowledge of the world youve discovered
The day/night cycle is 4 times the speed of in real life
 So you have 3 real time hours of darkness to immerse in the nightlife of the woods, as well as those daytime hours
 Many outposts are scattered throughout the maps, and provide access to your storage, the in-game store, and a sleep point
 Sleeping allows you to move time ahead in hours
 Setting it to 18:00 for example, would make it sundown if you want to hunt at night
 But, each time you sleep costs in-game money, making it a bit more of a challenge
 Your character and your atv can take damage
 Creatures stampede and can hurt you
 But, death only resets your character at a sleep point & you lose nothing
 Atvs are unlimited
 Abandoning one at the foot of a mountain is nothing
 You can retrieve it at the next outpost, or even pitch a tent, and summon one up
 Tents have a limit that seems to be about 7 or so on each reserve
 With fast travel, you are able to move from tent to tent if you wanted to be in another location to hunt at dark
 I like to explore in the daytime, and hunt at sunset, sunrise, and nighttime
 Tracking and missionsThroughout the world you come across animal need zones and tracks
 These can be read to give information about when the animal species was last there and often how many animals were in that location
 Returning to that spot at the same time will allow you to encounter that species, whether for hunting or photography
 Multiple arcs of missions are imbedded in the single player to allow the option of structured gameplay, for those who want more than just simple run and gun type game play
 Of course, even the most hobbit-like adventurers like me, who love to wander around the countryside seeing all the sites and animals, love to find a cozy spot on a rock overlooking a canyon and accumulate a few carcasses down below before climbing down to harvest them all
The Shooter Experience: COTW has a range of weapons that you feel sufficiently motivated to collect for hunting every species
 Of course, more is always better, when it comes to weapons in game
 More would be even better
 It also has lures, ammo, and other gear for hunting
 Scattered around the countryside are woodpiles for building permanent ground blinds using in-game currency
 These provide more experience points for the skills & perk trees as well
 The skill & perk trees provide a good range of skills to work toward increased hunting experience for the current 60 max of levels
 These add abilities such as gauging the weather, and improved tracking skills
 DLC expansions added ATVs and tents and ground blinds
 Im not sure, but it looks as if these can be purchased eventually with in-game funds as an alternative, though it would take a lot of time
 Either way, 4 bucks is the cheapest expansion dlc Ive seen
 And, the ATVs are an awesome part of the hunting and exploration
 And, the tents allow portable base access; functioning like the permanent outposts throughout the maps
 Personally, Id love to see the addition of boats and fishing
 But, that is just a wishlist item
 I see no cons to this game
The Diversity of Animal Life:The game is inspired by the book, Call of the Wild by Jack London
 Like the book, the game reveals much about the lives and behaviors of animals, and the great outdoors
 Many species are integrated into the world of the current two reserves in Germany and America: Black Bears, Roosevelt Elks, Red Foxes, Coyotes, European Bison, Wild Boar, Moose, Red Deer, Fallow Deer, Roe Deer, Whitetail Deer, and Blacktail Deer
 Besides the typical colors, several rare & albino furs appear randomly
 The upcoming dlc expansion will add a third reserve in Siberia: Medved, with snow and an anticipated new selection of animals such as the already revealed Lynx
 MultiplayerI was in Scouting myself at an early age, and later an Explorers Post as a young adult
 Ive enjoyed the fun of group campouts with my sons in the cub scouts over the course of a decade & the numerous camping trips with families & friends over the years, and even group & solitary hiking & camping experiences
 But, Ive never been hunting myself
 As great of an experience as solitary hiking & camping can be, friendship is a huge part of the outdoors
 COTW provides a smooth multiplayer experience, where you can either create your own server game, or jump in with already created servers
 All outposts & locations unlocked in singleplayer are also available for quick travel on the multiplayer maps
 You can join your buddies for group cooperative hunts or compete in challenges
 Graphics:I get 60fps steady & can play mp with crappy internet
 No problems at all
 Second monitor & the Steam overlay works great with COTW
 You can even open vids in the overlay and listen while you shift/tab back into the game, which is really nice while sitting in a hunting stand in the dark waiting on the animal herd to arrive
 Call of the Wild is a truly spectacular real world experience that takes all the quality of life improvements of computer video gaming and makes the outdoor life even better
I highly recommend the game for animal lovers, fans of shooters, open sandbox, and sims
 The devs at Expansive Worlds have made a high quality game for everyone to love

I was becoming bored
 The hunt became a grind
 Popping between campsites, downing whatever was foolish enough to exist within 400 meters of me
 I thought a 7mm would bring me joy, but it didn't
 I tried bow hunting, which was a blast..
 for a day
 I had forgotten the hunt
 Not the shooting and harvesting, the HUNT
 So I travelled on foot
 Day, night, shooting and arching along the way, I had fun again
 So much of the map had I left uncovered
 I was getting that old familiar feeling
 I could almost smell the rain on the grass
 There was so much I was missing in my chase of an easy thrill
 My travels brought me to North Lake, and in my search of a landmark I came upon a most chilling call
 It shook my core, I was frozen in fear or anticipation
 Awestruck is how the old man tells it to me
 His words became my truth when I levelled that 7mm towards the most gracefull creature ever stood before me
 A Roosevelt Elk, the biggest I'd ever seen about 100m away, and another beside him, not as big but just as majestic
 I knew I could only have one, but neither gave me a clear shot
 I called, He spun around and called back
 I felt a click as the trigger pulled, and suddenly I was looking skyward because the magnum has her own part in every discourse
 He was down
 The feeling I had the first five minutes in the preserve was back
 The wonder and grandeur of this magical place came flooding back into my veins
 I realized I hadn't taken a breath in at least a minute as my rifle came down to survey my quarry
 And there it was, the stag I earned, the stag I hunted
Posted: 27 April
100+ Hour's + and i love the game, Had mad repect for the devs as i thought they were not going for cash grabs with a buggy unfinished game
 Two thumbs down boy's i dont feel this is right, i and many many other people were under the impression that what set this game apart from thehunter original was the ONE TIME PAY FOR CONTENT game that they promoted

Early Access Review
This is one of the few games that are worth buying on early access unlike those that get ditched by the devs once they milk their product enough
 Slime Rancher will appeal to the audience that like to play and relax on their games
 With so many games out there that make us frustrated, angry and anxious, Slime Rancher tries to oppose those feelings, and to me, it succeeds easily
 My only complaint about this game is the lack of content, but considering it's early access, and that the devs are still updating the game, more content will be added in the future
Overall, I recommend this game to all my fellow gamers that are bored of being competitive and anxious all the time and that just want to have fun just like the old days

Early Access Review
The game has a huge amount of potential
 The art and music are perfect for the setting and the gameplay is fun and addicting
 The only problem with this game is lack of content, which is to be expected since it just hit early access
 If your looking for a complete package i would reccomend waiting for a few more updates before buying
 If the developers stay on top of this game and release frequent meaningfull updates this game could become a real gem

Early Access Review
You see, poop is an extremely valuable resource ..
Slime Rancher [EARLY ACCESS] ReviewI caught a first glimpse of this game when one of my steam friends posted a link about it on the activity feed
 I checked the game out briefly, but quickly went back to other stuff as it did not really peek my interest
 The game seemed a little bit weird to me (as in: it looks boring and stupid) and I was about sure I wouldn't enjoy it
 About a week later, I saw one of my favourite youtubers play it and decided to eventually give it a watch
 The video was over before I knew it and I clicked on the next one
 And the next
 After a while it was clear to me: I want this game
 NOW
 There was just something about it that I can't really describe, but it drew me in
 And a lot of other people got drawn in too
 It's like a disease being spread, the only difference being that it's a good disease
 I admit I've been a little bit too quick in my (wrongful) judging of this game, and will therefore give it a (fair) second chance in this review
You play as Beatrix LeBeau who decides to leave earth and set out for the Far, Far Range; a magical and adorable planet filled with slimes
 Your goal
 Finding slimes to Suck up their plorts (aka slime poop) with your VAC to ..
 sell them
 Yes, correct
 Plorts come in many forms and are used for various things on earth; mainly food and products (eww
)
 You sell these plorts on the plort market to earn some cash, which can then be spend on upgrades (for either yourself or the ranch)
 When slimes are fed, they'll leave one of these treasures behind for you, or two even if you are lucky
 As of now, there are 3 main categories of food: fruits, veggies and meat
 Each category has different types of food for you to find and feed to your slimes
 If you so desire, you can also plant your own food - you'll run out less slowly (and it's fun too
)
 Believe me, your slimey friends will be thankful if you do
 It is especially useful to plant your friends' favourite food; they'll love you for that and will definitely return the favour via plorts
 I hope it is now clear that plorts are extremely valuable and so is your task as slime rancher
The gameplay, however a bit unoriginal (find slimes --> feed slimes --> get plorts --> get money --> get upgrades etc) is very satisfying
 Finding new slimes is always exciting, especially since you can create mixed breeds that are more efficient for money making (and they are just so adorable too
)
 The game thus encourages you to explore the planet on your 'quest' to find more and different slimes, find food and start your own farms ..
 and getting upgrades will make all of that easier
 Be careful though, not everything is peaceful on the Far, Far Range
 Under certain circumstances, a Tarr slime will come out and devour all the slimes in the vicinity - even you
 So be cautious and take good care of your 'pets'
The 'thing' that makes Slime Rancher so much fun for me, is the fact that there is so much freedom as to how you play
 You can approach this game in a very casual way, and just go on an adventure, enjoying the different and beautiful areas with their inhabitant slimes (I could see this game used for therapy so to speak)
 The total opposite would be finding the most profitable slimes, combining them, putting them in a corral and making a lot of money - a dream for people who want to create a very efficient farm (or ranch rather)
 Or you could go inbetween and do a little of both: enjoy the slimes in their natural surroundings, but take a few home to take care of because they're so darn cute
 The game is also suited for all ages, which is great
 I'm pretty sure both young and old will find a certain joy playing this game and I love it for that
 I could totally see a grandfather and his grandchild play this game together having a lot of fun
The game in its current state is already super fun and stable, with minimal bugs
 I estimate about 5-10 hours of content
 There is still a lot of content waiting to be added, like more slimes, more types of food, more areas ..
 more everything
 I also hope that they will add different 'modes' besides the "do-whatever-you-want" experience
 I think it would make for much more replayability, which is what I'm looking for in the long run
 I want to be able to play this cute game for a long time, without it getting tedious, hence my idea for different modes
 (Ofcourse, this list is totally personal, and I will still love this game if it keeps up development like this - whether there be different modes or not)
 I'm thinking about: A story mode: right now there is a little bit of background in the form of mail that you receive, but I think playing through a real story would be pretty amazing
 Maybe one where you have to save the slimes from evil or something
 I don't know, maybe I'm just babbling nonsense, but I think some kind of story would make things even more interesting
Challenge mode: Think about having to complete certain objectives in a certain amount of days
 That way, players would have to make smart use of the day-night cycle
Sandbox mode: The current mode (aka do what you want)Pros and Cons+ Unique concept + Relaxing and/or challenging + Nice, soothing soundtrack+ Satisfying gameplay+ Excellent tutorial+ Gorgeous looking world+ Cuteness overload
+- (this is temporary): lack of content +- (this is temporary): some may find it a little bit too expensive in its current state- The gameplay is not very innovative (as in: get slimes -> get money -> get upgrades -- repeat)The VerdictI definitely recommend this game, but please keep in mind that it is still early access
 Not all the content is in the game yet, and weird stuff (buggs) may happen
 If you don't mind that, by all means, please support the devs
 Otherwise, just wait a couple of months for the game to be a little bit more polished
I will revisit this review when the game is fully released, as to edit it accordingly

Early Access Review
First of all, you may look at this and see a kids game
 Cutesy characters, no BFG to frag tight corridors full of baddies
 But sit down and give this game 15 Minutes and you will see why I am recommending it
 Without giving anything away, you are a slime rancher on a distant planet and you collect plorps (which are slime poo) and trade it within the global economy
 You can coop and breed chickens as well as farm a wide variety of fruits and vegetables

Still waiting for new updateWhy you should buy this:Anybody can play this game
Easy to learn
Set your own difficulty by setting how many slimes you take care of.Upgrades.Farming.Adventure
REALLY CUTE SLIMES
Really big slimes
KITTY SLIMES.combinations
COMBINED KITTY SLIMESSSSSwonderful music
Good for the build it's in
Doesn't take up much space
Indigo Quarry update
Some new icons for the spaces, really cute design
 Love the extra detail to the farm
 The updated plort market screen is nice
 The new music..
 Omg It's so beautiful
 This update is so wonderful
 Oh, the detail spreads out to the land too
 (I'm writing more to the review as i play
)Rapid fire was added, if you hold down the left mouse you will fire faster and faster
 Now that's useful
 :oThe gordos look fatter and cuter x3The ground shines at night and omg it's so beautiful
the water has a new slot, much more convient
Rad slimes are really neat, the fact you get radiation around them is a cool feature
water slimes just look like blobs with eyes now..
 i liked when they were actually slimes with the cute happy face
How I feel about this game.0
24bWhen I saw it on the steam store I was like "Hmm..
"After I got some money I thought about the game, I looked at Jacksepticeye's playthrough of it a bit, and it was awesome
 I really liked the way it looked so I bought it
 First few minutes i was getting used to the controls, doing the tutorial
 Seemed easy enough; Though the one thing is, is that having too many slimes in one carrol is hard to do/ hard to take care of them all at once
Knowing this, I take care of as many slimes as I can handle
 When I came across the cat slime, I was going so crazy over it; but then, it ate a pink slime's poop thingy [Plorts] (I can't believe I already forget it) and it turned into a big pink kitty
 There was also these rocky spike slimes; they are adorable..
 but hurt you
 ;u; I took care of the kitty with my other slimes but kept it outside
 Then..
 I discovered the tarr
 A really messed up slime that you cannot absorb or keep; well because it's evil
 I had to throw them into the sea so i could easily destroy them
 Then i found out i could take water and shoot it at them till they died or put them into water
 Where is when i found boom slimes
 Well they explode; that's pretty much it, but they have a good worth of newbucks(
)
There are different slimes and they can all combine into a largo which is a big slime that is both of the slimes through eating the [plorts] poop stuff

Posted: 1 August
Definitely a great game
 This is great for my down time and I use my steam account for the entire household and allow younger kids to play it while I am babysitting, or I can just play it on the big TV screen and all the kids love it
 They are so happy to learn each new slime or area
 The bright colors to the strategy and monetary system helps the little ones learn
 10/10 would buy the game again

Early Access Review
I am divorced and my life is in shambles
But now instead of my children I have kitty-slimes
Exploding kitty slimes
Posted: 29 May
Product received for free
I am a 50+ year old man who is fascinated by ecomomy, simulation, strategy, type games and much to my chagrin, I am absolutely horrible at them
 But I keep buying them, have a blast for like an hour or two until my economies or strategies start failing as they always do because I have a really hard time getting a grasp for all the intricacies of these type of games
 Frankly, they make me feel stupid because I don't understand all the mechanics enough to play a decent game
When this game came along it was pretty much the same thing for me
 But this game was a bit different
 It was so beautiful and the trains and vehicles were breathtakingly fresh compared to most games
 Zooming in on horse drawn carts moving around and gorgeous old European buildings was like being on a European vacation
 Seeing people move around in the city made them seem alive
 I was desperate to learn this game
 So I went to Youtube and watched a video series about this game by a guy named Skye Storme
 He basically started from scratch on a large map and just played for like 15 youtube sessions while explaining what he was doing in each session
 It was amazing
 I did not follow his plan but used many of his tips and tricks and suddenly some of my transportation lines were making profit
 My cities started to grow
 I would get 4 linked cities operating so well that I could move on to other cities and try to work these as well
 I would spend entire weekends playing completely focused on the game, losing all track of time, whooping and hollering each time I had a profitable year, marvelling at the effiiciency of my transportation systems
 I got better and better
 Soon just having great transportation wasn't enough
 Most of my cities were still poor
 I began to expand my skills into building them up through commerce
 Skye Storme's videos helped me through while allowing me to still maintain my own original plans
 I began to experiment and it was so much fun..
even when I would sometimes fail on some particular task
The game is amazing
 You
can open windows to every vehicle running in the game, click a button and watch them as they travel and work
 You can form terrain
 As the years go by, you update to newer types of transportation and each new model that comes out is absolutely gorgeous
 Old trains covered with brass that shines and shows reflections, neat looking automobiles that have character, Incredible ships and planes that you just want to follow around and stare at, Hundreds of mods for so many awesome trains and vehicles, I could go on and on
You get announcements every few years in game of new vehicles and it's so exciting to buy them and watch them come out of depots or warehouses just to see what they look like and I'm never disappointed
The game isn't easy..
it's challenging, but it's not "beat your head against the table" challenging..
it's a fun challenge because you know
can usually spot your mistakes and you don't have to quit if you make one..
you just suck up the losses for that year and try to get better and this aspect is one of the
most rewarding aspects
 Even on easy mode, you risk losing money in any given year if your ideas don't work out like you thought, but you can always try to turn it around and
that's such a great aspect of this game
 You never feel cheated or like the game is unfair
 Usually you can spot your mistake and correct it by the following ingame year and cheer mightily as you start to see profits on thet failure of a hub the year before
 You'll find yourself short of cash at times and have to borrow money
 I've been five million in debt at times and it's a glorious feeling when the gamble you took on loans begins to pay off and you start paying back your debt
 If you've ever been interested in this kind of game, buy it
 Like I said..
I'm terrible at these games normally, but this one is accessible if you study some youtube videos first or if you already have skills at this type of game
 I hear the difficulty ramps up tremendoudly at hard and even medium mode for those who seek a challenge
I love this game
 It's so well made and I feel like some mogul tycoon when everything is working properly and I'm seeing 100 people milling about at one of my train stations or see a beautiful new tanker I just purchased sailing out of port filled with resources or a wagon piled high with brick being pulled by two prancing horses, or seeing one of my farms so filled with grain that I decide to open a new line, or seeing some rare German plane from the 1930's soaring in the sky filled with passengers
 I can't wait to play today
Update: Still learning the game every day
 One important factor I mess up on sometimes is that you must be certain to complete the path of products you are producing in order for your transportation lines to run properly
 For instance: Train line to oil fields > send that line to a station at an oil refinery > send that line to either a city that uses fuel or a factory that uses oil > if you send it to a factory that uses oil to make products you must then add a line to a place that uses that product,
> You must then take the finished product to the town of your choosing
 Skipping any of these stations will cause one of your producers to quit producing and you will lose money until you add the proper line
Another tip: Watch how many people you have at train stations and monitor how many are left after a train leaves filled with passengers
 If the station consistently draws more passengers than you can carry, consider buying another train for extra profit
 You can either install a second track (expensive) or use waypoints and signals to make two trains run efficiently on one track
 (Much cheaper)
Ships are awesome
 I've had some profitable ship lines delivering products to cities that border rivers or lakes since you don;t need additional trucking routes to deliver them into the city
 I usually put one truck depot near the dock and one near the business and industrial heart of the city and can usually turn a profit
Second update: After about a week of playing an hour or two every evening, I have built a very successful (for me) transportation system and I'm having a blast
 My cities are filled with people
 Cranes are constantly constructing new buildings and you never know what they will be until built which to me is way more exciting than actually choosing what to build
 After all, I'm building the transportation lines not the housing and industrial complexes
 It is so cool though to see a building come up and see it turn into a store or hotel
 I'm into the 1900's now so I have early types of automobiles and trucks
 They are so incredibly detailed and above all so neat looking
 I also have awesome looking trains and they are getting really fast
 Best of all for the first time I was able to quit borrowing money
 I paid off my loans and actually accumulated 2 million dollars
 In the next day or so I'm going to link my grain fields to a plastics factory and also my oil wells to a refinery and then also to the plastics factoryso I can manufacture plastics to deliver to my city to boost the economy even more
 This game is just awesome once you get the hang of it

If you're interested in economic simulator management games such as Cities Skylines or Transport Tycoon, then you should really check this out
 The visuals are great, the economic system robust (if not a little finicky at times), and the UI is good
 The game lacks some explanation and the tutorials leave a bit to be desired (specifically on how the supply chains work as they are very different than Transport Tycoon but the same as their previous game, Train Fever which I never played)
 I had to rely on community guides and video tutorials to figure out some of these aspects
 But it's a testament to how fun it is to simply build track and trains that I stuck with it and figured it out
 There is simply a great sense of satisfaction in getting a rail line up and running
 Setting up successful supply chains and building a train empire is great fun
The campaign is good, albeit a bit wonky and cheesy at times in a good way
 I enjoyed playing through it and it helped to slowly introduce game concepts and new vehicles gradually
 There are no AI opponents, which would have made for a fun additional game mode but I do not miss them all that much
 Building up your own train/transport empire is the star of this game here and seeing the technological progress over time is very fun too
 Did I mention how great the vehicles and visuals look, especially for an economic sim
 The vehicles truly stand out, as they should
 Some folks have complained that there is a lack of vehicle options, but there are a lot of mods you can use to fill in this gap
 I'm 80 hours in and I've still not used all the base game vehicles so I don't feel this way
Overall, I feel that this game is a bit underrated
 I've also been disappointed at the lack of media attention it's received
 Furthermore, the developers have released some key patches that have fixed some of the slowdown issues and improved the UI so it's only gotten better since released
 It's not perfect but it's the closest thing to a Tranport Tycoon 2 that we have and it stands well on its own
 I highly recommend it

I consider Transport Fever to be an unpolished gem
 On one hand, I really enjoy playing it, as it does the important things very well
 On the other hand, though, it has plenty of problems
 The result, for me, felt kind of like taking a shower on a cold day with a faulty water heater, so the temperature of the water keeps flactuating between too cold and too hot
 Having played for over 250 hours (at the time of writing this review), it's evident I chose to keep playing despite the problems
The good side of the game, in my opinion, consists of the main gameplay mechanics
 Much like in previous games of this genre, including Transport Fever's own predecessor, Train Fever, the purpose is to build and manage your own network of transportation routes
 You build roads, railway tracks, sea ports and airports, plan routes, buy vehicles and manage your fleet and infrastructure
 While I have some serious reservations about some aspects of the economy (some of which I'll list and describe later on), the system does feel balanced well, in general, and is definitely complex and interesting enough to carry the whole game on its shoulders
 Also, the models of the vehicles look really well, and from what I understand from others, are also realistic
As for the negatives - while the game is fun to play, sometimes to the degree of being addictive, some issues take much of the fun out of the experience
 The most significant of those issues, in my opinion, are the user interface and the performance issues
 The game barely uses more than one CPU core, which practically means really low FPS values even on the best of hardware, especially when playing on advanced stages of the game
 This issue has been addressed and improved on one of the recent patches to the game, but the game still stutters and lags like crazy - enough to sometimes cause me to quit in frustration, even though I'm playing on a relatively fast computer (Intel i7 2
9Ghz, Quad-Core with 16GB RAM)
 As for the user interface - well, sometimes it feels like the developers of the game just didn't think things through before making decisions
 Some of the problems have already been addressed and fixed on a recent patch, but many still remain:1) When you upgrade a train station (adding platforms or upgrading tracks to high-speed, for example), all the passenger or cargo items which either wait at the station to be picked up, or on their way to that station - will vanish as if never existed
 This problem has much to do with the game's AI as with the user inteface, and perhaps the closest to the definition of "game breaking", as if it happens mid or late game, it can easily lead you to bancrupcy - all by a mere few clicks of the mouse, without any warnings
 Another effect of upgrading a station is that trains on the affected route will sometimes change direction for no apparent reason, and end up halting the entire traffic on the network (causing more losses, as maintenance costs keep accumulating as the time goes by, but since the trains can't move, no passengers or cargo get transported, so you don't get paid)
2) The cargo system is awkward and unrealistic
 I won't get into it too deeply, as this is not a guide, but I will say that despite being interesting and challenging when done right, transporting cargo in this game takes a lot of trial and error, as the game simply doesn't bother to give you all the information you need
 You'll start having fun with it only when you grasp the concepts it's based on (complete chains and demand base)
 3) Replacing vehicles (when they get older and need to be replaced) usually means loss of money, as the 'Auto-Replace' feature will in many cases have at least some of the cargo or the passengers on board the vehicle vanish into thin air (without paying you for the transportation), and sending vehicles to their depots manually will usually mean having to pay their maintenance costs for a long while, without being able to use them to transport anyone or anything during that time
4) Different scales - maybe the only problem on the list which also has something to do with the game-design
 As everything is obviously scaled down, there's a significant and obvious difference between the scale of the maps (including the cities) and the scale of the vehicles and stations
 This was most likely designed like this for the eye-candy effect of the moving vehicles, but I believe it has a major negative impact on the gameplay - specifically the acceleration rates of trains and airplanes, and the volume of traffic (especially trains)
Although it seems like most of this review is made up of the negatives of the game, I do recommend it, with all its flaws and problems, to anyone who likes this genre
 The game is fun to play - as long as you don't let yourself get too frustrated with the problems

I want to love this game, but when the game missions become more complicated, it becomes less of a transport simulator and more of finding way to work around the way the game is designed
 For simple tasks, like transport resource x from y to z it works great, you only create a railroad line and assign a train to it, easy as that
 However, trouble arose for me first during the mission in Sweden, where you have to distribute food from one place to three different cities
 It becomes awfully apparent that this game needs a way to specify what to pick up and where/how much to drop it off
 First, I tried to create a circular line, but all food were dropped of at the first city
 Then I bought a second train, and created one line for each city
 The game, however, thought it convenient to only deliver all food that came to the station to the first line instead of dividing it
 I tried creating a second station with no avail
 Lastly I had to set up a separate truck line, after spending millions on buying trains and building an entire new railway
Next mission included boats, and that's when I couldn't bother anymore
 The map had four harbours, and in the beginning you only had one boat (later on I got two more)
 One boat could only carry ONE TYPE OF CARGO
 This works fine with trucks, that have a storage of 5 units
 A boat with a 100 unit
cargo, however, is useless
 I had to transport 6 different materials using one boat, that could only take one kind of cargo
 I couldn't choose which cargo to load, which resulted in a line where the boat drove from harbour to harbour, only carrying 1 unit of tools, and failing to load/unload where I wanted to
 That's when I quit this game, I might come back when they allow more granular control over what resources are picked up and what to drop off, where

This game is the spiritual successor to Transport Tycoon, but brought up to date in full 3D glory
 First impressions are very good
 On the surface it looks just like Train Fever with ships and planes added, but there's a lot more to it than that
 It runs on a new game engine for a start, which solves the worst problem of the previous game, namely track and road laying, which could often be extremely frustrating
 It's still not perfect, but it's considerably improved, with far more complex track connections possible
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=796614848The scenery is a lot more detailed when you look closely at it, with many more different buildings in the towns
 The vehicle models are really well done, and they become dirty and rusty over time
 Distant scenery blends better into the background with a misty effect
The most significant change is that they've done away with the 20 minute rule and replaced it with catchment areas, which is probably more familiar in these types of games
 Journeys can be of any length now, but passengers still prefer quicker transport
 With freight it doesn't matter so much, especially with ships that can carry huge amounts of cargo but travel very slowly
Along with that, resources and products no longer move on their own, instead you have to transport everything yourself and place stations in appropriate catchment areas to ensure that everything gets delivered to the right places
 Industries now have more complex resource requirements
 If part of the supply chain is missing it will grind to a halt
 This makes the game more challenging compared to Train Fever, in which you could provide partial transport routes and the AI would automatically fill in the gaps
In keeping with the more complex industries, there are now six different types of products that need to be transported to towns, three to the commercial districts and three to the industrial districts
 This makes things even more complex since you need to use more depots to ensure the town is well supllied, although you apparently only need to supply one industrial and one commercial product (in addition to passenger transport) to help cities grow, making the more complex industrial chains seem somewhat unnecessary
Regarding money, even on the easy level there can be a lot of time spent waiting to make a profit
from your lines before you can expand, and the harder levels are much more difficult
 If you prefer to build without limits, you can apply a mod which removes money from the game, but you don't get any achievements in that mode
In addition to the main random game, there are also two campaigns included, one for Europe and one for the USA, featuring several scenarios each
 I haven't tried these myself, but they provide you with a story and clear goals to win each scenario
 They're probably a good way to help learn the game if you haven't played Train Fever previously
To sum up, Transport Fever can be very engrossing
 Personally I'm finding it just as addictive as Civilization, but instead of "one more turn" there's always one more line to create, a new train to build, vehicles to upgrade, a line to update or some other problem to solve
 "I'll just finish doing this then I'll go to bed, but I need to sort out that problem first, oh and there's that other thing I need to look at, and while I'm at it..
"If you enjoy these types of games, this is a no brainer
 We've been waiting a very long time for a spiritual successor to Transport Tycoon
 Many similar games have come and gone over the years, but this is the first that truly deserves that accolade
 It's the best game in the genre in my opinion
Posted: 27 January
I very much want to love this game
 I love the concept and being able to create and manage transportation routes is so incredibly satisfying.But
The game slows down A LOT once you have a decent transport network created
 Clicking on a moving vehicle will sometimes crash the game
 It's like having a key to a candy store, but discovering most of the inventory is made of wax
Please, if you are a developer for this game, FIX it
 It seems like I've been waiting all my life for this game, but it's technically flawed
Posted: 14 November, 2016
I do this with a bleeding heart, as I a great fan of transportation games, and those are rare and far in between
 I have pre-ordered Transport Fever, as I did with Train Fever two years prior
 I am very happy with the previous game and have clocked about 140 hours on it
 Possibly not that much, but that is life
There cannot be a dispute over the fact that there are a host of improvements in Transport Fever in regards to Train Fever
 We get scenarios - which are quite fun to play
 Track laying is much easier then in TF
 Graphics is a tad prettier
 But these are surface level changes
What finally drove me away from Train Fever were glaring gameplay issues that game had
 I am unhappy to report, that all those issues were carried over to Transport Fever and then some were turned up to 11 to make things even worse in many aspects
 Let me elaborate.1
 Cargo distribution model in Transport Fever is based on chain of interdependant industries
 In order to make it work, the player needs to eventually provide a service for the entire industrial chain
 In Transport Fever this might require setting up links between several industries, culminating in transportation of some goods to towns
 Production depends, eventually, on demand in cities
 However, if cargo flow one industry in the chain gets disrupted, then the entire chain collapses
 With very little info for the player
 This was an issue in the previous game
 Now however is even more pronounced because of complicated industry chains.2
 Game balance is odd, to say the least
 'Easy' is Hard
 'Medium' is very hard and 'Hard' is Dark Souls hard
 For a efficiency oriented player in Train Fever it quickly became obvious that trucks are most cost effective option to transport stuff
 Only in later game, when trains became fast enough to cover great distances, they would start to dominate
 This dynamic was carried over to Transport Fever and then turned up to 11
 In the earliest stages of the game railroads are a trap for the unsuspecting player
 At that stage train cars cost more then locomotives
 Even if, at that stage, the player manages to make profit on them then the cash flow is going to be very slow, thus we spend game time waiting
 On the other hand, forgetting about trains, and focusing on trucks allow to cheaply and efficiently transport even the hugest amount of freight
 Sure - this can be played, but it is a major immersion breaker.3
 There remain still lots of small issues that, if brought togather, are immersion breaking
- cargo remains weightless, so no differentiation between freight/passanger services exist
- acceleration is completely not matched to the game world
 Effectively, trains, even the fastest ones, rarely go above approx 170km/h, same as in Train Fever
- ascending/descending does not seem to bother trains at all after more powerful trains are introduced
- freight cars rated at 160km/h are just silly
- car traffic in cities quickly starts to erode any sensibility of using buses
- game is reliant on vehicle visit frequency, but no tools to handle those exist - simple "load for '_X time'" order would suffice4
 The game still suffers from some technical issues
- the gui cannot be scaled for high PPI displays or people with poor eyesight
- performance in some key situations performance can drop dramastically, even on quite beefy machines
- slight input lag still exists Overall - the game is mediocre
 If you liked Train Fever, then Transport Fever is mostly an expansion pack
 If you like train games, it is that too
 It looks pretty, runs fairly well, barring some specific situations
 However, it lacks strategic substance, its gameplay is detached from reality it simulates - thus isn't all that immersive
 It carries over most of gameplay issues from Train Fever
 Sure, it is fine for burning an afternoon or two, but that is about it
 For me it was a let down
Posted: 10 November, 2016
So many ignorant reviews that don't understand how this game works, and are stuck in a "this is supposed to be an OTTD remake with better graphics"
 It's a different game, please learn how to play it differently
For example, those who can't get freight working
Transport fever factories won't produce items if there are simply trains waiting at the station, you must have routes fulfilling the entire freight route, i.e
 logs -> planks -> tools -> city before all the lines will work, otherwise they will stop after a while
If you want to try this out for yourselves, the easiest is grain -> food -> city
 Also never leave one of the routes without a vehicle, such as when upgrading an existing vehicle on the line, otherwise production will drop very fast
 As you can see, this is far more realistic
I personally enjoyed Train Fever, even with its many, many flaws
Transport fever basically removed all these problems and added a bunch of new features such as shipping, aircraft, and much more powerful track laying tools
I wouldn't say I'm happy with the fact I have to buy a second game to get these fixes, but the game is definitely fun nonetheless
The performance of the game is definitely an issue though, I've lost count of the number of times the game has crashed
 I have been able to get solid several hour sessions at times
 It seems to crash on my system if I try and show too much on my screen at once, i.e
 angle my camera in a way that shows everything
My thumbs up is on the assumption that this will get fixed soon
Posted: 20 November, 2016
The game is good
 There is room for improvement definitely, but is good
 Graphics is great
 Never had technical issues, sure as the maps fills might get laggy, but i never met a game that worked better, even TTD and Locomotion had the same problem at their time
Trains looks amazingly good, busses too
 Visually is impossible not to be pleased
 Easy to lay tracks, roads etcWhat the game needs very bad is balance
 Time goes too fast even on slowest speed
 Ship docking takes waay too long
 Vehicles do not overtake one another so if you have a slower, older vehicle on transport line
you will end up with a train of vehicles
 You can filter what trucks can transport only in depot
 Informations on mouseover regarding industry is very ambiguous
 Powerful locomotives don't feel that powerful
 Ridiculously expensive locomotives, wagons especially
 For some reason upgrading train station resets all the cargo in the station, freight or passengers, same if you change the train on a line
 The concept of "full load" at terminal is broken because production it's based on transport arriving at destination instead of how fast you load at terminal, so you end up with an extermely slow start when you set up a line of transport, because your first transports will run mostly empty just so the Factory can detect that you are delivering stuff so he can increase production
 The more time you spend
loading the less production
 It can actually reach zero production
 This is a big flaw in the industry concept
 And one of the worst: no Undo button which is mindblowing

At one point this was my fav game ive ever played and then the devs got bought by kabam and kabam made this a pay to win like no other
 and pretty much all the old players quit, and you can tell kabam only wants money from this
sad to see that happen to one of my use to be fav games.r.i
p
Realm Of the Mad God(EDIT for those who dont really understand)ok i admit its all 100% a pay to win
its more of a pay to have fun, and make any real progress
pets to heal you, regen all your stuff, and attack for you, gotta pay to make them work
theres, backpacks,potions, item drop enhancers, very powerful items right off from the start
 only way you can get any of these is with money
 NOW , i wouldnt mind, skins, colors, things like that you know
 like the old days of this game

Used to play this back on Kongregate (I believe it was on there) and a bit when it came on Steam
 Was probably the best perma-death RPG game you could find
 Didn't have demanding PC requirements, cool and clean pixelated visuals, easy-to-pick up hard-to-master bullet hell-style gameplay
 Overall, it was great fun and I enjoyed my time with it
So I thought this game had died out a while ago (some time since I had played it regularly), but it turns out the game is still going strong..
really strong actually
 I was pretty excited and saw that this game has the VERY POSITIVE rating on Steam
 As I was strolling down to read some of the top reviews, I noticed a new publisher called Kabam in the game's description area
 Interesting
 So I finally make it to the reviews and what I see is a bunch of negative reviews about how pay-2-win this game is after Kabam took over
I couldn't believe it was THAT bad so I tried it out myself a few weeks ago
 Downloaded it through Steam, loaded it up.....Wow
 Another example of an amazing game ruined by greedy companies tainting the free-2-play model
 No one wonder people are hating on free-2-play games when we got so much greedy companies these days
 But Kabam really butchered this game
 Everything good requires money
 Skill is irrevelant
 I can't believe they actually managed to take the skill factor out of a bullet-hell game
 What's the world coming to....I.Rather.Have.Perfect.World.Own.This.....Hell.I.Rather.Have.Nexon.Own.This.Than
KabamNever again Kabam..
never again

I used to play this game a far long time ago, back on Kongregate
 It was a good game, plenty of fun to be had, and the perma-death, while annoying, only made me more determined to do better in the future, work with my friends, and pursue a higher goal
But that was a different time entirely; a golden age long since past
So, around 2 years later, being a more experienced and wisened individual, I decided to check this game out again, seeing it was on Steam
 I went into the reviews, and noticed..
a surprising negative reaction among a bulk of the players, even ones who've spent over hundreds of hours
 I thought to myself, Well it just can't be as bad as these people say, right
 People love to use hyperbole to make a point
 In my lack of judgement, I decided to play this again..
I regretted said decision
[GETTING STARTED]So I started up the game after a shockingly-fast install time of roughly 2 seconds
 Flash games, gotta love'em
 I start things up, go into my character menu, and realize that half the screen's dedicated to selling me crap
 That's not a good sign..
I start up my one character slot, and I go through the motions of picking my first hero, a Warrior
 The tutorial's straight-forward, I blitzed through fairly quickly, and reached the point where I named the account
 For review sake, I'll disclose my account username in-game was DMNTDxNem
[MY EXPERIENCE]When I first started up my warrior, in the first server I selected, things went overall decently for me
 I stuck to the beach, like the game said to, and leveled up to 3 before taking on a little deeper in the forest areas
 Reaching around level 5 now, fighting against not only the enemies, but the server lag, I decide a quick respite at the Nexus was in order
Now, from when I was playing this back on Kongregate, I used to love the Nexus
 It was crowded pretty often, yeah, but there tended to be a lot of friendly player interaction; people helping each other, constantly working in each other's benefit to get better gear and equipment, there was always strong community there
But on my return trip to the Nexus during this refresher playthrough, I realized the game's first critical issue:Bots
 Bots everywhere
 I couldn't speak to any of the players, as few as there even were around, without bots running up and drowning us out
 I cannot tell you how much I desperately wanted to kill some of these players; physically
 In real life
 I was that angry
Aside from that, though, there was also the issue of the shop items
 Originally, pre-dev change, the shop items, while difficult to acquire, were completely do-able, and it was rather straight-forward; you earn coins, you go to the shop, you spend coins on an item you want (and eventually die and lose, but I digress,) and you got said item
 Now, shop items range from the hundreds to the thousands in coin value
 And if you came back into the game with 50 coins earned, many of the shop items that were once 50 are now 51, meaning you'd be forced to pay for one more bloody coin
 Slowly, I was realizing that people's anger was rather justified
Enough about the Nexus and the broken shop, though
 I went back in, enjoyed my time fighting through enemy territory, until it appeared the server I was on had a server-wide boss battle occurring
 Everyone was teleported into a dangerous, high-level world dungeon: Oryx's Castle
 I, among many players, was ill-equipped for the encounter, so I ended up dying along heaps of other players, who all probably experienced the same game-breaking lag spikes that I did
 Congratulations, RotMG; you, a flash game, made my high-performance gaming computer buckle onto its knees..
Second go, another warrior, and I was definitely getting the hang of things
 I beat a few dungeon bosses, went into the ruins and killed a few mini-bosses strewn across the world, and grabbed some decent equipment
 Things were going good, and the whole thing went just as I'd hoped
 Barring the several passing exchanges I gave the bots advertising their crummy products, to which I had some choice opinions of them, I finally came across an actual, breathing player; they were running around like the flash, and when I strolled up, they told me about a dungeon where they could help me get some better equipment
 Now, I'll say in advance that I read the reviews extensively, and knew there were players who got their kicks off of getting people with good characters killed
 I thought to myself, Well, my guy's crap, so he'd be wasting his time if he just wanted to off me
How wrong I was
First off, the dungeon he dragged me into was from some candy dude that was prancing around like the Gingerbread Man
 I insisted on being the one to take him down, so a little Looney Tunes-style chase went on, me using mana potions to keep up like Lance Armstrong used drugs for the Tour De France, and finally was able to dead him to death
 Me and the guy go in, and before my eyes, he vanishes through a wall..
and when he returned, every enemy he could alert in the area was with him
 Running as far as I could, not long, considering I used up all my mana, I was eventually shot to death by a unicorn pinata barfing rainbows
 And so, at level 9, Sir Gullible II was found dead due to overdose on vibrant colors
 The last words he ever heard were from his once-thought ally, typing in "#rekt" about 7 times
 Fun times were had.
[GAMEPLAY]Now, the fact the game now being a botting trollfest of epic proportions notwithstanding, it's still incredibly functional
 The base game works as intended, and the system hasn't changed all that much since 2 years ago
 Now, I'll admit the difficulty curve's definitely become harder to cope with, especially how the higher-tier equipment is even harder to acquire than ever before, unless you throw your wallet at the screen, but by the by, it hasn't really changed all that much
 You still work with other players, you still try for the best loot, and you still fight towards the ultimate goal of taking down the Mad God
You have your four slots, weapon, helmet, armor, and ring, and equipment is divided amongst different classes, rings being the only ones where any class can use anything they find for that slot
 Each class has different advantages and disadvantages; warriors can buff allies and face-tank, wizards can do solid damage, archers can hit multiple enemies at once, they're all viable for different reasons
Remember, of course, about the perma-death mechanic; once a character's dead, they're dead
 Anything they had, if you didn't get it sorted out or saved, is gone, so it's incredibly important to manage the equipment that you find, so that the next time someone throws a death-spewing unicorn at you, you'll have plenty of equipment for the next character that hits the ground
[SUMMARY/FINAL THOUGHTS]In all, the game's as it's always been: you play, you die, you improve, you die again, the cycle continues
 Granted, there are the more-than-occasional hacking players that either screw you out of loot, or, in my experience, send sentient pinatas to murder you with rainbows, so the cycle is a bit less off a circle, and more of a triangle, where every corner is a slap to the face

Micro-transactions became too dominant in the game's design and it's suffered greatly for it
 Used to be a lot of fun, though
Posted: 3 December, 2013
Hoo, this game
Was a lot of fun for the first 60 hours..
before the company got bought out by a bigger company
Apparently that company had big ideas in terms of monetizing the hell out of this fairly enjoyable free to play game
I enjoyed it back when it was catching on, but I think the game has definitely taken a turn for the worse when it got bought out
The design is more focused towards getting your money than making the game more enjoyable
When a game does that, even if I already invested 60 hours, I walk away rather than get treated like a bag of money by the game's designers and publishers
Posted: 4 September, 2015
Before you say I have no experience with this game, I have played for a good few hundred hours on the browser version
This game USED to be good
 It really was
 Back then, a company called Wildshadow owned the game
 It was truly f2p, with skill and no money required
Then, a company called Kabam took over
 They changed the game into a cashgrab
 Skins
 Buy gold
 Vaults and characters
 Buy gold
 1-life weapons or keys
 Buy gold
 Everything is gold gold gold
 Updates are rare, and even when they come they just add more items to be purchased with gold
 In fact, the way they 'celebrate' holidays is by creating cheap weapon reskins for more people to buy with.
 you guessed it, gold
You might be thinking, at least there's player interaction
 No, there isn't
 The game is infested with hackers, scammers, enemy draggers, spambots, etc
 Kabam doesn't care at all
 After all, you don't make any money from clearing away hackers, so why bother
TL;DR: Stay away

Stunning
The online mode is incredibly fun
It's one of the funniest games i've ever played
 There is only one problem: It ends
If there were a mechanism to avoid the ending of the game, it would be one of my top 3 favourite games
Just something like a LEVEL CREATOR attached to Steam Workshop
 To sum up, a way to create objects and maps to publish at Workshop would be amazing for "Human: Fall Flat"
Posted: 13 June
Wonderfull fun little puzzle game, the game is half figuring out the puzzle and the other half is making the "Human" do what you want him to do
 Other than that i really really loved the Polygen art this game contains, a 10/10 buy, PS
 play with controller

(I'm 47, so you may have different results if you're younger) Nice game
 Really fun, and not too hard to grasp the movement
 There's a slight learning curve when climbing, but it's easy once you learn how
 For some reason, tho, this game gives me motion sickness something fierce
 So, only good in short bursts for me

Posted: 8 January
This game is truly amazing
 At first, you spend a bit of time grasping the controls and marvelling at your ability to climb and move things
 Then the puzzles become more complicated (but sometimes menial)
 There isn't just one way to do things, either
 I passed an entire part of a level because I broke a window, stacked some matresses and clambered through
 You could also use a rope swing to cross a chasm instead of jumping your way across big rocks
 Basically, the game has some replayability, if you wanna go back and do the level a different way
 You can also do local co-op (NOTE: It's only with two gamepads, no keyboard
 But you use the keyboard and mouse in singleplayer
) Co-op just makes it more ridiculous, but the puzzles stay the same
 You could use your new buddy to try new ways of doing them, though
 I'd say this game is worth whatever it's being sold at, because you can't put a pricetag on honest fun

Human: Fall Flat is one those hidden gems that manages to take you by surprise and offer you a really well thought-out experience
 The game itself is visually simple in style, but fantastic in its presentation
 There is a genuine adventure to find here and it can only be achieved if you continue playing it
At first glance, it gives the impression for being a linear puzzle game
 From the mechanics and controls to the environment - it does seem like just an ordinary game that relies on its experimental physics
 Yet, there is a layer of wonder to it and shows us that a lot of love and care went into making it very fun for the player
 Once you've progressed past the first couple of stages, get ready to discover huge areas to explore
You are free to approach each stage however you please
 Many of them encourage creativity since it offers you more than one way of completing an obstacle
 Not to mention that every one of them is challenging enough to feel rewarding at the end, because there is a clear logic to their design
 While the motions of the character may seem confusing at first, you will eventually learn how to control them and be more accurate with their actions
The soundtrack is perfect, helping you relax as you try to figure out the puzzle in front of you, which fits in with the gentle nature of this game
 And if you think the solo playthrough isn't pleasing, then you are in luck
 With split-screen support you can invite a friend over and complete the game together, making the adventure a lot more hilarious
 Go for it
I'm definitely going to recommend Human: Fall Flat

If fun

Early Access Review
One of my favorite games that I have played in the past five years has got to be 7 Days to Die, hands down, maybe even my absolute favorite
Whenever I try out a game, I dont play it for three or four hours before rating it, you're barely into a game to even rate it, in my opinion
 At this moment, I'm 529 hours in, so I felt the time to review it was approaching fast, so here I am
Where do I begin
 Well, I had been scrolling around on YouTube, looking for games to watch people play, when I accidentaly stubled upon this gem
 I only saw Alpha 1 gameplay at the time, which barely resembles what this game is now
 Despite how it looked, I had been looking for a survival base building game for a long time, so I bought it one weekend, and it absorbed my soul and then some
Whenever you first start, you have little to nothing on you
 You have a bottle of water, a bandage, and some food to start with
 You can loot your surroundings to get some basic materials to start making a stone axe to start getting wood to make a simple shack
 If you don't want to build a base in the beginning, you can claim one of the many buildings and fortify it so it works as a home until you decide what you want
This task won't be easy, with zombies added into the mix
 Depending on your difficulty, the zombies might be a niusance or an absolute nightmare to deal with
 Every 7 days, a Zombie horde will come to attack you and destroy the precious progress you've made on your base, hence the name 7 Days to Die
 In those 7 days, you will build your base, and get traps and weapons ready to survive the night and emerge victorious from your base when the morning comes
As the game goes on, it senses how well you're doing
 If you're sweeping through the zombie hordes and haven't died in a while, It will send stronger zombies in more numbers to try to give the hardcorre people a challenge
There is a whole lot I could add into here, but for the sake of people who get bored of reading reviews all day, let me get to my pros and cons
Pros:-Lots of replayability
 You can play a whole lot of this game and get the best stuff, and start all over again on another world with different settings to give your veteran self a bigger challenge, to keep the game fresh
 EDIT: Even though the updates come rarely, there is SO MUCH added each update it's sometimes like you're playing an entirely different game
-Smart building
 You can't just build a castle in the sky here
 There is structual intergity in this game, so if you build a structure incorrectly or a zombie takes out an important support beam, the building could fall apart around you, along with your supplies being cast into the void
-Friendly Community
 This community isn't like DayZ or some of the other communities that have murderous players lurking everywhere, there is a huge variety of servers, some being PvE(Player verses Enemy), others being PvP(Player verses Player), other servers being modded to give the game even more life
Cons:-Updates
 The game does have updates, but they happen at least 3 or 4 times a year, so you will be playing the same thing for at least a couple of months before anything new is added, which is annoying at times
-Learning Curve
 There are games like Space Engineer that have a very steep learning curve that makes casual players not want to pick these games up
 7 Days to Die can have this problem with new players at first, with so much to do and a horde on Day 7 being a problem that might overwhelm some players
 I would reccomend watching some people play this first before jumping in, mainly so you have a vague idea on what you are doing
 After that initial curve, the game definitely gets easier
-Graphics
 If you are a big graphics gamer, then this game might be a bit dissapointing for you
 The models, especially for the players, aren't too pretty to look at
 The zombies are a bit better, but like I said, the graphics are a bit dissapointing to look at
 The landscape is kind of blocky, but It is a minecraft-like game, so it is to be expected
Overall, this is one of my favorite games of all time
 It does have it's flaws, like not super good graphics, a bit of a learning curve, few updates, and the occasional bug, but what it has far outclasses its cons, like solid gameplay, lots of repalyability, and having building physics that make you build smart and realistic
 I would reccomend at least trying this game out, I think that you will enjoy it

( Updates at bottom
 )A friend got this game for me, I looked at the title, looked at the screenshots and groaned
 "Not another 'zombicide game' trying to say it's a 'survival game'
" But he got it for me, and it woud be rude to not atleast give it another shot
 I'm rather glad I did
I started play in a -private game- with my friend, set to the medium difficulty
 Day one was a mess, I figured I was playing another left4dead 'survival' game which was all about killing as many zombies as one humanly can before wandering to the next area
 Well, after breaking a few weapons on zombies and getting no reward outside of what lint was in the zombie's pockets, I knew I was wrong, and night had begun to set in
 My friend luckily -had- played before and warned me that things got a lot different at night, so we managed to make it through with no deaths, but many close calls
50 days in, I'm more than hooked
 Survival is the key- Food, water, scavving, repairs and building at day
 Shelter, security and stealth at night
 Crafting damn near anything in a Alpha game, from multiple layers of cobblestone walls outside of what used to be a log cabin
 Each peice taken the long crafting process of finding rocks, chopping them down into stone and then turning into cobblestone

 We built a second story for storing items

Three friends and I spawn in the wasteland biome
Thought we could make a shelter out of this apartment complex
Was going well at first
Gathered many supplies
Fortified the door
Was supposed to be temporary, started turning into something permanent
Everything was going well
they broke down the door..
Everything went to hell
They started pouring through the stairwell
Dogs everywhere
The only way out was down
Started running down and dodging walkers
We got separated in half
Two of my friends made it out
My other friend and I were still stuck inside
Figured we'd spend the last night, hiding
The moaning of walkers never stopped
Morning came.
It was time
We had to go
My friend and I continued to drill down passed the horde
Got desperate
I jumped out the second floor
Broke my legs
They were everywhere
Managed to limp through the horde
Met up with my other three friendsDon't look back.
We crossed the river into a forest
Started off with a small shack
Turned it into a four house village
We had a wall, a trench around it
We had something
We never did forget about what happened that day in the wasteland
That right there, is just a small story (that wasn't even in full detail) of what 7 Days to Die is like
 Very few may say that "Oh, it's just another zombie survival game" or "Oh, it's just a DayZ knockoff"
 Well, I'm here to tell you that this is not the case at all
 I own H1Z1, DayZ, and 7dtd
 I have to say that this is the best one
 Why
1
 The developers are actually going in the right path.2
 Loot system is pretty awesome.3
 Crafting system is also pretty awesome, may take a bit to get used to
 But, still awesome.4
 Instead of just piling blocks and making a box-house, there are actually physics to the building system
 Like, in some cases, you actually have to put support
 Otherwise that sniper tower or that neat house will collapse on you
 Which has happened to my friends
 It's kind of satisfying to watch, but damn you're mad if it's your structure.5
 The different variety in enemies is cool
 Right now, you have: bees, dogs, and zombies; and other different kind of zombies to add to that.6
 Speaking of zombies
 This game's zombies have something that DayZ doesn't have
 You know..
 They actually pose a threat and can move in numbers
 There are moments when you see that police station surrounded by a horde of zombies and you think to yourself "No, I'm good", because they actually threaten you
 The fact that they sprint at night by default (settings can be changed) also adds a thrill to the game
 To a point in which you don't even want to leave your shelter at night because you can hear a spider zombie calling a nearby horde
 Hordes also happen randomly at anytime and anywhere
 This is also unheard of in DayZ
 You never see a horde in that game
 Also, as the days go on, the zombies start to get a little tougher
 You start to feel that the apocalypse is worsening
 Zombies are also smart.7
 There's nothing more satisfying than fortifying your base to prepare for the undead
 This game does a very good job at that
 You can do almost whatever your mind imagines.
 Wanna put a trench that surrounds your base and put spikes at the bottom of it
 Do it
 Want to salvage land mines from an overrun military base and use them as your own
 Do it
 Want to build a huge wall around your base
 Do it
 However, don't think that just putting a wall around your base will help
 Zombies will rip through it and actually dig under the wall
 We've seen this done in our server before, and it's frustrating, but it's so awesome having to constantly keep maintanence on your base and look for new ways to prevent them and to see your weak spots
These are just some of my points, and you wanna know the awesome thing
 This right here, is just an alpha.

First time playing when it turned night I had no choice but to burry myself in the dirt...
Sitting in the pitch black hole just listening to the insane sounds of the zombies outside
I felt a real rush and fear not knowing what would happen....
Its rare a game can do that to you
Pros:Great extensive crafting mechanicLootingZombies present an actual challenege especially at night when they runMining for resources feels like you actually acomplished somethingCons:DOGS, $^#@ themStill in alpha so some glitches may occurPerformance can be rough on older systems unless you turn graphics all the way downAll in all though i give this game a strong 8/10 -The Fun Pimps seem to care about the game and are quick with fixes-It can be insanely addicting to play-I love the mining and crafting mechanics-The fun to be had in this game is only limited to your own creativity-LOTS OF REPLAY VALUEI am not good at writing reviews but I hope this helps at least one personFINAL VERDICT:

I have been playing this game since Alpha2, it is my and my son's favorite game to play together (he's 14)
 We have written a few suggestions that would increase longevity of gameplay, efficiency and fun.1
 Decrease the stupid wasp noise, way too loud and obnoxious2
 Incorporate rope, and simple machines including but not limited: pulleys for drawbridge function, trip wire, netting, and levers.3
 Equipable ruck sack for additional storage, but decreased speed.4
 Weather
 rain would dampen smell and sound sensed by zombies, slow player..
 etcetera.5
 A zoomable minimap6
 Ladder lock, jump to eject, I have died way too many times falling off of a ladder.7
 Easier book reading for recipes.8
 Laser sight, red dot sight, and mechanical sight
 Add a sword and a spear.9
 Alliances, groups, clans
10
 Big military base instead of those small camps
 a lot of loot a lot of risk.11
 First aid kit to restore either half or full health.12
 Restaurant food prep/ovens and MREs13
 Fall breaking: IE pressing space bar breaks fall.14
 Silencers for the weapons15
 ammo in inventory carries to belt with a reloading speed penalty instead of having to manually transfer16
 Stamina regens faster when undected, slower when detected or hunted

Minecraft was too boring for me (I'm not a creator for creations sake)
Terraria was fun, I enjoyed the additional combat focus
 DayZ didn't have 'it' for me, I didn't like the lack of building (at least when I played it)Ark was fun (dinos
), but it got stale as there was no forced conflict
 No reason to explore, no reason to keep building
 So it fell into the minecraft trap
7 Days to Die allows me to be creative, but gives me a good solid foundation of conflict and purpose to my building
 Not only that, but it creatively forces/encourages me to get out of my safe keep and risk exploring which causes me to engage with the game content in a very enjoyable fashion
This was a recommendation from a friend based on the steam sale, and I've dedicated 90% of my gaming hours to this since I bought it over the holiday break
 Strongly recommend
Posted: 13 November, 2016
Early Access Review
Considering the amount of hours I've poured into this game, I believe a proper review is far overdue
 To give a bit of background, I first discovered this game back when alpha 9 was the current build
 My adventure began when I logged into a singleplayer game in Navezgane with all the settings on easy
 This was the first game of its kind that I had ever played, and I had no idea what to expect or how to play
 This was evident, as I spent my first day sprinting through the Wasteland in which I had spawned, completely panicked because I had no idea what the game controls were and I had no idea how to get the endless trail of zombies off my back
 I never did, either; I ended up dying multiple times and that was where my solo beginning of 7 Days to Die ended
 Then, a few months later when alpha 9 got updated to alpha 10, I convinced my friend to buy the game when it was on sale so that he could help me learn how to play it and actually enjoy it
 He caved, and so our adventure began in Navezgane once more
 Of course, we spawned in the wasteland again, and it was like the horror of my solo journey all over again as we desperately tried to escape the zombies while scavenging for what little supplies we could manage to stop and gather without getting bitten by a dog or smacked by a cheerleader
 By the time the 7th day had rolled around, we had finally gotten a grasp on how to play the game..
 or at least we thought we did at the time
 I say this lightly, as we also considered killing ourselves a better alternative than the progressive zombie infection, broken legs, and the endless dysentery that we always seemed to have - probably because food was so hard to come by that we were filling ourselves with old sham sandwiches, rotten flesh, and raw eggs
 We hadn't the slightest clue that we were completely destroying our chances of survival as our wellness plummeted down from 100 to 60
 Then, our blissful ignorance turned to incredible terror as nighttime rolled around, and the hordes came for us
 We had shacked up in the desert by the river and made twin towers out of the incredibly ineffective log cabin wood, which the sprinting, bloodthirsty masses of zombies tore through in a matter of minutes
 We had little choice but to hide ourselves on our top floors, watching and waiting in horror as the dead simply demolished everything we had spent the last 7 days working for
 But then, in a final moment of hope and desperation, we whipped out the chainsaws we had found and quite literally blasted our way through the masses, only to escape in the night and return in the morning to pick up the pieces and kill off the stragglers
 We considered calling it quits and starting over, but ultimately decided against it and decided to dig ourselves a series of bunkers connected by tunnels across the desert
 As time passed, we became wiser, and we grew stronger
 It was day 35 that we had finally built ourselves and our base up enough to fight off the hordes of the 7th night
 We were victorious
From that game on, we've stayed ever-faithful to this game
 With every new alpha that's been released, we've been waiting on baited breath to launch a new game, each time slowly but surely helping us progress from the dark, early days of alpha 10 to the hardened, survivalist veterans that we are now in alpha 15
 With countless play-throughs on both Navezgane and Random Gen, on servers belonging to friends, random people, and eventually even ourselves, we have learned the game, though we are far from masters
 Each new alpha released is like an entirely new game, and we revel in the chance to start anew and work at the chance to better ourselves and our tactics even more
So, do I recommend this game
 Well, that would depend on what you're looking for, and what you're expecting to take from the game
 You will pour an endless amount hours into this game, you will sometimes regret it, but most of the time you won't
 You will be frustrated, you will be terrified, you will be inspired, you will be determined, you will be devastated, you will be excited
 The accomplishment you will feel is immense, and it will keep bringing you back to this game even when you think it won't
 So, yes, I do recommend this game, because this game is golden, and it just keeps getting better and better
10/10 will continue to be terrified by dogs but explore the wastelands and cities unarmed anyway

Day 1 - Got attacked and almost killed on my first night
 Then I went Rambo
 Fought my way out and ran to a house
 Hid in the attic until the sun came up
Day 2 - Found a few weapons and some rudimentary armor in the house next door
 And the upper half of the owner
 Gotta stay mobile until I find a place to settle in and make it defensible
Day 5 - Snuck around and scavenged houses for food and potable water
 No sign of...people
 Am I the last one alive
Day 10 - Found an abandoned military outpost
 Made a door and barricaded myself inside of the largest tent for now
 Will scavenge the surrounding area during daylight only
Night of the 10th day - They're everywhere
 Oh God
 They walk right by my tent
 I'm cowering in a corner behind a desk with a pistol and a wooden club that I wrapped in some scrap iron
 Only 15 rounds of 9mm for the pistol
 I hope that they don't decide to tear the tent down around me
Day 11 - Began collecting resources
 I think that I'll try sleeping tonight
Day 12 - They woke me up 2 times, but never took notice of me
 I'm glad that I don't snore
Day 25 - Have been fortifying my position, dug a trench to trap the undead
 Only the "Spider Zombies" can get out
 I need to contain them somehow
 Day 50 - Currently I have a fortress surrounded by metal tipped log spike traps 3 deep so they can't escape
 Then I just stand on my roof and snipe the spider zombies
 Collect loot and smile
 I think that I'll be ok
Day 79 - Been farming
 Food is plentiful now
 Weapons and ammo are easy to make
 I built my fortress on top of a deposit of iron, lead and potassium nitrate, with coal deposits poking out of the ground all around me
 What luck
Day 1
 - There's no end to them
 I heard a scream the other night
 Not one of them
 It sounded...human
 Female
 Close
 By the time I made it outside at first light, all I found was a pool of blood and entrails a half mile from my fortress
 Next to the carnage I found a purse with some pictures of a pretty young blonde lady with a cheerleading outfit on in one picture, in another she was in an expensive looking dress cuddled up to who was probably the star quarterback at her high school
 The last picture was her with what must have been her family on vacation at an expensive looking beach house
 They looked so happy
 Her driver's license said that her name was Cindy Batross and she was 17 years old
 There was a notepad with illegible scribbles and crude drawings of people eating each other
 I cried as I realized that she saw my lights and was desperately trying to make it to the safety of my home
 What may have been my only hope for companionship was now in the rotting stomach of the undead
Stardate 4/20 Delta V - Venison stew is good
 It's lonely here
 I found pictures in houses and I talk to the nice people in them
 You want to be my friend, Jimmy
 Ok
 I promise that I won't chew on your bones
 Day whatever - What was that noise
 They scratch inside my skull sometimes
 I saw the cheerleader
 She doesn't have a stomach anymore, but she walks around with a little smile on her face and coos sometimes
 Then she screams when I try to talk to her from my roof
 Maybe I should let her in
 Maybe she just wants to be friends
Night time now
 She didn't want to be friends
 Only my iron helmet kept her from chewing my face off
 I cut her head off with my hunting knife
 She didn't have any manners at all
Hump Day - I sewed her head back on and sat her in a chair
 We talked for hours while I cooked some vension stew for us
 She's nice, but a little cold
 I hope that she's on the pill

I am speechless
I bought this game together with two friends after we ran out of Coop-Games to play
And since this game has been on my wishlist forever, I decided to go with it
 It was on sale, after all
After a 5
5h session on the first sitting, we became addicted
And I mean, really addicted
 Couldn't wait to come home from work and continue
To prepare
To survive
This game is basically a survival-bulding game
 DayZ+Minecraft, to be
really general
You can build and destroy blocks, create furniture, traps, weapons, houses, etc
You can find blueprints and craft even more things
There is also a skillsystem in place where you can teach yourself recepies and f.ex
 craft ammunition
But most of the time you're just gathering resources to set up a base and not die
And of course you alos have to eat, drink, stay warm and dry and not get sick
There are multiple ways to do so and the more you play, the more you'll learn
Pros:- Big world for you to explore (Either a map or randomly generated)- Lots of stuff to craft and build- New enemies with 7 days- Upgrade your weapon parts and build weapons from scratch- Change the world the way you want to
 Dig caves, live in trees, etc
- Play with friends together / against / or alone- A lot of places to discover, change, upgrade and live in
Cons:- It lags when zombies spawn (Down to 20-30fps)- You can get stuck underneath the ground when you join a server- A few minor glitches- Not easy to get started; you need to read most stuff on the wikiOver all, I do recommend this game
In 3 days I logged 23hours of game time and I do not regret it
 There's a lot to do, a lot to plan and a lot of fun involved
 You get better, quicker and smarter with each day & move
If you love a scare, some pressure, crafting, harvesting, looting, creating, building and shooting, this game is for you

Early Access Review
A16 ReviewAs a die hard veteran of this game it has been 'suggested' by various friends on Steam that i write a review
(Write a reivew after only 6,000 hours
 Pfft..
FINE)Away we go..
Buy this game only if you fully understand what Early Access and Alpha stage game development truly mean
This game is incomplete and yet it still is one of most playable and enjoyable Early Access titles on Steam
Watch some current videos and educate yourself on what you're getting into before you buy this game
This game has a steep learning curve and while in game tutorials have been added the game does not hold your hand,Buy this game if you enjoy:-Fully destructable, randomly generated, ludicrously large game worlds
-Zombies-Crafting-Zombies-Survival-Zombie DOGS-Building system with structural integrity-Zombie BEARS-Mining-Exploration-Base defense (A16 added turrents and traps)-And yes, good ole' first person, zombie shootin' goodness
Did i mention that this game is incomplete
Yes
 Well ok then, let's all say it together
7 Days to Die is an Early Access game which means that it is not finished yet
The developer plans on completion sometime in 2018
Updates for the game are about every 6 months
The developer is active but wants the game to be built right so is taking it's time
This game will not run well on a potato
Performance is good but rough on average hardware
Summary: Highly recommended for the reasons listed above
Worth every penny of the $25 i spent on it

No season pass, no day 1 dlc
 No microtransactions to exploit the crafting and level up system..

Do you like Resident Evil
Do you like Silent Hill
Do you like Alan Wake
Do you overall like 3rd person atmospheric survival horror
Did you play and enjoy the first game
If your answer to any of the aforementioned questions is 'yes', then stop what you're doing right now and buy this game
 Let the horror and weirdness galore begin
FULL REVIEW SUMMARY:Now, that I'm almost 80 hours into the game (and still not entirely done yet), I want to share my final thoughts on this incredible experience
 Obviously, it's one of the best games I've played this year and there were a lot of good games
 Now, I'm not good at categorizing reviews, so I'm going to summarize my thoughts as best as I can
First of all, it's inevitable to compare it to the first game and I personally have mixed feelings here
 There were a lot of great things in the first game that are absent in the second, but the second added some needed spice, especially for NG+, which immensely improved the replayability, which was very weird in TEW with the chapter selection nonsense
 Right now, I'm attempting the classic mode and it's a total adrenaline rush
 I know people loved the AKUMU mode in TEW, but it was a bit too much for me to handle, while classic mode is much more manageable
I feel like if you're a diehard fan of the first TEW and RE4, you might be slightly disappointed, since the game ends up feeling way more mature and closer to RE7, minus the 1st person aspect, which to me was a huge plus
 As a side note, I liked RE7, but kept asking myself "why is it in 1st person
", I really hope they'll be back to the classic 3rd person view in the future
 Otherwise, the gameplay felt great
 You got your green gel, but in addition, there's now a crafting system, which really added the much needed variety that the first game lacked
 Both gun play and stealth feel great, mostly letting you decide how you want to approach certain situations
At first, I wasn't on board with the open world sections of the game, but I eventually warmed up to them and now can't even imagine the game without them
 The non open world areas are on a whole different level though, as they are stunning, confusing, horrifying and yet brilliant, as expected from the ingeniously twisted Shinji Mikami
The enemies and especially the villains were great, not as iconic as the first, but still fascinating on their own
 The story is great, while not being a direct continuation per se, but instead expends on a substory from the prequel
 I've seen people debate on whether they should play the prequel and I say absolutely
 While not being as great, at least in my opinion, there are too many references during the sequel, especially some throwbacks to the incredible DLC, that it might get a bit confusing as to what really happened in Beacon
 Again, I highly suggest playing both, if you want the complete story experience, preferably playing both back to back
To wrap it up, I cannot recommend this game enough, as it will sadly be overshadowed by many other great games coming out this Broketober
 If you love 3rd person psychological survival horror, it's a must buy

The true survival horror returned
*Short Version of Review*+ Graphics
 Stem engine is pretty cool
+ Open area gameplay it's deeper than the first game+ Whole new upgrade and progression system+ Now this game have side quest and main quest like an RPG game- This game might be hard for some people- Some movement glitch on Seb and enemy you will see them turn around to the circle for sometimes
My score 9/10This is better than the first game and a lot of new things
 And harder than the first game
 If you asking for real survival horror this is your place
*Long Version*Alright after i cooked this game around 4 hours i should say The Evil Within 2 is really really better than the first game
 This is dark and deeper than the first game
 And so many new shape of gameplay like- Now this time The evil Within 2 is a open area
 This mean you can go anywhere or find some supplies and do some side quest before you rush to the main quest
- New progression system
 Just not only use green gel for upgrade your weapon
 But this time you can upgrade ability like an RPG Game and so many weapon upgrade for the better journey
- A lot of new weapon- AI looks smart than the first game a lot- New enemy type
 Some enemy you can't kill them with a 1 sneak hit
 this make the gameharder and more challenging
And so many things new in this game
 And this time The Evil within 2 is looks like Survival horror than the first game
 Because you have to face a lot of enemy with a little ammo
 You have to be better man on the first game
 Because enemy you've kill they not drop ammo anymore but you just got gunpower for crafting
 That's why this game has be improved stealth system
And you will ending this game or not
 It's all up to you
 Like an RPG game if you explore a lot your character will strong and you got a lot of supplies for use
 But if you go on with only story quest
 you will feel the pain because your character is so weak your weapon is so low damage
I gotta say this is really survival horror than the first one
 Because you can't kill every enemy anymore but you have to choose your way for run or sneak kill on them Or just run away and go on your business
 And with new progression system this is really make The evil within 2 have fun more than first game

To me this is the peak, the cream dela cream when it comes to a pure singleplayer experience
A weak beginning that only draws you in deeper and further, a plot that grows on your spine like the undead that stands behind your back as you read this
 This is a snapshot in how to make a game without cutting content out for DLC, season passes or loot boxes, something that scares me (more then this game) we won't be seeing much of in the future
If you still care about games that gives you chills, want to support creators visions in this media then buy this game, buy it and remember this game when you are playing Resident Evil 14 and think to yourself "where did it all go wrong"
 11/10 - What Mass Effect 2 was to the trilogy and a killer GOTY contender
Posted: 13 October
I'll keep it simple and to the point
The Evil Within 2 is Resident Evil 7 meets The Last of Us
 It combines the third person action/stealth of one with the item conservation and "horror" of Resident Evil
 The game encourages exploration and good aim and minimal use of resources
 A light RPG/crafting system gives an incentive to take risks
And it's got a hot nurse
Posted: 13 October
I decided to write this review a bit early for those on the fence here on the day of release, but I plan to write a more proper review later once I've finished the game
 So I've played this game for 9 & a half hours at this point, and barely just finished Chapter 4 (of 15+ chapters)
 First hour and a half was taking it slow and exploring around in the first two chapters, the next six & a half hours was Chapter 3 and doing EVERYTHING you could in the open world level, 30-45 minutes was committed to me doing the special shooting gallery minigames added to the Save Area once you reach Chapter 4 and getting all the rewards, and then the last 45-60 minutes was going through Chapter 4
I should mention I'm playing on Nightmare difficulty, and playing with almost all my HUD off
 Only things I kept on were my reticle, item pick-up info, and some stuff for later like partner health gauge
Posted: 14 October
Didn't expect it to beat the first game but it did by a mile
 Difficulty has increased, the story got even more twisted, enemies are more interesting, free roam, side quests
 Everything that I liked in the first game seems to be amplified in EW2 so, can definitely recommend
Posted: 21 October
I created this world, you cannot keep me here
The Evil Within 2 fixes many things from the first installment but some of the things I liked was also gone
You are
Leon
Sebastian, trying to find a girl in a town where everything went wrong and must use everything at your disposal to get to her..
if you are playing on classic mode difficulty, that is
 The game is not that hard to be honest, even in nightmare difficulty after you upgraded some abilities and guns
 If you are familiar to action-adventure genre, this game won't challenge you much
 The design of the monsters that appear in the town are good enough for me, but it's the boss designs that I'm underwhelmed with
 In the first game, every boss was unique and some of them even had their own little backstory
 They were memorable
 In this one, the antagonists are unique and do have their backstory which is great but they lost their creepiness
 Only the chainsaw lady freak and the ''obscura'' is what I liked in terms of looks
 Also, the final boss is better than the final boss of the first game but is still bad
Shoot the glowing parts, really
The semi-open world style areas are not a bad addition in my opinion but I can understand if some players don't like it
 It's a good thing the developers didn't just make the whole game resolve around in the same big area
 There is variety, as you progress you start to visit different linear and semi-open areas
 The environment design is nice and detailed, it is not boring to look at
Now, onto the good parts :) + Controls are much better
 You don't automatically stand up when you aim anymore, don't have to stand still while using syringes, can reload while sprinting and stealth is much more polished with the addition of stealth upgrades for Sebastian
+ Upgrades are separated into two parts and the addition of crafting
 No more using green gels for upgrading guns
 Instead, you have to collect weapon parts to upgrade your guns
 Another new addition is high-grade weapon parts and red gel, you use these two items to unlock the next tier in upgrades, these are found or given to you as you progress in the story
 This system prevents you from upgrading to the top tier from the very start so you don't get overpowered in one category
 Also, you can craft ammunition in workbenches using less crafting items or on the run using more items
 + Better voice acting
 I admit the lines can be cheesy at times but still Sebastian is not dull and actually has a personality
+ The story
 A father who feels guilty and trying to find his own daughter story is as generic as it sounds but what makes the story interesting is the involvement of mobius and STEM
 I also would like to thank the developers for answering most of the questions that were asked in the first game and not forgetting the events of it AND building up on it
 But I still have 2 questions: 1
How did Sebastian and his team went into the STEM in the first game and why
2
WHERE IS MY BOY JOSEPH
 + You don't find the story interesting
 It is still fun to play
+ A polished game overall
If you were a fan of the first game: + Tatiana
+ That part after you reach Theodore
 + That feeling I got when I opened last projector slide ;_; and after I talked to kidman about it
In the end, I think this is a solid sequel
 Thank you Tango Gameworks
 and thank you for reading
 :)

Product received for free
As someone who really disliked the first game, I had a lot of fun with the sequel
 Combining open world gameplay with more linear environments, allowing for stealth or combat against enemies and catering to both casual and hardcore survival horror fans
The Evil Within 2 tells a pretty interesting story about a guy stuck in a nightmarish world trying to make sense of things and just rescue his daughter
 It's scary at times, action packed but always pretty polished
 New Game Plus mode allows high replayability and there's plenty of unlockables and collectibles for completionists
 With an I7, GTX 1080 and 16gb ram I've had no peformance issues either and the game looks stellar most of the time
 If you didn't enjoy the original game maybe wait until it's on sale, but otherwise I'd say check it out

10/10 RecommendPros: + The developers keep updating the game for free (third one so far)+ A lot of different scenarios and other modes+ Possibility for so much uniqueness and creativity
 I never realised how creative I was, but this game is pushing my potential
+ Workshop content
 Sometimes, I am unable to create super-awesome things, but luckily, hundreds of other people can and they upload all their creative creations online
Cons:- Requires a lot of time and patience to practice the placing of objects and creating your artistic vision- I find that there is a limiting restriction on building walls and roofs, which might leave you a bit dissatisfied
 I am sure there is a work-around by using much more objects as resources, but it is more tedious than I'd like it to be
 TLDR: Amazing game, get it as long as you can be patient to learn and to explore your creativity

A Roller Coaster Theme Park Sandbox Gamehttps://www.youtube
com/watch
v=L7OMZxjZUbAThere's a lot to love about this game, but i'm just going to mention a few things that surprised me
+ Workshop support
Some people have created some unbelievable roller coasters and theme parks that are absolutely amazing
 Even if you don't care about designing your own park or own rides you can easily find user created ones and ride them yourself which to me was extremely entertaining
( I suggest checking out the Walking Dead Roller Coaster, Alice in Wonderland, and one called "Dread Horror Roller Coaster" which has it's own custom music )+ You can import your own sound or music files for any ride in your park, and it's extremely simple to do so
 + Designing my first roller coaster was surprisingly simple and very intuitive
 It'll take maybe 5-10minutes to learn, but once you do you will be able to build anything you can imagine and test them out
+ First person view for every ride in the park
 There's also multiple other camera angles, and for me it was a joy to just watch people ride all the rides in the park
+ Water raft rides and Go Karts
+ Loads of other rides all of which you might see at real theme parks+ A sandbox mode with unlimited money+ A variety of challenge levels that have you fixing up a not-so-good pre-built park
+ The soundtrack of planet coaster which plays in the main menu and in-game is absolutely wonderful
 Very relaxing and uplifting
- If a ride is too scary people won't ride it
 While this may be "realistic" I was very disappointed in this
 I like to build elaborate insane roller coasters, and it's a shame no one in the park will ride it..
even if it's free..
 :,(- There's not very many pre-built shops or decorations
The one's that they give you at the start also have wildly different themes, and don't seem to fit in very well unless you design your own
- Strangely enough, I didn't really get into the whole thrill of designing my own park
 Once you get a few shops, some rides, and plop down some staff the game plays for you and there's really not very much "management" to be found

Does for RollerCoaster Tycoon
 what Cities Skylines did for SimCity

How do you manage the expectations of a 10 year old obsessed with roller coasters
He thought this game would be the same as walking around Thorpe Park which he adores
But on every level this game has exceeded his hopes
He can build dramatic roller coasters with some effortless clicks, he can follow the amazing looking people as they walk around and it's like he's really there
When first water rides were released he couldn't believe how amazingly realistic the water is, or how the animatronics moved and worked
The game has grabbed him and allows him to be incredibly creative - he loves the rides but because creating the scenary is so simple and intuitive he's not just creating rides but making them look beautiful too
The sounds, the sights, the excitement and sheer immersion of this game is outstanding and full of depth and imagination
Being combined with Steam Workshop means he can use and be inspired by other people's creations too
And when he's in bed I can play with the scenarios and tinker with the endless array of management settings too but all I'm really hoping for is that Frontier make a theme park world I can land my ships from Elite: Dangerous on

Brilliant game
The true successor to RCT3
The level of detail you can attain in this game is staggering
I just spent 2 hours designing a toilet building
Posted: 3 April
Going into Planet Coaster I had high expectations
 I hadn't played theme park games for a while and heard great things about Planet Coaster
 Besides that, It's from the developers of Rollercoaster Tycoon 3
Starting out I decided to try the career mode, something I recommend all of you to do
 It explains the basics of the game throughout all of the missions and shows you a bit what the game has to offer
 At first, the game seemed flawless
 Everything about it was perfect
 But although Planet Coaster is one of the best games i've played in while, it has it's flaws
So what exactly are these flaws i'm talking about and are they really that important for your experience
 Well.
 That depends on why you're buying Planet Coaster
The main flaw with the game seems to be the management system
 At first it seems great, but soon enough you'll find out it doesn't really have that much depth in it
 Now is it really all that bad
 No
 there's still a decent amount of management to be done
 From choosing the prices of your rides to deciding how much salt you wanna sell on those delicious frites
 Unfortunately sometimes you get the feeling not every decision you make in the management part of the game really matters all that much
 The game is more build focussed
 With a ton of scenery items you can pretty much create/recreate everything you want
 And building is really well done
 Yea it has it flaws, like objects needing to be split from a building in order to rotate/place it properly etc
 but overall it works really good
 Often enough i found myself casually building looking at the clock only to realize i've already been working the whole night on this small building since the game offers you so much options
 A few downsides to the building system however are: Water being really hard to place and creating coasters can be difficult thanks to the Fear/Excitement/Nausea ratings
 Now 1 thing needs to be said when writing a review about Planet Coaster
 the game looks absolutely gorgous
 The cartoonish style, the water effects, the lights at night, the details and animations
 It's just looks perfect
 The game runs really smooth aswell, until..
 you start building a real park from scratch
 At first everything seemed to run great, but after a couple of thousand objects the game starts to lagg/stutter especially when zooming in or out
 And yea, you will have thousands of objects in your park
 Creating a ride will easily put you at 1-2 thousand objects
 But i still found myself walking/flying through my own park often enough just because everything looks and sounds so amazing
 Because yea, the sound in this game is amazing aswell
 People cheering, the water and all of the different ride sound effects make it feel like a real theme park
 The support this game gets is insane, and it gives me hope
 Apparently there are still developers out there that care about their game after release
 Lots of free updates with bug fixes, new scenery, new rides/coasters and even new mechanics are are being released every couple of weeks
 Next to these amazing updates, the developers actually take time to interact with the players
 They listen to what their fans want and every week they feature the best creations placed on the workshop in their stream
Before buying, just keep in mind, this game is aimed mostly towards building
 This requires you to be a bit creative otherwise you'll find yourself with a lack of ideas since the game doesn't have that much premade scenery/rides
 However, the workshop makes up for that part in my opinion
 Besides that i highly recommend this game
 It's probably one of the best, if not the best theme park game you'll found out there, atleast for me it is

I've been a stubborn RCT 1&2 fan for over 10 years now
 RCT3 was a dissapointment, and after that I felt like the series was lost
 Enter Planet Coaster
 I must admit I was skeptical at first..
 but this game is absolutely fantastic
 Everything, from the satisfaction of curved paths, to the terraforming and the massive choice of rides is spot on
 Coaster building is intuitive and the game just looks gorgeous
 Highly recommend not only for disenfranchised RCT fans, but also fans of this genre
Posted: 27 June
Pros:- Sandbox Mode- Story mode- Steam workshop- Coaster building system- The amount of detail that can go into customizing something- Frontier Studios helped- No DLC- Free Updates- A good Time Waster- Can optimize on A bad Graphics card (I have a GeForce 640)Cons: - I didnt buy this sooner

The Rollercoaster Tycoon games were near and dear to my heart growing up
 I love management and tycoon games, and for whatever reason the magic of theme parks made a really great video game
 Ive lost hours and hours to the scenarios in RCT 1, building in the sandbox in RCT 2, and playing with various trainers to break the game how I see fit
 RCT 3, however, marked a rough transition into 3D
 There were a lot of problems with the game, and I honestly never enjoyed them very much
Theres business drama of some sort with the ownership of the name of the game, and there actually is an Atari published successor to RCT 3 called Rollercoaster Tycoon World, but apparently the verdict is that the entire thing is a hot mess
 The folks who developed RCT 3, Frontier Development, went on to create Planet Coaster as a spiritual successor to the RCT series
Although I didnt enjoy RCT 3 very much, Ive really loved my time with Planet Coaster, and I can already tell that Im going to be spending a nasty amount of time with this game
 There is a lot to digest here, and I think that a lot of the criticisms I have wont apply to the majority of people who would be interested in buying this game
 I think it is necessary to give the game two ratings  one for casual folks who are looking for a fun tycoon game, and one for people who have a Drexler patched copy of RCT 1
It really seems as if Frontier aimed to make this game primarily a sandbox game with a dependence on user-generated content
 The campaign is amazingly short, and some missions can actually be finished in a matter of seconds on accident
 There are tons of coaster types, shop types, and scenery objects but very few ploppable pre-built options
 The shops you can place down are little 1x1 generic box-shaped grid pieces that are clearly meant to be built upon, and the game also defaults you into a building view for constructing something around it
 Very few sample coasters exist to play with
 There are tons of generic scenery and building blocks for building cool stuff, though
 If youre willing to spend hours building things, youre in luck
The workshop support is really easy
 You open it up in the shift+tab menu, subscribe to something, and it is immediately in your game
 The workshop tagging needs a lot of cleaning up right now, and it can be difficult to find quality content
 Even though the integration is pretty simple, it isnt very fun to go hunting for good content to use in your maps
 The really complex workshop items also sometimes come unfinished due to built-in limits the workshop has, which makes me wonder because this game really emphasizes the user-created content aspect
 Ive downloaded more than one item that requires me to build the roof, or place the paths, and it can get really frustrating to finish these things sometimes
 Downloading maps and other things that people have worked on is a lot of fun, there are some really incredible things out there
A huge problem I had with RCT3 is that building precisely in a 3D space is difficult
 I have similar problems with Cities: Skylines when compared to Simcity 4; 3D spaces end up with weird curves and other buggy moments when building things
 Planet Coaster is also victim to this
 Youll probably end up with lots of oddly shaped pathways and coaster supports
 This is a difficult problem to explain but it becomes really evident when youre trying to connect curved pathways together that are at slightly different angles
 Theyll never couple together cleanly and leave weird gaps
I have a lot of Quality-of-life problems that I wish this game had
 I wish I could have my coasters constantly testing without a janky workaround, and I wish I could run ghost trains instead of constantly crashing real trains
 If Im in a scenario trying to build a coaster, its goofy that I can keep crashing my trains and hitting the peeps and nobody seems to mind
 I feel like nobody on earth wants to delete their entire roller coaster when they hit the delete key while placing paths after they built a coaster
 The UI is really ugly and feels like it is in beta still, and it is tough to navigate to find what I need
I feel like the way the game measures stats for rides is somewhat broken, because Ill have a coaster that has a great rating up until the last ten seconds where it brakes going into the station and slows down, and that little section will kill the average of my coaster making everyone think it is boring
 I had a coaster in one map with a 135mph top speed and a 100 meter drop with tons of twists and lots of great moments, but because the last thirty seconds were a slow moment to ease back into the station, people in my park thought it was boring and avoided riding it
 I used to be able to build incredible coasters in RCT1/2 (9+ excitement), but I cant seem to break 5 excitement in Planet Coaster
I have a lot of things I could say about this game, but ultimately Steam has a review limit, so Im going to wrap it up
 I would not recommend this game if you are looking for a management game, or if the scenarios were the meat of your playtime in RCT1
 Youll likely blow through the scenarios very quickly, and youll definitely be frustrated at the lack of ploppable coasters and buildings
 If you dont enjoy sitting down to work on the right angle to bank your coasters, I would probably recommend skipping this game
If youre looking for a really hardcore sandbox to spend hours building the monster roller coaster of your dreams, this is probably your game
 After all of your hard work setting up trigger points, banking turns, measuring speed, you can sit down and ride your coaster
 Riding things is pretty damn fun after all your work is done
If you also like to download things from the workshop, and think you could get a lot of fun out of downloading crazy things that people have spent hours working on, you could probably eek some good time out of this
I have a tough time giving a good rating to this game, but I also dont feel like it is a bad game
 I feel like it is a lazy game
 I dont get why they didnt include more ploppable samples for players to use
 There are tons of coaster types, at least two dozen, and then there are something like seven sample coasters
 Thats just silly, and these depressing numbers carry over to every part of the game
 I dont get why there are only nine measly scenarios
 The sandbox maps the game ships with are boring flatlands
 The whole thing feels janky
But I know the potential this game has
 With very little time since the game has released, folks have already build some incredible stuff
 Im very curious what is to come
Whether or not you'll like this game boils down to whether or not you like intense creative sandboxes
 This is not a good management game, even if the game makes an attempt at being one
 The potential is certainly here, since you have some pretty powerful control over certain aspects of the park, such as opening times (which doesn't seem to change anything), staff management, and customizable options with vendors
 The management side of the game can be totally trivialized by putting down a cluster of shops and rides very close to your entrance
 Congratulations on the money farm
 If you're the kind of person who played Rollercoaster Tycoon, placed a balloon shop, and thought to yourself about how annoying it was that the balloon shop was a few pixels taller than all the other shops requiring an entirely special setup to fit it inside a building, then Planet Coaster just might be the game for you
 This is the spiritual successor to those hundreds of hours we spent as a kid playing RCT1 with the Drexler patch and a trainer, or building sandbox coasters in RCT2, and even riding your custom rides in RCT3
Posted: 20 April
I abslolutely LOVE this game
I am in my 40s and I actually design attractions for real parks for a living
Alot of people talk about the lag and the game play
I have found that if you keep simplicity in mind and create large parks with only scenery where the guests would see it in reality, keep your que lines decorated with simple landscaping and flora, use only a few props for decorating purposes and keep a nice clean and open approach, you will have seamless and enjoyable play
It is very realistic in it's management, marketing and security features, as well
If you start with a small area, only allow 200 in your park, let it become popular, then add an area, allow another 100 people in and so forth
You will find that the park almost runs itself with very little problems
I am an old school RCT player
I have created rides and content for RCT3 for a long time
This game made all of that so much easier and the ability to share creations with others is one of the best features of this game
Would I change anything
Not really
Frontier seems to be on top of things and the updates and customer service is near perfect
So in closing, remember this: There are folks like myself out here using this program to create the new and exciting things you see in the real world every day and using it to test reactions and popularity
It is truly a theme park creator in the most literal sense

As someone who has done a lot of mechanical work on their cars over the years, I am happy to say that Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is accurate in many ways
However, it does lack a number of key components of any wrenching session, such as..
-The "This Bolt is so Badly Rusted and Seized That No Amount of Breaker Bars, Impact Wrenches or Penetrating Oil Can Help You Now" puzzle;-The "DO YOU FEEL LUCKY, PUNK
" EZ-Out Bolt Extractor Mini-Game;-The "Dropped a Nut in the Engine Bay and it Didn't Hit the Floor" experience;-The "Broke a Thousand-Dollar Part While Attempting to Fix a Ten-Dollar Part and Now I'm Inventing New Swear Words" vocabulary game and its companion, "Throw the Wrench Across the Garage in a Fit of Rage"; and-The "Desperate Run to the Parts Store Five Minutes Before Close" racing game
Oh, I almost forgot about the ever-popular "Roll to Hit Your Head on Everything Between the Floor and Ceiling" skill check
Come to think of it, that's exactly why this game is pretty enjoyable - all of the wrenching without any of the frustrations that come along with it
In all seriousness, it could use a couple things (for example, removing an engine whole instead of piece-by-piece, then tearing down the engine on a stand outside the car), a bit of polish here and there and, of course, more cars and more customisation (performance parts, tuning and engine swaps would be great
), but overall, CMS 2015 stands well on its own as it is

I almost gave thumbs down..
 but the game is well-made and it's very relaxing to play it
I learned a bit about car parts, but this game could have more information about parts:-what they are for-if they break what are the consequence and symptoms-how can we damage those parts (so we don't do it IRL)The game is nice, but If we learn more about mechanic this game it would be much cooler

This is among the few simulator games such as Euro Truck Simulator and farming simulator that actually does a good job
 Game runs smoothly, has minimal bugs, well designed and is fun
Pros:+Manage your own car garage+Nice textures and models+Test driving+Garage customization+Minimal bugs and glitches+Runs at 60 fps+Developers are actively working on improving and adding features to gameNeutral:~Needs more cars (coming soon in dlc)~Would like to see more cables and parts under engine hood (bit empty atm)~Different engine types would be interesting (diesel, hybrid, older style engines, vans)Cons:(Remember the developers are actively working on this game)-Career mode could use a few more features (ranking, economy, business decisions)-Some UI improvements can be made (selling and buying multiple parts in tedious)-Main car parts are in cars however fuel lines, brake lines, radiator pipes, electrical cables etc are absent

I come from Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 and found that it (CM Sim 2014) was enjoyable but once I beat the game for the first time and played some of the DLC I felt like I didn't have a reason to pick the game up
 When I heard about Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 being in crowdfund mode I was hesitant to put more money down as I felt like it'd be the same thing
 A decent time waster until you beat the game
 After looking at what they had so far I started to get excited for the title and immediately pledged enough to get the game when it was released
 I received my code earlier today and began playing it
 The menu is completely different and I found it to be fluid and well designed
 It immediately gave me a good vibe
 I quickly and eagerly created a profile and began playing
 As soon as I started working on the car I automatically fell in love with how it felt
 In the previous title it felt like the menus were slow and sluggish
 It felt like a burden just to check my inventory
 In CMS 2015, that's not the case
 The keys are simple and understandable yet pay homage to the original title
 Taking off and putting parts on was a breeze
 I found myself immerse and even at times swearing like I was working on a real car
 Not even kidding
 At one point when it told me I had to replace a Piston I was like "Man forget this game
" yet I quickly dove into the top end and just started taring down and enjoying it
 It's immersive and easy at the same time
 I played for 4 hours before I could even test drive a car, but it was worth the wait
 I've messed around with the Auction house and that's a great perk
 I gave myself a budget and immediately surpassed it because, well 'because I can'
 This game feels endless and fun
 Fluid, good looking and immersive
I was how ever, disappointed in the fact that when you purchase a car on the auction house, you're required to put back what was on it
 For example, I couldn't put a dual carb intake when I took off a single carb intake
 It was disappointing as I am a big mechanic head, I love to be able to upgrade rather than replace
 I was equally disappointed at the lack of aftermarket body parts
 I was hoping for a hood scoop or two, but unfortunately nothing
 These aren't game breakers though
 I will still enjoy this game daily
 Hopefully, they will update the game with either a DLC or a base patch that will allow you to do a motor swap in the auction cars
 TL:DR version: Game is fun, fluid and immersive
 Way better than 2014 and in my opinion, should be in any gear heads library, or just anyone who wants to play a good car game
 Looks great as well

I own an American muscle car custom garage..
 so the content in this game is something I'm familiar with
I'll say that, yes this is a game..
 and a good one
But, it is a casual sim and not so much like a Falcon flightsim
For example, changing the brakes on a car is one thing, but in this game you don't have to spend time bleeding brake lines or..
 running brake lines or electrical lines
In real life, gremlins in the electrical systems (wiring harness, fuses, etc) are what takes up so much of my time
In this game..
 they're not even there..
 really (unless you count ignition wiring)
That could be a blessing or a curse because I hate testing 2 miles of insulated copper wire with a multimeter just to figure out why a car has a mysterious parasitic power drain
In this game..
 you're either blessed to not have that tedium or let down without having that real sim experience
Overall, it is a fun GAME
Little to no bugs
I only wish the market allowed me to reference my parts list from the build order so I didn't have to go run under the car every time I forgot what suspension part I needed
Overall, I rate it an 8/10
Posted: 7 November, 2015
A view from one who both enjoys driving and also swings spanners for a living
TLDR version - A very basic introduction into light vehicle components that feels like it needed another 3 months before release
 CMS 2014 is more realistic in many ways - sideways evolution not revolution
Graphics are decent, sounds are reasonably realistic if simple
 Music is passable for the first half hour, then gets turned off
 An ingame jukebox with your own mp3 folder linked would be great
Into the reason why we play games - gameplay
 The main suspension types (live axle and independant) are well represented along with engine choices
 What is lacking is any customisation
 Once you've put together 20 or so cars the excitement fails and you feel like you're grinding toward a goal you can't see
 You cannot change parts from one car to another to improve horsepower or weight like Redline Racer 2 or similar (incidently a very good car modification game but very buggy)
In my case, I was grinding for 9k experience, the point in which you can buy parling spaces to get cars from the auctions
I hit 9k, spent my 50g then went shopping at the auctions
 Bought an absolute beater for far more then it was worth and took it home
 Stripped, rebuilt every component I could, replaced everything else and then looked for a place to market my rebuilt ride
That's strange, I have no auction option..
that's right
 You can only sell the cars you buy for a set sum dependant on condition and model, not feed it back to the auction where you bought it
 You get paid a minor 'restoration bonus' and actually end up almost even steven from where you started, which considering you've just spent the better part of 30-45mins rebuilding this thing is....
disappointing to say the least
This seems to underutilise the potentially exciting platform of the auction
 Why couldn't we walk the lot before the auction, checking out the cars beforehand or even meet other bidders
Also on bidding, it seems a very simple but random process - you're not sure why one model car sells for more then the same model in similar condition because you're literally given no information on each unit
 Zero
 Can't even pan around to see how many panels are missing
Another lost oppurtunity is the test track - this could have been much larger and give the player a challenge or at least a reason not to on-sell a car but alas no
 Mods are enabled so the community will probably come to the rescue but they shouldn't have to
 The pan speed is excellent however not being able to do anything while draining oil or lowering/raising a car on the hoist is immensely frustrating, can't even check the job sheet
This game is worth money
 How much though
 To someone like me who already has a sound knowledge base on car mechanics, maybe $5-10
 The content there is well done with no bugs I can see which is a pat on the back
 I understand it uses DLC and I've bought a couple already, but misses clear oppurtunities to shine using platforms already existing in the game and offers little direction or encouragement to continue either doing customer jobs or rebuilding auction cars
 You will get bored at less then 20 hours
If you want a better understanding of cars, this is a good start at least in names of components and different types of suspension
 Some little AVIs on how the different suspensions compare to one another in practise would be great to better educate those who wish to play this game as a learning tool
A good crack at a title, but over far too quickly with little replay value
EDIT
-
After playing the 2014 complete version I must say there appears to be more tangible goals at least on the Tuning and 4WD addons, in addition to 2014 having more realistic graphics and engine components (actually has intake from filter housings to throttle bodies unlike 2015)
 Unfortunately 2014 has slow component removal speed and slow mouse speed and still has limited content.
The best CMS would be an amalgam of the best attributes of both with casual/hardcore mods with more complex components and tuning/mix match options

Over simplified and a bit repetitive after a while
 Good fun for a car nerd like me though
Posted: 3 April
I played this game for a night, a while ago
 As a mechanic in real life, I enjoyed the game and figured I'd check back in on it eventualy
 Such a great base for a game but a couple small things would really bring it forward and keep the game play fresh
 I guess I need more on the management side of it
Fun way to learn some things about cars, although perhaps the game would be harder for people who don't already understand vehicles
I'd change my vote if they had addressed some of the player's complaints to simplify and complicate various parts of the game
As you level up, it would be nice if you have someone who brought the car to a lift and took the wheels off
 Or you could provide orders to someone to keep a job moving or put a job back together after you finished the difficult part of it
 Or have a rookie who can do the oil change for you
 An experienced mechanic RARELY finds himself performing basic services
Parts ordering: 2 years and not a single improvement has been made
 With experience, I should be able to get parts on the way or make a check list as to what I need and then go to the computer to have it ordered
 I thought the tablet would do this and it doesn't
Typically a mechanic has a list he hands off to someone, and they get the stuff on the way
 Would love to see this
I'd also enjoy the challenges of delayed payments, as in the vehicle does just magically fly off the lift and cash goes into the account
 You could have your assistant call to inform the customer the car is done, bring it to the parking lot and let you know your ETA on their pick up

Inspired by Car Mechanic Sim, I fixed my broken car and saved $600
 It worked
10/10
Posted: 1 June, 2015
I would really recommend Car Mechanic Simulator for everyone who is interested in cars and how they work
 If you have the previous version of this game (Car Mechanic Simulator 2014) and you like it, I still recommend buying the new version since there is a significant update over last version: cars now have much more parts, engines and car bodies can be disassembled and repaired
 Now in later stages of game you can buy cars, repair them and sell for profit
 The game today also got a FREE content update in form of a new car to repair, the developers said there will be more free content updates
 I as a car fan find this game really enjoyable and recommend this to everyone who is interested in cars

Early Access Review
In my years ive spent time working on cars
 I know enough about them to pretty much know how to put one together so i figured this wouldnt be too bad
 Part 1: What a peice of junk
 There strewn about me was dozens of engine parts all along the shelfing
 I recognize many of them and i think to myself hey, this wont be too bad
 2 hours go by
 Part 2: Fear and loathing in finland
I knew nothing
 All of the stress
 All of the hair pulling frustration and gut wrenching heartake of wasted time is encapsulated perfectly by this game
 That point in your project where youre so keyed up you have to just walk away and go to town for a drink at the pub
 Its all there
 Its the most realistic simulation of a project car that ive ever seen
Part 3: My moment of glory
After 7 hours of toiling
 Putting the engine together
 Finding a part i missed
 Taking it back apart
 All of the constant pain and suffering
 I finnally lower the engine and transmission into the car body
 I find all the linkages and hoses and connect everything
 I put in oil
 I put in coolant
 I put in what little gasoline i have
 Not time to hook up the driveshafts yet
 i must test the engine
 I jump into my bare body car
 Id only bothered to put in the basics things
 The seat
 The shifter
 The steering wheel
 Id assembled the wheels and such of course
 The only missing basic necessity was the driveshafts and probably the exaust pipe
 Wasent needed for a test run though
 I lean to the right
 I hit the ignition
 It turns
 Turns
 Turns
 IT HAS STARTED
 THE ENGINE HAS STARTED
 It sounds horrible
 Its missing
 Its stuttering
 But it RUNS
Part 4 Why does this always happen to me
 I hear what can..
 only be described as a slight cluck
 The engine stalled
 I suppose it had run out of fuel
 I look and it had
 I try to put some more in and do so
 I get back in to start it up
 Tickticktick
 Its not turning over
 I get out and look at it
 Then down in the pit over which id parked i notice something
 a small part..
The starter had fallen out
I recommend my summer car to anyone that has ever worked on a car before
 Also to anyone who thinks they know everything about how cars work
 Is it 100% full on accurte in every respect
 No
 I dont think any game can be
 But its the closest thing to actually working on a car that ive ever encountered
 I now have to pull the engine back out of the car and try to get the starter back on while figuring out what went wrong in the first place
 Some projects never end
Oh yeah theres like a survival thing too but i mean
 All you have to do is not die like in real life
 Some people might find that harder than others
 PS: To the creator of this game
 If you could somehow make this game or a similar concept in multiplayer i will give you my soul

 buddy tells you about this game2
 you think about all the last 5 games you took a chance on and put it off3
 your buddy keeps mentioning the game4
 you have some cash in your steam wallet so you say heck it5
 you've put together real life cars so you walk around the garage and the empty shell of a car like it's a bug on the bottom of your shoe6
 go have a beer7
 go back into the garage with confidence8
 30 min later you finally figure out how to tighten bolts9
 drink several more beers10
 start listing what you would do to the person that designed a car that uses odd sized fasteners11
 more beer12
 curse at the bolts that have zero visual reference to the spanner that it needs13
 more beer14
 your eyes become hazy as you finally drop the motor in late into the night15
 eat your pack of sausages and drink yourself to sleep16
 wakeup realizing you need food and fluids to get that pile of turds running17
 fumble around the van for 15 minutes before you finally get moving18
 get on the highway and immediately disregard all law enforcement19
 realize where the store is after 3rd time driving by it20
 buy the entire store21
 you're thirsty af so you have some milk cuz driving under the infuence is bad22
 die on the highway by police brutality23
 alot of death, beer and sausages later - the car finally starts24
 several trips to the store making the brake fluid manufacturer rich cuz it took 10 bottles of brake fluid to figure out you suck at tightening line fittings25
 get frustrated with the leaks and overall terrible state of the vehicle you built26
 wonder where you went wrong with your life over several beers27
 crippling depression hits hard
you stop cleaning yourself.28
 distract yourself from suicidal thoughts by driving around the septic truck and pumping out everyone's crap29
 driving into the night realizing your life is nothing but a magnet of turds as the beer bottles clank around the floor of the cab30

Early Access Review
The developer sums up the experience of this game perfectly on his site, and it's worth quoting again;Originally posted by ToplessGun: I am making this game because this game needs to be made
 This is not made because this is fun game, but because it is NOT
 So right from the off you should be aware that this game will require the patience of the god of thunder himself
 There is virtually nothing in the way of instant gratification sent your way
 Every single Finnish markka is hard earned by doing jobs in the septic truck or chopping firewood, as is every tiny bit of bolt-tightening progress you make with building the car
Where this differs from other games is how entertaining the developer has made the traditionally grindy process of making cash
 Every time you venture out in a vehicle and leave the relative safety of your home in Kesselinper, you are putting your life in your hands
 If you don't manage to slide off the narrow dirt track and bury yourself into a pine tree, then you have to run the gauntlet of playing chicken with a drunken lunatic in a little green Fiat
If you survive this and somehow make it to the paved highway, you still run the risk of getting killed by an errant moose, crashed into head-on by the infamous Techno Viking, or getting chased by the police for not stopping at a checkpoint
 And then when you finally arrive at your destination the odds are the store will be closed/the mechanic doesn't work weekends/you forgot your parts order back home/you fall into a septic tank and die
 Brutally unforgiving in every respect
Same goes for building the car, miss tightening a bolt all the way on one part, and all the others will gradually work loose as you drive
 My first build made it 200 metres down the road before the front left wheel fell off and took most of my suspension with it
 So I dragged it back to the garage with the tractor and tried again
 Despite being so unforgiving, and usually just giving up on games which treat the player with such disdain (like I did with Dark Souls) I found myself becoming obsessed with getting the car working properly, passing the inspection in town, and upgrading it to go rallying
 You find yourself forming a love/hate relationship with the thing, surely a feeling everyone who runs and maintains an old car IRL can identify with
So the developer's stated goal of 'realism' at whatever cost has actually produced a game which creates an incredible feeling of achievement when something finally goes right for you
 It's the same buzz people talk about when they finally beat that boss in Dark Souls after hours of trying
 But in this game there's no memorizing of moves or anything like that
 Just keeping yourself alive is an accomplishment - the rest of the time you're free to enjoy the endless Finnish summer, using the sauna at the lake house, visiting the pub, or simply getting drunk on home-made kilju and running amok around town
Once you add all your favourite music to the 'radio' folder, tinkering with the car in the garage becomes relaxing, almost therapeutic
 You shouldn't start building with the intention of getting it finished as fast as possible so you can race - this will probably end with you dying horribly later on
 It's more of a 'James May' kind of simulator than a 'Jeremy Clarkson'
If you're someone who's willing to put time in to learn the controls (2 minutes watching a gameplay video is enough to give you the gist of what to do) and who has an attention span longer than 10 minutes you will find this a very rewarding and hilarious game about life for a kid in 90's Finland
 There is a breathtaking amount of content and fun to be had for what is essentially a rough-around-the-edges Unity game still in early access
Oh, and press 'N' to swear
 You'll need that

Simply put, one of the hardest, most frustrating, most obnoxious games I have ever played
There are no tutorials
Nothing is in English
You know nothing
Suddenly you're dead and broke and your car has exploded
You scream "F$@# this game" at the top of your lungs
And then suddenly you figure out how to put your first part together and you scream and cry and laugh in joy
Hours take place and you finally found that missing screw you forgot to tighten, you learn to tune your car and get it to start
 It finally stops stalling on you, the engine hasn't blown up yet and you start to drive to your inspection to find out whats wrong with it still only to find out that the only thing that IS wrong, is that you forgot a stupid triangle in your trunk
But its okay, because now its time for an adventure
This game seriously, gives you some of the hardest rage moments in a single player game
 But you keep going back for more because its all on you
 You have to figure it out and by the devils angel is it hard to do
 But once you do, it is the most rewarding and satisfying feeling that I have ever experienced in a game like this EVER
 Because no one is holding your hand, no one is helping you cheat your way to victory, it's all you
So go you, and make this happen, make your dreams come true as you build your little $h
^^y car that you almost want to drive off a cliff
 But you wont, and in the end, you'll love this game, no matter how many times you rage quit after smashing your keyboard
10/10Can't wait for the future updates

A Hat in Time is one of the best platformers you'll find on steam
Pros:+Colorful Artstyle+Easy to grab+Full Voice Acting+Funny/Cute Story Line+Funny/interesting characters+Gives Super Mario Sunshine/ Legend of Zelda: Windwaker feels
Cons:-I didn't support the kickstarter and now i'm sad
Overall a pecking good time
Posted: 5 October
this is one of the prime examples of a succesful kickstarter, i have pre-ordered this game in 2014 and i have no regrets in supporting it for so long
i have played the alpha, beta, speedrunning event, had fun in all of those, though they were only 6 levels of the game
the game as it is right now is a much more upgraded version from the beta (well duh, its released), it features many more interesting mechanics, improved graphics and well, its finished
 i definitely wont play through it only once, as it has a special spot in my heart, anticipating a game for so long cant be healthy :Pit is one of the best 3D platformers you can get on steam, if you are an enthusiast for this type of game just get it, and if you are interested in the genre, you will have no regrets
you will smile from pure fun, and actually funny writing
 it puts humour where it belongs, and in very precise moments just to get that chuckle out of you
characters are cheerful and memorable, they have great design, atleast i think they do, they look great for the art style the game points torward to, their voice acting is great (you will find exceptions for this, though
), and they are just all around loveable

Absolutely one of my favorite games ever
 Probably the only game I've ever 100%'d
 I was a slacker backer for the Kickstarter, so I bought my copy like..
 2 or 3 years ago
 And honestly, it was like a gift from my past self to my present self
This game made me feel like a kid again
 The absolute joy of taking control of Hat Kid for the first time, discovering what kind of jumps and leaps you can do onto platforms
 The controls are just so tight and responsive, and everything just works together so well
 The worlds are all so incredibly unique, and no mission is like any other
 The characters you interact with are well voice-acted and full of character
 The bosses you fight are unique and memorable
 The music is STELLAR
 There is not a single song in the game that I don't love
 One issue is that the game does not keep track of your progress on certain collectables such as the pages in Time Rifts (unless you're currently in said Time Rift), yarn, or tokens
 It's very difficult to tell if you've completely cleaned out a world of its things to do when there's no stats on the menus to tell you
 This is pretty minor, as it doesn't really detract of the general experience
 It'd just be icing on the cake if they fixed it
This game is getting workshop soon
 Which will involve custom hats as well as custom made levels with modding tools
 Meaning that when you're done with the game, you won't truly be done
 Even after I 100%'d this game I still want to play more
 Hopefully we can get some level ports of Super Mario 64 so we can play through them as Hat Kid
Overall, the entire game is fantastic
 It's unforgettable to me
 It made me genuinely feel like I was playing Mario Sunshine for the first time again
 It's truly unique, and a great result of a long time development cycle
Posted: 6 October
Here's some pretty extensive thoughts of A Hat in Time after playing it for 8-9 hours & completing about half of the game (my percentage on my main file is about 50% done right now, & I've completed 21/40 levels the game has so far
A Hat in Time's story follows a nameless girl (aka Hat Kid) who is an alien who's ship runs on hourglasses that store time, having the ability to rewind & freeze time
 Due to some silly shenanigans involving the mafia on a planet she's passing, her ship crashes and her 40 hourglasses spread across the planet
 She goes off to collect them all, meeting a colorful cast of characters along the way
 The game's story isn't going to win any awards, but I've been surprised how much I've enjoyed it thus far
 The characters are voice acted, & so far the voice acting is pretty good (there's also a badge you can equip which makes them to 'mumble' speak if you wish..
 more on badges in a bit)
A few of the characters I've already come to love, plenty have time to let you come to know them & find them likable or not
 I also appreciate the game's villain angle, everything is kind of a gray area in the game
 The good guys aren't wholly good, the bad guys aren't wholly bad
 Hat Kid actually doesn't seem to care about good vs evil, there's a do-gooder who has a morale high-ground of sorts & can't understand why Hat Kid doesn't want to use her hourglases for good, but Hat Kid just wants her hourglasses back
 The bosses you face aren't strictly because they're the bad guys, just they're in your way to collect your hourglasses back
 Motives for the bosses so far often have to do with wanting the hourglasses to go back in time & undo a mistake in their past, something they'll do anything to change rather than because they're evil, which I find an interesting dynamic
 I don't know obviously if the story holds up all the way through yet, but I like it for what it is so far
Game has a hub world, which is Hat Kid's ship
 The ship loses power & needs the hourglasses to restore it
 Get more hourglasses, & more of the ship unlocks as well as access to a new world becomes available to play
 The hub world is fun to explore & gets more added to it over time, including patrons who decide to board & do small things for you (ranging from allowing you to switch music in stages to selling you something or just loitering with flavor text)
 Out of the many collectibles in the game are souvenirs you can find (split into pieces though), which you bring back to your ship & you organize on one of a few pedestals (you have to manually stack them though)
 If you complete a souvenir, you unlock a new bonus level in one of the stages you can then access, which includes a harder than usual level with collectible pictures that give you a picturebook story (no text, all pictures though) of the backgrounds of the characters who live there
Speaking of collectibles, the collectibles here are well done, which works well for a collectathon
 Every one is linked to something, there's no 'useless' collectible
 Green orbs you get everywhere is your main currency, which you can use at a shopkeeper to buy new badges, to buy some new missions in levels, & some other misc things
 There's different types of yarn you can collect, which gives you different hats
 The hats all give you different powers, & you can change them on the fly with the d-pad or choose one from a menu of hats that slows down times
 The hats abilities range from letting you speed forward, doing a statue-esque ground pound, an aura which makes certain transparent objects appear, & more
 You also can collect customizable looks for your hats, as well as different colors for your main character
There's also badges, which are kind of your power-ups in the game
 You buy them from the store mostly, but some you get from other means
 At the start of the game you can only equip one badge, but there's two upgrade slots you can buy from the shop to equip three badges total
 Badges do everything from giving you a grappling hook to decreasing hat ability charge time to a map showing you where nearby souvenirs are, among many other things
 You can change them on the fly in the middle of the level whenever you like, & they're fun to mess around with & think what's best for a situation
 And then of course, the main goal of the game is to collect back your 40 hourglasses
I feel the game's controls are going to have some mixed reactions, but I actually REALLY like them
 They're a bit floatier than some platformers, & some may have different preferences here to me, but once you begin to get a handle on them you can do some crazy stuff
 They can do a great job at making you kind of feel like you're parkouring, as you can run up walls for a short time, wall jump, slide to go faster, dash in the air, do a double jump, & you can begin combo-ing these things like jump, double jump while in the air, dash in the air ahead, hit a wall, wall jump off the wall, dash in the air again & do a double jump off that dash
 It also can combo well into the other abilities you begin to get, like the running ability can run up walls a bit higher (as faster), or the grappling hook can chain very well into things
 One ability I was not expecting at all is kind of a homing attack similar to Sonic, where if you're close enough to an enemy in the air you can press the attack button to dash towards them in the air as a homing strike
 It's not all very complex, but well handled in my opinion, I personally really like the movement & almost parkour element the game has sometimes
All of this wouldn't matter if the game wasn't fun, which at least I think it's insanely fun
 The missions are very creative with a lot of twists & turns
 I don't want to speak too much in-depth here, but there's a LOT of variety of what you're doing
 The game shows all sorts of inspirations everywhere in its worlds & missions, & has its own set of unique twists on each one
 The game is the sort of game where one level is a murder mystery on a train & you're collecting suspects while avoiding being caught, to a previously fine island level being loaded with lava and having to maneuver in a whole new way due to the change, to a sort of Luigi's Mansion/Resident Evil/Amnesia hybrid horror level, to a level where you rush to go from press meet to press meet trying to become a diva & get your reputation up by publicity stunts, or going behind the scenes of a studio in a segment that almost has tinges of something like Portal
 There's a lot that happens, & then in what happens there's a lot of twists within the twists, & a lot of cleverly timed and amusing jokes & surprises
The game never loses its identity through this, but you end up going through a large variety of scenarios, & different kinds of stages (the main kind of stages are kind of open-world playgrounds that Collectathoners may know, something akin to Mario 64/Sunshine esque style, but there's some very different other types of levels, including these challenge levels that heavily remind me of Mario Sunshine, more linear affairs or sub-areas in the levels with their own flavor & level design)
I've fought two bosses so far
 The bosses in this game are surprisingly not that easy, they take like 20-30 hits before they die & have multiple phases
 The second boss I fought I REALLY liked, so much so I won't spoil it
Music is fantastic, it has some stand-out tracks but all of it I've heard so far is quite good
 There's also several variations of most themes which kick in during different gameplay moments, which does amp up & do what's intended
I need to see if this game falls apart in the second half of the game, & I won't claim everyone will love it as much as I have so far, but this I think is going to be a top five Collectathon title for me
 It has made me smile on multiple occasions, I've had a lot of fun with its mechanics, surprises, level design, missions, characters, and collecting

Posted: 7 October
SCROLL DOWN FOR TL;DRThis is one of the best 3D platformers I've played in a long time
 Tight controls, great abilities and creative level design
"How does it stack up to Yooka Laylee
" you might ask
Well, in terms of level design, humor and characters, it surpasses Yooka Laylee in several points, or at the very least matches it
 The catch
 The game is WAY too short
 Only 5 levels and only 40 hourglasses to collect, 24 of which are needed to beat the game
 However, the sheer amount of mission variety is staggering, and the attention to detail in every level is marvelous
 You never seem to be doing the same thing twice
 If I had to compare it to an existing game, the overall mission structure is like a heavily abridged version of Super Mario Sunshine, complete with platforming levels in a void
The character cast has an incredible amount of heart and soul in it
 Even the bad guys are immensely likable
 The Cook Mafia has to be my favorite band of crooks in the history of video games
 Hat Kid herself doesn't have much personality beyond "cute and happy" during most of the gameplay, but her character becomes more apparent in her diary entires, relic descriptions and the way she comments on various world objects
The bosses are easily the most challenging aspect of the game
 They're fast, have a lot of attacks, and the fights can go on for ages with no midpoints if you die
 Some of them can even get you in a stunlock, which is quite infuriating
Overall, A Hat In Time is a solid little gem, with its biggest problem being that there isn't enough of it
PROS + Great level design + Great controls + Great characters and humorCONS - Way too short - Some bosses can stunlock youSCORE: 8

Early Access Review
I was kinda skeptical about buying this game at first, since most games i've bought in early access kindddaaa sucked majorly
 Although I found a good deal on it and decided to try it out.
GAMEPLAY: My first hour went a little like this;"Oh this is actually a very pretty game""Where's all the land
""Look at all these crazy fish, they are so cute
""Wait what are you
 OHFUKMAN GET AWAY FROM ME""GET OFF MY ARM YOU SQUID WORM LEECH LOOKING THING""WHY IS EVERYTHING TRYING TO KILL ME
""This looks like a safe place..
 HOLY SH*T WHERE DID YOU COME FROM
"This game takes all of your fears of the deep dark ocean and puts them on steroids, every time that little thought crosses your mind that your survival chance can't get any worse, it can and it will
 It's almost like this game runs on your "I hope this doesn't happen" thoughts
 STORY:The whole plot of the game is one of the biggest area's still being worked on, it's more focused on gameplay and mechanics at the moment
 I have to say though, the general background and lore of the game is very interesting and i'm excited to play through it when it's finished
PERFORMACE:First off, when you read all the reviews about the crashing and "needing a beast computer to play" isn't true at all
 I have never had a crash, none of my friends have ever crashed, and if you really can't run this game at a playable FPS then you probably need to stop trying to use a baked potato for a graphics card
 This game is put together far better than most fully released games i've seen
 Yes, my framerate isn't pushing 80-120fps BUT considering my laptop is about 3 years old and I still manage 30-50fps on a gorgeous game like this is amazing
There really aren't any serious bugs, the most you really run into is like a light glitch or maybe a fish getting stuck in the ground, nothing game breaking
 The mechanics and actual gameplay are FANTASTIC, I have to give the dev's credits for a real original survival game (since almost every one of them now-a-days are about the same with either zombies, cannibals, or just nature; but underwater alien horror survival
 That's new)

Early Access Review
I used to be a SCUBA diver
Can't do it anymore
There are days when I miss it all so bad it hurts
The freedom
The solitude
The Unknown..
It's all out there, hidden beneath the waves
 Subnautica is the game I have been waiting for
In a strange way, it feeds the sea-hunger inside me somehow
Can't quite explain this sensation without having it sound corny and contrived, but that's how it works for me
I stumbled onto Subnautica purely by chance while browsing YouTube gaming clips
Ever seen that *one* game that stops you dead in your tracks
I did
 Definitely got my attention, as I recall
It was an Early Access release, so I could expect all kinds of unforeseen digital weirdness happening inside the game itself
My PC's operating specs were a tad on the light side too, but it didn't matter
I wanted that game
Badly
I bought it
I played it
I built things and survived
 I enjoyed every minute that I spent 'underwater' again
It's an alien ocean on an alien world
Curiously, the sights and sounds around you might seem strangely familiar, in spite of the bizarre shapes Life has taken in this place
There is indescribable beauty to be found here, side by side with terrible dangers that are either innocently disguised or glaringly obvious
It takes a certain mindset to fully appreciate this world,
as well as considerable restraint to avoid blindly lashing out at every shadow that flits past your facemask
Remember
YOU are the intruder down there
 Take a deep breath and immerse yourself completely
Welcome to Subnautica

Early Access Review
Everyone talks about how it's early access, bugs, blah blah blah
 If you're reading this review, you know about all that
 I recently realized I am a huge fan of survival sandbox games, and I have played quite a few in the last months
Here is my personal impression of this one
Graphics are incredible
 I know everyone has said this, but it needs repeating
 On the lowest settings, it still looks awesome
 Some clipping and such, but it never really bothered me much
It's very fluid (no pun intended) to get into it
 I agree with most other reviews that recommend no using guides and such and just jump into the deep water (pun intended) and learn to swim on your own
 It's a very friendly interface that gives just enough explanation to make you feel like you can do it on your own, but not enough to make it boring
Edit: I forgot the most important part (to me at least
) The metabolism for food in this game is very nice
 In plenty of other games like this you have to eat every two minutes or face death from starvation
 In this game, keeping hydrated is the issue
 While this is rather ironic while being surrounded by water, it makes a lot more sense
 I get away with eating once every day or two depending on my activity
 Dehydration keeps me drinking daily, but not constantly
 Considering dehydration kills you faster than starvation, I feel this is the most realistic representation I have seen in one of these games thus far
 Here is what any new player needs to know:Expect it will hurt you until you prove to yourself that it can't
 Explore
 Even the dark and scary areas
 They usually have the best loot
Storage cubes cannot be used indoors (as of the writing of this review
)Predators are everywhere and you are not one of them
 If it can eat you, it will
If it can eat you, it's usually in a scary area
You WILL get snuck up on and jumpscared
 Give it at least an hour before you start looking up stuff online, and once you do, do it very sparingly
 Discovery is an awesome feature to this game and the more you have to figure out, the more valuable this game will be
Posted: 18 February, 2016
Early Access Review
After 41 hours, I feel like I'm ready to say my piece about this game
It's important to specify that I'm playing in survival mode where you have to constantly worry about food and water
The game will be very different depending on which mode you play, because in the sandbox mode you can freely build and explore without every having to stop what you're doing to gather nourishment
In hardcore, you have to be extra careful, because once you die you have to start over
At this point, I'm glad I did not pick hardcore, because there are ways you can die that just aren't forseeable
There also occasional bug in the game which results in your death, like the all too common diving reel malfunctions
First Impressions:This game is amazing
That can be, and is, said about many games
But there is nothing like Subnautica
I had been waiting for 19 years, ever since playing the crap out of the incredibly immersive, fun, but ultimately flawed Sub Culture
Finally, we have a game that surpasses Sub Culture in every aspect except the storyline
With that said, Subnautica has flaws
The Bad:In all it's glory, there are a few nags, some of which make the game increasingly difficult as you get further into the game
First, I'm going to get it out of the way that there is a startup bug that made me almost request a refund even before getting into the game
 Subnautica doesn't always start, because the game menu screen frequently refuses to fully load
This is probably some sort of GPU initialization issue that prevents the graphics from displaying properly
In any event, I have to exit out of the game and restart it in Window mode to get the game to finish loading at all
Also, The learning curve is very steep
There are no instructions for anything, and the information given on any device in the crafting menus tell you nothing worthwhile about what stuff does
There are some basic descriptions, but they're very poor
For example the current generator says it generates current
When I started playing I had no idea what I would want to create a current for
The third thing is the max depth of the in game vehicles
There is much debate about the actual depth of the game
Some say it goes on forever
Others have quoted that the game crashes out at 60,000 meters
Some have said 20,000 meters
Others have said there is a secret world in the greatest depths, which sounds pretty epic
In any event
The ocean goes deeper than I feel comfortable thinking about
The problem here lies in the fact that the vehicles seem to have a max depth of 200 meters
(I've since found the Cyclops can go to approximately 900 meters at the expense of power efficiency
I believe the Seamoth can also go to a comparable depth
)Fourth, the hunger and thirst meters drop far too quickly
This seems nitpicky when you consider I did pick the survival mode, but the problem with this system is that you have to spend hunger and thirst to find food that becomes increasily more difficult to find as the game goes on
As a result, you might find yourself spending almost half your time gathering food and supplies to make water
Which leads me to the next problem in the game
Fifth, scarcity of food and supplies for making water
At first, everything is plentiful and readily available
Salt, while a challenge to find when you don't know what you're looking for, seems to respawn readily and limitlessly
Coral, while seemingly limitless at first, begins to disappear rapidly after many hours of gameplay
Moreover, I have seen no indication that it respawns
Food, which pretty much comes from the natural fish stocks, can disappear amazingly fast from an area
After 41 hours of gaming, I have effectively cleared all of the initial shallows of the ocean, plus the surrounding depths of fish
It's amazing how fast they diminish
The only solution seems to be to put respawning, or faster reproduction, of the fish in the game
I have not seen any indication that the fish respawn at all, which seems clear by some of the dead zones I have in my current save
There are some pretty heated debates about this in the discussion groups
Naysayers claim the supplies are unlimited, and all you have to do is look further
My answer to that is that you begin to spend a lot more thirst and food meter, energy, and other resources to find food
Because of this there is a rapidly diminishing return on the value of food and water in the game
The devs claim it causes people to explore more
I'm not satisfied with that response, because the reality is this:
if people have no motivation to explore
If they just stick to the shallows and eat and drink, they aren't going to have the attention span to stick with the game for the long term anyway
 Apparently, a fix is being tested in the experimental mode, but it's coming all too slow to a stable build
Sixth, and my final gripe, and this is definitely as glaring as the fifth, scarcity of resources
Copper, Quartz, Acid Mushrooms are plentiful at first, but become ridiculously difficult to come by as the game goes on
Quartz is practically used in everything, because you need it for glass and rubber, which you need for building and making Power Cells to power your vehicles
Each Power Cell takes a vast amount of resources, which would not be as much of a problem if they didn't deplete so rapidly
Even with the power efficiency mod only a small expedition can use 6 power cells and leave you scrambling for resources
Many users have defaulted to the same argument they have given to the food shortage problem, that there's plenty in the depths
The problem is that it takes more and more energy, food, and water to farm this stuff
You end up trapped in a cycle of more and more rapidly diminishing marginal utility on all of your resources
This really need to be fixed or users will basically be driven out of their own game by scarcity
 Both of the last two problems have people vehemently defending the current scarcity, with the argument that resources are scarce in real life
I would like to point out, however, that one person alone in a wilderness does not leave vast expanses of land void of any life
Certainly these rich biomes should be able to support just one person
Also, if the player were able to hunt for shellfish and crustaceans in the game, diversity of foods might help lower depletion rates
The player should be able to find oysters and dig for clams
The Good:Based on my criticisms, some might get the idea that I don't like the game
That couldn't be more wrong
Subnautica is, hands down, simply the best underwater game ever made
There's no competition
The environment is rich, full of wonder, and among the most immersive games I've ever played
The world is packed full of fascinating creatures, beautiful vegetation, and unparalleled undersea effects
The graphics are complimented by some of the most incredible sound you could possibly imagine
All of it adds up to a game that makes you feel like you're living rather than playing
It's one of those games that comes along and really changes things forever, at least among those who have played it
In my opinion, the game hasn't gotten nearly the recognition it deserves
The amount of stuff you can do in this game, and the painstaking attention to detail are mindblowing
Those are things I hope never change with Subnautica
Many early access games are dumbed down in later iterations
Unknown Worlds Entertainment seems to have a good attitude about adding new features instead of taking them out, like some other developers of early access releases have done in the past
I just hope they maintain the trend
Subnautica is an oustanding game, worth its price about three times over
It comes with my highest recommendation
 In it's current state, I would give Subnautica a 9/10

Early Access Review
Wow
 This game is amazing
 Pros-The graphics are sharp
 -The controls are smooth and intuitive
-The crafting system is simple
-The Creatures are Diverse-There is lots to explore-That little Red Puffer Fish with the Funny Sounds in the Caves, I like him
Con-Thirst and Hunger increase kind of fast, with so much to explore I want to spend my time exploring or building, not collecting fish for food and water, it gets repetitive
-Items don't stack
 Maybe they are going for realism but I'll give you and example of why It doesn't really matter
 Mushrooms for example, if you fill your inventory with them and then drop them all somewhere you will see that carrying that many Mushrooms that size is not realistic to begin with, so why not just make them stack
 -Also one more thing to add
 It gets lonely, really lonely
 Maybe give us some kind of robotic companion drone, or something like that.Kifflom

There is no other game like this on steam and once you begin to play you'll never be able to stop
 Beautiful immersive world that sucks you in with its bright colors and delightful sounds then scares the crap out of you with its shaped teethed creatures who may or may not swollow you whole
 Hunt for teasure and loot, discover the mystery behind the crash and the missing crew, explore the vast ocean from friendly cheerful coral reefs of the Safe shallows to the dark deep underwater caves of the Blood Kelp and the Jelly Shroom caves
 Make your own underwater base and set up your new home on the alien world
 Grow underwater crops inside and outside your base, make a aquarium and collect or breed fish for food or jus to keep them as pets and much much more
Has active devs that give the game tiny updates about once a month so you never have to wait half a year or more to get new content and a very nice and helpful
steam community
To put it simply this is the best undersea adventure you'll ever have

This is why I love this game:I remember starting up minecraft for the first time, when I was 13 years old
 Everything felt exciting and scary but interesting, I forgot everything around me and was immersed in the world for hours on end
 No other game gave me that same level of immersion, that same feeling of wonder, for years
Until this game came a long, right from the first minute I was transported back into the mindset of a 13 year old kid, exploring and learning in awe
So I wholeheartedly would suggest subnautica

this game has got the graphics on point, aswell as a rollercoster of emotion to get into the mood and the music oh the music is fantastic sounding so perfect for the situation you could get in to where your own heart starts racing and the music just adds to it

Early Access Review
After being interested in what I saw on steam, I followed this up with some gamer reviews on Youtube
Several notable game reviewers and let's play's later I was hooked
Right off the bat, most basic functions were intuitive
Movement was the standard WASD, I quicly figured out TAB opened my PDA, etc..
Off I went
Nearly drowning myself within a minute
A few minutes later I got too close to something that didn't agree with my presence
A few minutes after that I realised I needed some food
And so my adventures in survival began
Since then I made several mistakes in base design or venturing too far
I still remember the time I stranded myself in my seamoth(minisub) at about 600 meters, at night and my sub ran out of power
I wont repeat the word I said
But that is the sort of situation which captivates and maintains my enjoyment
You trully are responsible for your survival
Once you get a hang for how things go, you can quickly get a base going within 10 minutes
Have a minisub in less than an hour
But it is not a race
It is a sandbox experience to enjoy in all its beauty and depth
(pun)As the game progresses you must venture away from the safety of shallow waters for materials
The revamped Day/Night cycle and newer water graphics are breathtaking
Nighttime is both visually beautiful and terrifying
Daytime can be deceptively safe by comparison
I eagerly await each major update and new content the developers add
Each time, I cannot resist diving deep into subnautica
I hope you all enjoy it as much as I have so far
Highly recommended, especially for what it will cost
If still unsure, give youtube a look
Happy gaming
Posted: 10 June
Well, my review is mainly for beginners who have just started this game or willing to buy it
 This is also for them who had stopped playing it after some trivial hours of trying
A great game but yet I think the enjoyment will depend on how you are playing it
 All that I mean, if you want to get the fullest essence of this game then play with suitable co-op partner(s)
 Some who enjoys solo, they may say different but as I played solo because I had none to play with, so I felt even boring in some point and so also I felt how much the experience would be better with suitable co-op partner(s)
This is a hard-core game for hard-core gamers
 Death and incapability may happen every now and then but again the number may be reduced dramatically if you have your co-op partner(s)
 There are some other advantages too to play co-op (such as, better loot, or think that while you are reloading your gun, your co op partner still firing and thus you will be less hurt by enemies) and the game itself prompts for co-op although everything can be done in solo except few achievements
This is a long game, including DLCs and need patience to finish them all
 However, as I said before, this is a hard core game with almost a lot enemy everywhere, so, at some point you can feel frustrated if you dont have proper levelled equipment and so you should farm for right things enough
 Here again comes the advantage of co-op; such as you 4 people if farm for 4 weapons and then you can make duplicate of those [though it is a glitch] and you 4 can be well equipped which chance does not exist in solo and so can be a lot time consuming and monotonous to be advanced
For new players, as I was when I started this game may be a problem to understand the architecture of the game
 At the very beginning the game starts in NORMAL mode
 Once you will finish the main game then TVHM [True Vault Hunter Mode] will be unlocked which you can take as medium difficulty
 Re-playing the game in TVHM mode from the beginning once you reach at level 50 and then so also if you have finished the last mission of main story, then UVHM [Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode] will be unlocked for you
 So take this as hard mode
 There are over power [OP (1 to 8)] mode also where you can think it as very hard difficulty mode where enemy is up of your level
 but that can be unlocked once you reach the ultimate level of the game, i.e
 level 72
 So, the main game will take you upto the level 50; The UVH pack 1 will take you upto 61 and UVH pack 2 will take you to level 72
Addition as on 30th June: Since I have just finished the main mission of main game in UVHM mode so I shall suggest you if you are playing UVHM then you must carry 2 blue pistols: Potent Rubi and Potent Gorg Nozzle and always keep one of these at your one slot
 Whenever you are low in health start shooting using it
This is the review basing on my present experience of nearly 400 hours; I can update this review in the future as I shall get new experience

Borderlands 2 is a game for those that enjoy the feeling of finding awesome equipment hidden in a massive pile of other stuff
Sure, you don't NEED to go in-depth with this game
On the first playthrough you can get by with just picking up gear as you travel along, choosing stuff that looks better than your current gear, and maybe occasionally buying something in the vendor that looks handy
The deeper you go down the rabbit hole however, the more there is to discover
The story is decent for a First Person Shooter (albeit one with RPG elements), and dialogue is often amusing to a degree
Handsome Jack, the main antagonist is a cartoon villain with M rated attitudes
He believes, or at least pretends to believe that he is the good guy, and you are just a "Filthy Bandit
"
Graphically, the game has a lot more variations in design and color scheme than it's predecessor (which was brown, brown, and a bit of color here and there)
Cell shaded graphics with thick, graphic novel like outlines is the style of the game, and does a good job of separating it from the average FPS
Now, on to the gameplay itself
:Action is often fast paced and exciting
So long as you don't allow yourself to get too far ahead of the enemy levels, you'll find battles where you have to fight hard to win
The game does a decent job of easing you into the various elements, such as different gun types (Pistol, SMG, Assault/Combat Rifle, Shotgun, Revolver, Rocket Launcher, and Sniper Rifle), the importance of a good shield, grenade mods (alter the way your grenade behaves, including damage bonuses and special effects), Class Mods (Class-specific devices which can boost skills, and have other effects like increasing fire rate with specific weapon types), and lastly Relics (Device which generally boost damage or defence in some way)
Equipment rarity is also made fairly clear
It goes White, Green, Blue, Purple, Magenta, Orange, Seraph, and Pearlescent
The final two rarities (Pearlescent and Seraph) are special
Seraphs require you to have at least one of the season pass DLC to obtain (and you need all 4 of the Season Pass DLC to obtain all the Seraph rarity items), and as to Pearlescent rarity weapons, you need to be in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (Playthrough 3) for them to have a chance of being spawned
Don't assume that a blue is automatically better than a green rarity item, even at the same level
Experiment
Playable Characters and Skills:There are 4 included playable characters, and two DLC characters
Each class has it's ups and downs, and a special game changing skill unique to them
For example, Salvador (Gunzerker) will dual-wield guns when his action skill is active, meaning TWICE THE FIREPOWER
Axton (Commando) drops a turret, which damages enemies and draws aggression away from you
Maya (Siren) locks an enemy's movements for a short time, allowing you to get in free hits
Zer0 turns invisible for a few seconds and launches a decoy, and his first attack made whilst in this mode does increased damage
The DLC characters are Gaige (Mechromancer) who launches a flying robot that attacks nearby enemies, and Kreig (Psycho); a schizophrenic musclebound maniac that will whale on everything within reach with increased offensive and defensive capabilities and can even throw his axe at more distant targets
Aside from the action skills unique to the character, there are various other skills that you can put points into, and have an effect on gameplay in some way
For example, increasing fire rate or damage for a few seconds after a kill is made
Each character has 3 skill trees, each ending with a final gamechanging skill modifier
For example, Zer0's Bloodlust (Melee) tree ends with the Many Must Fall perk, which will instantly re-deploy the hologram if he kills the enemy with one melee strike
As mentioned before, Class Mods unique to a character class will boost certain skills
It's possible for them to go as high as +6, meaning some skills can be boosted to 11, as the normal limit on points you can put into most skills is 5, though some skills are only 1 (those usually affect the way you play)
Plus, there is a gun that shoots swords...
EXPLODING swords..
In DLC4 (Tiny Tina's Assault on the Dragon Keep)
So yeah, there is that too
I hope you found my review useful, even if it might be a bit messy XD

Borderlands 2 - Excellent Story, Solid Gameplay, Great Characters and one of the very best Coop experiences around
|| 9
5 || Score Comment
Graphics 8 Borderlands 2 has a visual style all its own, it may not initially impress some used to a "next generation, high definition, ultra realistic landscape", but it is nevertheless very appealing and detailed
 Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora (the world on which the story takes place) are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere
 Characters and enemies are detailed and extremely varied in appearance
 You can customise your characters appearance with a large selection of outfits and heads which you can collect throughout the game
Audio 10 No real killer soundtrack here (apart from the the introduction video), just really good atmospheric music throughout
 Where this game really shines is the voice acting for characters, enemies, audio logs and even weapons (yes some of them can talk
)
 The dialogue is often very funny, helping to explain and drive the story, fill in background and really adds the the immersion
Gameplay 9 A mix of FPS and RPG, Borderlands 2 is a lot of fun to play
 So many missions to complete, so many enemies to kill, so much loot to grab
 You are given massive area's to explore all over the world of pandora filled with creatures, quests, secrets and homages to lots of popular culture
 Controls are responsive, intuitive and the game mechanics (even at higher difficulties) feel fair and well thought through
 As you progress through the game you will earn xp and levels which allow you to customise your characters skills giving a large variety of gameplay styles
Story 9 The story in Borderlands 2 is rich and engaging
 The action is character driven, and while the main story is fairly linear, the open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora
 It also has one of the most badass, charasmatic and handsome villians of all time..
Replayability 9 So many reasons to replay this game
 Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards
 There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different
 Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore
 Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character
 These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text)
Multiplayer 10 For me, this game remains simply the best cooperative multiplayer experiences you can have
 Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team
 Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels
 The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication
Overall 9
5 I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters
 So much fun to pick up and play with friends
 - I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game
 To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more

Edit: Please stop joining my game, my anxiety can't handle itI've been avoiding reviewing this game, being my number one favourite I couldn't think of a way to make it unbiased
 But after the resurgence of Open world games, the downfall of AAA and the battle between TF2 and Overwatch, I think I can finally pinpoint what makes it so beautiful
The art style is an obvious starting point
 Everything is cartoony and exaggerated, it's filled with colour and despite being cartoony it feels more realistic than the grim grisley greyness of Skyrim, Morrowind, Witcher etc
 It's not perfect of course, with clipping and terrible lip sync but with the cartoony atmosphere it adds to the exaggerated charm that it provides
The characters themselves are also important
 If you compare how they were designed to Mass Effect: Andromeda, the way it has been presented is genius
 There are a lot of gay characters, black characters, female characters- but these characteristics do not define who they are
 The characters still have peronalities, they just happen to be these things- they are not just addons, it just adds to the depth of the world
I suppose the most important thing in a game is the gameplay, and this Borderlands nails too
 A lot of games can't tell whether they want to be simple or complicated, they can't tell what gimmicks they want to use, so they use everything and it turns into an incoherent mess like Undertale
 Borderlands knows exactly what it wants to do
 It's a Single Player or Co-Op FPS with RPG mechanics with levelling and loot systems
 The RPG mechanics make it feel more open worldy than most open world games
 It defines what towns exist, and gives you fast ways to get to them, and while games like Skyrim use the open world idea to make you travel for hours, Borderlands 2 just adds a lot of depth with; secret loot boxes, experience, Cult of the Vault logos or mini easter eggs
Something that I noticed in my most recent playthrough is how much freedom you have throughout and how this can appeal to both new players and veterans
 One example is the first area, the entirety of Southern Shelf
 You fight Knuckle dragger, to a new player they find out how brilliantly designed the bosses will be: They aren't walls of health, they aren't stupidly damaging, they are balanced with weaknesses and phases
 An expert player on the other hand could then debate whether they would want to farm Knuckle Dragger for the legendary pistol Hornet, or just move on
 This can also be seen in Southern Shelf Bay when you have to kill Midgemong
 A new player could rush right towards Midgemong or maybe explore the boats, while an expert player would take the long route around for some extra loot and instead of calling the bridge over to get across the lake, they can just run across the chain, significantly increasing the pacing and replayability of the game
Of course Borderlands 2 isn't perfect, the majority of the fun is in the UVHM playthrough which is a DLC
 The bugs might throw people off while I enjoy discovering two or three new ones every new playthrough
 Even despite this, just the first playthrough with a friend is highly worth your time
 Let's hope Borderlands 3 will be another great one
 Iron out the issues of Borderlands 2, while still being able to provide replayability where Borderlands: The Pre-sequel couldn't
Posted: 11 July, 2014
There is something to be said for a game that I just don't get sick of
 I have owned this on console and played through TVHM at least 4 times with 4 different characters there
 Played all the DLC except Tiny Tina on console, but when the GOTY edition became so cheap on PC I jumped at it and bought all the Headhunter DLCs, and the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack as well
 So I can now play through the game THREE times on a character
 DarI'm so addicted to this game still, but the funny thing is that I don't even finish it, or even come close to it now
 I'm in a mass addiction to boosting my Badass Ranks so I just keep trying to "prestige" it instead of moving on and going towards UVHM
 xDI feel like I can pick this game up and play it at any time
 Do a few things, and then quit playing
 Unfortunately, for me anyways, I don't do that
 I keep playing for hours, and I let all the other hundreds of games in my library continue to pile up
 I play this game EXCLUSIVELY in SINGLE PLAYER
 People will tell you that it is much more fun playing with friends, and truly it can be, but don't disregard this game as a single player game
 It is insanely addictive, and it actually poses some slight challenges to you to play it solo
 Beating Raid Bosses solo is actually a genuine accomplishment, if you can actually do it
 They are meant to be beaten witha 4 player team, but you CAN beat many of them solo
 The new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM) makes it an even more insane challenge to play solo just for the regular game enemies
 Needing to pump them full of slag just so you can actually get ready to start damaging them with any real power
 Of course all this is basically a math problem of damage output vs
 damage defense
 Borderlands 2, simply put, is one of the best games ever made in my opinion
 The sheer addictiveness and fun in playing it are jsut off the charts
 I recommend this to anyone, even if you think you won't like it
 I thought Borderlands 1 looked stupid for years until I bought it for $5 with everything and realized how amzing the concept is and how it was made for OCD gamers
 Now they are both 2 of my most played games ever, and I don't see myself stopping BL2 anytime soon
 After all I ahven't even used The Psycho yet
Buy the GOTY Edition
 It is the best deal by far and has most of the relevant content you will want
 Forget about the Season Pass and regular game
 GOTY has all that stuff and more
 Then buy the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack to get extra level sand a 3rd round
 The headhunter DLCs are worth it too for the cheap prices
 Only thing not to buy are the stupid skin packs
 Unless you like that sort of thing
 Wait for it to go 75% off and you can get GOTY, UVH Pack, and allt he Headhunter DLCs for less than $20
 BTW..
these DLCs are legit and worth buying
 This isn't some garbage map pack DLC, or jsut skins
 These are high quality and large DLCs on the scale of the FAllout DLCs, and add even more than that in some of tehm
 GOTY edition has almost too much content
 >_>
Posted: 6 March, 2015
Definitely one of the best "new" games I have played
 This game is fun to play solo or over the net with friends
 The characters are witty, yeah even Claptrap :) Graphics are beautiful..
 Even after playing this game over 3000 hours; the game gives wow-moments to me
 And every time there's something new...
 and the vast choice of weapons, shields and other gadgets
 So I full-heartedly recommend Borderlands 2
 And yes, I will play co-op with you :)

This game is infinite
 You can play it whatever you like and it's always fun
 I've said enough
Posted: 16 January, 2015
I had played 1200 hours before I even tried any of the DLC
 Now, if that doesn't speak to the incredible level of fun and depth that this game brings, well, I just don't know that anything can
 Sometimes I wonder how much better my life would be if I had spent those 1400 hours doing something constructive like studying my trade, helping the poor, or working on my home
 But not often
 Second best game ever made
 Absolutely terrific
 Life ruiner
 Go for it

THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1
3 Starbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy
 From playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy
 Pros + Unique art style + Infinite procedurally generated universe + Creative alien races that are completely customizable + Pets unique to each race + A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero + Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials + Mining and harvesting isn't a grind + Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator + Devs constantly working to update and add new features + Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization + Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race + An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable
 Exploration is necessary to advance upon it, is unique to each race, and customizable to each player + Crew members can be added to your ship, but I'll say more later + Your own space station can be created for players and NPCs to visit + You can create and fully cutomize a mech to fly through space and stomp along the ground + You can visit and trade inside of other space stations full of NPCs / other players + You can create colonies for NPCs to live in + Treasures can be discovered pretty much anywhere + Tech can give you powers like dashing, jumping, and morphing into a ball + The bosses get harder and are all quite cleverly created + The quests link into the web of connections that advance your tech, systems, and story + Moddable in any way you like, from the intro scene to Robbie Rotten's clothes + Vehicles such as hover bikes and boats are available
 + Port forwarding isn't required to host games, your friends can join you through Steam at any time + Tiny easter eggs and hints from the devs can be found throughout the game + It's fairly cheap price-wise, I mean it's a fourth of No Man's Sky and four hundred times better + The soundtrack is beautiful and has brought tears to my eyes more times than I'd like to admit + So many possibilities that can lead to my 700 plus hours on this game Neutralities ~ The universe doesn't feel losslessly empty and gigantic, it's fairly easy to get from star to star ~ Life is extremely abundant ~ 2D and pixelated; the graphics aren't 'next gen' Cons - You can't customize the exterior of your ship - Crew members are a little dumb AI-wise and not extremely useful - It's a bit slow paced, which a lot people don't like
because they all are stupid and get bored way too fast and don't have the drive to actually work for anything
but I love it
 TL;DR * It's a great space exporation game with a web of slow-ish paced advancement that's extremeley wide in possibilites and customization
* Much of the game is unique, including the races, planets, stars, and generated structures
 * If you don't like it, you probably don't like space games :p

For people who like story, or fast, reaction-based gameplay, this game isnt for you
With over 200 hours on this game, i have come to a conclusion
 You don't play this game for the end goal of saving the universe
 you play this game for the journey it takes you on
 I realised this when I was playing with friends, and we where doing nothing but sitting around a campfire on logs playing music on our instruments that this was my favroite game
 If a game can make sitting around a campfire an experience that is memorable, it has to be doing something right
10/10, hands down
Posted: 24 May
More Than Just Terraria In SpaceI was initially attracted to Starbound because it looked like Terraria in space
 This was appealing to me because I love Terraria  I presently have over 290 hours in that game  and I love science fiction
 After 100 hours of playing Starbound, I came to the realization that despite their surface similarities, Starbound and Terraria have subtle and not-so-subtle differences which distinguish between the two games
Starbound focuses more on completing quests and uses procedural generation more extensively
 It also is more of a survival game than Terraria is  on survival and hardcore difficulties, your character must eat to survive
 While both games have exploration and combat mechanics, Starbound tends to be more focused on exploration and less on combat, as most weapons are found in chests distributed across the surfaces and caverns of planets rather than dropped by enemies
PositiveThe boss fights are enjoyable
 Furthermore, after you complete the campaign, you gain access to a repeatable dungeon with a procedurally-generated boss, Building is easier in Starbound than Terraria due to the ability to place back walls without having to craft them from blocks  instead, you simply right click while holding a block to place a background wall
 There are also a wide variety of block types and objects to build with, allowing the construction of interesting towns and villages
Multiplayer games are exceptionally easy to set up
 Starbound supports Steams join game feature
 Furthermore, the multiplayer games are very stable  I have accumulated most of my 100 hours in multiplayer, and only noticed one significant bug, namely a villager side quest which could only be accepted by one player (With the introduction of 1
3, I have noticed an uptick in the number of bugs in my multiplayer game
 The bugs don't seem to be multiplayer specific and appear to be limited to a handful of players, but I thought them worthy of mention)
Starbound features Steam Workshop support and a massive array of mods - over 2,600 workshop items are available for the game at present
The pixel art is good
 While aesthetic is highly subjective, I find Starbound to be a better-looking game than Terraria
Starbounds soundtrack is, to my untrained ear, quite good
 It is also fairly extensive  there are several hours of music to enjoy
 In the endgame, it is possible to upgrade lower tier legendary weapons (a group of weapons which were designed by hand rather than randomly generated) to tier 6, the highest tier of weapons available
 If you particularly enjoy using one of the lower-tier legendary weapons, you dont have to permanently relegate it to the shelf when more powerful equipment comes along
NegativeMovement in Starbound is less satisfying than in Terraria due to the lack of an equivalent to the later game's wings
 This is an issue given that a large portion of the game consists of travesing alien landscapes in search of a village or dungeon
 I often wished that I could simply fly over a pool of lava rather than building a bridge over it
 While this is the only major omission in the movement catagory, it is a rather glaring one
 Starbound has some of the worst side quests Ive ever seen, and I played the original Mass Effect
 While the handful of handcrafted side quests in the game are fine, the quests given by villagers and colonists are awful
 The quests are randomly generated and fall into only a handful of preset mission types
 The messenger quests are especially annoying, requiring the player to carry notes between two NPCs standing 5 feet apart
 The other quests arent quite as bad, but the lack of quest variety quickly leads to them becoming repetitive
Crewmembers seem like an afterthought
 In my experience, medics and chemists give their respective bonuses so rarely when outside the ship that they are mostly only useful as combat support
 Furthermore, engineers and mechanics are hilariously broken
 Mechanics can increase fuel capacity infinitely, while engineers can increase fuel efficiency to the point that you can fly across the galaxy on zero fuel, behavior that was presumably unintended (fixed in update 1
3)
Some of the achievements require an insane amount of grinding
 The worst offender is the Destroyer of Worlds achievement, which would take tens of hours of nonstop mining to achieve legitimately
 NeutralServiceable is the best way to describe Starbounds story
 The game has a hackneyed collect ancient artifacts to save the world plot, the characters are memorable, but dont get much character development, and the campaign consists of only 8 missions including the tutorial
 This is forgivable given that the story isnt Starbounds focus
 Ultimately, Starbound is a sandbox game, not a JRPG
The cost of randomly generating ordinary weapons is that they are far less interesting than some of the insane weapons found in Terraria
 The inclusion of secondary attacks helps somewhat in differentiating between weapons, but I still found myself deciding which weapon to use by calculating DPS
 Fortunately, there are a fairly large number of handcrafted legendary weapons
If you somehow didnt like Terraria, you probably wont enjoy Starbound
 While Starbound tries to differentiate itself with its focus on questing and sci fi setting, its gameplay is like that of the game that inspired it
 However, if you enjoyed Terraria and are looking for a similar game with just enough alterations to the formula to justify its existence, Starbound is the game for you

Starbound, short and sweet it's a great game
 But here are the very long reasons why: (
Paragraphs in order: Storyline, Gameplay, Graphics, Setting and mods
) STORYLINE In starbound, you play as a character of any of the six races about to graduate to a protector
 This is stopped by a violent and mysterious force, which coerces you to escape in the first ship you find
 As you look to repair your ship you are pulled into a rope of interesting and exciting quests to see what parts of the universe you can salvage before the same violent force rips it apart, just like it did to your home planet
 PROS:
Allows you to get a sandbox experience without feeling forced to do the story (there are ways to skip it) Feels complete when you're done, main story line may end, but there are always tonnes of sidequests
 Easy to follow along if you don't take long breaks
CONS:
Low curve, would appreciate more action spread through the scavenging of artifacts
 My ideal would be adding more minibosses
GAMEPLAY Although it may seem daunting with all the crafting and vague mission information at first, it is not
 A general idea is to get your ship furnished before doing the missions
 Get some understanding of the crafting and the traveling
 Generally, looking at the
starbound.wikia
com
helps you with missions and obtaining items
 The gameplay can shift between serene and action filled based completely on what the player wants
 The serenity and action are respectively accompanied by multiple factors such as the music or dialogue
 For the calmer experience, there is farming, cooking, building spectacular monuments, fishing and looking for easter eggs and pop culture references (which are spread out very frequently)
 As soon as you want action, you could do some hunting, exploring or doing missions in both the main storyline and ones you find in the settlements on the planets
 The quests are also rewarding, with some giving gift bags and others offering to join your crew on your ship
 The boss battles in this game are exciting and suits both casual and hardcore players, depending on how fast you decide to go through the story
 The combat is smooth and is changeable depending on the players choice of weapons and armour
the most important part, however
is the free and easy multiplayer
 You can play with friends through dedicated servers or through the steam overlay
join game feature PROS:
Everything is fun, there is really not a whole lot of grinding for items or currency
 during mining, for instance, the game throws dungeons and new underground biomes at you to keep it interesting
 Everything is a way to progress
 After some calm farming you could sell the crops to progress, if you want, you can make food with the ingredients that can help you with different effects
Combat is very good and easily fits any player
CONS:
Some derpy issues such as settlement guards attacking you because their houses get striked by meteors
 GRAPHICS
"pixely" graphics remind many of terraria, but the graphics designers have really done well, seeing as there are so many branches of weapons and clothes from all races and all different weapons, magical, firearms, spears, chakrams, you name it
 Everything is very varied and all the mobs are very visually adapted to their biomes and planets
 The bosses do a good job of showing their origins and the attacks fit their visuals
 PROS:
Modern but nostalgic Well varied Items and furniture convey their origins and use
CONS:
Not a whole lot of underwhelming weapons that allow the legendaries to stand out
 They took away the feature of mobs having different colors depending on their planets to give slight notability to a seemingly average poptop or gleap
SETTING
The setting can change depending on choice
 Staying on a planet is accompanied by one of twelve songs by day and sixteen by night
 Many who play this game, including me, love the music and it fits to different parts of everyday life
 My personal favorite way to listen is through the title screen, but I know I should already have bought the OST on steam
 In the game, during bossfights, there are nostalgic feeling battle-music that really sets you into the idea that your character is in danger
 PROS:
Amazing music that fits a serene or action-filled gameplay
 The immersion is helped so much by music
 CONS:
It's hard to get around to buying a five euro soundtrack
MODS When you feel like you have completed everything you wish to have completed in starbound but crave more, fear not
 There are hundreds of free mods to enrich your experience, post main-missions and during them
 A noteable one is called
"
frackin universe
" The megamod is generally the biggest mod in all of starbound and adds dozens of new biomes and monsters along with hundreds of weapons, armors, tools, items and microdungeons
 It also adds a whole new quest hub and a massive eldritch dungeon to explore
 There are also things to help you collect things
you would normally have to work a bit harder for and very much more content
 It feels like an entirely new game
 Oh and did I mention
 the mods are free
SUMMARY
Addictive game with smooth combat, interchangeable setting, easy multiplayer, cute graphics and free mods, some of which completely renew the game, to multiply the replay value tenfold
 I have over two hundred (I know, casual hours) in this game and I don't plan on stopping, seeing as I have only slightly dipped my toes into the "frackin' universe" mod
 9
5/10
Would definately recommend if you are willing to get past a slightly slow early game

Early Access Review
You don't have to wear pants in this game
11/10
Posted: 24 July, 2016
See my hours
 I know this game, and i know that i say it's by no reach a perfect game or a horrible one
Congrats Chucklefish, if i could give a neutral review i would, consider this a close passmark of a release and even though this review is positive i'm still going to lay it down on you
After spending years in early access most people assumed it would never be released and that the devs abandoned, they didn't and in fact were actively working on it throughout the time it was in early access
 Their only major falter was the lack of finalized updates
 I would by lying if i said i didn't at least once or twice feel angry or ripped off by Chucklefish
 After all its not the money we paid, but the promises we paid for
 Development is slow, very slow
PROS:+You will probably spend at least 100> hours exploring and getting your gameplays worth
+Can capture any monster you find on a planet and use it as a pet (yes, its like Pokemon, but in space)
+Procedurally generated weapons, very good ones too, you will be surprised at the variety of attacks and designs
+Building is easy, wiring is easy, painting is easy and there are hundreds upon hundreds of different blocks and decorations
+7 Starter races that are diverse and unique
+Modding support for this game is well maintained
+(near) Infinite planets that never have the same two types of monster or buildings
+Multiplayer through steam, easy to connect via the client (can be very laggy)
+Professions are chosen by the player, you can play how you want HOWEVER some professions are blatantly more fun or better than others
 The Farmer will never have that awesome shotgun the explorer does or the armor the miner has
+OST is amazing +Active devs, who also listen a fair bit to the community
 Might even find them in the Discord or IIRC
+Customizability is insane, akin to Terraria's system (including dyes and social slots)
+Liquid and Light dynamics are "realistic"+Supports 
ABC Files (You can play actual music in game from websites such as LOTRO)+Boss fights are unique-ishSEMICONS: (Things that the devs are likely to fix soon, or will fix eventually, or may not be encountered by everyone)+/- Can feel a bit solitary, especially in singleplayer+/- Game is unoptimized and crashes on startup occasionally+/- Mods are sometimes undetected by the game alltogether and you might have to restart multiple times to get them working+/- Obligatory semicon about the bugs and rush to 1
0CONS:- AI can be pretty stupid- The story is average, and cuts off pretty quickly with very little relevance late game
- Some significant unbalance in both the bosses and weapons
 (For their level, some are incredibly weak or easy, or very hard/OP)- The tutorial explains gameplay fundamentals but lacks out some smaller things that people might miss- APPLIES MAINLY TO BETA PLAYERS: If you played in beta, you will notice that a lot of content is totally gone or inconsistent, especially in tiered species weapons and the story bosses
Posted: 5 June
Although it gets boring fast if you're alone,add in a few mods like Frackin' Universe,get a friend or two to play with you and you're really going to enjoy the game,I'd give it a 9/10
Posted: 23 January
EDIT: damn, top of the list..
 i hope this changes something
EDIT2: got sick of people misinterpreting the reference to No Man's Sky, so i removed it
 sorry
1
3 edit: basically only modified the lategame, base gameplay is still mechanically brokenDon't let the negative rating fool you - I don't hate this game, I just don't like what it's become
TL;DR Loved Koala, don't like Giraffe
 Generic environments with generic dungeons and towns, repetitive and boring combat, shoehorned and unengaging story gates your progress constantly
Let me start this review off with a little nostalgia from my first experiences with the game
 I played - and loved - the Koala builds
 Every planet was different, with different creatures and different landscapes and colours
 It was nice
 I didn't know what I was going into, and that was great because each experience was a new one
However, I feel the direction the game's taken is downwards
 Planets are now segregated into different types, and each one has essentially the same thing to expect
A lush planet has a mine and some ruins
 A forest planet has a swamp and some frogs, maybe a few Avians
 A snow planet has llamas and some monkeys
This happens again and again and again, and while the terrain is varied and gives a hint of adventure to the "exploration", seeing the same rebel camp or monster-filled mine or generic temple over and over again gets boring, fast
 Seriously, on every planet, you'll be sure to find the same thing in a different shape
This is a weakness that demonstrates itself in spades when you begin to actually explore the universe
Additionally, there's the problem of the combat system
 Throughout the course of your exploration, you're constantly thrown the same preset enemy with the same preset fly-towards-you-and-do-damage-on-contact tactic
 (I'm exaggerating here, but still, there is a shameless amount of monsters which simply run, hop or fly at you and deal damage as soon as they touch you
)More creatures with mechanics like the Poptop, who come at you slow but do a lot of damage when they charge, would be a lot more fun, and would make the fighting more engaging than "this creature runs at you and mobs you until you die, kill it"
There is so much more that could be done with the system, and it shows with the complexity and variety of weaponry in the game, but the way that every monster attacks you is insultingly and unfittingly simplistic
 It's also annoying to get cheap-killed on a regular basis, and degrades the gameplay significantly when it literally starts punishing you for daring to venture from your house on your starting planet
Finally, there's the problem of the story being shoehorned into everything you do
 I don't know about you, but I play Starbound to build pretty things and venture out into the unknown
 Unfortunately, the game forces you into the shoes of a superhero, and it constantly rubs me the wrong way
I couldn't give half a damn about the fate of the universe
 I play this game to build and chill out
 Maybe that's an incredibly shallow way to play a game, but it's just the way I play
 Unfortunately, the way the devs have implemented the story is annoying and broken, disallowing you to actually explore, instead holding your hand like a gameplay-long tutorial level
I don't care for the story because it's inconvenient and slow to work through, gating your progress while never bothering to actually engage you outside of "save the universe from Cthulu"
I don't think there's any more that I can say other than please, for the love of God, Chucklefish
 Make the worlds more wild and varied
 Add more building configurations
 Make some biomes NOT spawn buildings as often - people don't need to live everywhere
 Reduce the spawn rates of your preset creatures and work on the combat - it's boring and it starts to grate after a while
And, please, make the story optional
 It's so painfully linear and shallow that it feels like I'm trying to read a children's book than play a game
Please make this game fun again
 I'm starting to get sick of installing mods and turning off monster spawning just to have a nice time
ADDENDUM:About two weeks of experience with the game later, and my opinion hasn't changed - though I can certainly list out some good aspects of the game:BASE BUILDINGThe wide range of blocks and items, and the option to have NPCs inhabit things you create, makes for a fun and relaxing to play
 My only gripe is that the interactions are far too shallow, and the radiant quests have a very, very limited range
MODDINGModding is absolutely amazing in this game, and is exactly as advertised
 While confusing and frustrating occasionally, modding is incredibly flexible and often instantaneously satisfying
Also, the ability to add mods to the game to flesh out your experience is rather pleasant
Unfortunately, it's the most fun I've had with the game thus far
If something passes my mind, I'll add it to this addendum
 I would have written something on the community but I currently don't know what I'd say on it
Posted: 14 May
Starbound is everything that No Man's Sky isn't
Posted: 3 September, 2016
Playtime and Time/money I'd say about 60 hours of gameplay maximum for the state it's in now
 Thats what I spent on it while playing with 2 other friends doing absolutely everything
So even in that regard it's 25 cents an hour, which is absolutely fantastic
 Exactly what is this game
The good: This is starbound
 The game that it currently is, is a space themed, construction and survival exploration game
 Comparable to terraria, it has improved upon a lot of things from that such as the ability to use one block as a back wall and a forewall, there are more space related things like atmospheres (1) space creatures (2) space ships, a space story line etc
 There are planets to discover (3), theres progress to be made through building a colony and adventuring through planets (4), Plenty of fun to be had with interesting tech mechanics (5) a very large assortment of vanity goods, and a nice multiplayer experience
 The inventory feels not too full all the time as it is now catagorized into everything you need (such as an ore bag and a building materials bag etc), and it comes with a complete story which you'd have a hard time finding with such creative games (6)
 The Bad: The game is rather short with only 6 tiers of progression
You run around on planets and can easily move on to the next section by scraping the surface alone
The armor balance for players is slightly higher than the game seems to want, it's so mind numbingly easy that a toddler could sit around with a stimpack and a med kit and outheal any damage coming at them
It's so incredibly easy for other players to ruin the efforts of a server because the protection isnt in the game by default, in any way
The game will get extremely laggy for many players when there are too many entities in one area of a world
 (which should be something obvious, however I'm saying that it's taxing on higher end systems even)It will consume many of your hours doing simple things like building, or gathering a crew/upgrading your ship/mining
 (ok, this one isnt really bad, unless you hate that sort of thing
) The Unforgivable: this entire "the unforgivable" section will be gripes about features removed from the game, they will not impact you if you do not know about what was in the past
 I advise you to keep clear if you are fresh and have never had your hopes high for the game
As much as I don't want to say this, I feel as though it has to be said, the game has been stripped of features
 The justification for this is improved framerate, when honestly it is worse now
 So I cannot and will not let it go
 Lets start off with the numbers 1
 They removed the heating system, and the complexity of atmospheres from the game
 you now craft a survival pack that allows you to eventually traverse all territories, instead of how it was before, which was harsh and based on your selections
 While this choice for sure makes the game easier, it takes out the fun survival part of the difficulty.1a
 They also oversimplified the hazardous environments, so it doesnt matter if you take cover, or build a fire to stay warm, you will always be suffering the consequences of a planet, no matter where you are, if you don't have the correct survival pack.2
 They drastically reduced the randomness of creatures that spawn on planets, there are now a total of 3 major variants of creatures, large, small, and flying and are trash monsters who have no meaningful attacks
 There are now many pre generated creatures that inhabit every single planet in the game, and they are very common
 I hope you enjoy going to the same 20 planets over and over again.3
 unrelated to the creatures but stemming from the random generation, planets now are even genned the same, and the color of planets is only based on the planet you're going to, which you will find out are very limited in number, it's not a mystery of what you're getting anymore, you go to an ocean planet, you've seen them all, you go to a starter planet, you've seen them all etc
 the only thing that remains are the random dungeons generated in the planets themselves.4
 Adventuring is blindly easy, everything has been simplified down to looting all the surface boxes of a planet for "EXTREMELY RARE" matter manipulator upgrades and the ore the planet has that you want, along with tech tokens which allow you to buy whatever tech you want, never forcing you to try something out because it's your only option
 shrug5
 Techs
 oh my god techs
 They removed all the fun ones, removed all the flying ones, removed the mechs the cards and the interesting ones, and of course replaced the hazard protection ones with the survival pack
 somehow, they took the worst tech of them all (the nearly useless morphball) and made it worse AND a focus at the same time (they removed the bomb feature and gave it trashy mobility options) (also I say this as a fan and a person who tried implementing 2 high tunnels in my bases for fun
)The current state of techs involves head techs, body techs, and feet techs
 They are painful
 5a
 The morph ball is the head tech

So..
I've just over 350 titles purchased through Steam over my years of gaming
 This isn't a humble brag, rather a picture of perspective
 I have never written a "review" for any of those games, but I want to write a bit about this one.Look..
the game starts off sucking
 I don't know how many times I said to myself "This game is SO bad" but, I don't like losing to challenges
 That's what this game is
 A challenge
 A challenge of fidgety controls, a challenge of stiff combat, a challenge of convoluted
quests, and I should preface this by saying I have never played any of the Gothic games to completion, but I have played the Risen series, and came to very much enjoy those
 The game starts off with these milestones that seem unreachable at first, requiring seemingly way too many stat points to learn any skills, get any upgrades, or progress your character at all
 Right around the 6 or 7 hour mark it was like..
all these milestones came at once, and then all of a sudden, the game was playable and started making sense
 I hate saying this about games, but you have to put a little time into the game before it gets good, and I guess you could argue that this is the "Piranha Bytes" way, but I felt it more in this game than in the Risen titles
 So give the game a try for a while and power through the garbage first 5 or so hours, get your first companion, and THEN you will have much better grounds to make a decision
 I am SUPER glad I didn't push this one to the side
UPDATE: So a little over 20 hours in, and I have to say, the game has done nothing but get better and better
 I am at the point now where the world building is incredibly well done, and I have had so many awesome experiences with the quests moslty due to the lack of "Here's the morally good choice, and here's the morally bad choice"
 There are SO many more grey areas than that, and choices that you made at the beginning of the game come full circle 20 hours later, and I am hoping the game continues that trend
 I also want to note the companion system
 I LOVE these guys
 They have their own motives and views on the world, and will change their disposition towards you if your choices conflict with their goals
 The companion quests, so far, have been really interesting as well
 I havent cared for a companion in a game this much since KotOR, I just wish that there were more banter between your companions themselves
 I feel like that was a missed opportunity that could have been interesting, and added even more to the world building
 So far if I could sum this up with some cheesy quote, it would be "Shoot for the moon, because if you miss, you could still land on a star" and then I would add "..
And eh...
if you don't land on a star, theres all kinds of other cool stuff hanging around in space"

Pros:--------One of the most immersive and interesting open-world RPGs I've played recently
-Runs smooth as BUTTER on my computer, and my hardware isn't even that new or great
-No borders or invisible walls.
 you can go anywhere
-The world is fairly large, and also not empty
A good balance of vastness, and denseness of stuff to do
-Various combat systems come together in harmony for a smooth experience
Melee combat may feel a little stiff to some, but I got used to it
-Rich world full of character and an interesting story and lore
Great blend of fantasy, modern, and high-tech
-Controls for Keyboard/Mouse and Xinput-compatible controlers is both very good.
 though I wish you could disable double-tap to dodge on keyboard
-Tons of room for changing your style of play.
 weapons ranging from sharpened sticks, to laser rifles all availible here
Assign your own attribute points when you level up.
 learn a ton of skills, and find yourself some armor and accessories that suit your needs
You can even learn magic, and psychic abilities
Meh:--------It takes a pretty long time to get anywhere in this game
Be prepared to sink a dozen hours or so, before you really start to feel like you're getting significant things done/ are strong enough to do more interesting quests and go to more interesting places safely
This may be a turn-off for some
-This game world does not give a crap about you
It's tough
You're meant to run away from some encounters, especially early on
It will test your patience and skill
Sometimes you have to dig around to figure out what to do
This may be a turn-off for some
Cons:--------Some clumsy little things in the controls, like interacting with the wrong person/item occasionally happens
-Sometimes enemies and followers kinda slip inside objects
 It doesn't happen too often, and they usually pop back out just fine, but it's a bit weird
-If a follower doesn't want to be involved in a fight because it is against his/her morals or whatever, they will just blankly follow you around while you fight, making it appear that they are simply not reacting to the combat taking place
It'd be better if they'd go retreat off to the sidelines or something maybe, instead of getting in the way, but it's usually just a minor annoyance
-Might be too difficult/slow/frustrating for some
Already kinda covered this in the 'meh' area
I personally like the pacing of the game, but I know that some people will not be into it
Bottom line, I love this game, and I recommend it, but not necessarily to everyone
It's a pretty hardcore experience
Difficult, and time-consuming
Immersive and wonderful
Free and sandboxy
Easily worth the money, if it looks like the kind of game you'd be into
Posted: 21 October
So.
 I pumped about 20 hours into this game now and I can come to a conclusion about this game
We'll do that quick and firm
Cons:- Animations (Janky, look weird at times and are forced to play until the end a lot even when not needed)- Movement system- Combat system (mostly because it contains the movement system)I hate the fact that the character has to play through the "I was falling and now I am hitting the ground, preparing to start moving again" animation until the end and you are not able to do ANYTHING while it does that
 You are literally frozen for a whole second
 And oh boy, even if you didnt fall from a big height, let it be just a small stone u are walking off, the character plays the animation and THAT is truly annoying especially when fighting
 The enemy can get up to 3 hits on you ending up killing you while you were unable to do anything because that animation forced you to freeze at the spot, waiting to play it through until the end
The falling animation from greater heights is a joke
 The player is standing still like a statue and is standing straight

ELEX - ReviewWARNING: Multiple walls of texts (and accompanying TL;DRs) await
 Please skip to the bottom if you'd prefer to not read tons of paragraphs
STORY:Setting:The story revolves around the planet Magalan
It takes place a few decades after a meteor crashed into this planet, transforming it into a post-apocalyptic wasteland
With the meteor, a new substance arrived on the planet: Elex, which found many different uses within the different communities of survivors
Over time, factions developed based on the people's beliefs regarding the right use of Elex
Factions:BerserkersBerserkers are, despite their name, the eco-friendly faction that despise technology and you as well if you use it
ClericsReligious fanatics, that subvert the trope and use modern plasma rifles
OutlawsAnarchists who are high on Elex and have a fondness of blowing stuff up
 AlbsThe Albs are a militant group, who abuse Elex for its power, which turns them into cold and callous, machinelike beings
SeparatistsFormer Albs who rejected their leaders but not their way of life
Player:You play as Jax, a former Alb, who was excommunicated by execution (which obviously failed), and is now stranded without gear or Elex in the wilds of Magalan
As Jax, you can join up with one of the factions, gain a high rank and good equipment - or gather followers and build up your own faction
The main storyline leads you back to the Albs - as their enemy
But, as is usual with RPGs, one can spend quite some time with sidequests - which in this game are actually quite intruiging (more in Gameplay)
TL;DRSet in a post-apocalyptic world, in this game's setting, both sci-fi and fantasy elements clash
The player, thrown into this world's conflicts, has to decide to which lengths they will go to reach their goals in this modern take of a choose your own adventure
GAMEPLAYELEX is an open world adventure RPG
StatsAnd since this is an RPG, it obviously has a levelling system, which I actually quite liked (though the first ~10 levels didn't advance the player too much) - the management of different skills allows for certain perks to be trained, and these perks make a big change
In addition to these stats, your character also has a "cold" stat, which varies depending on your behaviour (mostly in dialogues) - being 'cold' - emotionless, selfish etc
 This stat allows for different dialogue options, which often can be quite helpful
 (e.g
 When talking to a friendly woman, dialogue options with less 'cold' value will make it a lot easier for you to gain her sympathy - conversely, when talking to a separatists, being able to converse in a logical emotionless (cold) way makes it easier to gain their support
Posted: 20 October
Long story short: yes, this is Gothic 2, with all of its pluses and minuses
 And I mean ALL of them
If you haven't played Gothic before and are trying to decide whether to grab this game or not, you should understand what Piranha Bytes games are and, more importantly, what they are not
 Speaking generally, despite having dialogue choices, character progression and inventory management, I wouldn't call ELEX an RPG in the same sense as, for instance, Pillars of Eternity or Divinity: Original Sin
 Mechanics of ELEX are much more straightforward, the stamina-based action combat is simpler and easier to understand, the conversation options are mostly limited to either accepting quests or rejecting them, leaving no room for a philosophical debate akin to Planescape: Torment
No, the real backbone of ELEX is its sense of adventure and real, hand-crafted world to explore
 The game doesn't feature randomly generated items or level scaling for enemies, meaning that everything and everyone you meet out there is hand-placed by the developers
 This, in turn, means that no matter at which point of the game you currently are, you're free to use your skills and speed to discover and loot whatever you fancy
 Fall down a pit and emerge with a hefty pouch of coins, explore the dried well and find a forgotten sword stuck in a stone, fly to the top of a cliff and be rewarded with a valuable amulet that'll increase your abilities - all of this feels extremely satisfying, because it gives you a real advantage in both conversations and combat
 Since the content always remains set, every small item you get, every little thing you find brings you one step closer to achieving the heights of your power
Speaking of heights, I can't help but ask myself whether it's ever a bad idea to include a jetpack in your game, because you'd better bloody believe it makes the world of ELEX so much more enjoyable to traverse
 Can't win a fight
 Fly to the top of the nearest cliff and flip your opponent a bird
 Want to check an interesting spot far away on the map
 There will definitely be a way to get there without putting yourself in mortal danger
 Love to chill and enjoy the scenery
 ELEX has plenty of vantage points for you somewhere up top
 It feels good
 It feels right
Anyway, the worst thing I can think of about this game is getting used to it
 Even in the days of Gothic, the control scheme and clunkiness of movement took me several hours to get accustomed to
 I suppose that's just the way Piranha Bytes operates - the movement feels a bit heavy and carries a certain amount of momentum, and that is true for both exploring and fighting
 However, once you put an hour or two into ELEX, this won't be a problem anymore, and you'll be able to enjoy the game to its fullest
And there's plenty to enjoy even without venturing to the farthest points of the vast world, because every NPC you meet will most likely greet you with not just one, but two or more tasks to handle
 Earning their trust to eventually join a faction is also a trademark of Gothic, and this just makes the characters you meet more believable and likeable
In the end, I think ELEX is not a game for everybody, because some of its aspects could definitely use improvements, and it's not even that polished yet - I had the game crash on me twice during the first two hours of playtime
 However, for those of you who are sick of the silly open worlds a-la Ubisoft that somehow found its way into so many modern games (sorry, Geralt, but I don't feel that destroying my 837-th drowners' nest only to find a chest with useless loot counts as a good exploration experience), ELEX will be a welcome relief

I mean work hard
Alternatively - go play Shadow of War for your sense of accomplishment
 They give it there to you on a plate
Oh and cons:- Clunky UI...and.
- INVENTORY MANAGEMENT - I mean who designed this s**** inventory, it's a 10 steps back from whatever gothic had, and that was clumsy and unwieldy
Posted: 22 October
This is probably the first RPG in a while that had me going past the first several hours
 Instead of a cookie-cutter, procedurely generated open pit of mediocrity, what you get instead is a lovingly handcrafted world
The story and characters in this are on the level of that of Black Isle or Obsidian
 Even within the medieval looking Berserker faction, sworn to reject the lure of technology, there are those that dissent quietly and have their own agendas to carry out
Posted: 28 October
Its not a beauty, but it has a soul and that matters.btw.
 no ingame-shop, DLCs, lootboxes etc.
 feels good

My first "review" Currently like 40 hours in i believe and the game is amazing
 The start of the game is really punishing but that's a classic PB game for you :) (Which is great btw)I love how PB lets you learn about the world in the beginning and introduce to so many characters to tell you about the history of the world and their view on it
 It's nicely explained by the characters
 The world is amazing and there's literally 0 loading screens, only when using fast travel (Which takes literally 2 seconds to do as well) Graphics overall are very well made and im really amazed how PB managed to pull this off with only 25 people
 game is voiced acted very nicely
 Many people complain about the combat, at first i did too
 But in like 5 hours it's something you learn and get used to, how to parry enemies and juke them as well
 Most PB games require skill when fighting enemies, not just brainless clicking
 If you already played gothic or risen then you should really buy this title
 many "Youtubers" make videos about this game being trashy when they only shown like 2 hours of gameplay..
You really need some patience when playing this game and it will be rewarding
 Exploration of the world is amazing as well
 I was so side tracked i didint do any main story missions
 started around 27 hours in
 The game does have some issues but hey, which games doesn't have them on release..
The AI of companies is a bit glitchy but it's not really a major issue
 Some AI do glitch and dont move from time to time but it should get patched soon
 If you never played a PB title
i would wait until the game gets patched or goes on sale
 For most PB fans we know that glitches often happen in Gothic etc :P but some of them are super funny so its not even that bad
 I'll rate the game a solid 8
5/10
 not 10 because of the glitches mostly
I haven't been so hooked on a game for ages and Elex finally brought me back nostalagia from Gothic 
Thank you PB for this game <3 looking forward for a next game

It's an episode of South Park that goes 10 to 20 hours instead of 20 minutes
Posted: 15 June
For South Park fans: It is a 11-hour interactive episode of South Park that you would enjoy if you like the crude humor from South Park, definitely worth purchasing
Positive points:+ This is a light RPG with few status effects and simple combat
+ The story is extreme to say the least
+ Four classes to choose from, each with different play styles
+ Interesting achievements
Negative points:- Balance is skewed towards being too easy
- Glitchy at times
- Locked at 30FPS
 (not really an issue but still a worthy note)- Steam version is censored
 (Australian, EU or German versions that I am aware of)

Fantastic game
The whole way through, the experience feels like watching a really good South Park episode or South Park movie, and the game is a *really* solid RPG, to boot
But the game isn't without its flaws
I want to spend a few paragraphs on some criticisms of the game, and then we'll talk about what makes the game awesome
The game feels heavily "consolized
"
Loading screens are far more frequent than they should be and the controls often don't make much sense
Throughout the game your character will be taught "magic spells" from various NPCs
Each time you learn a spell, you are taught a series of controls to use that spell
However, these spells can be used both in and out of combat, and in both situations the controls are different from one anotherand in neither situation is the spell invoked the same way the game inititally taught you
Your out-of-combat utilities (like firing a ranged weapon at something in the environment or sending a buddy to perform a task) are equally awkward to select and use
Now, here I should note that I played with a controller attached to a PC
I started the game with a keyboard/mouse but changed very, very early on to give my normal gaming posture a rest (I play games a lot with the keyboard/mouse), and also because South Park: The Stick of Truth seemed to be tailored more toward a controller
Perhaps the controls are better with a keyboard/mouse, but using a controller felt awkward in many parts of the game
But not in combat
In combat the controls felt great
More on that later, though
On top of that, the game's humor can be off-putting in some parts
This isn't a real criticism so much as it is a warningit IS South Park, after all
The show has a reputation of making comedy material out of even the most sensitive of topics, and this game also doesn't hold back
I like to think of myself as a fairly easy-going guy and I try not to take many things too seriously, but there were parts in this game that I felt myself somewhat rushing through or avoiding just to get away from an uncomfortable topic
There's a lot of back-and-forth running around the map in this game, and loading screens are absolutely everywhere
The loading screens are a real slowdown
So let's see
The loading screens, the really iffy controls in much of the game, and the warning about how the game remains very South Park in its humor are all the things I wanted to make sure to mention
So, now we can talk about the stuff that makes this game a fantastic one
While moving on the map and navigating menus is often awkward with the game's controls, combat is something the game gets very, very right
As I mentioned earlier, this game is a very solid RPG, and The Stick of Truth's turn-based combat is airtight
This isn't your typical "select an ability and watch what happens" kind of turn-based combat
Here, you'll select an ability, and then you'll influence the outcome of the ability with some simple, but fun controls
For example, Butters the Paladin has a "Hammer of Justice" ability
To use it, you select it and then choose a target
The game then has you rotate the left control stick in circles to make Butters spin (think Olympic discus tossing), and at just the right instant, press the A button
Succeed, and you'll deal bonus damage to the enemy
If you mess up, Butters will still deal damage, but not as much
Again, this is coming from the perspective of using a gamepad to control the game; I'm sure this is different for a mouse/keyboard, but the principle is the same
Combat is filled with awesome stuff like this
When you are attacked, most of the time you are given the chance to block some of the enemy's damage by pressing A at just the right time
Some enemy attacks strike multiple times, requiring multiple well-timed blocks
Different enemy attacks have different timings as well, so you'll always need to be on your guard
These combat mechanics make even turn-based combat a very active affair
The action is fast and challenging, so you'll need to be spot on with your controls
Thankfully, controls in combat are responsive and intuitive, and anytime there's some ambiguity about what to do in battle, there are useful tooltips and pop-ups to remind you of how to use an ability
While combat is great fun, the game also very often presents you with multiple ways of dealing with foes
Sometimes you can distract them and sneak by
Other times you can use the environment to defeat your foes without having to confront them
Keen awareness of your surroundings and appropriate use of your abilities out of combat can speed up your progress and yield satisfying results
It should be noted that if you sneak by enemies, you probably won't get experience for dealing with them
But in the cases where you can use the environment to defeat them, you'll be awarded experience as if you had battled them
There are many quests to accomplish throughout the game, and a few side quests can be completed as you progress
As far as questing is concerned, it's your typical RPG farepick up a quest, complete the objectives, turn the quest in
The game does nothing to revolutionize questing, but it handles questing very well
The story-based quests, however, are always greatly satisfying to accomplish because you are awarded not only with experience and often loot/money, but also with story exposition done in only the way South Park can
It really does feel like you're earning a little piece of a South Park episode or South Park movie when you complete a story quest
The writing in the game is spot on
You'll get to watch the South Park characters you're so familiar with do the things they do, in the way they do them, while interacting with one another and with your character
I found the story largely fun and interesting
I was often quite pleased with the developers' efforts to include as many South Park characters as they could in the game
This could not have been an easy task to accomplish, but the game is solid through-and-through with the show's characters, and because the show has been running so long, these characters bring with them their histories, backdrops, and references that the South Park fan should thoroughly enjoy
Character customization is very in-depth for a game with such a simplistic visual style
You'll begin the game by choosing a class, and then customizing your looks
As the game progresses, you will find, like, a bajillion different ways to customize your charcter's costume ("gear"), hair, facial features, makeup, and accessories
You'll even find "strap-ons" (for weapons) and "patches" (for armor) that let you add significant bonuses to your gear, letting you really specialize or round out your character and playstyle
I did make a warning above about the game's humor, but for South Park fans, that (most of the time) means you're in for more of what you enjoy about the show
There were plenty of times I found myself actually laughing out loud at the characters' antics; or at the writing; or at the timing of a joke; or just at South Park being South Park
It's a funny game
There is also a difficulty slider bar
Early in the game I cranked the difficulty to max and didn't look back, and for me, it was quite rewarding
The window of opportunity to block enemy attacks seemed drastically smaller, necessitating more precise timing, and enemies often didn't go down without a fight
I had to stay on top of my gear choices and customize appropriately
Which buddy to bring into battle with me was also a serious consideration, and more than once I had to stock up on potions
Overall, it's just a really solid RPG, and I'd strongly recommend it to any South Park fan
I could go on about it, but I feel I've covered most of the relevant aspects of the game, and apparently Steam has a character limit for reviews
:)

TL:DR
 See ConclusionNOTE:I have played this game extensively when my internet was down (which was 3 days long) so Steam did not record my game time
 Steam does not record game time while offline and if I remember correctly I should have 10-11 hours clocked in
INTRODUCTION:South Park: The Stick of Truth is a 2014 role-playing game based on the popular TV show South Park
 The game was developed by Obsidian Entertainment, and surprisingly enough, published by Ubisoft in one of those occasions where they release a game that is not broken or tied to Uplay
 Good job Ubisoft
PLOT (No Spoilers):The story takes place in the town of South Park where you, the player, take on the role of the 'new kid' who holds a mysterious power of making friends really fast
 Upon arriving, you quickly learn about an ongoing 'Battle' (game) between the Human forces of Cartman and the Drow Elves loyal to Kyle for the control of an artifact of limitless power called 'The Stick of Truth'
PROS:+ Great art style that mimics the TV Series with great accuracy making the game feel more like an episode of the TV show rather than a video game
+ High resolution art works and good animations+ Great sound design that remains true to the TV series' quality+ Wonderful voice acting featuring the original cast and Adolf Hitler[www.imdb
com]+ Good old fashion South Park humor (See NEUTRAL #2)+ Very fun and well integrated gameplay mechanics+ Good amount of Easter eggs from the TV Show+ Excellent overall presentation starting from the character creation screen until the end credits+ Excellent Story+ Fun Canada mini-game+ Good amount of character customization however..
(See CON #2)+ No Uplay account neededCONS:- Gameplay becomes repetitive after a while- Very limited armor & weapon customization and selection- No crafting mechanic to fix the above CON- Useless DLC itemsNEUTRAL:+/- Excusable 30 fps lock because it works well with the graphics, gameplay and artstyle+/- The South Park toilet and black/dark humor may not appeal to everyone (so if you don't like South Park to begin with, you will probably not like this game as well
)+/- The story is fairly linear but the presentation makes it feel as if it was open worldCONCLUSION:EXCELLENT game for South Park fans all around
 This game preserves the look and feel of the series while integrating very fun and entertaining gameplay mechanics that would rival even some of the much more established RPG games
 WORTH IT
:I can RECOMMEND this game at its full price only if you're a South Park fan because chances are, any fan of the series would fully appreciate all the extra content and easter eggs from the show
However, if you're not a fan of the series but don't particularly hate it, get the game during a sale
 If you hate the series and/or you're easily offended / triggered by dark / toilet humor I would not recommend purchasing this game

(TLDR
 This review is also available in video format if you scroll down
)Since 1997, South Park has graced television with its profane, unabashed, and satiric humor
With its success it has managed to become a part of American culture and spawn a full length movie and several video games along the way but none are quite up to level as South Park: The Stick of Truth
 With the help of Obsidian Entertainment, Matt Stone and Trey Parker have created the most accurate transfer of an intellectual property to games ever made
That being said, this is a game made with longtime fans of the series in mind
If you're not a fan of the show, or don't appreciate its style of humor your experience may differ drastically from the intended audiences
The Stick of Truth picks up shortly after the trilogy events of Season 17
After an initial character creation screen you wake up as the new kid in South Park
 Upon leaving your house, you'll befriend your neighbor, Butters, and venture on over to Cartman's house where he and Kenny, along with an ensemble of South Park regulars, are role-playing as a warring fantasy faction of humans that guard a sacred relic known as the Stick of Truth
After a brief introduction and Cartman honoring you with a chosen name his kingdom is assaulted by a band of elves who manage to steal the holy object
As in typical South Park fashion, the small and insignificant somehow manages to eventually involve the whole town and powers beyond as the story snowballs you through the town's workings, aliens, government interference, and of course..
 Nazi zombies
 One thing that's blatantly obvious from early on is that this isn't cable television's South Park
This is a humor much more akin to the 1999 South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut, except on steroids and about 15 hours long, which is relatively short for a game of this genre
Much of the humor is crude and meant to be insulting, but fans of the show will find it quite satisfying
 The South Park writers were really on their A game and the show makes constant references to its own history, from every single piece of junk you pick up to who or what is in each of the boy's closets
The amount of detail and respect this game has for the source material is really quite amazing
 Its visual style makes you feel like you're actually playing the show and people walking by may not know the difference
The game play involves you picking one of four classes, each with their own unique playing-styles
 The combat plays out similarly to most JRPGs with a turn-based system that rewards timed button presses similar to Super Mario RPG
Youre also able to choose one of six companions to follow you at different points of the game each with their own distinct abilities
It's a streamlined but fun system that forces you to pay attention while you play, although its simplicity doesn't offer much in the way of a challenge
Occasionally you'll also be presented opportunities in which combat can be avoided or reduced by taking advantage of the environment around the foe
It's a great feature to have, as with most turn-based RPGs, combat isn't the high point and creates a nice rewarding dynamic when you see an opportunity to kill an enemy without direct confrontation
To offset the impressively accurate paper cut out visuals, Stick of Truth employs a very serious orchestral soundtrack
You'll frequently be reminded of Game of Thrones and Skyrim while listening
 Its contrast to the material creates a great comedic effect
 The voice acting remains true to the show, with Matt and Trey supplying most of the voice work, often with the same voices for different characters, with the Nazi's having an effectively hilarious voice track
While the content provided is an impressive representation of South Park, its accuracy raises the expectations enough so that when something from the series doesn't show up, it can be a bit disappointing
 Some characters and locations are missing and one cant help but think they were deliberately left out to allow for DLC and/or a sequel
 South Park: The Stick of Truth is a great game for people who appreciate the show or have a similar taste in humor
It can be a bit polarizing but that's to be expected with a title such as this
The writing is rich and full of references that fans will truly appreciate, but sometimes, as with the show some of the jokes can get old at times
 Luckily however, there are enough jokes in this game to be thoroughly enjoyable throughout its somewhat brief duration
 A relatively easy difficulty, and lack of post-game content and a somewhat questionable quest reward system, where you'll frequently get items well after they've had any use to you can cause a bit of tedium to set in
 The gameplay holds its own, it doesn't do anything new or amazing but the charm that saturates every aspect of it makes it feel special
 This is, hands down, the best South Park game ever made
If you're looking for the definitive South Park experience, waiting for season 18 or just want to laugh, this is the game for you

 Great game
I am new to
the strategic fps scene and I found this game easy to adapt to
 The community is mostly welcoming and helpful
 However, I made the mistake of purchasing this game as a 15 year old
 People dont appreciate Mr Squeaky as much as other games
 I was shocked to discover that only 2% of the players of this game are under the age of 15
 And if you are my age

Be me
Create a new squad and be SL
A bunch of randoms join it
Game starts
Whole squad follows my orders
 No questions asked
Worried we are all a bunch of casuals that are going to get wiped out as soon as we get into contact
Hike across map for 20 mins stressing out about it
Hostiles spotted
All hell breaks loose
Everyone starts shooting
Everyone screaming
I s**t my pants
We call out targets and look out for each other and somehow make it through
We wipe out three enemy squads, a BTR, a logi truck and an enemy fob
We cap two points and push enemy team all the way back to main
Our squad is so good, other squads start thanking us wherever we go
Other squad leaders start arguing with each other over who asked for our help first
We become the stuff of legends and take out another squad, a BTR and fob
Game ends
 10 seconds of silence staring at score screen
We win and are by far best squad in every category with kills, points etc
Squad says I was the best SL they ever played with

May 31st 2017 - 15:30 GMTAs a medic in the Russian Ground Forces, I saw bodies in the streets of SE Petrivnka, of my fellow comrades, ones who fought beside me, the ones I trusted, laying beside me as I was firing bullets into an enemy we could not see, but was there siphoning the lives around me
 All was lost but hope
 As I helped build sandbags around the village, I could feel the presence of the militia, their eyes on me, their fingers ready to see me drop
 As explosions and bullets smashed through concrete, the concrete we thought would protect us, the concrete we thought was impenetrable, I made a desperate run for the two-storey farmhouse with my best friend and some comrades in arms, a few of us were in the same squad, some from different squads, yet we fought and bled together we saw some of our comrades hit the ground as the militia technical's DShK ripped into the building shattering the soldiers
 Some of our men were down, I peered through the window hoping to get shot, but I see enemies coming over the hill and I see one in an alleyway, I take a shot at him and he is injured, but I was too scared to take another, my team-mate finishes the job, I went to attend to the men which were down but I had no bandages, then a comrade decides to go and help with the bandages as he was too a fellow medic
 He goes and tells me something but he.
 he gets shot in the head blood pouring through like a waterfall
 I take cover, as many other men fall around me
 We were stuck in a two-storey prison and also a mass grave
 I took cover in the corner, as the only people left was me and an automatic rifleman, I saw my best friend bleed out in front of me, he dies
 I shut my eyes and then the automatic rifleman was shattering the stairs with bullets
 The enemy which I couldn't see is now one floor below me
 I shut my eyes one last time and as I open them I see on my screen:"MILITA FORCES HAVE WON"I was glad, not because the enemy won but because the pain had stopped
I was only a recruit, 13hrs on my belt
 Yet nothing could prepare me for this

I spent the first 20 minutes in Squad not knowing what to do
I spent the next 15 minutes trying to kill someone
 I didnt
Then the game ended
Undeterred I picked a new server and got ready to roll into the game with guns blazing
Twenty minutes later, I still hadnt managed to shoot a single insurgent
It took me a full 45 minutes to get my first confirmed kill
The first half an hour in Squad was awful, the HUD wasnt intuitive, and I had no idea what the point of the game was
The next hour was filled with short and intense firefights, slow and steady progress and some of the best teamplay that Ive ever experienced
Squads gameplay bursts to life once you start actively participating in your squad and communicating with your team members
Each kill you achieve brings you one step closer to victory, and every death you experience cripples your squad
Squad is an immersive and realistic experience, filled with tense moments, bitter defeat and sweet victory
One of my most memorable moments in the game occurred about halfway into the match
We had just managed to capture the Market and parts of squad 1 were with us(squad 2)
After an incredibly tense firefight, we had finally managed to take down the insurgents and were stationed in a defensive position, looking out towards no man's land, on the lookout for the opposing team
One of the cool features of Squad is proximity communication, in other words you can push-to-talk and those that are near you will be able to hear what you have to say, with the voice getting quiter the further away you are from the speaker
One of the members in squad 1 activated his proximity communication, and started talking to us about a firefight that he had experienced the other day
What happened next was a couple minutes of players, sitting in a circle swapping war stories as if they were old soldiers
It was an incredibly rewarding and organic experience...
until we got way too distracted swapping war stories, and got overrun by the insurgents
In CS:GO are punctuated by a bursts of activity, gunplay and death, Squads gameplay is much more of a slow and steady burn
At its core, Squad is a game that revolves heavily around teamwork and being able to communicate effectively with the rest of your squad
Communication with your squad and your team is especially important and the game allows you a multitude of ways for you to communicate with your squad, your team, and those in your direct proximity
Youll need to work together with your squad in order to capture and control each base
This will require large amounts of teamwork and for you to have complete trust in your squad to watch your back
The gameplay in Squad is deadly, with death occurring quickly and oftentimes unexpectedly
You'll run and duck as a shower of bullet peppers the wall behind you, grip your gun tightly as tracer rounds fly above your heads and breathe a sigh of relief when your squad rounds a corner in order to back you up

Early Access Review
If you don't trust Early Access titles, then this game may change your mind
 I can honestly say that I have NEVER in my time playing Early Access games, seen a developer team that works so closely with the community, and even comes on the servers and plays with every one and asks questions and makes sure that the communities voice has been heard
 But to get down to an actual review of the game, here goes
GAMEPLAYThe gameplay for it being an alpha early access game is PHENOMENAL, the firefights that you get into are intense, and really get your blood flowing
 The game is so well designed that from the standpoint of gameplay, you actually gain a sense of fear before assaulting a compound, or hearing footsteps outside a wall unsure if it is a friendly or not, and being unwilling to check your map for fear of potentially getting shot
 The in-game comms are very well done, Local positional voice, Squad voice, and Squad leader voice (For SLs talking amongst other squads)
 The medical system is an ever changing system, but it is also a system that works, and it works damn well
 The weapon handling is fantastic, it really emphasizes not blasting full auto, unless of course you are in a CQB situation then it works perfectly fine
 Fob building is great as well, clear images of what is going to be there once it has been built by squadmates, and what direction it faces
 Overall, coming from Project Reality myself, the gameplay for Squad gets a solid 10/10 from me
AUDIOHonestly, I have never heard a military shooter with such crisp audio
 From the footsteps of friendly and enemy soldiers, to the supersonic crack of a bullet flying passed your head
 Nothing in my opinion beats Squads audio team and I really commend them for doing all the research they can to get the sounds as close to what they are in real life
 The weapon sounds are crisp, clear, and sound powerful
 Not like other games where they sound like peashooters
 The death screams are a nice touch, and help with identifying allies that have gone down and need a medic and confirming kills
 The music score in the main menu is also phenomenal, it really brings to life the thought of being sent to a warzone and not knowing if your squad is going to make it, although the music isn't featured in the actual gameplay, it's a welcome and very well done touch to the main menu
GRAPHICSThe graphics are a huge step-up from Project Reality
 I've played games like Arma 3/2 and before that, I've also played the entire battlefield series (but stuck with BF2), and countless other games that are very intense when it comes to graphics
 Squads graphics in some aspects are some of the best I have seen
 From the backblast of an RPG or LAW, to the actual explosion of hand grenades, 40mm grenades, or the warheads from the LAW/RPG they are fantastic to watch and truly a sight to see, and gives a sense of danger when you see this huge cloud of smoke land just feet away from you as you are taking cover behind a wall waiting for your moment to break cover and return fire
 The player models are always being updated, with the new Russian, Militia, and the Insurgent factions getting a welcome makeover since I started playing in September
 The Americans are due for a makeover as well, but this will come in due time
CONTROLSUnlike the Arma series, Squad doesn't feel even close to as clunky as arma, but offers the same range of movement(Save for free look which is a possibility in the future)
 It offers a rich and rewarding movement system that causes you to think before you make an action as the momentum of your soldier is what propels you towards the direction you are facing, unlike games like Battlefield 2/3/4 where it feels like you're constantly sliding around with a constant momentum in either direction where you can turn on a dime and get a headshot
 Squad isn't a milsim, but it also isn't a twitch shooter, and it really finds it's balance by bringing the two together and taking the good parts from both, while getting rid of the bad parts as well as incorporating a lot of the phenomenal things that Project Reality has done
TEAMPLAYI'm going to say it simple, and blunt
 If you DON'T communicate with your squad/team, you WILL fail
 I play in a highly organized clan where we are all comfortable with each other, and understand each other
 We know what is expected of us from our Squad Leaders, and the #1 thing that you can, and have to do to be successful, is LISTEN to your squad leader and COMMUNICATE what is going on around you
 Giving valuable information such as enemy movement in a certain direction (0 to 345, 0 being 360), letting your squad leader know when you have stumbled upon an enemy FOB, or even letting the medics know you've been tagged and need medical attention
 I cannot stress enough how valuable communication and teamwork is in this game, working as an effective squad where that squad is helping the team will make or break your experience
All in all, I recommend squad 110% the game took my breath away from the moment I stepped on the sandy hills of Logar pressing through hostile fire coming from the central village, or stepped into the deep desert valley of Kohat
 Now with the addition of Fool's Road, I can add the intensity it was when we had three squads all communicating together storming up the side of a steep hill, to overtake an enemy FOB and release the capture point from their possession
 If you pass up the opportunity to buy and play this game, I guarantee that you will regret it, Squad has been the best money I have spent on a game in a long time and I couldn't be happier
 To give you some perspective on what I mean by teamwork, here is a link to a video I recorded tonight (2015-12-14) that should shed some light on what it's like to really play as a team
The game takes time to learn
 There are bugs yes, but the game is still in early development and the developers are very active in the community and do their best to fix every bug they can find before the next build update
 With regards to the learning curve, it's not as steep as Armas learning curve, and it's designed so that the average FPS player can hop in and start playing basically
 But, there are still concepts that are not present in other FPS games, like listening to your squad leader and doing what he says, building FOBs, taking defensive positions etc
 The game isn't about rushing in and trying to get the most kills, it's about playing as a team, moving as a team, and making sure everyone is ready in your squad before moving in to attack
 There aren't any bugs in the game that are gamebreaking, AMD users have a bit of trouble playing, but that's not completely on the devs side, that has to do with Unreal Engine 4 not really liking AMD processors and graphics cards
 I myself have a Core i5-3570k and a GTX 970 and I usually get between 40 and 50 fps right now while recording video
 To end the final edit on this review, the game is great, it's still in alpha and being developed by only 30 people, now for 30 people to do something like this, it's amazing
 When you get a company like EA/DiCE who have hundreds of developers at their disposal, and they still turn out a bad game (E.g
 Battlefront, Battlefield 4, Battlefield Hardline etc) or Treyarch/activision (Call of duty games = same thing every year no real ingenuity) then what exactly are those devs doing to make sure they put out a good game
 Anyways, YMMV with this game, but it's up to the individual to decide whether or not this is the game for them
I chose to replace the original video with one that shows what you will see more of in Squad
 This is what you will experience 95% of the time while playing
 Or at least what I have experienced 95% of the time while playing

BeamNG
drive is a very physics-heavy simulation, utilizing Torque3D and a very accurate, realistic soft-body physics engine
 What does this mean for you, however
 This game provides stunningly realistic vehicle deformations, much like Rigs of Rods, which BeamNG
drive is based off
 BeamNG
drive tries to be the most accurate vehicle damaging simulator, and it is succeeding
 While it is still only in Alpha, I strongly recommend picking this up if you're like me and find pleasure in smashing pickup trucks into small Japanese compact cars
If you wish to own this title, you can order a Steam Alpha key at their website, http://www.beamng

Early Access Review
First of all, your search for the ultimate car game/simulator ends RIGHT HERE and RIGHT NOW
 I'm serious
 No other simulator in history has ever been as realistic as BeamNG.drive
 In fact, once this sim gets popular, it could even be used in driving schools
 The cars handle, perform, and DEform EXACTLY like their real life counterparts
 Behind each car is a revolutionary system of nodes and beams that calculates the deformation of the car's body at 2000 times a second
 Not only that, but the windows crack and shatter, and pretty much every part from the headlights to the tailpipes to the fenders to the engine can break off like they would in real life
This is a long, in-depth review, to give you the best idea of what this is
This is an awesome simulator
 You can do anything you want with cars, trucks, boats, planes, and drive/fly them as well as smash them, crash them, and drop boulders on them (Yes, I'm not kidding)
 There are also numerous props you can play with such as a car shredder (two rollers close together that you can drive through) and many others in the official game
 There is even a fidget spinner mod that you can DESTROY cars with
 And, if you want you can put that 3 foot tall spoiler on your old Honda
 The base game comes with 13 maps (aka terrains) to explore, and they range from 1 square kilometer to 4 square kilometers (there is a 16 square kilometer map coming)
 The developers do, however make them seem much bigger despite their real size
 There is also an infinite grid map which is completely flat and empty and the ground is nothing more than a grid
 In addition, there are maps created by the community that can be as big as ~350 square kilometers
 Once BeamNG's engine gets optimized to the point we can have open world maps, we will start seeing even larger maps
Here are the vehicles included with BeamNG
Also in the base game are 20 fictional vehicles (as of last review update) based off of real-life vehicles, which are FULLY customizable in almost every aspect
 In addition to in-depth customization, you also get about 10 preset configurations (trims) for every car
 You can choose the one you like the most and then add/remove/change the parts on that trim to make it JUST the way you want
 Here is the vehicle list:http://wiki.beamng
com/Official_Content#VehiclesAnyway, enough about the content
 Let's get into the gameplay and physics
Although for now there is no Career mode, this simulator is still very fun to play
 There are scenarios, and they are usually coordinated time trials on a specific course on a specific terrain
 Sometimes it is just for fun, like jumping a van off a ramp and landing unscathed
 And the physics, they will not get any better than this
 BeamNG is the most realistic and detailed vehicle simulator to date
 It simulates the behavior of vehicles from the glass breaking to the hubcaps falling off to the engine block melting
 BeamNG uses a unique system for ultra-realistic vehicle behavior that yields a unique gaming experience each time
 It uses beams (BEAMng) and nodes to simulate each and every part independently
 The nodes connect all of the thousands of beams together, and the beams can deform, bend, and break
 There are no predefined damage models
 The node and beam system calculates the damage on any one section of the car
 For example, if you slide past a wall in a Need For Speed game, with the front facing it slightly more than the back, the windows will probably shatter and then there will be paint scratches on random places of the car
 Let's slide past that same wall in BeamNG
 The mirror fell off and there is a dent in the front bumper EXACTLY where the car contacted the wall
 Also a hubcap most likely fell off if the car had plastic rims
If all that isn't enough, there is a big community on the BeamNG forums cranking out mods frequently
 There are well over 200 vehicles/vehicle mods to download and well over 200 extra maps to download from the mod repository alone
And, finally, let's talk customization
 Let's take the D-15 for example
 For this single vehicle, you can customize the paint job (color/decals), the tow hitch, the type of engine (I6 or 2 tiers of V8s), supercharger, lights, color, bumper type and color, suspension, body, and even the light bar to name a few
 So the bottom line is, this game offers more customization options than any other driving game currently on the market
 Even NFS Underground 2
Also, in the 0
10 update, each kind of engine (inline 4, v6, etc) has its own sound
I hope this review was helpful to any new BeamNG players
 Enjoy this wonderful game

SUPER fun
After finding out about this, I went on a search to find any free games that could do what this thing could do
Nothing
Then, I took off the free filter, and still nothing compared
 This game is a true simulation of physics, and it does it extremely well and accurately
The next best thing would be rigs of rods, but even that doesn't come anywhere close to the power and freedom you have in BeamNG
Highly recommended

Early Access Review
I purchased this game since day 1 and i am very very glad I did
 I have seen the development of the game grow from the start
 The developers have been amazing keeping us informed of the status of the game with consistant detailed dev blog's
An amazing game with the best physics engine for vehicles out there
 From crashes, weight of the vehicle, traction, torque ....
 everything is incredibly accurate
There is so much to do with many many hours of fun from using community made mods such as vehicles, maps, objects and much more, cruising around the beautiful maps, re-enacting crash scenes, racing, demoilition derby ....
 The list goes on
It may seem as if I have only been on this game for a couple of hours, but I can assure you I have played this game well over 100 hours

Early Access Review
Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher
I'm about one..
 maybe two good jump scares away from being institutionalized
 Playing as an Indonesian schoolgirl with a magic phone, an archeologist with amnesia, and a toddler with diapers full to the brim has had an ill effect on me
 My heart just can't take it  my mind just can't take it
 The filaments that hold my fragile psyche aloft are pulled taut, straining as each frayed fiber falters and my sanity slips closer towards the cold, dark depths of derangement
 Which isn't super great, really
 But I'll gladly surrender my faculties for a game as fun as Darkwood
Darkwood isn't a Slender or Amnesia clone
 This is a game in the vein of old school horror where atmosphere was king  you'll hear lots of comparisons to the Silent Hill series
 The key to good horror is cultivating a crushing, foreboding world environment..
 one that fosters paranoia and unease the whole way through
 Sure, jumpscares are necessary to finally break the tension, but the best horror games are dripping and oozing in atmosphere
 The whole world should FEEL hostile, not just the denizens that inhabit it
 This game doesn't want you playing it, no
 It wants to play you
Here's what you can expect playing Darkwood: your hands should be clammy with an itch you can't scratch, not now
 Your face should be inches from your monitor, blinking only when necessary, scanning wildly back and forth for something, ANYTHING, to betray the game's ill intent
 As you talk with each bizarre NPC you should feel nervous, wondering when the conversation will go from benignly creepy to malignantly violent
 And when you finally encounter an unspeakable horror, you'll have to make that gut decision whether to run or stand your ground
 I recommend running
 Like with all survivor horrors, you are at a notable disadvantage
 You'll also be able to set up hasty barricades..
 rocking back and forth as claws scratch and jaws click outside, tearing your defenses down piece by piece
There are a lot of cool things happening with this game
 Your vision is funneled, forcing the aforementioned wild scanning
 You can see the world generally in your peripheral vision, but you have to be looking relatively dead-on to see any actual threats
 They'll be effectively invisible otherwise
 You'll inject yourself with concoctions extracted from fauna and flora that provide mutations
 They will grant a boost in one way and a hindrance in another
 There's a crafting aspect that's pretty basic right now but feels natural..
 rough and raw
 Besides health you have a stamina meter, one you'll have to keep an eye on when deciding whether to fight or fly
 Graphically speaking, Darkwood isn't exactly next gen, but it is highly stylized and creepy
 It's a beautiful, dark, Gothic painting  like the ones where the eyes follow you wherever you go and it talks smack about your mother
 And the music will chill you to the bone
 If the environment and enemies start to give you a little break, don't worry
 The music will swell and put you right back on edge, or the heavy creaks and sudden cracks of the sound design
Like any good horror this is a challenging game
 I do recommend playing with permadeath on
 Adds to the spook factor
 Anticipate shedding lots of your own pixelated blood
 My biggest gripes
 It's hard to determine sometimes (between how dark the game is and how..
 generally dark the colors are) what
I can search and interact with and what's just a creepy thingy
 The controls also take some getting used to, but that seems appropriate considering the genre
 Now seeing that this is an Early Access title my recommendation is tentative and subject to change
 But at the moment there is nothing out on Steam quite like this
 Every day you hear people bemoan the death of true survival horror, myself being one of them
 Well folks, it wasn't dead
 Just waiting for the right moment to sing its siren song..
 and draw us in at least once more, into those dark and dreary woods where light dares not penetrate and your screams can't quite escape

Early Access Review
<Subject to change>My first few hours in Darkwood were certainly very interesting, after the impressive prologue I decided to go speak to an NPC i was advised to find
 After I did this I realised daylight was running out, and here's what happened next:-Returned to my safehouse and pushed a wardrobe up against a gaping hole in the wall
-Panicked because I didn't bother to collect the tools necessary to barricade the house
-Everything is now pitch black, my cone of vision is
tiny -I weep as I slowly walk myself to the 'front lobby' room because it has no windows to reduce the chance of being spotted
-I hear the moans of some unknown ethereal horror-Check both the exterior and interior door to ensure they are closed-The moaning gets louder-The action prompt for the front door now says 'close door', meaning it has been
opened -My cone of vision is still 2-3ft btw-I quickly close the door-The prompt changed to 'close door' again-I close the door again-Moaning is still extremely loud-Continue in this pattern for 60 seconds in sheer terror before the door finally stays closed for a while
-I sigh a breath of relief-Something swiftly moves past the far edge of my cone of vision-* very loud moaning continues
*-The monster was in the lobby with me for the whole night-I'm sure i'm going to die-Suddenly Daybreak-*Day 2*

Wow, what a journey
 A top down actual survival horror game that actually has an intriguing storyline
 Categories typically get a base score, followed by pros and cons
 Graphics: 9/10==========Many will question why I give this game a 9
 I don't believe graphics have to have 1000000000 polygons to be good
 This game chose a more pixel style of graphics with what I believe to be some hand drawn environments
 Whatever it is, the composition comes together so damn well
 The Depth of field on trees that are high up in the air way above your character, to the animations of enemies and your character, to the fire and flames and 3D buildings
 It all looks great and has fantastic polish
 Well done
 +9Story: 8/10========This is a game where I can't really give a synopsis to what is going on
 You will just have to play the game
 +8Some major/minor character questlines have unexplained and unforetold consequences to the story and your surrounding environment
 This isn't necessarily a bad thing but it has a chance of frustrating you since you probably won't be able to go back and change it (unless you reset very quickly)
 As someone who always tries to achieve the best ending possible, this affected my "try not to die" playthrough
 +/- 0Sound/Music: 10/10==============10 out of freaking 10
 This is a game where you will constantly be saying to yourself "wtf was that noise
" From the subtle footsteps you'll occasionally hear of someone walking around in your hideout that isn't you, to the creepy eerie music that confronts you upon approaching a critical point in the storyline
 It's all brilliant
 +9No jumpscares
 +1Gameplay: 9/10===========Gameplay revolves around scouraging for supplies and progressing the storyline in the daytime, to surviving the nighttime in your house against the perils of the forest
 +2Crafting system is easy to understand, works great, and is implemented without frustration (besides missing a needed supply)
 +1Fair difficulty settings ranging from Normal (infinite lives), to Hard (limited lives), to Nightmare (one life)
 +1Enemies are varied in difficulty as the game progresses and all have unique abilities that might just end your 1 life playthrough
 They are however readable, learnable, and aren't frustrating to deal with
 You get the hard mode without the headache
 +2Again, no jumpscares
 +1Events that take place directly at the hideout at nighttime are brilliant and creepy
 One night you may not encounter a single enemy, but instead will find someone knocking on your door to leave you supplies
 Another night you'll face against 10 Huge Dogs
 Good luck
 +2Unique category, Lighting and Vision: 10/10================================Darkwood gets its own category of how it handles the lighting and the vision in this game
 It takes into account not only the visual perspective of your character's eyes, but also of electricity, and fire, and whatever the hell those things are later in the game that emit light
 Sometimes an enemy will temporarily destroy all electrical sources of light
 Lets hope you have some torches or a flare
 Even things such as getting poisoned, or drunk on alcohol will affect your given vision, typically narrowing it for a period
 And there are abilities that give you greater vision
 Some enemies simply require that you don't look directly at them, no matter how close you may be to them, and they can't do a damn thing to you
It's these things that I feel needed to be accounted for, for how brilliantly they're used
 Well done
 +10Overall: 9
2/10 (46/50 = 0
92)=====================It's not often I buy a game that I am just so utterly excited to play again the next day
 I'm sure I'm not the only one
 For what Darkwood is, it nails just about every aspect of its intended presentation
 Well done developers

Early Access Review
Dear Journal: I keep coming back to life, despite my best efforts
 I thought death would be a release, but it's only a continuation of the torment
 In what I'm sure is a futile effort to keep my sanity, I will try to catalogue my various deaths
Death 1:No weapons in sight and night is falling rapidly
 In a misguided attempt to make the animals friendlier towards me, I've brewed a strange concoction from the local mycological flora and injected myself with it
 The only effect I've seen towards my original intention was that the rabbits have stopped gnashing their teeth when I approach and have opted for a more subtle, indignant sideways glance
 Night fell and I drank the well water as I was told by the nonchalant wolfman (nonchalant in that he seemed to have no compunctions that he was a freak of nature) that woke me up
 The generator has failed and my only light is the mocking phosphorescent glow of my last flare
 I hear things approaching
 Hungry things
 I've pushed my wardrobe in front of the window in the hopes that it would stop them
 It did not, and a howling naked man has bashed my skull in and, presumably, eaten me
Death 2:Woken up by the wolfman again
 He doesn't seem to remember me
 I show him the dogtag as before and, as before, he tells me to seek out the chicken lady
 My travels this time have been more fruitful
 I've discovered several nonfunctional vehicles nearby, each containing a substantial amount of fuel
 Hopefully this will help me keep the generator running this time
 I've also found enough material to fashion a crude weapon for my inevitable self-defense
 On top of that, I've found a bear trap with which to lay a trap for any more au naturel forest men that want to avail themselves of my sweetmeats
 Once again, night falls and I drink from the well
 I'm somewhat prepared this time
 Again they come
 I catch one in the bear trap and proceed to beat him into submission
 Shortly after, another bursts in behind me, catching me by surprise
 A pitched battle erupts, with me barely surviving to fell my opponent
 I'm bleeding badly, but have enough rags to fashion a welcome, if somewhat unsanitary, bandage
 Eventually morning arives and I stride wrecklessly back out into the forest, perchance to happen upon more provisions and survive another night in this hellish place
 I happen upon a corpse, seemingly hidden under a jagged thicket
 Immediately upon poking it, it explodes and I'm slain by its cadaverous stench
Death 3:Again the wolfman comes
 I think he's mocking me
 Is it a he
 It sounds male
 I have little luck in finding anything useful in my wanderings
 The woods are crawling with wolves (the normal kind..
 I didn't think to stop and check their gender), and I have to skirt around them constantly
 I find some alcohol, rags, and a lighter, but little else
 At least I can keep warm with this, one way or another
 Night falls and I drink the water
 I'm beginning to wonder if I should be following the wolfman's advice at this point
 For all I know, it's the well water that's keeping me here
 I can do nothing but sit in my dark house, hoping they don't find me and tear me limb from limb
 My hopes are completely unfounded
 Having no other weapons, I quickly fashion a crude Molotov cocktail and hold it at the ready for when something crashes through the window in front of me
 Alas, one crashes in behind me
 Panicking, I drop the freshly lit incendiary at my feet, immediately catching myself and the wildman ablaze
 I'm not sure which of us died first
 I can now officially say that immolation has been my least favorite way to go
Death 4:Banshee..
 or witch
 I'm unsure at this point
Death 5:Pack of wolves
 Gender unknown
Death 6:%$@&ing CORPSE BOMB
Death 7: Ok, this is getting a little ridiculous
 I'm just going to sit in my house and pretend I'm dead
 Maybe the universe, or whatever cruel deity placed me here, will forget that I exist and move on to torment some other poor soul..
 Nope
Ten out of ten
 Would die again

This games makes a great impression in the prologue and in your first night out of the tutorial
Mine went like this
-I was able to gather a bit of resources and boarded up a door and a window-I turned on the generator since I moved a lamp into a room I thought would be perfect-I moved the lamp to the window which was boarded up so I could see outside as well as inside-As the night got darker I see creatures outside through the small cracks within the boarded up window-Moans closing in and sounds of furniture moving in the room next to mine-The generator dies and everything is now pitch black-I sit for a while in the darkness-When the door opens and this THING enters-I was luckily able to kill it with my plank with nails in it-Close the door and hold out-Day 2 starts and I leave the room I was in-I check the house to see how it got in-NOTHING was moved from its original spot and no windows or doors were brokenSo..
how did it get in

I abstained from writing this review until Darkwood was publicly released
 That being said, I've owned this game well over two years, so I've got quite a bit to say
 To compare this game to others would be a crime, but if I had to, I'd say that Darkwood feels like playing Hotline Miami, if HM were inside of the Blair Witch Project
 The top-down perspective may seem like an odd choice for a survival horror, but it ends up working very well in Darkwood, since your cone of vision is small, and the added challenge of having to mouse over areas to see underneath tree cover adds to a perfectly executed sense of claustrophobia
The primary gameplay loop of Darkwood is fairly simple: Explore, scavenge, and arm yourself during the day, then gas up your generator and wait out the night
 If you fail to make it back to your safehouse and power on the lights before dark, Bad Things will happen
 What makes nighttime truly terrifying in Darkwood is the lack of a sleep mechanic: You are awake at all times and constantly afraid that your pitiful house defenses will be breached and you'll suffer Even More Bad Things
 The sound design also adds so much to that tension of waiting out the night
 You'll hear footsteps outside your door
 You'r door will be beaten upon
 Things will go bump in the night, and you'll be cowering in the corner waiting, praying, for that music to start and your screen to go red, signifying the successful survival of another night
Setting and plot wise, Darkwood has the most compelling location and premise of any horror game I've ever played
 I won't spoil much, just remember to respect the trees
Controls and game feel are 100% spot-on
 Graphics look very good, especially if you like little details (Just look at how the grass moves
) Buy the game
 Door code couldn't be simpler

got to The Old Forest, found my new home and had all the supplies to move in
 fixed up the well, was able to blocked up all the windows and fortify the doors i needed to, moved the furnature into one main room to cover the doors and windows at night (extra protection from the locals, just in case) and got all of my supplies put away and prepared for the great night i would have in my new home
and what a night it was
after about 30 seconds after getting my late night drink from the well, walking back inside and pushing the wardrobe over the door again, the fun began
 they started with the windows
 i watched in horror as almost all at once, my window barriers started to explode in showers of splinters in the rooms surrounding mine
 i could hear the abominations
climbing in, roaming the halls, smashing my doors off their frames, and hunting for my flesh while they screamed out in anger

So, I invested 31 days (in game time) to one world, thinking I could go through it and get some of the many endings this game provides
 On the 30th day I go into a hellish pigshed and find a monstrosity that no words can describe, the only way of ending said creature (besides being insane and fighting it directly) was to electricute it
In order to do this I needed a particular cable that was sold by a good buddy of mine called Piotrek, whom I had just given all the items to for the rocket he was building
At the time he was really excited about this and told me that by tomorrow he was going to fly to the moon or something of that sort
What was unknown to him was that I had allowed the Wolfman to see one of the components to his rocket (I had no clue that this would cause the ship to explode, sadly
) So the very next day I walk to
Piotrek's house only to see him dead on the ground, skewered by the many pieces of shrapnel that came out of the exploding pile of junk
In a flood of sadness and fury, I head over back to the wolf camp and began talking to my partner in crime, whom was sh*tting himself in laughter after seeing the explosion
Once I realized that I wasn't able to finish off the monstrosity, I stride behind the Wolfman, brought out my pistol and put a bullet into the back of his head
I then promptly loot the dead man's body and walk out into the middle of the meadow as I waited for the time to tick away
As the sun set I felt my body begin to corrode away until my heart stopped, and I fell to the ground dead
I'm sorry, Piotrek

With almost 10 hours of straight gamplay including using heavy equipment but not a large scale wash plant, I would say my current stance with the game is in the positive but still concerned over the issues in the game
So I will break down my take on the game and people can read it at their own discretion
Positives:-The game looks really great overall with fantastic detail on the terrain and purchasable items
 -The vehicles function as intended despite my losing my truck to the glitch gods and flying thru the air while driving down a trail
-The lack of "tutorial" is in my opinion better as in real life, you aren't hand fed with a silver spoon in this business-I enjoy the availablility of different claims, and the size of claimsNegatives:-A number of glitches that cause trucks to fly in the air and crash the game, throw your purchased items yards away from your vehicle or trailer, or simply getting stuck on nothing and unable to move yourself or your vehicle
-The game does not offer multiplayer despite that it was "loosely promised" by the devs, with that in consideration workers are available to hire yet still meaningless
If the devs are going to neglect any type of multiplayer, at least allow the workers to help on the same claim I'm physically working on
I can't do 6 jobs on my own, there needs to be some compromise by the devs with this issue that many are unhappy with
If farming simulator could figure out how to allow workers and multiplayer, I'm sure these devs can too
-The game is a serious grind out type game that can make people easily burn out with it either from frustration or simple lack of visible progress
Granted this one negative point I am not really swayed by, but I am aware that this could be an issue for many who play this game
What I would like to see:-I would love to see a vast array of purchasable equipment, parts, and vehicles
From different size buckets for front loaders and excavators, to different generators or water pumps that allow for more hookups and outlets
Even going as far to allow the placement of steel/metal piping for water to our washplants instead of hoses
-Some sort of "multiplayer" in game platform
I understand many are asking for this, but I feel that if I want to hire a worker to run the front loader at my washplant while I excavate more material on the same claim that should be an option
Sure you can hire a completely full crew on a claim that you're not on, but then you're still in the same boat of having to work an entire claim on your own, this is a problem that needs to be fixed
If it be worker help on the same claim, great, or if it is multiplayer assistance that can be added, great
My dream would be to have an open world server with a massive open terrain with available claims for anyone to claim who wants to play the ONLINE version of the game
Oh that does remind me, open advertisements and forced online connections really screw with the game, please stop that devs and publishers....
really annoying with your nonsense here
-Transparency......
yes transparency is a must for me
If the devs and publishers are russian hackers, I want to know up front
I'm tired of all these cloak and dagger games developed and run by Russians who are actually working for the Kremlin helping sabatoge the internet and global communications networks in the U.S
A and around the world
Just be honest with us devs, we won't care, we're just stupid gamers in the west that want to have fun
(This was a joke if you haven't already figured that out)
Final take:I would say taking into account all the good and bad I have faced so far, I would give the game a 6 out of 10
It is not bad, it is not good, but slightly above average at the moment with huge upside potential as Jordan Belfort pointed out during his Wall Street Run
I would definitely recommend this game to others, but with caution saying yes it could be an amazing game, but still has enough bugs and glitches to keep people away or completely frustrated with the game
I can personally say I was more than frustrated last night after putting my entire wash plant together then to have my truck thrown in the and the game crashing...
losing all my progress in the two hours it took me to actually put the washplant together.....
two hours real time, not game time
 So if you're interested in the game, buy it at your own discretion as it was just released yesterday and still has work to be done
If you can mentally move past those obstacles, then you'll find a fun game that is truly time consuming and can be rewarded for this type of gameplay
Thanks for reading and I hope any of this verbal diarrhea will help you in your quest for knowledge and information

Ever since i was born, i wanted to become a capitalist
 This game made that a reality, i took a small loan of a 13000$ and made myself a fortune
 I got a car, a escavator and lots of buckets
Posted: 17 October
Well there we are,
Early Access Title in disguise Even thou this game is selled as full release title, with already anounced
FREE DLC
, it should be more looked at as an "Alpha" with the ususal quirks that are asosiated with EA, Alpha, Beta, whatsoever...
_________________________________________________________Having that out of the way, let's get started
I was playing for nearly a day straight what doesn't happen to be verry often with a game that I bought just to test out
 More so, if the game has some releation to a movie or TV show
 These tend to be bad cashgrabber titles
But let me get things in order
 At first glimps in the Steam store it looked like a generic 3D digging sim wich isn't exactly a new genre
 There are other games that have done that before, like
Mining & Tunneling Simulator
or
DIG IT
and failed utterly to entertain me for long
Mostly those kind of games are eiter complex as hell (what I prefere) but have an optik impression as they came straight out of the 90s
 Or have astonishing graphics but are mentally so plain that they could put any salt flats to shame
So where does Gold Rush fit in
 As of now (Update 1.0
5258 - 17.October
2017) the game tends to be more for the looks then in gameplay complexity
 But this is down to not all gamemechanics beeing fully implemented yet
 What kept me going was not just the fact that I could get bigger and better equipment it was the way how you set up and interact with all your stuff on your claim
 Draging power cables and hoses acros your land setting up machinery consisting of multiple smaller parts
 Even buying stuff in the warehouse wich is not just a popup menue, klick and done
 No, you have to do the whole logistic by getting there loading your vehicle up an get back
 And the map is quite nice to look at, the scenery may be a bit too much post apocalyptic but beautifull in it's own way
What I'm trying to say is that, even the games main focus is about digging up dirt, it's not limited to that
 And that's when games get good
 When DEV's look over the plate rim of the genre they choose to fit in
Enough sweet talk, get down to some facts 
Con: Usual early releas bugs, bumps and hicups
 Containing memory leaks, unoptimised framrates, nonfuctional stuff
 Lots of content still missing
 It says open world to explore, but predefined mining sites connected via linear level design roads shouldn't be called a open world
 The most intresting stuff to build has fixed predefined locations wehre you can build them
 No game difficulty options, like a gold ore multiplier
 No real goal, such as pay off a big debt or get x amount of gold within one season
 No Story or campaign The old tutorial was way more obvious, people overlook the whole "DigTube" manual to easily
 Pesky repeating infos
 The roads are verry narrow and getting stuck on every tiny bush, twig or invisible wall is borderline annoying
 Prepare yoursellf getting stuck in tiny holes that you dug with your shovel
 Even if I had a sense for irony
 Mining vehicles that get stuck on small bumps they created while digging wouldn't be funny
You will learn to hate wooden posts, especially ones place in front of loading zones
 Litterally every time you want to trow stuff from the shop into the back of your truck you will get stuck on one
Pro: Suprisingly stable, it didn't crash once on me nor hit I any gamebreaking bug
 Very nice graphics
 Free DLC's for all the mentioned kickstarter stuff
 Patches are planned weekly, fixes come almost daily
 Completly customizable keybindings
 "DigTube" Ingame manual that schows videoclips how to do stuff and set up your machinery
 Even the bare content thats in, can keep you occupied for some hours of entertainment
 The digging mechanic holds up to what you would expect from a mining game
 The digable area my be restricted but is by far bigger than it needs to be
 Day / Night clycles
 Weather
 Different season (seasons are not in jet) Decent price
 18 Dollar and I have already plyaed nearly 18 hours
 So thats a good game value right there
A thing that schould be mentioned is that, even this kind of game would be well suited for multiplayer or Co-Op
 The Developers stated they won't invest any work implementing it, meaning this game will stay as a singleplayer title
So my final sentence on this matter is
If you can imagine getting at least a bit of entertainment by digging virtual dirt and are used to how early release games can be, then you should give it at least a try
Posted: 13 October
To be honest, when i first saw the game on kickstarter i thought it was gonna fail like every other mining simulator
 To my greatest suprise it didn't, the game simulates everything to the detail and it is great
 You dint start with heavy equipment but with a pan and a shovel
 From there you get a sluice box that ypu either can use a bucket or pump
 Then once you dig up enough on the claim you can buy your first wash plant
 All of the physics are great and realistic enought to satisfy me, the fuel burn in machines is realistic and the reapir mechanic in the game is awesome
 The excavstor and buldozer handle amazing
 All around great game
Posted: 20 October
I dont get the amount of negatives
1 - Between the journal, digtube, google and a bit of looking about you can easily play this
2 - I set up pretty quick, OK it is not the smoothest but I was panning gold in no time
3 - Grinding, I got the extended sluice, 4 mats and dig until all 4 are 50% full, then I clean out and start again
 I cleared about 60% of that first paydirt which included the big nugget
4 - started part 2 or 3
 of the journal with the more advanced machineryAnd that in my 6 hours
 Not crashed once, not got stuck once, few small glitches
It certainly is not the most polished release and I agree it seems odd that its not Beta or EA and there is already free DLC however, at this point, that to me is semantics, its a $20 sim whether its EA or released
I have to admit, right now I am unsure of the replayability, I think what would be a really good addition is that you can switch the game into a 'strategic' view whereby you can point and click as well as take control and switch to First/3rd person
By this I mean I want to start a company, I want to employ people, I want to design roads and conveyors and place complex plant, water management, stockpile management, large area mining and this needs a plan view
 For this game to be a benchmark in its genre, its needs to offer the ability to jump in (if your truck driver quits) or manage large claims once you have done the ground work and earned an investment
I would recommend this game, but its not easy, it is a grind
Posted: 16 October
The idea of the game is great and it's an addictive game feeling good to play
 However there are some significant downsides
 About the bugs and crashes you already know if you read a couple of reviews, but the devs are working to fix them so I won't really give a negative for these
 The negative review comes from game design issues that have been clearly missed or not thought of at all
 The developers did a great job with the things they didn't miss however
One of the important things missed in this game is a better progression
 Tier 1 is fun as you are excited to go Tier 2
Tier 2 rewards your progress but then it's still slow to go at tier 3
 I decided to skip the grinding after a crash that cost me several thousand in game dollars during Tier 2
 I skipped grinding Tier 2 with a cheat code and moved to Tier 3
 Setting up the base was fun for a while, but working in Tier 3 was not rewarding at all, as these buckets would take forever to fill and really pay some money
 A 100% bucket would give 10oz, aprox 12k $
 It would take 3-4 days of costant digging to fill which makes it at 2
5k a day
 Taking gold from the extra Moss in Tier 3 needs you to still run around with a bucket for clean water many times which becomes like the most boring thing
 In a Tier 2 setup with double Washing side by side and Large Excavator was more profitable I think as I could make 3,5-4k a day and have a better workflow
 So this is the biggest downside that the progression of the game is dissapointing
 Tier 3 is slower than a smart Tier 2
 The second thing that enhances the negative is that this game in order to work well it would need some serious effort in creating AI
 There should be people inside, interactions and machine operators that could actually use machines alongside us, so we wouldn't have to do repetitive mundane tasks all the time
 The current AI is that "when you are not there", there are some workers elsewhere that give you 
01s of gold oz every hour
 I would not ask for a refund, I really enjoyed investing in the idea of this game and several parts are well executed
 I hope that the devs would really invest in setting up a free DLC, that would complete this game in the future and make it trully amazing to play
 I really liked the attention to detail, but they missed some BIG stuff

This game has a whole load of potential, if you like sim games then give this a try, yeah it may take a while to earn the big bucks for the big machinery but all the small machinery upgrades and purchases should keep you interested
I have only played for 1
2hrs and so far I got stuck in the mud so had to reset but the biggest pain for me is opening the case in the tent and I can't exit it now, saved the game and now I load in the menu within the case every time
 I would recommend this game if you like starting with nothing (a shovel)
and watching your
empire grow, if it wasn't for work tomorrow I would have started a new game and carried on digging but I do hope they fix the bug so I can carry on from where I left off
I have used my Xbox controller in the game and it works great, most of the game is set up for the Xbox controller however you do need to use the keyboard for some menus but it's not an issue for me
 So far there are a few issues with bugs but nothing that should stop you from purchasing the game so crack on and start digging for that gold
NO GUTS, NO GLORY

Well i know its early on and i havent playeed a lot, but none the less i will proceed with an EARLY review
ill cut to the chase, it IS a little difficult to understand what to do - you will need to follow the in game journal as well as watch the DIGItube in game footage- from both of these you will be off and running for the most part, however it does NOT tell you everything, for EG once you wash your first matts into the bucket, thier is NO information on what to do with the bucket at all - i needed to watch a You tube Video on a walkthrough to find out, no big deal but none the less ANNOYING 
Once i got into my tent with the paydirt to begin washing it etc, i clicked on the tabet - this is sort of your main console for hiring / bank loans etc etc - from here i lost my mouse completely and never got ot back - being a regular saver i relaoded the game back into the tablet..IKR.
why did i save there..
annyway same thing again no mouse and freezing - this is where the game has ended for me, i dont want to play another 45 minutes to get to this point again - not now anyway
Posted: 13 October
I have been playing since the closed beta began
 In the last 10 days the devs have been working almost nonstop to get this ready for release
 Having seen the progress in just that short time gives me great hope that this game will continue to grow and be a great Sim
Posted: 13 October
well for a launched game its not too bad at all buttons was a bit fiddley but im a console gamer so new to pc could be more my fault but please dont let that put you off this has a good basis for an amazing game and you need to understand this is in its early stage please stick with it be well worth it

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS GAME
 Seriously, look how many hours I've played: Over a thousand
 People make fun of MMO players because they spend so much time working for imaginary goals, but at least they're hanging out with friends and collaborating
 I've just been sitting here alone in my underwear in the dark
 FOR 1000 HOURS
I used to be like you
 I had friends and family, hobbies and interests
 I used to cook for myself and clean my apartment once in a while
 I used to have house plants for god's sake
 I thought becoming king would take a week or two of gaming sessions at most
 I WAS WRONG
 Please, if there's anything you value in life, don't buy this game

- Backbone of all combat oriented games- Best melee combat in any game- Dozens upon dozens of mods- Graphics are not the best, but both the developers and modders do an amazing job at making them look very good- You're not going to get bored of this game easily

684 hours divided by 24 hours is 28 and a half days

If I had a choice between having sex with a woman or playing Mount & Blade: Warband, I'd probably still choose sex with a woman
Posted: 18 May, 2015
Mount & Blade: Warband is a game that defines the whole concept of what a perfectly shaped sandbox/RPG medieval game should be like, mixed with loads of action and epic adventures
Start either as a peasant or a noble man with a fully selective character customization and background history at your own choice, participate in tournaments, travel and discover the vast variety of what Caldaria has to offer you
 Warband will be an unforgettable realistic experience that will mark in you the true hardships and living ways of the medieval age
What makes this game so great after all
It isn't just a 1st person game where you can travel around doing quests, Mount and Blade: Warband goes way beyond that by offering players a battle system where you can command your army while simultaneously giving your men orders during the heat of battles
In this game, both your character individual life and his relationships among all other NPC's are equally important to how well you can manage your army expenses and food variety in order to achieve success either alone, or within a faction
A never ending adventure
 If you are not looking for trouble, trouble will come to you as time passes by and factions envolve with each other by declaring full-scaled wars against each other conquering castles and other key locations that will drastically change the game economically and militarily
Be either a good samaritan with your army of justice and fight off bandits and free entire villages from rebel control, a evil masterless soldier with a thirst for blood and wealth in the middle of the Caldarian disgrace, or simply a trader travelling around buying cheap and selling expensive, Warband will give you a fair challenge with very balanced rewards and consequences in whatever way of life you decided to take
The game difficulty is well balanced, and instead of making things harder just by simply increasing the units stats that you are facing against, the AI gets a lot more rational and fast even during the campaign map as well with the in-game combat, they will almost act as real human players
Remember that I have mentioning about your character individual role in the game
 Get a good relationship with lords by doing quests or freeing close family members from enemy heavily guarded dungeons, and who knows if you can freely marry their daughters unless you convince them with your persuasion skills to run away with you
The medieval atmosphere and music has never been so good as it is now; If you enjoyed the previous Mount & Blade game, you will fall in love with this one
Mount & Blade: Warband will be the game that you will be happy to be hooked into to, a fair balanced game between adventure and RPG with a vast variety of content and diversity in all of its aspects
Some negative aspects
Bugs, Glitches and some graphic reading failuresDespite being unusual, you will encounter some glitches that will make some of the game items to disappear, or to find everything in a black screen when you return to the world map
 There are also some in-game bugs that makes everything blur and unable to see around, although, I found out this can be fixed if you simple minimize the game and open it again
Some crashes might happen too, but those are rare to encounter
ConclusionI would rate this game with a 79 out of 100, or 4,0 out of 5,0, a never ending sandbox game that will make players fall in love as they experience the life and atmosphere of what a true medieval age game has to give

Yngol/JacobZupers guide/review of Mount and Blade: WarbandThe game Mount and Blade: Warband is the purest sandbox game that i have ever played, you can litterally do anything you feel like doing in the small land of Calradia
 You can be a pirate raiding caravans from the six big factions (Sarranid Sultanate, Kingdom of Vaegir, Kingdom of Swadia, Kingdom of Rhodoks, Kingdom of Nords and Khergit Khanate
) or you can join up with one of the factions or make your own one or just play as a mercenary
 Many people that look into the game for the first 5+ hours think that this is a simple game, but it is indeed pretty complicated which i will come to later in these 5 facts about why and how i have played 1400+ hours of this game, enjoy :)1) *SINGLEPLAYER* The singleplayer is awesome, you will spend a minimum of 100+ hours on it, and once you get the hang of it you just wan't to play it 2-3 times again because you haven't even tried a bit of the possibilities, but once you have tried the most it will get kinda booring but the next facts will fix that problem
2) *MODIFICATIONS* There are a BUNCH of modifications for the game and they are so simple to enjoy
 So when you are tired of the vanilla game go to this website -->
http://store.steampowered
com and download some of the many multiplayer and singleplayers mods for the game
3) *MULTIPLAYER* If you aren't happy with the singleplayer game, you can always move to the multiplayer
 Note that M&B has a very intense fighting system that requires you to play a bunch before you can actually feel like a good player
 But once you get the hang of it, it is so much fun just to hack and slash through your enemies
4) *INDEPTH MULTIPLAYER FIGHTING SYSTEM* The fighting system of M&B is very complicated, for some players it is just a slash/block game, but it's really much more than that, there are loads of tricks to defeat the more experienced players
 5) *EVENTS* The Mount and Blade community is still really active and therefore there are events for most of the of the mods
 If you wan't an mod simply full of events i would reccomend you buy the "Napoleonic Wars" DLC and join up with a regiment and play a couple of linebattles with your regiment on TeamSpeak, there are loads of regiments and some in different languages
 There are pure Spanish, German, Danish etc
 speaking regiments
 This is simply some of the biggest reasons to as why i still play Mount and Blade: Warband this day
 I hope you enjoyed my review, and i really hope that this makes you buy this wonderful game and play the living soul out of it
 :)

Posted: 23 June
I wanted to wait until I beat it to write a review but at 60 hours in, the game is already so good I feel compelled to
This is probably one of the best action JRPGs you will find on PC, and certainly the height of the Tales series (disclaimer: I've played a handful, but not nearly all of them)
 Let's dive right into what makes Berseria great, and where it's a bit lacking:- The story is engrossing
 Yes, it's JRPG, and it's Tales, so there's bound to be clichs and tropes, but Berseria strikes the perfect balance of not taking itself too seriously while presenting you with relatable characters in genuinely compelling scenarios
 You can have fun, but still feel invested, and there's enough sub-plots to keep you interested in ALL of the main cast
- The combat is bleeding edge, joyous, chaotic mayhem
 It's super fast paced, and between juggling enemy types to trigger status effects to fill your Soul Gauge to use Break Souls to feed your Mystic Artes (which you'll want to properly time to get grade bonuses, among other things), there is always a strategy to be refined on the battlefield if you are a grinder, min-maxer, or whatever
 That isn't to say mastering the mechanics is a necessity
 There are plenty of tools and difficulty settings to tweak the combat difficulty to your liking
 Me
 I crank that **** up to Intense ASAP and get to work melting wave after wave of demons in Dangerous Encounters (and all the better if you get a Dire Foe afterwards - seriously, these are some of the best, most heated moments of the game
)
- The cast is fantastic and the writing is strong
 This is hands down the biggest strength for me
 Despite being yet another title in a genre as saturated as JRPG (in a series as dense as Tales, no less), the main characters manage to have very distinct personalities and motivations, and are just the right amount of "morally grey" to be likable without being obnoxious
 They start off as somewhat standoffish misfits, cooperating only to pursue their personal opportunistic goals, but over time you will see them grow together in a way that is believable
 There's also something deeply satisfying about being able to play as a team of blatant criminals, as opposed to the white knights, royalty, and chosen ones we've grown so tired of
 And beyond that, even the side cast of characters does a great job of complementing and bouncing off of the main cast
 The villains do seem a bit one dimensional, and I fear the "big bad" twist is going to end up being predictable, but it's a small bump on an otherwise fantastic journey
 Final note on this - the themes and the tones are appropriately adult
 The language feels natural and there is swearing and innuendo in all the right places, never beating you over the head with it
- The pacing is good
 The intro/tutorial segment is the perfect length (some Tales games have ones that drag on ENTIRELY too long, not the case here), and you will periodically unlock new mechanics to keep the gameplay fresh
 You will actually acquire all the party members pretty early on in the game, although this is preferable due to how the equipment mastery system works
- Great customization options
 The arte pools are huge, and the trees are fully customizable
 I've used Velvet almost exclusively for the first 60 hours, but I can tell there is still plenty to unlock for her and the rest of the cast seems to have their own fun, unique playstyles as well
 Because of how fast paced the combat is, I don't find myself switching primary fighters as much as previous Tales games, but Berseria actually makes it even easier by allowing you to swap mid-battle, mid-combo
 Lots of fashion options, lots of equipment flavors, and a mastery system that makes it fairly compelling to keep different sets of equipment around (and tweak until your playstyle is content)
- The world map is expansive, but the areas can be a bit samey, and the puzzles are definitely nothing groundbreaking
 Pretty middle of the road for JRPG, so just don't expect anything impressive there
 I find myself constantly looking back to Symphonia as the holy grail of Tales world maps, as I've yet to see that one be outdone
- The voice acting is good
 I've only listened to the dub, as the English VAs are more than serviceable
 The main cast are all great
 The NPCs are not as varied as I'd like or as I have seen in previous Tales games, but again a pretty small nitpick
 Nearly all cutscenes and skits are fully voiced, though, so there is a truly dense amount of lore and worldbuilding going on, if you are into it (I am)
- The visuals are aesthetically pleasing
 Watch some videos
 It should be clear that Berseria is not pushing next gen graphic fidelity
 Instead it goes for a colorful, eye-popping art style that does the game justice
- The music is good
 The tracks set the appropriate moods, and have enough depth to be enjoyable from moment to moment, but I honestly didn't find much in the way of "holy **** I need to go download this right NOW" kind of songs
 Still, I would say a bit above average in terms of video game music
In summary, this is a must-buy for Tales fans, but still a heavily encouraged purchase for JRPG fans, action RPG fans, or someone looking to try out the genre
 If you haven't tried the series before, don't worry about needing to start at the beginning
 You can jump right into this without any issues and you'll find yourself getting giddy with glee as you literally hack through swaths of demons like they were hot butter in no time: I guarantee it
Posted: 24 June
I think the only bad thing I can say about this game is that a lot of the environments just seem pretty bland and the dungeon layouts can be irritating at times
 I also wish that it looked nicer overall
 Velvet could also use some better costume options :sThat aside, the game has a wonderful story and the entire group of characters are all lovable
 The combat is somewhat deep and also quite fun
 You can definitely tell that a lot of care and love was put into this game
This was my first Tales of game and now I'm definitely going to be looking to play more
 Easily my favorite game of all time

Once every few years, a JRPG arrives that blends together good world-building, a story that is both fascinating and thought-provoking, challenging your own worldview, philosophy and beliefs and a combat system that, while simple at first, makes you feel like a glorious badass having fun killing hordes after hordes of enemies
This is Tales of Berseria
 Review is spoiler-free, minus the intro stuff
The game puts you in the boots of Velvet - an average village girl that one day gets to see her little brother being murdered right in front of her by her own brother-in-law, she turns into a daemon and then she gets thrown in prison to feast on other daemons for 3 years
 As she manages to escape with someone's help, she learns that her brother-in-law now is mankind's greatest hope against daemons, and the whole world praises him as a saviour
 Filled with rage for the injustice she and her brother tasted, she embarks on a journey to kill him
Let me start off with the world-building
 I was having a discussion with a few friends over how games stopped bothering with giving attention to details due to how gamers nowadays tend not to care much about information that gives you a clue on how X village works, how they survive in Y conditions etc
 For that I'm glad that Berseria doesn't do that
 Here, in the form of completely optional NPC's, you'll find stuff like a father looking for his lost son, a group of teenagers who become interested in music and decide to start their own band and dogs that are criticizing humanity
 For that I praise the creators of the game who decided to not restrict themselves to "what information is useful" but also to "what information makes you immerse"
 I found myself returning to a city wondering whether a couple of NPC's got married
 I can't criticize the English voice acting because I play the game in Japanese voice acting, and there's some great quality to be found there
 One of the characters in the group, for example, is the same voice actor behind Jojo's bizarre adventure part 4 antagonist, Yoshikage Kira, and he's doing a glorious job here, too
Combat system time
 People will bash the game for having "button-mashing combat"
 And they are right, combat is button mashy, BUT..
 It would be wrong to stop here
 See, this is first and foremost a JRPG that has an "exploit weakness system"
 Your typical dungeon/area visit will be
to first identify the enemy population's weaknesses, compile combos that hit every weakness they have then mash that button against them
 For example (oversimplified), if an area has worms, knights and bats I end up identifying and crafting 3 different combos so I'll mash Y for bats, X for knights and B for worms (Xbox controller)
 This is the equivalent of scrolling through menus in a turn-based JRPG to find the ice spell versus enemies that are weak to ice, the armor penetration move for armored enemies etc
 Later in the game the enemy variety becomes large enough that not only you craft combos for each but you make sure you can weave them
 So you'll start with X for the first move of the X-combo then Y because the second move of the Y-combo works not only for bats but for armored, etc
 Then you get moves called mystic artes that make your characters go full blown crazy killing machines
 All in silky smooth 60 frames per second, even for my poverty rig (there's a demo on Steam that you can check out if you're not sure about your PC's performance)
 Add to that the amazing A.I
 behind your teammates, which is also one of the best, if not the best in a Tales game ever and can easily play better than 70% of the players
 I can even put everyone on "auto" and go to the bathroom knowing that we will almost certainly win a fight
Now for the downsides: So far, I find the game quite linear - on rails, so to speak, and the optional areas that I have unlocked so far (I haven't finished the game yet, have mercy) are simple arenas that lack in the difficulty and satisfaction department, compared to the rest of the content
 I found myself visiting them once, go "is that it
" then leave in disappointment
 Maybe this will change as the game goes on
 I heard very good things about the post-game content
 There are also the occasional sidequests and mini games that (thankfully) are so many and diverse that you can "play favorites" without losing the rewards (you win coins that let you buy stuff, but its shared across mini-games, thanks Namco)
The difficulty settings are Simple - Normal - Moderate - Hard, with Intense and Chaos being unlocked after you do something in the game
 On the other hand, there's a way to make fights so hard you'll almost always get a couple of party members or everyone dead
 To give you a clue, my winrate in normal fights is around 90% but for dangerous fights it's at 10%, but that's just me not accepting winning a fight with people being knocked out left and right (the game rewards you with in-game score, called Grade, if you win fights without deaths and without using items, who would say no to that
)
 Maybe it's also me being used to JRPG's throughout the years
 Someone can also play the game with the combat system in full automatic mode - AI doing everything - in case you just want to experience the story without bothering with learning how the combat works (I wouldn't do that but some people could)
 NINJA EDIT: Something else that I noticed and I gotta say: Contrary to most JRPG's, on higher difficulties the enemies not only get the usual stat increases but also different attack frequency and in bosses it can be a change of movesets and spells
Overall, this isn't simply one of the top Tales games ever (and easily the best modern Tales game - RIP Zestiria) but a great JRPG
 I said it on my Zestiria review and I'll say it again: "Tales of" games are the only JRPG series on Steam that combines fast-paced flashy combat system with immersive storytelling
 Does it worth paying full price
 For me that's a resounding yes
 But I hope that my review was informative enough to draw your own decision
 Meanwhile, I'll be finishing my playthrough and prepare for my next one
 And if you choose to get into it, I would advise you to take it slow and savor every minute, instead of speed through it
 JRPG's like this one deserve to be enjoyed like good wine or chocolate
Posted: 24 June
Do you like great story telling
Do you like JRPG's
Well, there's a reason you see "Overwhemingly positive" on the reviews
Treat yourself
 
Posted: 28 January
A JRPG in which your starting party is an angry vengeful demon, a psychopath with a sword, a merciless pirate and a brainwashed child you literally kidnap and take on dangerous adventures with for endgoal to kill King Arthur because he made the world a better place and you just can't accept saving the world was worth one life
Also the battle system is majorly improved over Zestiria and Xillia/Xillia2
Posted: 25 May
So after about 70 hours i finished the story of Tales of Berseria
 I did not download any item packs and played on normal difficulty
 Ill just jump right into the review
GraphicsIt fullfills its purpose
 It is not espeacially good or bad
 The characters are well designed and the animated scenes are beautiful
 But tbh, i dont really care about the graphic quality in this game
SoundFirst of all the soundtrack is amazing
 No other than Motoi Sakuraba composed the soundtrack
 It really has a big role in the atmosphere of the game
 This is what i call art
 Every scene is accompanied by a track, that fits perfectly
 Joy, happiness or sadness, even the funny parts feel authentic
Now the dub
 Everything in this game is dubbed
 The dubbing actors did an amazingly good job
 I have no reason to play the Newgame+ with japanese dub
 The english dub is by far better than expected and ill stick to that
 BUT this game has a bug
 Many people cannot hear certain sounds when using 5
1 surround sound
 In this case you also cannot hear the dub
 Using the stereo mode fixes this problem, but can cause other sound issues
 I recommend using a fix for that (just google it and you will find it)
GameplayThe battle system is in realtime and pretty good, but not well explained
 You have to figure out some stuff on your own
 Tbh, i liked figuring stuff out, but i can see people being annoyed, because certain actions/skills dont work they way they expected it
 The items and ability system is easy to understand and the game is beatable without focussing too much on optimization
 If you want to master every equipment or make very effective combos in battles it becomes a little bit more complex
Outside from fights in dungeons you have to walk a bit until you unlock certain teleportation points
 Outside from dungeons there is a quick travel system that is bound to a consumeable item
 Since you should have absolutely no money problems, it is no problem to buy nearly endless of this stuff
At a certain point ingame i nearly stopped caring about anything that has to do with gameplay, because the story gets such a strong peak, you could have given me 2d jumpnrun gameplay and i would have enjoyed this game
AtmosphereNow some of the more important parts
 The atmosphere in this game is convincing
 I felt like i was part of the world ingame
 This is achieved by the amazing soundtrack and also by many other little things
 For example small conversations between characters (which are also dubbed) or even some background noises
The characters all have their motivations to do whatever they do and no one feels out of place
 There are many scenes where i thought: "Oh god no, why did you say that
" The first time was the point where my mindset changed
 These characters HAVE a personality
 Each of them
 And the game is not afraid of showing this
The characters develop while progressing in game
 Everything happens for a reason
 To fully understand what happened with some characters i had to rewatch scenes or let whatever happened rewind in my head
 I paused the game many times, just being stunned, waiting for my brain to comprehend the situation
StoryWow, what can i say about the story
 I dont know, i am speechless
 The story in itself is kind of sinister and gets darker, especially when you understand why certain things happend
 While the game starts a bit slow it quickly gets to a point where i stopped thinking this is a game
 I stopped "playing" it and started "experiencing" it
 My emotional state was decided by the happenings in game
 I felt joy, i laughed, i was angry, i even cried a few times
 This story hits you hard with emotions
 And this is coming from a guy who stopped playing story focused game long ago and thought he was more of a cold, emotionless guy
tl;dr: All i can say is i am absolutely overwhelmed by this masterpiece
 Dont get scared away if you think the beginning is slow or boring
 If you are only interested a little bit in JRPGs or just want want to experience a great stroy, because most of the animes released nowadays are boring, i definetly recommend this game
 I also recommend watching the trailer "The Calamity and The Blade", which is english dubbed, since steam only has the "The Flame" trailer
This is the best game i have ever played
 
Posted: 29 January
Pros-Fast paced intuitive combat
-Solid visuals and animations
 Cutscenes are nice
 Character models and expressions are great
-Interesting story theme
-A lot of content, very long game even when you're moving through it at a fast pace
-Great HUD for finding points of interest and next plot point
-Tag switch mechanic is fun
 Soul Break mechanic is fun
-A good amount of side content with interesting rewards
 Unlocking some costumes felt rewarding
Cons-Bloated and repetitive dungeon design as you progress in the game-Arena is beyond average-Weakness/Resistance/Stagger system is really wacky
 Combos feel super RNG unless you heavily spec yourself with stats and hitstun modifiers-Lack of good ways to enjoy the combat system post game-Combat is fun, but becomes very mashy at times-decent songs in the soundtrackNeutral-Minigames range from simple and fun to grindy-Game is long and packed
-A lot of the recycling, but that's a tales standard at this point
-Difficulty is average overallNote:this may seem like a backstory for Tales Of Zesteria if you ever finish the game till the end and do every side quest to know the full content of the story
 Should You get this game, only if you are Tales Fans and i certainly this game will be worth your time and money and pack full of content than the previous Tales installment beside my Favorite Tales Of Symphonia
Posted: 2 July
A game I wish I could forget entirely so I can go back and play again for the first time
 The world is large, the quests are plentiful, and the story reads like a top teir play
 The usual archetypes are introduced but as the game marches on they're abandoned and the depth of each character shines through
Pros:-Story-Combat (Insanity is level to shoot for, if it's too easy, you're on the wrong difficulty)-Playtime-MusicCons:-JRPG Dialogue, prepare for the grunts and cheesy emotions-Weapon system feels abritrary at times, no reason to give up certain gear for a long time

Story: 9
5/10Characters: 8/10Combat: 9
5/10FPS : 60/60---------------------Overall: 9
5/10Pros:+ The story is not your average save-the-world heroic stuff, instead it's dark and twisted
+ The combat system is the best among all Tales' games and is easy to understand
+ There are strong enemies if you like a good challenge (such as "Dire" foes)
+ New Game+ is filled with interesting options, so starting another run is worth it
+ 60 FPS
+ New battle camera
+ Quick save option
Cons:- Some characters may be annoying
- Music is not as good as other Tales' games
- Dungeons look better than in Zestiria, but some require a lot of time and running around to finish
Note:You don't need to play Zestiria before this one to understand the story, but doing so will make Berseria much more enjoyable since it will show how Zestiria came to be
 Alternatively, you can play Zestiria after Berseria
 Whichever you choose will make you experience the story in a slightly different way

This game is so realistic compared to other flight simulators
 I played FSX for a while and i'm going to say goodbye to it
 You can't get any better graphics in a flight simulator then x-plane 11
 I didn't installed any other freeware airports and by it's default, it just looks beautiful
 The night lighting of all these highways my god..
 I can't say any better
 If you want to have a fully packed flight sim with outstanding graphics, very good default airplanes and "yet" no 200 euro addons, buy this game

Very beautiful game out of the box
 The aircraft look amazing and perform really well
 It is also very easy to make a custom flight quick and easily
 Weather is very nice
 Very polished game at day one
 I am very happy i buy this

Why not early access
I know fanboys will downvote this but I dont care
 I give a constructive criticism from my point of view while backing my words
Ive never piloted a plane and never will so I cant say how realistic it is or not, only how I think it is
 All I can say is that flying in X-plane 11 feels more satisfying than in FSX or FSW
 It feels like Im really in the air
 Landing a plane smoothly could be a challenge
 The whole flying process feels amazing
 Setting up the plane, setting up the route and following it is rewarding
 Flying over a place you know is awesome, the scenery is very accurate, unlike the new revolutionary FSW where I cant find anything flying over my city
Graphics are the best Ive seen in a flying sim
 The scenery looks great and if you add ortho4xp and w2xp it becomes the most accurate flying sim
 You literally can find your house, w2xp places correct building types in correct places most of the time
Plane models are pretty nice, but it could be better, inside could use some work
 And the best part  night lighting is outstanding
 Flying at night/sunset over a city is a real treat for the eyes
 No mods needed, it looks stunning out of the box
Default planes are average, most of them are functional and fun to fly, but some are not and GPS doesnt work
 The ones which work still have some unclickable switches and FMC in 737 lacks some features and is worse than a free modded 737
 Good for beta/early access, but not for a full game
The main reason why Im giving this a negative review is because it should be an early access game and not sold as a full product
 As an early access game I would give it thumbs up, it shows great potential and is fun
 Im enjoying it and will enjoy it in the future, but I cant give developers an excuse to release half finished games
There are too little planes and even those few are not the highest quality
 Theres no Airbus which is a real letdown
 FSX had more content, of course the default planes in FSX are worse because it was released
11 years ago
 If developers include only few planes they could at least make them authentic with fully working systems
There are no missions like in FSX or FSW
 When I think now FSX was ahead of its time, even current sims have less features
Performance is not very good
 Its good while cruising, but fps drops drastically when you need fps the most  during take off and landing
 It could drop to 25fps on a high end systems with graphics not even on max settings
 Thats simply unacceptable
 Performance should be better and theres no excuse for it
 I already see the fanboys 20-35fps is considered ideal
 No, 20-35fps is not ideal and nowhere near it
 Yes games with less action can be played on lower fps but it cant be called ideal
 30fps is the minimum and considered as acceptable framerate
 While this game stays smooth at low fps, its still breaks the immersion, things go all floaty and it doesnt feel real anymore
 I used to play games on 20-30fps for a long time but I never even thought this being ideal
 Developers keep promising things, add things, changing the engine to vulkan, but time passes and nothing happens
 Updates are very slow, there could be no updates for moths
 How are they going to make VR work with this performance
 If I would want promises I would go to vote in the elections
Remember this requires a beast of a PC
 To get an enjoyable experience with nice graphics you need something like 7700k/x1700 overclocked and GTX1070
I know developers are flying enthusiasts and they're trying their best to give us the best flying experience they can and Im thankful for this, but thats not an excuse to do a lazy job on other aspects
 Is it so hard to enable steam overlay
 It doesnt require time and effort, its a default steam feature, even non-steam games have the overlay
 You need to download reshade and it enables the overlay and broadcasting, but developers cant do this simple thing
 I start to think they disabled the overlay intentionally
 Price
 I understand Laminar is a business and its their right to decide what the price will be and its our right to buy it or not
 But why they increased the price for everyone except USA
 This seems a bit nationalistic to me
 Maybe I wouldnt write this if developers wouldve bother to answer why did they increased the price after I and other people asked about it in the discussions
 But there was no communication, its probably too hard to spend 1 hour/week to check the discussions and answer some questions, make some sticky threads etc
So the price for EU was 55 and 60$ for US
 One day developers decided to increase the price for EU and all other regions
 EU got 10 increase, Russia for example got 100% increase, but what about US
 Nope, 0% price increase
 That is not a nice thing to do
Wanna hear a funny thing
 They charge you this price but youre limited to how many things you can download from their official website
 The other day I was downloading liveries and after downloading 20 of them I was greeted with a message which said you can only download 20 things per day
 Seriously
 Its not a problem of course, you dont download that many things often, but the whole fact is just stupid
X-plane 11 doesnt have any flight planning tools
 Yeah sure you can use other apps or websites for this, but why not include everything in the game
 Website like Simbrief uses old airac cycle, you want a newer one
 Get a monthly subscription plan
 Flight school is very limited, there are only few lessons, no airliner lessons
 Again feels half finished
 Would be perfectly ok for an early access
Another very important thing for flight simmers is ATC
 Its practically non-existent in X-plane 11
 Its there but its absolutely useless and will only confuse you and youll never land
 Would be acceptable for early access
What happens when Bethesda releases Fallout or Elder scrolls
 You probably all know the jokes like modders fix and finish their games
 So this one feels the same
 They charge a ridiculous price, but to make it authentic you need mods and you also need payware mods
 The upside is X-plane 11 has a good amount of free mods
 Like photo scenery, its free and looks better than payware scenery for FSX or P3D
 There are plenty of free airports, so thats another +1
 But when it comes to planes forget freeware, they suck
 There is Zibo 737 modded, its free and its really amazing, if you buy this game, download this plane as soon as you can
 But thats about it
 There are more free planes, but theyre nothing good
There are some good free plugins to enhance the airports and make the clouds look good
 The default clouds are absolutely pathetic
 The environments looks awesome but the clouds are just bad
Im not interested in multiplayer, but I saw some people complaining about this
 It seems that the game has no multiplayer as stated on the store page
 Well it kinda has but the setup process is very archaic and no one uses it
Things evolve, things change and fight sims should change too, by becoming more casual friendly and more affordable
 Saying it always was this way, I remember when I was young we done things this way and its the best way is not right
So like I said I enjoy X-plane 11 and I recommend it for those who want an awesome flying experience
 If youre ready to tinker, spend a lot of time watching youtube, learning, downloading stuff, spend time making things to work, waiting for updates and have a good PC then buy it
 Its the best flying sim out there
 It is not finished yet and should be in early access state but I like where its going and I hope it will get better and better
Pros:Flying feels greatAccurate sceneryLighting is amazingBest out of the box experienceGood amount of free addons/plugnsCons:Feels like betaMisses many featuresNot everything worksPerformance is not goodDisabled basic steam features

Excellent upgrade from X-plane 10
 Just purchased so I do not have a lot of time with it, I did not try the Beta
 My first impressions have been excellent thus far
 Setup and usage is much more intuitive than 10 was
 I especially like the joystick setup now which included a visual representation of my Saitek X52
 Setup was very easy and I was flyimg with the default aircraft in no time
 The 737 and MD80 included aircraft are very well modeled and surprisingly detailed
 Weather has been improved and clouds and visibilty look very realistic
 Flying through clouds now is very impressive
 The user interface is a welcome change and easy and intuitive to use
 Frame rates for me are great, and I am very pleased with the overall look and performance of the sim
 I'm sure there are bugs and issues yet to be found, but I am confident LR will deal with them
 This by far the best flight sim available, and very much worth the upgrade
Posted: 3 October
Listen, this sim is a serious investment
 It's not easy to justify dropping 54
99 / 62 EUR / $72 on a game, but this isn't really a game
 It's a full-on, commercial-grade flight simulator and one that will either make or break your commitment to learning curves
If you do any flying, this sim is the only one worth getting
 It accurately simulates flight dynamics based on real-time flight modelling; it's as realistic as you're going to get
 Paired with the correct hardware and licences, it allows pilots to log hours towards ratings
 So, for the best part of 60, you'll get as close to flying as you can in your home
For someone who doesn't fly, this game presents a significant challenge
 There are some basic tutorials which explain the fundamentals of flying in a Cessna 172 - after that, you're absolutely on your own
 There's a few aircraft to choose from, from small GA planes like the Cessna all the way to four-engine passenger jets from Boeing
 Systems are accurately modelled and interactable - you really can control everything just as you would in the real machine
 So, once you've mastered some simple pootling about in your 172, you can escalate to small jets or 747s and find a whole new level of challenge
 It's the only game where I've had to consult actual reference material outside the game, and when I found myself reading a flight manual in my idle time, I realised I was either very sad and or probably justifying my purchase price
 It's an immersive world, and if you've got the time and the brainspace, it's rewarding too
XP11 is endlessly expansible too; the default install package includes the WHOLE world's terrain and is impressively accurate, but with the help of mainly freeware mods online, you can accurately simulate your hometown if you so wish
 There's a raft of extra aircraft (including some payware which rivals the base game price) which are unbelievably well-concieved - the community go the extra mile here to faithfully recreate their favourite airliners
A small mention has to go to the visuals - it's a stunning engine and some of the 3D cockpits are so immersive it's easy to forget you're sitting in front of a monitor
 Engaging, stimulating and satisfyingly accurate, Laminar Research have continued to impress with XP11 - but it's not a light purchase
 There's a good demo, if you fancy it - and for the love of god, play with some sort of controller, it makes things a lot easier

Spent at least 10 minutes trying to turn on a plane before realizing that the game was paused
Posted: 27 July
It's more realistic than FSX, with better graphics out of the box (albeit mostly auto-gen), a better interface and the all-important 64-bit compatibility
 It just needs a bit more content
 Suggestions:1: Career mode, like start in a cheap plane and ferry people wherever they want to go and eventually upgrade
 Give me an incentive to grind flight hours and visit places I wouldn't normally think of
2: More tutorials
 Teach us more about all the instruments
 Go through taking-off and landing the various planes
 Preferably in interesting locations
3: More missions
4: Steam Workshop support
It has a few bugs at present, which I won't detail here, but nothing game-breaking - I've not had any crashes yet
 Also, I find it inconvenient to have to go to external websites to properly plan flights
 It needs the ability to see the whole world in the map screen, and also have it accessible from the main menu
Posted: 30 March
Finally
 A flight simulator that is actually good enough to replace the ever so old FSX
Pros: - Finally some graphics, the game looks greate out of the box
 On FSX and P3D I had to download over a dozen mods / addons to make it look any good
 - MD-82, what can I say, I am glad to see my fav
 commercial airliner made it into the game - In-Flight functionality is better than ever
 everything seems clean, and well done
Posted: 14 May
From a former FSX pilot (800+ Hrs on FSX)I run the 64bit version of XP11 and i love it
Pro's:- very nice scenery (night time scenery street lighting is very good)- Nice looking and good default aircraft
 ( i was surprised compared to default FSX aircraft)- good flight modeling (feels more realistic then FSX in my opinion)- X-plane
org community, where there is loads of free Stuff created by other users (scenery, plugins, skins, aircraft etc)- XP Plane Maker to create you own aircraft (have not tried it yet, but that you can create your own plane is a cool feature in my opinion)- WED (World editor) where you can create your own airports or upgrade deafult airports
 (i have done 2 airports so far, and i must say if you follow some tutoials you can create very nice airports)- Good functioning flight Replay and Record function
Cons:- most default airports look very basic
 (can be easely fixed for many airports by downloading user created airports)- At this point in time there are not so many payware or freeware aircraft availeble- default ATC is not very good (can be easely fixed with freeware or payware plugins)- no flight planning tool in the game

It's hard to describe why Dark Souls is so, so good
Yet, it's so incredibly easy
Why
 We just need to look at the core attitude of Dark Souls, from a design-to-player perspective
Dark Souls is challenging
 Yes, that much is clear
 But it's not to laugh at you or to discourage you
It's hard because it knows what you're capable of, and it believes in you
 It doesn't want you to give up
Despite killing you all the time, it respects your intelligence and holds you of the highest regard
 Dark Souls wants you to succeed, and this gives it the framework to do so many things right
In that regard, Dark Souls does absolutely no hand holding in almost every aspect
 The story and lore of the world will completely pass you by if you don't take the time to read item descriptions, examine the world, and talk to every NPC you meet
 You will be torn apart if you don't take the time to familiarize yourself with your weapon and shield
 Most of all, if you don't take your time, you will be seeing YOU DIED a lot as well
 The game grounds itself in patient manner when it comes to enemies and bosses: it wants you to slow down, weigh all of your options, experiment, and most importantly do whatever it takes to survive
Combat is slow, but weighty; everything about the fighting is spot on
 Small weapons swing fast like they should
 Large weapons swing slow, and when they hit the ground they emit satisfying "clunk" sounds
 Every swing depletes a certain amount of stamina
 It's a simple mechanic but it puts so much choice and consequence on the player
 You can try to attack like a madman to burn your enemies down as fast as you can, but you won't be able to hold a block with your shield if you run low on stamina
 All of this goes double for the intense boss fights - most of the bosses won't hold anything back and they will be a true test of applying everything you've learned thus far
 You will die, a lot, but finally defeating one of these bosses grants you such an immense feeling of accomplishment, because YOU DID IT ALL WITH YOUR OWN SKILL
The world of Dark Souls is completely open
 There are very few loading screens, there are no transitional airlocks between areas; everything is seamlessly connected to each other
 At times, the geography will seem strange but once you take a look around and realize that you can actually see areas from other places, suddenly everything feels natural
 Dark Souls' atmosphere is done with careful and precise attention
 At times you'll be exploring dark, moody caverns, other times you'll be wading through a dense, moonlit forest with nothing but the ambience to accompany you
 Sometimes you'll even find yourself deep in the middle of a trap filled fortress
 Make sure you always have your wits about you and you're actively paying attention
 The world is just flat out beautiful and knowing that the game is one big connected overworld makes it feel so real and alive, and it really drives home the sense that this world is huge and it brings back that "adventure" experience I've come to miss so bad
 The world is yours, and you're free to go wherever you please
 At times, you might feel like you're a bit lost, and I do admit the game is sometimes a little obscure with the regard of pointing you towards the right direction, but there are subtle clues and hints
 Are the enemies too hard in a certain area
 Is there a locked door
 There's probably another way you haven't explored yet
The world is also home to many NPCs
 I mentioned before that if you don't take the time to talk to the NPCs you meet and try to piece together who they are, what they're doing, and how they got where they are, you're going to miss out of a lot of Dark Souls' story
 This is where I feel Dark Souls' thematic focus comes full strength
 The entire game is about overcoming, and fighting through your own struggles
 In that same sense, all of the characters you meet along the way are also fighting for something
 Something they thought was important, or something they hold dear
 Really, take the time to get to know these people and pay attention as well
 You won't know where they go next if you don't listen
 With that said, if you make the effort to witness each of these stories, you'll watch them struggle along with you, fighting their own battles
 Yes, Dark Souls is rich with lore and backstory, but I think the real beauty is watching these characters fight for what they believe in, while you yourself are fighting your own battles too
Dark Souls also has a very unusual multiplayer system
 At all times, your character will be in either one of two forms: hollowed, or human
 You spend a somewhat uncommon item called "Humanity" to turn from hollow to human
 This enables you to partake in jolly co-operation
 If you're in an area where you haven't beaten the boss yet, you can summon fellow players to your world who are also in the same area, as long as they're relatively near your soul level
 Sounds good right
 Just like the combat, there's another consequence you might have to face when you turn human
 Dark Souls allows players to "invade" the worlds of other human players
 They will appear as red phantoms, and they will hunt you down and kill you on sight, essentially marking this game's version of PvP
Now, this is where I feel Dark Souls' biggest community strength comes from
 You see, once a player invades you, all bets are off
 They might be insanely twinked out
 They might be a fair fight
 They might want to honor duel you
 You might even have a couple friends already summoned to help you out
 Some players have taken it upon themselves to create a sort of "honor" code when it comes to PvP
 They like to designate certain areas of the game for official dueling, with no help from other players or no healing, stuff like that
 Some players agree with doing this
 Some players prefer the chaotic nature of invading in random places, not knowing what either party will be up against
 Some players are firmly rooted in the idea that PvE and PvP should not intertwine
 They'll even go as far as to never turn human
 What "honor" or "etiquette" should be included in Dark Souls' PvP, if any, is still being debated today
 I feel like there will never be one solid answer but I think that's okay
 It allows for more discussion and I think there's something inherently beautiful about a community being on two complete opposite sides of how an in-game mechanic should work
 Bottom line: try, at least a couple times, to play through the game in human form
 The invasion mechanic is a part of the game, and even though sometimes you'll get ganked, it's an experience quite like no other
Dark Souls is challenging, but not unfair
 To be honest, the difficulty this game is notorious for isn't as bad as a lot of people make it out to be
 Don't get me wrong though, there is still a lot of obstacles you'll have to overcome and at times it'll feel like you're stuck
 But don't give up
 Never give up
In today's world of modern game development, it's very pleasant to play a game that actually holds you with a high regard and respects your ability to think, perceive, and act
 Dark Souls is a hallmark of intelligent and masterful gameplay design, and it stands as one of my all time favorite games
 Highly recommended
 Well, now you know..
 and I can die with hope in my heart
Posted: 30 December, 2013
I've had a love-hate relationship with this game for years
 My first three attempts were miserable failures, and hardly stretched beyond an hour of gameplay
 It took a fourth attempt to understand where I went wrong
This game is not a bully or a menace
 It is not unfair
 Dark Souls is a father that wants to play catch with you in the backyard
 Sure, he tosses you a few practice pitches, gets you warmed up, makes you feel like you're in the big leagues
 Suddenly, you eat a screwball to the temple
 You cry at first, moan, maybe fuss a little, and then get up to catch another
 The stinging welt on your face reminds you to keep your glove up
 Throughout this process, your father slams a fastball into your gut, sails a slider into your genitals, cracks your skull with a curveball, and he'll throw a second ball just when you're barely figuring out the first
 Now you can give up whenever you want
 Make a big deal about it, about how Dad is cheating or he's being mean or that it's all just a big waste of time
 Your father will patiently wait while you throw your tantrum, slowly turning over the next hidden threat in his worn glove
 The truth of the matter is that he wants you to succeed
 He's teaching you by showing, not by telling
 He's preparing you for something much, much worse that lurks ahead
 Don't fight it
 He wants you to succeed, but he's going to make you work for it
 Take your lumps, say goodbye to your precious souls, and above all else: Prepare to die

Dark Souls is hard
 That's the first thing people probably hear when the title is mentioned
 I think that people have become spoiled -- or maybe weak or complacent are better words to use
 We've become used to pressing A for awesome or quick time events flashing across the screen
 We're used to hand holding and tutorials that overstay their welcome
 We're used to winning and not having to work for it because challenges are usually designed to be beaten without the threat of losing or death
 If Dark Souls is a difficult game, then it's because it actually respects the player
 I know that I find the typical style of hand holding in games to be patronizing, no doubt from being developed for the lowest common denominator
 If you die (and you will), then it's because you lack necessary information and must learn it through experience, or it's because you're not paying attention or being too careless
 Dark Souls rewards adaptability and experience
 If Dark Souls is difficult, then it's not because it is unfair, but because we are weak and need to shape up
Another claim I've seen bandied about is that Dark Souls is light on story, but I do not believe this to be true
 The story, like the difficulty, treats the player with respect
 We're not going to be fed exposition from an eye dropper
 The majority of the lore we gather is embedded within item descriptions or world and enemy design
 We approach the game as an explorer, travelling to the cataclysmic land of Lordran to sift through its relics and best its challenges
 The way the lore is delivered reflects this
 Does this mean that it is light on story
 Only if we assume that deep story necessarily means being beaten over the head with it via heavy handed narratives
 Dark Souls is/was a bad pc port
 It is internally rendered at a fixed, low resolution, can't really be played without a controller and, the worst of all curses, uses Games for Windows Live
 DSFix is a third party modification that alleviates the former graphical issues
 There'll be a patch released this month to remove GFWL, so that takes care of another issue
 Honestly, the game is such a masterpiece that it's worth recommending even with the above porting issues, but it's nice to know that the two main gripes (I don't mind using a controller, personally) are not issues any longer
 Subtlety is an art that seems lost in the medium of video games
 Games are treated as if they are amusement park rides with all the flash and noise one should expect from such a distraction
 Dark Souls is not an amusement park ride, but more like a long forgotten, dusty tomb that we disturb at our own peril; it thusly responds to our disturbance in kind
 I played Dark Souls to completion around six times with three characters when it was released on consoles
 I didn't hesitate to purchase it again when it was ported to PC
 I've since played through seven more times with another three characters
 I suppose you could call me a fan of the series
 I obviously recommend it
Posted: 21 March, 2015
I'd recommend this game under one condition: Take the advice in the title, and prepare yourself
Death is not failure, but it is common
First, a bit of background: Coming into this game, and having never touched either it or a controller before, I actively disliked a lot about it
I hated the Vancian cast limits placed on the magic (still do, in fact; I'd prefer nerfed magic and a bloody mana bar)
I also expected to be able to play it immediately, but instead was advised to get DSFix (no, seriously, get it immediately) to ensure that it worked well the first time around
I had to buy a
controller just to PLAY the game, since the M&K combo didn't work out
The only reason I even got the game was that a friend wanted me to try it, and it wasn't all that expensive
All in all, I was more than ready to hate this game and everything about it
And then I actually PLAYED the game
And it's amazing
Let's ignore the setting for a minute, because it's awesome on its own
Let's ignore the depth of the lore, and the subtlety behind it, for the same reasons
Let's look at the combat, and the exploration, and the GAMEPLAY of the game
I have never seen a game so dedicated to making it YOUR FAULT when you die
It's not that hard to take about ten extra seconds and think it out before charging in, and if you do that, you instantly double your chances of survival
Trying out a weapon and learning its quirks BEFORE fighting the enemy is absolutely vital, so that you know how to time your hits
The attacks the enemies use are, for the most part, very easy to read if you just WAIT a minute and figure it out
It's not hard to figure out which enemies are tough enough that you should just leave them alone for a while, and if you attacked them, it's on your head
Once you understand the basic mechanics, the game becomes downright refreshing
I don't know about you, but I hate it when I die in a game and it WASN'T my fault
I need to be able to see where I screwed up, and fix it
This is the game that lets you do that, and if you're not willing to do so, of COURSE the game is super hard
Of COURSE you're getting punished
If you're not willing to learn and get good, you deserve punishment
In summary, though, this game is not for casuls
This game is for the player who is willing to accept constructive criticism both from the game and from the player base
This game is a trial by (bon)fire, and passing through will temper you into a better gamer, and possibly a better person
Git gud, stay warm, praise the sun, and kill the dogs first
Good luck out there, and don't you dare go Hollow

I was always afraid to play dark souls
 I've heard the horror stories, I've heard of people spending hours on a boss, I've heard of people raging and almost quiting the game
 And I went through all of that
 And I'm glad I did, because I experienced one of the best games I've ever played
 And dispite looking at guides and getting help, I'm proud that I was able to beat the game
I could go on about what the game is and what it does, but lets be honest, everyone whose played games before has heard of this game
 I'm basically writing this for the people who where in my shoes before I played it
 If your worried about the difficulty, about getting upset at the game, you will
 Its almost a guarentee
 You will have to look up guides to figure out what you're supposed to do next, but the games level design and combat more than make up for the frustrations of the game
 And after you realize that death in this game isn't a punishment, but more of a learning experience, you stop getting so frustrating and you realize that you have to learn how the world works
 There are definitely some frustrating elements that I think are way too unfair, but the game makes up for it with the combat and level design
I think everyone should play this game through at least the first 3 bosses
 If you decide it isn't for you after that, that is prefectly fine
 But a lot of people play for an hour, die, and say it was too frustrated
 And admittedly I did that for a long time
 But if you give this game a fair chance, I think you'll realize that it really isn't as frustrating and hard as people think
Dark Souls turned me from thinking it was a frustrating mess of a game to being one of the best games I've ever played, and I'll definitely play it again at some point
 You owe it to yourself to give a fair shot to one of the best games of last generation
 Buy At Full Price

By far the best game I have ever played
 Dark Souls is NOT even close to the hardest games out there, contrary to popular belief
 It is just a wake up call from the standard industry games where everything is handed to you
 You actually improve at the game as you go, as opposed to just getting equipped with better gear only
 This is a perfect 10/10 for me
 Also don't use the drake sword
Posted: 7 October
You think you know, but you don't
You've heard the reviews: "Dark Souls is the hardest game to exist
 Dark Souls is so soul crushingly difficult I can't play normal games anymore
 Dark Souls seperates the casual gamers from the elite
"Ridiculous
 Dark Souls is a game for everyone
 You will play Dark Souls
 You will like Dark Souls
 You will "Git Gud"
 But Dark Souls isn't a litmus test
 It's not a bar that seperates the wheat from the chaff
 It is a transformational experience for the benefit of all of those who enjoy video games
 Dark Souls believes in you
 It challenges you because it knows you can do better
 And you will
 Everyone is capable of success in this game
 All you need is a willingness to keep trying- a willingness to lose all that you have
 Once you realize that everything that you have to lose in this game is all obtainable again; once you realize that there is no penalty to trying your best and failing- that is when Dark Souls truly challenges you to transcend the current limits of your play and evolve into something more
 Many RPGs have a sense of progression
 There is a satisfaction, a catharsis to growing stronger as your character gains attributes and statistics and you have the opportunity to fight some enemy that provided challenge much earlier in your playthough, and now dispatching them is mere child's play- but this catharsis transcends merely gaining numbers on a character sheet in Dark Souls
 In Dark Souls, your character doesn't level up: you do
 And as you get better, as you grapple the controls and the inventory system; as you familiarize yourself with the weapon animations and the combat mechanics, you can feel yourself eclipsing the terrors the game faces you with
 You begin to feel safe, to feel certain in yourself
 There is no danger the game can throw at you and leave you running scared- you have won, by virtue of your persistence
 You know the map now
 You know where the enemies spawn
 You know precisely where to obtain the weapon you love and the resources you need to level it into grandoise preportions
 You can roll, parry, and backstab your way out of any combat encounter
 You have achieved mastery
 This is what makes Dark Souls brilliant
 The appreciation you acquire on subsequent playthroughs
 Dark Souls affords you the power to play the game however you may like if you will only try
 Try and you will prevail
 Try and you will be rewarded with the purest sense of accomplishement to grace modern gaming
 Link the fire, Chosen Undead

It's like being married to a woman who is attractive and charming and funny and intelligent and you are soulmates and everything is perfect, right
 She is the perfect woman
 You could not ask for a more better woman in the world
 You love her, and she loves you
 Only, she has one flaw
 Every 5 minutes, she punches you in the face..
 For no reason, she just punches you in the face every 5 minutes
 Even at night, you wake up, she punches you in the face
 You recover, get 3 minutes 38 seconds of sleep, then she punches you in the face again
 And you love her

Lots of cheaters
 Anticheat system makes me laugh
It's been a year from the launch of H1Z1 with battleroyale now chopped into King of the Kill and Just survive
 Just to make more money
 It's soo obvious hunger they have for money that they not only did this, they are giving more priority into creating new crates and skins to sell to dumb people instead of fighting the high amount of cheaters in this game

Do not purchase this game
 Do not support unethical price gouging
Step 1) Announce you are making a game that will be free
Step 2) Release it as early access with tons of bugs for $20Step 3) Release a new game mode to hold people over while you fix the bugs in the actual gameStep 4) Announce the game will NOT be free Step 5) Split the main game and the secondary game mode into 2 seperate games and charge $20 for each
Step 6) Profit

After almost spending my entire life (almost 1000 hours, including the original H1Z1) here is my final review for you guys
It all began 2015, where the glorious H1Z1 has been released
 At this time the game was full of bugs, well I didn't judge in those days, because it was an Early-Access-Version of the game
Though it had a lot of bugs, it was really fun to play, with friends of course
At this time you actually were getting rewards for winning, even if you were playing in a group
 Nowadays you will not get rewarded after winning when playing with a group
 So for some people (including me), the motivation to win was missing, since those days
After the Developer Studio switched and reorganized from Sony Online Entertainment to Daybreak Games (TheyBreak Games

 I know what i'm talking about
Imagine you buy a nice dog (h1z1) for your birthday
 You love this dog, you play with it almost every day, and the dog loves you back
 After a few months you decide your current doghouse isn't big enough anymore to keep your dog in, so you buy an expensive, nicely painted doghouse (brand new pc) JUST to play with this dog
 Another few months go by, and you start noticing all the things you don't like about your loyal companion anymore
 His fur is all scruffy, his teeth are going yellow, and he barks at the first sign of another human being
 You try to convince yourself your dog is changing, growing up
 Little do you know every time you try to play with your dog it attacks you and starts growling at you
 Every single week you notice different changes to your dog
 He starts walking funny, his barks sound like guinnea pigs having cotus and the once beautiful fur has all but vanished

This is from some who played 1k+ hours of BR/KOTK
DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
You will be greatly disappointed by the developer of this game (Daybreak)They always manage to mess up something every single patch and never listen to the community
It's obvious that they are here to make as much money as they can and just abandon the game

Early Access Review
H1Z1 is a game I've played for over a year and a game that I've loved a lot for such a long time
 It was a game that I was willing to look past the bugs and poor development team because of how much fun I had playing this game
 The current state of the game, on April 11 2017, is absolutely terrible
 We've been promised so many things and been given so little
 We just NOW got a spectator camera
 9/10 of my games are ruined by a hacker two tapping me from a mountain
 Despite all of this, I loved King of the Kill so much
 I made so many friends and got close to so many people through this game, and it held a special place in my heart for that
 Until today
My best friend got on to play a couple of rounds with me only to find out that she had been banned
 Why, might you ask
 Well neither of us have any idea whatsoever
 She's not someone to care about cheating or even her rank all that much, seeing as we only played duos and fives
 All of her games were very low kill counts and placings, if anything she was a very average player around Gold level
 She never had an insane performance or anything like that
 Today, she was banned by Daybreak Games for virtually no reason
 I can not, with a clean conscience, recommend ANYBODY to purchase this game or give the developer any of your money whatsoever
Daybreak Games is a terrible company in literally every single right
 The game has been early access for three years and the game has gone nowhere at all
Edit: Daybreak responded to my friend's complaint about being unreasonable banned with:"nullnullThanks
don't reply
":)

Tough but fair
 Rewards slow and methodical gameplay
 And the boss battles are fantastic
Posted: 16 April, 2016
I summoned a mad phantom with the intention of dueling him, but instead he sat down and offered to toast with me
 We continued on throughout Undead Settlement together despite my wariness of him and he helped me take out all the mobs in the surrounding area
 After a while, I became accustomed to fighting alongside my newfound friend and started turning my back to him knowing full well that he would protect me to his last, dying breath
We were a team
 The best of friends, and nothing could stand in our way
 He may not have been a Warrior of Sunlight, but Solaire's legacy thrived on within him
 Jolly co-operation resumed until we neared the Curse-Rotted Greatwood..
And it was then that I decided to take yet another chance and summon a second Mound-Maker to see if we could rally him to our side
The plan seemed successful at first
 But it wasn't long before I noticed some suspicious patterns in the phantom's movement, and his interest in my backside became a significant concern
 My anxiety was proven justified when the phantom took a swing at me with his greatsword and missed
My loyal protector raised both his hand and his middle finger at the attacker, before charging forward with fury the likes of which none in Lothric had seen
 He made it his personal duty to end the traitorous life of the one who would dare attempt to strike at me, and before long the violent fool was fleeing from our jolly wrath
 He rushed up a ladder and leaped across rooftops before finally dropping a harmful distance to the ground, giving us an opening to attack
 My companion launched himself from the rafters and his flowing cape waved majestically in the air as he readied his sword and plunged towards the infidel who would dare spit on the tenets of co-operation and sunlight
The valiant protector lunged his sword deep through the attacker's back before he could escape, the weapon grinding through bone and flesh and rendering him a lifeless husk
 I dropped down following this, and we waved and spun our capes at one another in excitement and victorious glee
But this was the end of our time together
 We gave each other one final wave before my friend's body started to fade away as he was whisked back to his own dimension
 It hit me I'd never see him again

After putting these many hours, I must say that this is one of the best, if not THE best RPG
 Period
It's hard, yes
 It has a steep learning curve, also yes
 But this game is a rare gem among the simplified, straight-forward, linear games that are currently in trend
 Rare indeed for a game that actually rewards you for patience and restraint and encourages players to slow down and observe the surroundings and the enemies
 Of course, the same can be said about Dark Souls 1 and 2
 But Dark Souls 3 is really much more refined than those in a good way
 Relatively faster paced combat not only feels more fresh but I think is a necessary step forward in making the gameplay more interesting
 Also, the enemies are much more aggressive to compensate for this faster paced combat
 Though the lore does not appear to be on par with the one in Dark Souls 1, which I personally believe to be the best in the Souls series
 But it is still well above Dark Souls 2, which I personally didn't like all that well
I could go on and on about this game, but for brevity I must say: Everyone must try this at least once
Posted: 7 June
I was there to fight Lord Gywn I was there to fight King Vendrick I was there to fight The Soul of Cinder I was there to fight to the end
 I was there to fight along side Solaire of Astora I was there to fight along side Lucatiel of Mirrah I was there to fight along side Siegward of Catarina I was there to fight along side them to the end
 The Bonfires were there whenever I needed to rest The Emerald Herald was there whenever I needed to rest The Firekeeper was there whenever I needed to rest They were all there for me until the end
 Artorias was there when I came to challenge him Sir Alonne was there when I came to challenge him Gael was there when I came to challenge him Honorable knights were there when I came to end it all
 I was there to explore Lordran I was there to explore Drangleic I was there to explore Lothric I was there to explore to the ends of the Earth
 I was there to Praise the Sun I was there to Git Gud I was there to Finger But Hole I was there to Jolly Cooperate to the end

There isnt any game that will make me feel as connected to my character as much as the Soulsborne Series has
 But specifically, Dark souls 1-3
Now dont let my play time decieve you, ive easily played this 3-4x more than the playtime suggests (I also own it on PS4)As such is has a special place in my heart, it might not be the best game the bosses not as hard as some but i made a character and that character i have never had a better representation of my self in any game and ill explain why
In August 2012 i bought a copy of Dark Souls "Prepare to die" Edition
 i was going through a hump and honestly retreated further back into video games than i did previously, I remember putting the game on my PC and dealing with the buggy Microsoft Windows Platform but i kept going, I made my character look like me like i always do after the back tingling sensation the opening cut scene gave me
 The witches of izalith with thier chaotic flame, Gwyn smiting the dragons, Nito moving with his wrathful stance
And the Pygmy, With his Dark Soul
 Sharing it with others
 Humanity
From that moment i knew i was in for a hell of a good time
 I was wrong obviously dark souls stomped me into the ground but eventually i got the hang of it, Buggy controls or not i had fun, Not just playing the game but reading desciptions of items trying to scrounge up what the lore ment and filling in the gaps that i missed
 I wanted more and more, the story was great even if it wasnt offered up straight to you and you had to look for it, and i think thats probably why it was great
Miyazaki once said in an interview that he made dark souls in a similar way to what he experienced as a child, Growing up he had a lot of time alone and he spent it reading, He loved it but his favorite books were those about the knight who goes on daring quests to save a princess or slay a dragon and find treasure, However these books were in english and so he didnt understand them completely, a lot of the information was missing and he filled in the blanks with his day dreams of how HE wanted the story to go
 imagining the hardships the knight must have gone through to get to where he was, and he couldnt have done it in a better way than what he did with dark souls, He made a community of people who feverishly try to fill in the blanks of the story even so complex that it makes your head spin
Then there was Dark Souls 2
 I continued the fantasy and made my character look like me again, Making it a continuation of my characters story -SPOILERSIn dark souls 1 i chose to not light the flame and walked out to start the age of men, its my favorite ending and if i have the option its the one i always take so to me the story of drangleic was someone else managed to get through and continue the age of fire while i went off and disappeared for an undisclosed amount of time with a dope hat and a ton of soulsTo be fair Dark souls 2's story was lacking more than everyone expected but it was still a great game, the controls were more optimized so the game itself didnt seem as hard and the opening cutscene was great, i got goosebumps when the old firekeeper said "And like a moth to the flame your wings will burn in anguish, Time and Time again" and that was very true to the game we kept going for more even though you would get that angry sensation to just put it down and not pick it up
 but you always do
Then theres Dark Souls 3

Tip from someone who recently beat the game
You can use the cord for your controller to hang yourself
Due to many responses as to having wireless controllers bash your head with it until you forget about the game or you die doing it
Posted: 15 September
You'll try
 You won't know what's going on
 You'll think dying is bad
 Your friends will explain things to you, using words like, "Estus shard" and "Praise the sun" and it won't make sense
 You'll give up after dying repeatedly on the tutorial boss only to finally kill it and then die to a dog that scares you into falling off of a cliff
 Three months later, your friends will convince you to play again
 You try it out, only to fail yet again
 This time though, you understand that's part of the process, just as your friends had reassured you
 You'll roll
 You'll roll again, then again
 You've done it
 The dog that once scared you into jumping off a cliff is dead and you've miraculously taken no damage
 Renewed vigor fills you and you continue on
 This time you ignore your friends, resorting to the wiki to answer your questions and your own curiosity to guide you to treasure
 Suddenly things begin to make sense
 You go to bed
You wake up with this incessent urge to play again, oddly intrigued by the story even though you're "not that type of gamer"
 "Why do I enjoy this
" You'll ask yourself
 Soon, you're rolling in real life, to dodge your responsibilities solely to play this game
Didn't think it'd happen to me
 It did
 Buy it while it's on sale so the first three months of you not really playing it don't feel like, "Such a waste of money
" It's not a waste, even at full price
 Amazing game and story
 So damned confusing at first but it's worth it
 I promise you

Positives: + Gorgeous looking
+ Level design is great
+ Massive areas
+ Game rewards you when you progress
+ Difficulty
+ Well designed enemies and bosses
+ Best PVP in souls games
+ Amazing soundtrack
+ NPCs are interesting and well done also their quest lines are pretty fun
+ If you want to CO-OP with a friend it has never been this easy
+ Good and smooth controls
 Negatives: - Sometimes framerate drops but not too often
- Areas aren't connected like in Dark Souls I
 But it's not a big deal
- IMO some of the bosses need a little buff
 Summary As a Souls "veteran" this is the best Souls game in my books this is just amazing piece of work to be honest i didn't even expect this much
 FromSoftware did amazing job and hopefully it doesn't end here
This is how you make a game
Buy this game

Spoiler free reviewIf you didn't enjoy the quality of Dark Souls II and are wondering about the enjoyment of Dark Souls III and the fact that it may be overhyped, worry no longer
Dark Souls III is the true successor to Dark Souls
The third entry in a game series renowned for its outstanding unique storytelling and its sinister difficulty, FromSoftware has brought us again another game worthy of praise
 Taking place in the land of Lothric, you will encounter grotesque beasts of the unknown, epic bosses, the most beautiful environments and a lore deeper than any ocean
 If you are tired of hand-holding games where the game seems to shove tutorials in your face even to end-game than this is the game for you
 Dark Souls is NOT a HARD game
One of the reason that I hold Dark Souls in such high regard is not because of the difficulty but rather the fact that it doesn't treat the player as if they're a child
 The game will punish you but know that it doesn't mean the end, rather every death you face is nothing more than a stepping stone to a greater success, a hard earned success is honestly the greatest feeling ever
 You will learn new skills and eventually adapt, the game knows you aren't stupid and will treat you like you are; a human, something a lot of games these days are sorely missing
DifferencesAgain, Dark Souls III feels more like a sequel to Dark Souls I than II ever did
 Borrowing things from all their previous games you will see happy changes to the overall game
 Fans of Demon Souls will be happy to know that the hub world shares an uncanny resemblance to the Nexus as well as the Maiden
 Extremely well designed bosses inspired from the creatures of Bloodborne and its engine as well as Dark Souls II's accessibility to the series
Positives: CAMEOS
 Returning characters will make appearances
 Extremely well optimized
 Keyboard and Mouse controls aren't that bad
 There is now no permanent health loss when dying
 Amazing soundtrack that will soothe your ears
 Extremely well designed boss fights
 Full of amazing locations to explore
Great level design
 Rewarding difficulty
 Playing CO-OP with a specific player is very easy now
 Stances
 Combat has been reworked for the better
 No more Soul Memory
 Interesting NPCs, to encounter and converse with
 PVP is better than it ever was
 Classes don't lock you into anything, you can make your build into anything you want, e.g
 magic user
 World fits together nicely in a way that makes sense
 Open world, areas are massive
 Approachable systems, deep and very easy to learn and master
 Mage builds are rethinked, they aren't as broken and overpowered like in Dark Souls II
 Matchmaking is a breeze
 This is NOT the final Souls game
 BACKSTABS ARE BACK
 At the very least better executed than in Dark Souls II
 You can easily switch between OFFLINE mode & ONLINE mode now
Negatives: Though rarely, at the moment there is a few framerate hiccups but other than that PC version is very well done
 Somewhat noticeable pop-ins
 The world isn't inter-connected like in Dark Souls I which may upset some
 CAMEOS
 Though I've written it as a plus, some may dislike it as some may think of it as lazy where From could've very well created new and interesting characters
 Not necessarily a negative but having an unstable connection while online will bring you back to the main menu
Is this game worth it
Yes, very much so
 Though I am biased, this is truly an amazing game
 It doesn't matter if you are a veteran, new or old, Dark Souls III takes the best part of all of From's previous games and makes it even better
 It surpassed my expectations, even more it completely destroyed what I should expect from a game
 All upcoming games, Triple A especially take note, this is how you make a game
 This is a true game
Thank you kindly, Alex for giving me the chance to play this wonderful game

Early Access Review
This review is for the current version of the game(2/1/16)What is Scrap Mechanic
 Scrap Mechanic is a 3d sandbox where you can construct all kinds of things
 From spider mechs to transforming houses, the things you can make are surprisingly vast considering how early in development this game is
 The best part
 They are planning to add plenty more, which will open up your options to even greater extents
Positives:This game has a pleasing aesthetic
There's no limit to how complex/big your creation can be
You can set up your vehicle to have multiple passengers, or "co-pilots"(Useful for aircrafts and mechs)
You can automate things
 (Spinning windmill, elevators, etc)The game actually has pretty good physics for the most part
Decent variety of materials to use
Quick load times
Drop in/drop out multiplayer works flawlessly
You can make games within this game
 Like what me and my friend did in this video
This game doesn't take a lot to run, has pretty low minimum requirements for a 2016 game
A survival mode is planned for the game
Devs seem to be fairly active on the forumsThere's 2 maps, one with terrain and one flat-world for those who just want to build
You can create, (auto)save, and load back into multiple worlds
There are in-game tutorials to help you out; they are well designed and easy to understand
Negatives:The game can lag pretty bad, even on high end PC's(especially in multiplayer)The maps are kinda small, but plenty big enough to have fun in
The game will crash from time to time
 Fixed for the most part
Sometimes you'll run into weird bugs while building more complicated things
Intense rubberbanding can occur after long playtimes on multiplayerWhen in a semi-fast vehicle, your character twists and warps backwards because it can't keep up with the speed
The triggers (buttons, sensors, switches) only work one way
 (i.e
 You can't hook up two switches to a single door for inside/outside)Other people can build on/destroy your stuffDevs don't seem to have a roadmap Devblogs are being released with this info
At this time, there's no real "point" to making things
 Those looking for "objectives" will want to wait
So is it worth it
Absolutely
 This game is extremely fun for what it currently is
 You'll find yourself figuring out how to make your vehicle faster, or how to climb hills better, to not flip over, and so on
 Before you know it, you'll have spent 3 hours improving it to perfection
 Then you'll find yourself thinking of new ideas you'll want to try, even while not playing the game
 I can easily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys creative sandboxes like Minecraft or Garry's Mod
 Although this game has a fair amount of negatives, they do not make the game unplayable by any means, and they certainly don't outweigh the positives
 If you can, you should pick this game up for sure

Personally I love any game that gives the player the ability to create and build things
 And if you're like me then this game will not dissapoint
 As I'm writing this review the game is still in early development but still has lots of interesting 'mechanics' that allows the player to run wild with their imagination
 Very excited for the future updates, I hope the devs continue to add new items/mechanics
 10/10 would Scrap Mechanic again

Early Access Review
The idea for this game is great and this game could be incredible, but I just don't see any progress being made, even after a year
 Most updates are small, meaningless, and add nothing to the game, thanks for that toilet we all wanted
 Problems that have existed since the game's release still plague it, such as huge lag spikes when colliding objects, Multi-player extreme rubber banding, and poor optimization on large machines
 However the most disappointing thing about this game is the constant promise of "survival mode"
 I'm just gonna say it
 I don't believe theyre working on it and it will never be finished
 There is simply no evidence that any of their time has ever been spent on it
 No inventory system, no crafting system, No hunger/survival aspects, no monetary systems, no combat systems
 There's nothing here and there's no proof that they have ever done anything for survival mode what so ever
 One scrap of evidence and I'll change my review
 Until then, I cannot recommend it
EDIT 06/24/2017, After reaching 1st place in the steam reviews and gaining some negative attention this review was set to hidden to improve the sales of the game during the summer sale
 This was intended to be an honest review and I wont be silenced
 I've lost respect for this game and they've proven to me this game and the developers cannot be trusted
EDIT 06/25/2017, Hidden from the front page again
 Updating this post seems to bring it back up
 I will not be silenced
EDIT 07/05/2017, This review has gotten way more attention than I ever intended, even from a developer
 I'm glad the developers are at least willing to listen to criticism about a valid point
 In my previous edits I've mentioned my review being hidden from the front page and this did happen, despite my review have having hundreds of ratings more than any other
 I find it unlikely my review was rotated out, because it was the top review and none of the other top reviews were ever hidden
 For the haters out there, Id like you to know I really do love the idea of Scrap Mechanic
The possibilities are truly endless and Ive even posted a couple of my own creations to the Steam Workshop
 The purpose of this review was never meant to sabotage Axolot Game, but rather to push them
 This game has shown clear signs of abandon-ware and the public deserves to know
 Almost no progress has been made in the last year and anyone can check this
 At the end of the day I would prefer to be wrong and have to change this review
 However, my doubts remain and until then, I do not recommend this game
EDIT 08/13/2017, Thank god it's in Russian now

Early Access Review
I've played about 20 hours so far and this early access is off to a great startScrap Mechanics allow me to create cars, houses, and engineering things like elevators, escalators, etc
Pros:- Allows me to make anything- Make it as big or as small as you want - Enough parts for me to play with as an early access game- MultiplayerCons:- It can get laggy if you place too many things (I heard there will be an update for that)- Theres no undo or ctrl-z, so if you accidently delete something you could break it- You can't move specific parts without having to delete it and then make another one in different spot (ex: Move engine from the back to the front or more the button up a bit)Suggestions for the dev:- Be able to run a community multiplayer server for people to join- Add a wireless remote control- Be able to create your own world with custom terrain, weather, rock/trees, hill/mountains, etc
Overall I do see a great potential for this game to grow in near future with new parts, maps, and survival mode
 I recommend this game to anyone that likes creativity with a little bit of engineering :)
Posted: 26 January, 2016
Early Access Review
I don't write many game reviews, but I felt it was necessary to write one for Scrap Mechanic
 So here's the basic rundown of the game in my mind and in this review I will be listing items that I think should be addressed
 My Experience So Far So far on this game at the time of writing this review I have almost 16
5 hours played
 As far as Early Access games go, this one is by far the most advanced from Launch Date that i've everseen on Steam, from Launch it had more than enough to keep you busy for hours on end right out of the gates, not very many games can say that
 I started off watching the Videos on the game's page like the Introducing ones that showcased the Controller, Thruster etc etc, then as I experimented and numerous trial and error situations, I started getting better and better at knowingwhat was going on and how things click
 I started with a little piddly concrete car with a horendous design, but then I started to get more intricate with my designs, using pipes and I-Beamsto make an overall badass design, then I found out the steering mechanics and how to work the controller with ease, once all this clicked I made some of my best creations
 Multiplayer As fun as this game is when you're alone, I thought to myself, "Wow, this would be so fun if I had some buds to play this game with
" Sure enough this game was already equipped with a Multiplayer from Launch
 At first that seems amazing, but then once you start getting a total of 4 players and even sometimes 2 players, the servers lag tremendously, my friends and I both checked and we came to the conclusion that it was in fact server side lag, now I know the game came out almost a week ago, but I think that Dedicated Servers should be a rather largepriority for a game of this proportion
 Overall, the Multiplayer in this game is rather flawless when I doesn't lag, it makes for an amazing experience with friends and it has so much potentiallike the rest of this game
 My rating for the Multiplayer alone is a solid:8/10- This rating due to the Server Side Lag, which can be fixed in the future, otherwise, its spotless
 Priorities
Now let's talk priorities in this game and let's face it there are a decent amount, so I will just list them: In-Game Name Tags Dedicated Servers Steam Workshop Support
Aerodynamics Friction Between Wheels and Other Blocks Remote Control Force Save Feature Bigger Worlds More World Options Variety in Blocks
More Offered Angles when Building (Like 15,30,45 etc etc)
The list could go on and I know some of things I listed will come in future updates, but I thought I would get it out there
My Message to the Devs
Dear Axolot Games, There are many games out there, Early Access games that get promises that 99% of the time aren't actually given, be in the 1% that actually cares about their community and whatever you do, never and I mean NEVER give up on this game and "Scrap" it..
see what I did there
 Anyways, do not be like previous games that were promised to be huge and have a lot of potential just to die off
 For everyone that loves this game and wants it to be as huge as we project it to be, don't give up on us, we've been lied to before and we can't take too many heartbreaks
 We the Mechanics of this game can see the future, we see large worlds, hundreds of different blocks and pieces we can put on our contraptions, Workshop support so we can share our insane inventions and vehicles with the rest of the community and so much more
 With that note, we all thank you for making this game that we will hopefully loves for days, months and possibly years to come
Final Rating
My overall rating for Scrap Mechanic Lands at:
8
5/10- Due to the Multiplayer Server Issue, other than that, Great Game
If you agree with this rating or just like the review, please upvote it so others can see and maybe even the Devs so they can get a basic understanding of what the community wants

Early Access Review
Let me tell you about stuff I've done in this game
 Made a train of caravans pulled by a jeepMade cool rocketAccidentally set off rocket while not sitting in the seatMade a flying aircraft carrier to find and recapture the rocketBuilt a transforming car planeEndless amounts of trolling my brothers with an overpowered rocket sledBuilt a fully sick tron bikeBuilt a sky city made of different segments pushed against the invisible ceiling by rocketsAccidentally caused the city to fall out of the skyCoordinated a mission with my bros to put the city back in the skyMade a mini jet planeI've had heaps of fun playing this, it's really enjoyable working out how to make something work so if you like logical puzzles and a decent challenge give it a go, it's so awesome when you've finally got your hoverbike soaring through the trees and you know that you made this
 Multiplayer is laggy but still pretty fun, great for just messing around and having a laugh really
 Overall would recommend, but remember at the moment it pretty much is just a building game, there's no objective or 'game'
 You have to make your own fun, make your own missions and stuff
 Thats what I've done anyway
 If you want more of a 'game' wait till they release the full game with story mode

Early Access Review
This game presents the most fun I've had in a while, and it's still in early development
Pros:-Place barrings, blocks, thrusters, wheels, seats, and more to create cool machines
-Intuitive wiring system
-Online Multiplayer possible
-Overall amazing game
Cons:-No welding tool, so if you break a machine in half, you have to completely rebuild the other half
-Occasional FPS drops with the lowest graphics settings (Keep in mind I play on a 1
3 Ghz processor
-Noticable memory leaks after playing for two long
Overall:9/10 amazing game
I can't wait for survival mode
Suggestions:-Welding tool (or other useful mechanism for the same purpose)-Air resistance (to create lift for planes rather than upward thrusters)-Water, submarine/boat parts, and water physics-Randomly generated maps-Optimization for less lag

I suggest this game, but only to people with an open mind
 I played for a good hour and 20 minutes before i said, "This game isn't really for me
" It's a great game, has potential, but it's not the game for me
 If you're a creative person, or someone with an engineering mind, this game is definitely for you
 For an idiot like me, it probably isnt
 It's fun, but i didnt know what to do

This game is like a toast..
Your first attempt at toast looks pretty good, but you end up burning it
You don't give up, after several attempts you make some better toastsThose toasts taste awful and one nearly burns your entire house downDesperate for toasting glory you search for some toast videos on youtubeAll these people making enoromous and gloriously looking toasts make you jealous and sadOne day, you discover that you sorta don't need to make overcomplicated toasts to enjoy your snack
 You also notice tiny differences between toasts and their preparationYou finally enjoy a proper toast, but the more you eat, the hungrier you getYour hunger for toasts gets bigger and bigger with every known recipeYou start modifying your snacks and try challenges from other toast fansYou achieve toasting heaven, nothing can stop you now, you have mastered the art of toast
 You begin preparing your masterpiece
After several hours of hard work you end up burning it
 You look back at all your progres, and you realize that you don't have to make every toast perfect
 It's in the dedication, will to learn from your mistakes and enjoying little victories on long and hard path
This game is sweet combination of pride, joy and relief you'll feel after every successful mission although you also get hours of excrutiating pain, swearing and mental breakdowns
 Get this game for full price, it's worth every penny...
and I like toasts

So..
 where to start
DMO is a MMORPG that is..
somewhat connected to the well known Digimon franchise
I will try to explain why I DO NOT recommend this game - no, I don't even recommend it to fans of the franchise (I have played more than 300 hours- so I think my opinion is valid)
 Is the game P2W
Yes, it kind of is (as I said- kind of) 
 And I am not refferring to the RNG infested hatching process which is required to acquire new Digimon
 I am more referring to the cash shop locked evolutions
 Of course- most cash shop items are tradeable - Which is a positive thing 
 But they are usually sold at a price which is not affordable
 So..
 you can have some fun for free..
 but the endgame is hardly available to those who play for free - unless ,of course, you cheat
Did I mention cheaters..
 or more importantly Bots
This is the main reason I am giving this game a negative review
 It is ridden by bots and psc (a macro which allows you to attack a digimon before it spawns) users
 I'd say that 50% of the servers population are actually bots
 So you got a 50/50 chance to talk to a bot when attempting to talk to someone
 nice, ain't it
And the GMs /admins/ devs or whatever they are, are beyond overwhelmed by the situation
 There IS a macro protector- which doesn't work in 9
out of 10 cases-or even less
 And There IS a report section on the forum, BUT reporting a bot requires you to record it while playing, put it on youtube and post it on the forums....
 only to then be ignored by the GMs (ergo, seeing the bot you reported one week ago bot it's way thru the game)
 Sounds quite frustrating , amirite
So...
 Unless you don't mind farm bots and players that steal your mobs per PSC macro - DO NOT play this game
Or unless you plan to use a bot yourself...
Which will...
 most likely go unpunished,..
 By the way: The punishment for botting are
a 7 day ban
 So..
 they just come back even if your report got responded to
NostalgiaA large portion of players are interested in this game mainly because they have memories of Digimon being their favourite thing during their childhood
 -And I am no exception- BUT the quests have little to do with the story we used to love so much
 Instead we get random quests with no story whatsoever.So.
 not much nostalgia was being had..
 at least not for me
 But maybe the immense number of Monsters is enough to impress you: Variety and Hatching I have to admit that the variety of Digimon and their specific evolutions/ attacks is somewhat impressive
 Even tho acquiring them is pretty...
 difficult
 Because we soon learn that size matters: A successfull hatch can be either 3/5, 4/5, 5/5
 The x/5 determines the size of the Digimon...
 Bigger= Better
 Each x+1/5 requires a succesfull data insertion- IF the insertion fails, there is the possibility that your Digi-egg will break
 3 successful data insertion allows you to hatch a Digimon
 But of course you want yours to be strong and big
 So you go for 4/5 or 5/5...
 And hatching a 5/5 manually..
 from 0/5 to 5/5..
 is pretty much impossible
But you will get 5/5s as you lvl up..
 you get one for reaching tamer lvl 50 and one for tamer lvl60...
 so..
there's that
 Personally I also got 2 5/5s from a single event...
 without much grinding....
 So..
 even tho a lot of people use the immense RNG involved in hatching aS
a reason to down vote this game...
 I gotta say...
Acquiring a 5/5 is not impossible And about the variety...
- what does it matter if the meta can be counted down to one hand full of Digimon
 (oh..
 and the meta can- of course- only be reached with cash shop items...
 pay wall much
) the community It's propably one of the worst communities I've ever been to
 90% of players don't speak english....
 means they propably understand english...
 but they will gladly insult you in their own language anyway
 Not to mention the homophobic and racist remarks coming from people whose mental age ranges from 12 -13
 security Oh..
 that's a fun one: Recently the GM accounts got hacked
 I've...
 I've never heard about thise happening in any other games I've played..
 like...
 WHAT THE ACTUAL ....
 I think that the fact that players are able to hack GM accounts and ban other players...
 It says a lot about the game itsself...
 nothing good that is
Conclusio:Don't waste your time on this RNG,bot,PSC,Spammer ridden piece of trash
 I mean.
 I hope I hurt no ones feelings...
 but the game_is_trash
 Even my love for Digimon can't change that
And if you aren't here because you love Digimon...
 leave...
 leave as fast as you can
 Play other Mmorpgs if you have to...
 but don't waste your precious time on this one
 The only positive aspect is that the game has lots of Digimon...
 that's pretty much it..
I give the game 1
9 out of 5
Posted: 19 November, 2016
I would of chose between yes and no if there was that option on Steam but there isn't sadly
 I've chosen 'yes' to recommend due to the length of my gameplay and love for Digimon
 A part of me has enjoyed playing this collecting game despite the bad parts of it
The bad side to it
Unless you've got Mummy's purse, Digimon Masters Online is a rich man's gamble game if you really want your favorite partner by your side
 I gone through twenty to thirty Impmon eggs in my gameplay and in the end they all got destroyed
 I gave up and was SO lucky just to get a 4/5 at first try in cash shop when I expected a 3/5 like in my gameplay on my older 'Joymax' account
 The game requires a lot and I mean a LOT of patience if you want your dream Digimon
 Thats the main bad side of this game
If you've played DMO when it was owned by Joymax, things have very slightly improved now from how they were before
 There's far less bots, less spam, better security and there seems to be no sign of a drop cap which made you want to rip your hair out
So if you love Digimon, love collecting, got a lot of patience and probably Mummy's purse--go for it
 :DEdit: I'm surprised this honest review has had downvotes despite the length of my gameplay and thumbs up to those who have played less than an hour
 Don't be afraid to tell me why you disagree, I'm interested to know
 :)

Gameking is like "We don't even need to bring new content and we get money
We'll just use
events to trick them into thinking we actually have new content planned
"
Posted: 1 December, 2016
***READ THIS BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD THE GAME***I would be careful about downloading this game
 Their security is horrible if you ask the right person all you need is provide anyones ID/Username and you the person can hack them
 Which means you could lose your account at any moment if you start playing this game
There is a possible chance of a random ban
 I was banned for 800 hours and the reason was "abused the bug"
 That gave me no explaination of why I was banned at all
 I decided to play on a very old account I haven't used in years "created during joymax time" and when I tried logging in it said the same thing "abused the bug" how exactly is it possible to abuse a bug if you don't even login
 So just a warning your account could be banned at any time too
Their customer service is HORRIBLE
 I sent them a ticket(Gameking)and asked the gms on this platform(Steam) to help me
out
 They did respond which was good but they responded with simple answers and most of their replies didn't answer or only answered half of my questions
 So if you ever have a problem don't count on it being answered
Posted: 8 March
The only reason to play this game is for Digimon nostalgia reasons
 This game has poor translations, a very heavy cash shop environment, constant client crashes, a lack of many standard MMO features, and a development team that pays little attention to the GM's as well as the players
 Bugs, Hacks, Bots, and Real-Money Transactions (3rd Party) run rampant in this game
 Further, their website does not have an SSL certificate, meaning everything entered into their website is not encrypted and vulnerable to hackers
 Why Bandai Namco allows this or any Korean company to stain their brand is beyond my comprehension, because this isn't even the first time a company has ruined this game
However, I do want to point out that while the GM's are stuck in the middle and have no real power in this situation, they are generally very nice people
 The problem is with the developers of the game itself
 Only play this game if you have some major Digimon nostalgia reasons, otherwise, run away as fast as you possibly can
 There are far better games to play
This review will be edited if/when the developers decide to fix the game and apply proper management
UPDATE: Account theft has become much less of a problem
Posted: 4 November, 2016
I mean..
 Wow..
 HOW can someone fail a game about Digimon this badly
I guess it takes the following:1
 Bad translations everywhere2
 Bad UI3
 Horrid camera control (especially near large buildings, obstacles)4
 Grindfest, bad drops, horrible pricing on everything5
 Outdated Graphics6
 Having to actually BUY WITH REAL MONEY AN ITEM TO STOP OTHERS FROM SPAMMING YOU7
 Couldn't be ANY MORE PAY TO WIN
 Spend 1,000$ and "finish" the game the same day.8
 Horrible-Horrible-HORRIBLE skill progression based on luck and rolls and bs to force you to buy premium items.9
 Really, never actually makes you feel inside a digimon world, no real story or anything like that whatsoever.10
 YOUR VERY OWN DIGIMON SPAMS YOU WITH THE SAME "ADVICES" OVER AND OVER
 ugh....
Move along, this isnt the digimon game for you
 I'm even considering replaying Digimon 1 after this nightmare
Actually yes, that's what I'll do now
Posted: 9 December, 2016
Took me long enough to review this game.
 Heres my point of view:-DMO Came to steam mostly advertising Omegamon server
-Server had a lot of problems with BOTS (macro users) but slowly been decreasing (you can still see a few bots)-Game is pay to win if you INTEND to go do high difficulty raids-Game is fun if you only there to level up some of your favorite digis doing quests till the end -Rude players or toxic community..
 (mostly from countries we all known that ruin the community on most MMOS..
 sorry but its the truth) <<<- This is the most important point to consider
cause its infested with themReview edited..
 As much as i love the game ill keep my review as it is
Posted: 5 November, 2016
This game has bad graphics
 I can live with that
 This game has awful translations
 It's usually kind of funny and not game breaking
 The one thing that absolutely ruins this game is the hatching system
 You want to hatch a digimon outside of the tutorial
 You better be ready to cough up some real money
Basically, in order to hatch a new digimon you have to grind on it's rookie form until it drops an egg
 This can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 11 hours of grinding, or you can buy an egg in the cash shop for $7
 Next you have to gather a certain kind of data (beast, bird, insect, devil, etc
)
 Once you have an egg you need to use DATA to increase it's 'level' by 1
 An egg has to be level 3 to hatch but can be leveled up to 5 for a stronger version
 Now, to 'level' up an egg it takes a certain amount of DATA
 Renamon takes 10 DATA pre try
 Yes, TRY
 Every time you attempt to raise an egg's level it has a chance to fail
 It also has a chance to erase all progress and delete the egg
 That's right, you can lose all your progress while trying to hatch an egg
 Also, DATA isn't exactly easy to get
 On average it took me about 40 minutes to gather up the 10 DATA required to level up Renamon's egg only to have a 33% chance that my grinding would be worth it
 However, you can buy DATA for only 10 cents each
So in order to hatch a Renamon (my only goal before actually PLAYING the game) you can be like me and grind in the beginner area for 5 hours only to have your egg get destroyed, or you can pay $7 for the egg, $5 for 50 Beast DATAs, and $6
50 for 5 items that prevent the egg from getting destroyed
 The extra DATA and safety items are for the unavoidable failures in leveling up the egg
 The $1
30 you spend DOES NOT prevent failure, just the destruction of the egg

I actually enjoy playing this game
 But the GM/customer service did not respond to player complain properly
 The way they handle issue is completly one-sided action
 For example if a player buy
" illegal items " ( acquired by chargeback or bug or etc )from other player, even he/she didnt know that the items was obtained illegaly can get banned for buying those items
Theres another alternative to take action for that issue like removing the " illegal items" but instead they choose the player who bought it
 Theres no way player can get information regarding if those items is illegal or not
 Really disapointing how they trying resolve the issue
 PS : I do support them for banning ppl who using bot or macro or bug abuse
Posted: 30 November, 2016
Filled with high level botters farming all low level and most other areas, channels get removed based on current players (which makes botters more conjusted into certain areas), to get ANYTHING you have to farm for ever but is nearly impossible due to the rampart botting, have to pay to unlock storage for additional digimon, coummunity is basically toxic

Ok..
 the game..
 oh gosh, my tears, I can't hold it...
 Because THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
 Here are the pros and cons (or not) for this game
The pros:+ Well-written and touching story about love, forgiveness and sacrifice
+ Beautifully hand-drawing, from characters to every detail of the environments
 (Too much clear water :)) )
+ Ahhh, musics to my ears...
 It made me cry....
+ Responsive control
 Nice
+ The platforming section is really well-executed, tricky gameplay
+ As the upgrade version of the original game, with more contents, more balance, more secrets,..
 more grinding for the ability poinits
+ Now it has 4 difficulties, from Easy to One-life..
 I hate one-life mode :))
+ A huge map with lots of exploration
+ There are parts of the game when it requires you to escape from certain death
 Well, It's time to ultilize your skills to get you through danger
+ This game reminded me of the game named "Cat Mario", the game which makes you suffer from falling, dying, danger at every corners
 RAGE
 :))
+ The game now is more compatible than the original one
+ The game is best example of Unity Engine Games that can run smoothly on low-end pc
+ No FPS drops
+ First playthrough with 340 deaths for finding EVERY SINGLE SECRET in hard mode, how bad could it be
 :))
 I bet that i will die even more if the game were bigger
+ Can you make a speed run from beginning to the end without using ability points, no death, under 3 hours in one-life mode
How long you guys can endure it
 :))
A MUST-HAVE GAME for anyone who want solid (with some trolling and surprise moments :)) ) and challenging gameplay with pure story-telling
 And I am still waiting for the sequel "Will of the Wisps"
 Oh boy, I cried even more when i watched the sequel trailer....
 Amazing game to the end....
_Epic Final Score: 10/10

Every now and then there's a game that changes the way you look at all types of games in the same genre
Take Witcher 3 for example, good RPGs are now bad because we now know that is possible to do better, MUCH better
For many of you this game will fly under your radar, many of you might even ended up here by mistake
 Whatever the reason i don't care just BUY this game
This is a masterpiece, this is the Witcher 3 of metroidvania 2D plataformers
The story is beyond good, is beautiful, it'll break your heart and make you smile, it wont bore you and it has enough to keep you engaged
The MUSIC
 The music in this game has life, it tells a story in it self, without a word you can understand the world around you, it whispers in your ear, never yells, it tells you a secret for you to keep
The art style is stuff of dreams, the color palette is vybrant but also dull when it needs to be
 The hand drawn vistas and landscapes are worth the games price, just so you can bathe in how good this games looks
The controls are just good, and they have to be, because this game is HARD, it rewards acuracy and quick reflexes, have you got those
I died 422 times on my first playthrough and let me tell you, i'd die 422 more just hoping this game would be biggerThis IS the 2D plataformer to beat, this is more than a game is an EXPERIENCE
Posted: 12 June
This is an action platformer in the Metroid style
 As you explore areas you gain new abilities that allow access to previously unpassable ones
It plays as good as it looks - which, considering it looks phenomenally gorgeous, is no small feat....
The controls are responsive, and the platforming gets nicely tricky (though not too frustrating)
 It also has several really cool "escape" setpieces that are just right for being challenging, and making great use of your skills
 You get the ability to slingshot yourself off of certain objects, which includes enemy projectiles, and these sequences make crazy use of that
 Mixed up also with various jumping / gliding / wall jumping bits that make them very exciting to do
 For a 2d platformer it really is quite thrilling when these setpieces kick off
It's an exceptional game mechanically, and hugely enjoyable - plus its also surprisingly hard on the highest difficulty, so represents a fairly big time to complete
There is a downside depending on your tastes - the story and music are pretty twee stuff, and the "voice acting" is just kiddyish gobbledygook
 But other than that its a very engaging, artistically stunning game, and I highly recommend it
Posted: 22 June
If anyone ever told me a video game cannot be a piece of art, I would show them Ori and the Blind Forest (soon to be the Ori franchise)
Ori and the Blind Forest is one of few games that recieves very little negative attention (only notable negativity come from those complaining about the Definite Edition release)
 There is very little wrong with the game itself in terms of gameplay, glitches, and music
 The story itself is known for making even the toughest of men cry as well
 Everything in the game itself seems to come together and forge a masterpiece
The main gameplay of Ori and the Blind Forest is the platforming
 It features a unique respawn system I have not seen in any other game (though someone else may be able to name one), utilizing an ability to create a respawn point anywhere at the cost of energy
 This energy can also be used for a blast charge that can break some walls
 Respawning by itself needs strategy, deciding whether the energy could be used for a better cause or not
 Platforming itself isn't frame perfect like many say, the game was very responsive with the jumping and was never frustrating at any time
 This is one of few games where I had not one issue with the movement and controls
As for glitches in Ori and the Blind Forest, they are so few that you are highly unlikely to experience any in the entire thing
 You aren't going to be coming across a Spore: Galactic Adventures experience here, where you have to be purposefully avoiding things in order to prevent glitches
 The lack of game-breaking glitches is actually rather impressive
 Yes, there are some, though it appeared to me you have to be purposefully trying to cause them to occur
The art and music in Ori and the Blind Forest is the most notable thing in the whole game
 The music score by Gareth is incredible
 Once you hear the songs, with how emotional and fitting they are for the game, you could easily see as to why they recieved such praise
 The art design is incredibly unique compared to similar games as well
 It is a 2D game that looks and feels as gorgeous as a 3D game
 The backgrounds and foregrounds are utilized to their greatest potential, being able to see the antagonist, Kuro, flying at you from a distance to Gumo hiding in the foreground behind tall grass
 The two combined, art and music, end up creating a visual masterpiece that is incredibly pleasing to look at
 Despite how simple Ori's sprite appears to be, it is at the same time very detailed with the animation and look
 Everything in the game looks and moves like something that is alive
The final part of the game, the story, is known to make grown men cry
 While it isn't the most unique story when you first start, with Naru perishing and Ori going on a quest for 3 elements, it ends up becoming apparent as to why it is unique later on
 Gumo, Kuro, and even Naru end up making the story incredibly unique for many, many reasons
 Each character has a lot of backstory, and it is incredible how it is told without words
 Gumo, Naru, and Kuro are incredibly detailed and interesting to learn about despite how simplistic they appear to be
 We learn all about Ori throught the whole game, similar to Kuro
 Every character, even the dead ones, have so much thought and effort put into them that it shows what Moon Studios is capable of
Gameplay: 8/10 - It could do with better combat, but since the platforming was nailed incredibly well with the platforming being the main focus as well, the combat can easily be looked over
Soundtrack: 10/10 - This is the only soundtrack I can say I have never enjoyed more in my entire life
 Every song fits the scenario and changes the mood drastically
 Without the work Gareth did, Ori and the Blind Forest would not be so amazing
Art Design: 9/10 - The game looks and feels exactly like you are playing a painting
 The characters move and look like they are alive as well
 There is very little I could say bad about the art of Ori and the Blind Forest
Story: 8/10 - Every single character has a massive amount of thought put into them and has their entire story told without the need of text
 Even the least interesting character, Sein, is still incredibly interesting to think of
 Every character in the game has incredible amounts of story put into them and the game tells it without saying it directly
 What happens to Kuro, you have to piece together
 Why the ending is sad, you have to tell yourself as to why
 The character's stories are incredible, and the game might have been even better if it was even more focused on them as opposed to the elements Ori and Sein were searching for
Bugs/Glitches: 9/10 - While there will always be bugs, I did not experience a single one during my entire time playing the game
 I thought this was incredible, considering how buggy many games are today
 The game still has some glitches as expected, but the lack of any glitches that occur during the playthrough of it is astonishing
 They seemingly have to be activated purposefully
Overall: 9/10 - Ori and the Blind Forest is perhaps one of the greatest games I have ever had the chance to play
 I highly urge anyone who hasn't play Ori and the Blind Forest to do so
 With Will of the Wisps coming out soon, now would be the time to play the original masterpiece that began my new favorite franchise

(Already played the original game
 => skip the first few paragraphs)Ori and the Blind Forest is a very beautiful metroidvania platformer
 It has won several awards for it's art and music
 The entire world is handcrafted and every area has a unique feel to it
 You play as Ori, a tiny being in a huge forest
 Your task is to restore the elements and restore balance in the forest of Nibel
 During your adventure, you will gain abilities and skills that give you access to previously unaccesible locations
The game has a unique save-system where you can place a checkpoint ("Soul Link") almost everywhere
 Are you stuck
 Create more savepoints
 Forget to save and die
 -- Too bad, you're going to have to do that all over again
 Besides that, the game allows you to pick skills from a skill tree that give you more freedom in how you want to play
 Want to explore, pick some of the exploration skills
 Need more fire power, pick a damage increasing skill
This game is an extended and improved version of Ori and the Blind Forest and is a stand-alone experience
 You do not need to play the original game first (the core game is the same)
Why buy this if you already own Ori and the Blind Forest
- New abilities that both change how you move around and change combat in a new way
- A large, optional, beautifully crafted and varied new area which tells Naru's backstory
 You need to backtrack to find it
- No more closed-off areas; Spirit Wells can be used to warp across the map and you will have access to every location, even after you finish the main storyline
- Difficulty scaling
 Was the original game too hard (or too easy)
 Try the new 'Easy', 'Hard' and 'Single Life' modes, each with their own leaderboards
- Behind the scenes content and concept art
- 7 new achievements to get
Like the original; probably best played with a Xbox 360/One controller, although not impossible to play on kb/m

*Edited : "Ori and the will of the wisps" is cominggggg~*This isnt a game..

Ori and the Blind Forest is one of the most visually stunning games out there right now
 Not only that, the storyline touches the heart and makes you feel the want to keep on playing
 Though the game may be tricky at some points and you may have to use your brains to figure it out, the game is a masterful piece of art
Posted: 3 December, 2016
I'm not a platformer fan but this is something else.
Ori and the Blind Forest is what you call a masterpiece
 Every essential aspect of this game is perfect or at least close to that
Posted: 27 April, 2016
This game was already good
 Insanely good
 Unbelievably good in fact
 But now it's perfectLet me try to explain how the new areas look, if i even can
 The new areas are definitive (heh) proof that video games are indeed art
 This isn't even a game anymore
 This is a painting
 You are literally playing a painting
 Seriously,
Moon Studios went to WORK on this game
 If you walk over a leaf, the leaf moves
 If you step on a single blade of grass, it waves along back
 If you run across the ground, it glows in response
 The environment, the atmosphere, it's all perfect
 You could set steam to take a screenshot every 10 seconds
 The soundtrack to this game is hands down the best soundtrack for any game i will ever play
 Gareth Coker, you take a bow
 Even if you don't play video games, or don't have a computer, or anything you owe it to youself to listen to the soundtrack at least
 The Definitive edition expansion to the soundtrack is name your price
 GO DOWNLOAD IT
 Listen bud, you had better go download this game
 Yes, you
 Right now
 You're missing what will likely be one of the best game's you'll ever play if you dont

I just finished my fist playthrough of this game, and I think it's become my favorite ever
I generally play action RPGs or just RPGs (souls series, witcher, elder scrolls, fallout etc
) and I've found some phenominal titles
But I've felt that every game I played up until now has been lacking something, for example, The Witcher 3's story and quests are fantastic, but the combat is sometimes clunky
The mechanics of the souls games are great, but you have to go out of your way and do research to figure out the story, which I've done, and still the stories haven't really grabbed me
Ori and the Blind Forest is as close to a perfect game as I have ever played
It has some really unique mechanics that all work beautifully, the story is bittersweet and wonderful, the music and artstyle are perfect for the game and its environments
In summary, this game is a work of art
I had one problem during the entirety of my 11 hour playthrough, which went through almost 100 percent of the map: I got stuck under a rock and had to quit out
That's it, that's the only thing approaching a glitch or a mistake I found
If this game is on sale, it's criminal not to buy it
If it's not on sale, it's still criminal not to buy it
This is the first game I've written a review for, because these developers deserve more attention for this masterpiece

I've been playing this game for about five years
 Well before it was on Steam
 It was a complete and rich experience then and it is even better fleshed out now
 Don't listen to negative reviews calling this game "unpredictable" or "incomplete"
 I never did the main quest until years of playing this game
 It is not the focus of the game
 The game is highly unpredictable but that is a feature not a bug
 In the vein of Nethack or Rogue, unpredictability is one of the main gameplay elements
 Expect to die immediately
 Almost every death, however, can be avoided if you play correctly and pay close attention to your surroundings
This game is not for most people
 But for the rare and imaginative few who appreciate turn based classic roguelikes with a heavy emphasis on gameplay and variety and not on graphics or balance, then this game will enrich your existence permanently

Early Access Review
I like Caves of Qud quite a lot, and it deserves the positive ratings it has gotten
However, it is not quite ready for a consumer audience and is quirky enough that it would turn a lot of people off
I'm writing this "negative" review so that you can understand its shortcomings before buying it
Caves of Qud is actively in development, with all that entails
By "development" I do not mean "polish"
There are almost daily updates which sometimes break old savegames
Mob combat AI is still getting major improvements, items are still being added, large balance changes are made regularly
The main quest is not finished, some major locations (the kind you can see from the world map) are not finished, and some of the few named unique NPCs have no dialogue
This is a true early access game, not a beta
If you are passionate about roguelikes and/or science fiction to the extent that you'd like to help develop the game by finding bugs through hilarious death, you might want in on this
Beyond its incomplete status, this game is a roguelike
By genre convention it lacks a great many of the conveniences most gamers are accustomed to
Input is keyboard-only
The default keybinds for laptop are both horrible and incomprehensible
Permadeath is on by default and the disable-permadeath option is somewhat cryptically hidden
Many enemies can and will destroy you even in starter zones and a "fair fight" is a myth
You will not always get warnings when steering your character towards certain death
You will have absurd runs of bad luck that are not your fault and you will die of them
CoQ makes excellent use of its tile art system, but it's not what most modern gamers will expect
If you are not comfortable reading books at least a chapter at a time, you will probably not be comfortable playing
If you cannot occasionally relinquish control and adapt to chance circumstances, you will find this game infuriating
If you cannot sometimes let go of a good thing, this game might break your heart when your character dies
This game, overall, has a high barrier to entry
If you overcome it, though, the world beyond is rich and lovely, as a hundred other reviews will attest
Caves of Qud is a lovely roguelike with beautiful tile art, a piece of far-future fiction that sci fi fans will immensely enjoy

Early Access Review
I'm not the biggest roguelike player I know
 Sure, I enjoy randomization, I enjoy permadeath (a lot
), and overall, I appreciate the types of games they are
 Before I played Caves of Qud, my favourite roguelike was probably Dungeons of Dredmor
 I still love it, but that's mostly for the writing, as I loved how goofy it all was
At first, Caves of Qud didn't really grab me
 I didn't play many ASCII games growing up, aside from a really great one called 'Sleuth'
 I was among the many that looked at a game's graphics and judged it solely on that
 My my, how times have changed
If you can look past the simple-yet-complex visuals that you're faced with in Qud, and if you get a hang of the fairly easy controls, there is a very, VERY deep game here
 One that allows you to opt-in for a character defect that will cause to you spontaneously combust, all so that you can balance that out with something better
 What kind of better
 Well, how about having hands so cold that you literally freeze your enemies from touching them
 Or a way to see 5 moves into the future
How about the ability to clone yourself to make your own follower
 Or give yourself better night vision and hearing abilities, so enemies are easier to detect
 Or what if you just wanted the mental ability to 'hate' something to death
 All of these options are fairly viable in your character creation process
 That's why I love this game, and I've barely scratched the surface
Play a gunslinger with extra limbs who survives by photosynthesis
 Play a water farmer who is constantly hunted by your evil twin
 Play a character who has a beak
 The possibilities are endless, and endlessly weird
This game is so much damn fun

Early Access Review
If I could take one game with me to a desert island, it'd be Caves of Qud
 **DIFFICULTY**Is it hard
 Yes
 Is it too hard
 No
 Even for somebody who's never played a roguelike before
 Totally do-able
 You will die
 A lot
 The game is designed to be hard, but not tear-your-hair-out frustrating
 The way that it manages to be very difficult and yet wholly enjoyable despite death after death is a masterpiece of gaming
 **INTRIGUE**There is deep political simulation, effecting every last mob in the game
 Gain enough reputation with certain types of creatures or people (arachnids, farmers, tortoises) and they will rush to your aid in battle
 Lose enough, and they'll attack you on sight
 The landmarks in the game--like the starting village, Joppa--are always the same, but the wilderness and caves are procedurally-generated
 That means that as you try to reach the deepest depths of, say, Red Rock, you could find the next staircase down mere feet away or on the other side of the map
 What's more, there are very in-depth and extremely interesting crafting and trade systems that you can master in time
 **COMBAT**Deceptively simple
 Like any proper roguelike, you have to come up with creative ways to deal with certain situations
 Choosing whether to shoot your rifle or swing your sword could be a life or death decision
 It's easy to learn, hard to master
 **CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION**Oh, boy
 Wanna be a beguilin', time-dilatin', flame-throwin', photosynthesizin', gunslingin' cowboy-snake called Grassy Jones
 You got it
 Want to be one of just a few remaining true men, an aristocrat as well versed in ways of the trigger as he is in the way of the blade
 You got it
Wanna get a few more points to put into useful mutations by taking a debuff that puts an evil twin somewhere in the world, an exact clone of your character who may one day find you and kill you
 Yep
 You can do that too
 **LORE**Just play it, man
 It's awesome
 **CONS**Sometimes, you get attached to your beguilin', time-dilatin', flame-throwin', photosynthesizin', gunslingin' cowboy-snake called Grassy Jones
 While after he dies you can click 'replay most recent character' on the new game screen and get Grassy Jones back, you won't get his successes back
 Half the time, that's fine and it's just as fun to do it all over again
 There's actually a disable permadeath button, but for now it doesn't work
 There are other little cons, but they're too small to mention
 **THE BEST PART**It ain't even finished yet, cowboy

Early Access Review
I've played over a 200 hours of this game (played on two accounts), I evangelize it to friends, family, and strangers alike, but Idk what to say in a review
 Should I approach the review from the angle of "this game has the most active devs imaginable and new stuff is added every Friday with development streams on Twitch every Thursday
 Or "Holy f*cking sh*tballs, you can play a psychic turtle gunslinger who has four arms and is bros with Fungi and is not welcome in the holy places of Cats
 I mean the first option seems most appealing on paper, as it is the most measured and most rationally persuasive, but I know that it has usually been the *weird* reviews that get me to buy games
So Im going to do both
In the last two months, a major feature arc was added to the game, The Water Ritual
 Fresh drinkable water is scarce in Qud, so much so that the standard unit of currency in the game is about an ounce of water
 To gift your life-preserving water to someone is a show of great respect and brotherhood, doing so is so culturally important in Qud that it happens in a form of ceremony that is acknowledged and respected by all of the 40+ factions of Qud
 Commencing this ritual boosts your reputation with the faction whose leader you gifted the water, but it also decreases it with the enemies of that person
 Each named NPC in Qud has a generated history and reputation with every faction in the game, which is different each time you play
 This means, depending on who you encounter in a given game, you can make friends with even the most initially hostile of factions

Early Access Review
I had never actually seen a madpole before
 Even the best hunters in Kyakukya would talk about them as merciless killing machines
The thing looked as mean as they said
 Rows of jagged teeth flashed between frantic snapping as it splashed about
 I watched from the banks of the river a few feet away, peering down my carbine's scope to get a closer look
 It was ugly
I pulled the trigger; the madpole tried to flee, but another pull and the water turned red around its corpse
 Three more madpoles swam over
 I shot another and they scattered
 I emptied my carbine, reloaded, and saw that only one was still moving
Feeling sporting, I shouldered my rifle and drew my daggers
 I waded into the river and charged the last madpole, landing both blades in either side
You can imagine my surprise when this madpole ignored the blades I planted, latched onto my shell, and I could feel its teeth through my carapace
 The very same carapace had, just last moon, merely sizzled as laser fire hit me
Even more surprising was watching my right arm come off in the madpole's mouth, then fall into the water as the madpole took another attempt at ripping my shell from my body
I stabbed as hard as I could with my remaining arm to try to dislodge the madpole
 This worked, in a way; the madpole released in order to gnaw at my feet, shearing them off with such speed that my terror obscured my pain
 My remaining forearm was taken off at the elbow
Rolling myself onto the bank of the river, the madpole released me to fall back into the water lest he suffocate on land
 I rummaged through my now thoroughly-bloody pack with a stump and my face; I found it: My last shot of Ubernostrum
Held in my teeth, I shot my bicep-stump full of superdrugs and watched as my arm sprouted back, as painfully as it did quickly
I dug out my revolver, shot the remaining madpole to death, and collapsed
 I decided to wait and wash my bag as I waited for my natural mutant regeneration to generate bones and sinew to regrow my limbs, and to reseal my carapace where the madpole had bitten through
I dined on my severed feet while I waited

Early Access Review
So to start off with, I have to say THIS GAME IS AMAZING
 Not just in a fanboy type of sense, this game even in EA manages to be FAIRLY solid even in it's current state
 Sure it may get a bit boring and you might run out of things to do, but even after a small break you will still be drawn back to this game
 The game in my opinion is best played in short bursts if you don't play with friends
 The devs seem to know what they're doing and they started adding more content at a steadier rate, which helpsThis game is pretty fun but it still isn't perfect:PROS-Nice visuals-Unique planets-Fun exploration-Fairly challenging-Lots of content-Fun to repeat-Overly addictive-Gives a feeling of excitement-Alright soundtrack-Nice artstyle-Still having content progressively added (EA)CONS-Wonky vehicles (slowly improving)-The art style is different to the style pre-launch, which I prefer to the current style-Annoying research system-Content is added in a pretty slow rate-Severe frame drop during takeoff and landing with spacecraft-Gets repetitive after a few hours-Performance issues (my pc is a mouldy potato) (slowly improving anyway)-Seems like not enough for $20-Not enough character customisation (apparently coming soon)-Too many bugs (slowly improving)EDIT 1: So as I mentioned that my pc is not very good and that the performance may be an issue, but I managed to recently fix the problem by looking in the game files, so the game runs without any problemsHere's a video I found with instructions: https://www.youtube

v=Oe2MMQjMrmAEDIT 2: So after a recent update, the devs added a graphical options menu, that helped improve the performance so you don't need to go into the engine

Early Access Review
Astroneer is a planet and space exploration game with a mixture of crafting and survival elements on procedurally generated planets
 It was finally released in Steam's Eearly Access in 16th December and I have been anxiously waiting for this game for a long time
 When I saw the first pictures and trailers, it instantly gave me the sense of freedom and exploration on a grand scale that I have been craving
 And of course, I have been very excited these past days when we all can finally set out to seek our destiny in this curious universum
As I'm writing this review the game is still in very early development stage and weird bugs and nasty surprises are bound to happen
 I was fully aware of this and knew the current annoyances would not keep me from having fun
GameplaySo, it all starts with you selecting your hero and landing down to an unexplored planet
 Game briefly gives you couple tips how to do things and after that you're on your own
 When I got the game, it wasn't even released yet and I enjoyed very much the fact that there were no guides around or too much hand holding within the game
 You had to figure stuff out yourself and the system on the background is quite unique and requires at least some focusing for it to be mastered
Your tasks in the game vary between material collecting for crafting, base building and expanding, researching new types of tech and building more complex stuff
 At first you jog around like a humble space peasant, dropping down lifesaving tether lines that lead into resource sites and tunnels
 Then you start driving around in small rovers, then bigger trucks and you can even hook these into each other to make trailer combinations
 Soon your tether worries are over and your vehicles own life support is enough to keep your lungs well oxygenized
All the vehicles and the various gizmos you can install into them require power of course and you can juice them up with solar panels, wind turbines and extra batteries to keep going on
 You can scoop up some energy nodes from ground too - or use a bio fueled generator on your vehicle to give it a boost of energy
What I like especially in Astroneer is how your vehicles have certain type of equipment slots and the possibilities of you micro managing them
 You can play around with them whenever you like, tear your cargo and items down and change everythings' places on a whim
 I had this scenario dozen times, where my truck was full of supplies, miles deep in the underground tunnels and heading back home
 The vehicles store up only so much energy, so eventually I ran out of juice
 I tear down a fully loaded cargo module, drop it on the ground while I grab a generator from my suit's shoulder, slam it in the truck's side and give it some time to recharge batteries
 Once I'm good to go, I snap the cargo module back on and keep on truckin
 Later on, I of course fine tuned my truck with solar panels, a wind turbine and a generator with enough biofuel to go with it
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=820419404The WorldThe graphic style, animations and visual effects are all very appealing
 I love the edgy, simplified and clean style of the game and it all ties well together with the soundtrack
 The soundtrack is there, but it's not really stealing away your attention from the game itself - and yet after hours and hours of listening to it you still don't get annoyed by it
 I visited all the seven planets the game currently has and they all have their own biome and special weather effects and dangers
 The terrain on a barren planet is dusty, sandy and well Barren, with little vegetation
 Arctic planet has a chilly and very rough terrain, where moving around in vehicle is pretty much impossible
 And all this time when you adventure on various planets, you can see the other planets in midst of starts when you look up into the night sky
It took me 24 hours in 3 different days to rummage through most of the current content and to figure out all the bells and whistles
 I would have done it probably sooner too, but I had to start a fresh game 3 times due to one savegame file not loading up anymore and on the second savegame my character was stuck inside a building
 (Can't destroy buildings or anything you build at least for now) Again, nasty early access symptoms but nothing major to worry about
 System Era has been pushing out solid patches on daily bases and they DO listen to your troubles as long you report the bugs on a proper channel: their own forums
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=820434992Crafting & BuildingCrafting in Astroneer in pretty simple and straight forward
 You build various kinds of workstations and they all serve their own purpose
 Smelter smelts ores, Printer "prints" various modules and items on resource materials, Vehicle Bay allows you to build Rovers, Trucks, Shuttles and even Spaceships that can punch through starting planets' orbit to expand your colony into other planets
 Research station unlocks new technologies like new vehicles, gear, modules etc
 Like vehicles, these workstations require energy too - and of course resources depending on what you're about to build
 You can fine tune your bases energy needs with solar panels, wind turbines and extra energy bank
 Solar panels don't generate energy at night, wind turbines won't spin if there's no wind
 Yeah, duh
 But I like the attention to these details
 And these are all detachable, movable items so you can switch their places depending on your base needs and they fit in vehicles too
The starting planet's surface has more than plenty of basic materials available
 The harder metals are underground and there's tunnel entrances almost everywhere to be found
 The rarest materials can only be found via researching various strange items found in the world
 They can be in a form of giant seeds, roots, crates, glowy rocks etc
 Once you get off the starting planet, these rare materials can also be found on planet's surface areas and they require more advanced drilling mechanisms for you to collect them
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=821109136-- At the moment - once you have unlocked all the tech and built most things, there's really no "need" to leave the starting planet
 Not much will change in the game - the planets all have the same materials so the only valid reason at the moment is to see the sights and explore new areas
 I have no idea about the game's future plans, but I do see it brightly lit
 Astroneer is one of those 'good vibe games', where you can truly relax, have fun by yourself or with friends and family
 Game has no violence: you don't shoot or smack or kill anything in it - though the nature and elements on planets vary and they can kill you if you're not cautious enough
 Luckily death is no permanent, so just jog back to the unlucky previous You and you can save your precious items and continue your adventures
 I am eagerly waiting for some minor bug fixes that gave grey hairs to my cute Astronaut and of course more content - any and all kinds of
 I want to keep playing Astroneer more

The thing I love the most about this game is how I stayed on the first planet for 6 hours and when I finally had a shuttle, I didn't want to leave, it felt like home for me..
 so I didn't leave, I continued to live on the planet
Well, until I died by driving a truck of everything I had into a hole I didn't realise was really deep
 Then I respawned with nothing but my ugly base and a space shuttle
 And so I flew to a new planet..
Unlike No Man's Sky where you just go to a planet for a few minutes then skidaddle, you will grow attached to the planets
 The animations are beautifully made and the gameplay is simple yet fun
 There isn't a lot to do in this game at the moment, but it has a bright future ahead of it
Also, I paid 15
99 for this game, and in 20 hours I'm still having fun, meanwhile I paid 39
99 For No Man's Sky and got bored after 5 hours or so..

WARNING:Game can crash at random times, also keep in mind that this game has been labeled "Pre-Alpha" so there are many issues and the game is no where near finished
 With that in mind lets talk about the game
PRO'sGame is super fun- had some really great times with just this amount of time already
Playing with friends is super simple- Just have one friend start the world up and then just click "Join Game" and have fun
Art Design- Not a huge art nut when it comes to video games however this game is very appealing to the eyes
Exploration- This is the biggest part of the game and where you will be sinking your time into, right now you can go to 5 planets all of which can be explored to your hearts content
CON's:Game is bare bones- Do not expect that much content, dont get me wrong theres quite a few however, in one solid session you get pretty much do all there is

So, Besiege
 This is a really unique game, and I'd really recommend it to a lot of people
 If you're deciding whether or not to buy this game, just spend 5 minutes on reading this review
Who should buy this game People, who look forward to playing a very fun physics-based sandbox game Gamers, who are interested in some kind of technic and war contraptions The creative ones, people who can find a thousand solutions to one taskWhy should I buy Besiege
 It's growing very quickly and is not abandoned, unlike a lot of Early Access games Very cheap as for the content that it gives you Enjoyable gameplay and graphics A ton of space for creativity The developers promised to add a multiplayer mode and a multiplayer level editor in late 2017
Below is a more detailed breakdown
GameplayGameplay is the main point of Besiege
 Just to list a few things off, this game provides you with a nice campaign (even though there are not so many levels yet, but every level has a ton of replayability potential)
 There are also a couple of sandbox maps
 The player is equipped with infinite amounts of different varieties of building blocks and elements
 There is literally everything, starting with a simple cube and going right to holders, pistons, different versions of cannons, bombs, wings and a lot of other stuff
 The best thing is that anything you will build will work and people have already came up with some really crazy ideas
 Ever wanted to create a huge flying carrier
 Or a machine that swings a giant hammer around itself, smashing everything to pieces
 You can basically do that
 Also, slow-motion is epic
GraphicsI like the graphics
 There is not much to say, but the visual style is pretty unique and is just enjoyable
 Fire, water, explosions, the machines themselves look great and organic
SoundThere is some nice ambient music that I really enjoy listening to
 The sounds produced by machines and structures are simply great
Sanbox-inessThis is not some kind of an official criteria, but I just wanted to mention how flexible Besiege really is
 First off, in any level (including the campaign ones), you are able to disable the small building box that limits you and build anything
 The sky is the limit (and your computers hardware, of course)
 There are quite a few cheats on the options panel, that can give you something like zero gravity or infinite ammo (most of the weapons fire only once or just can be held on for around 10 seconds)
 There are 3 large sandbox levels
 And, as I've already mentioned, a level editor and a full multiplayer system are coming in 2017 (well, hopefully in 2017
 The devs promised at least
)VerdictAs for a sandbox fan, it's pretty much a 10/10
 I would rate is as the best "wait, did this just really work
" simulator

So I gotta be completely honest here..
This game is freaking beautiful
 The animation quality, texturing, modeling, and even the music are all fantastic
Even the menu for the levels is addictive in a way..
 I'm actually HOPING they get around to finishing this because the framework of it is really astonishing
My only complaint is the lack of a tutorial; it kind of sets you out in the middle of the first level with the VERY basic blocks and such and doesn't tell you about certain mechanics
For instance: You can add steering devices for wheels
 STEERING DEVICES FOR WHEELS
 I'VE LITERALLY NEVER SEEN ANY OTHER GAME DO THIS BEFORE
Truthfully, I feel this is going to be one of those great games once (or if..
 though I hope not if
) the devs finish it
Really I think I'm going to play more, because this game is something special

I've only played the first 4 or 5 levels, but I would say the game is worth the $7 for early access already
 My favorite part about Kerbal Space Program was unexpected and hilarious explosions, and my favorite part of playing with LEGO was thinking up weird death machines
 Besiege has begun to combine those interests, and I'm excited to see where development takes it
Hopefully there will be many more blocks, weapons, etc to build with
 Right now we only have the basics

This is the BEST game I've EVER played with my two boys, aged 7 and 9
 A+++++ 11/10, best ever
 Together we've learned about physics, gravity, centre of mass, flight, ballast, geometery, engineering, problem solving, and other great topics
 As a bonus is it probably the first game my wife has shown any interest in too
 It's also sparked more interest in the kids toward real-life building, and they've dusted off their lego and are often inspired to build in real life after playing
In the course of 'beating' the first island we built a number of tanks with progressively better steering and durabily, a couple flying machines including a kamakazee model, a crane, a couple cars, and a number of mostly useless but fun "prototypes
" Awsome
I've found many games like this have been too complicated or been burdened by a cumbersome UI
 This game perfectly strikes the balance between simplicity and complexity
 The game mechanics are deep enough to stay very interesting for a long time, and simple enough that we've never been frustrated
 I really hope the devs stick to this winning formula they have here and just work on content, refinements, and more building pieces

Gameplay Stalker CoP is an open-world RPG survival shooter with 3 large areas Zaton, Yanov and Pripyat, very atmospheric with plenty of side quests that reward exploration
The beginning of the game is tricky with hardly any equipment or money, there's no tutorials or any kind of help so you need to find your own way to survive, isn't an easy gameThe A-life will not give up until you ran out of ammo or eventually die, some will trow objects at you
Screenshot
and even telekinetically steal your weapon, things appear randomly in the sky or mutants with camouflage
Screenshot
etc
 Human opponents put up a tough fight, they kinda cheat in fog weather or at night even without nightvision scopes equipped, (but mods like Misery fixes that) so playind like CoD will get you killed
Still includes the emissions and anomalies (detectors needed for finding artifacts
Screenshot
) and more customization of armor/weapons
 Graphics it features the X-Ray 1
6 engine supports dx11 elements like real time tessellation, shadows, wet surfaces, volumetric smoke and others like SSAO DOF..
 so in other words it looks good, models and textures are a little outdated but shadows and sun rays are amazing (i recommend to use mods like AtmosFear3 specially designed for sky textures and weather behavior )
 Screenshot
Sound The background noise of the zone is enchanting
 In the distance, the reactor is booming as before, animals roaring in the west, shootout in the East, everything draws exactly the image of the restricted area as you are used to it
 Multiplayer has Deathmatch and CTF style competitive matches with its multiplayer mode
 Mind you, this doesn't exactly represent the highlight of the experience
 If you want to get the best out of this game, stick with the main campaign, for what it's worth
Story Call of Pripyat - takes place shortly after the events in Shadow of Chernobyl
 Having discovered the open path to the center of The Zone, the government decides to take control of it via "Operation Fairway", in which they plan to thoroughly investigate the territory before dispatching the main military force
Despite these preparations, the military operation fails, with all five helicopters crashing
 In order to determine the cause of the crashes, the Ukraine Security Service sends an ex STALKER agent, Major Degtyarev, into The ZoneAfter discovering that the crashes were caused by strong electrical currents, Degtyarev makes his way to an evacuation point located in Pripyat
 Along the way, depending on the choices the player makes, he may meet a number of different characters that can become his allies
 Eventually, after arriving in Pripyat, Degtyarev's party finds themselves surrounded by the military survivors, who take them to their base
 Once there, they work together with the military commander of the helicopter group in surviving and escaping The Zone
 They are met by Strelok, the protagonist of the first game, who offers his full cooperation including the reasons why the operation failed in the first place
Degtyarev then helps to re-establish contact with headquarters and, together with Strelok, organize a desperate evacuation out of The Zone
 There are multiple different endings available depending on the player's success, whether or not some of the characters survive the evacuation and how the lives of other stalkers Degtyarev met throughout the game turn out
 In the ideal scenario, Degtyarev becomes head of the Security Service in The Zone, and Strelok gives all the materials he found in The Zone to the government, prompting the creation of the "Scientific Institute for the Research of the Chernobyl Anomalous Area", with Strelok taking up the position of chief scientific consultant
 Bugs/Glitches It has soooo many and it will crash or make one or two missions almost unplayable
 i recomend to mod the game (some will make it worse lol)
 MODs MISERY: (for hardcore difficulty) its full concept modification that touches every game aspect including textures, sfx, music, weapons, AI, items, weather, economy and 3 playable USS characters classes to choose from: Assaulter, Recon and Sniper
Each comes with unique attributes like endurance, speed, health, stamina, weapon specializations, starting gear..
AtmosFear: like i said before it tweaks and expands the vanilla weather system to be more realistic and various
Call of Pripyat Reloaded: it's like misery but for better and easier gameplay

5/10It's easily in my top 5 Exploring the hazardous lands and scavenging through abandoned buildings with aggressive wildlife never gets old
This is a true PC game ( not ported, bad optimized or locked at 30fps and weird controls
 not that junk we see today)If you liked the others stalkers this is a must or this type of game i recommend Metro series

I really hated this game
I bought it, downloaded it, launched it, and found myself plunged instantaneously into the Zone
 I was alone
 There was no tutorial, no introductory cutscene, no explanation, not even a basic explanation of how the game worked
 I walked forward, and looked around
 I was instantly shocked at the low FOV and uncomfortably "floaty" mouse control
 This was not what I was used to - my most played FPS is Team Fortress 2, closely followed by Fallout 3
 S.T.A.L.K.E.R
 was something else - something new
 I was excited
 I continued walking and came across three people with guns walking in the other direction
 "STOP WAVING THAT THING ABOUT" one of them bellowed, while sticking his assault rifle up my nose
 I pressed "e" (because by now I'd explored the options menu and rebound some keys) to speak to him
 What was going on
 That was a question that I'd ask myself a lot while playing this game
 This guy told me absolutely nothing of interest, except that there was a base of some description a little further down the hill
 By now I'd figured out what some of the HUD was for, and how to open my inventory
 I then went to Skadovsk (although I didn't know what it was called then) and got yelled at to put my gun away again
 So I opened my inventory and moved my rifle from its slot into my backpack
 I would be doing this for a while until I discovered that I could just press "3" to holster my weapon
 I then walked into the ship
I didn't know what the hell I was doing
 Where was I
 What am I doing here
 What do I do now
 So I spoke to someone who told me there was a strange glow in the distance that he wanted me to check out
 Fair enough, I thought
 So I went where the map pointed me and found a ship
 I walked onto the ship - and died instantly for (seemingly) no reason
 (In actual fact I'd hit an anomaly, I just had no idea what anomalies were or what I was doing
)
Having not saved at any point, I started the game again
 When I got to Skadovsk for the second time, I couldn't find the guy I'd previously talked to, so I talked to Sultan instead
 He wanted me to help kill some people
 Once again, I thought "fair enough" and went with him

ALOOOOOOOHA from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone
 For the mere price of 20 American dollars you too can join the many adventurous tourists who explore the alien, radiation stricken wasteland that is The Zone
 The Zone offers such wondrous experiences as:  Drinking vodka to stave away the agonizing entropy of radiation poisoning  Running for your pathetic life as youre caught in the open by an emission that can peel your face off like a melon rind
 Getting thrown around like a ragdoll by a dwarf in a hoodie that takes more bullets to kill than Rasputin
 Hearing Ah nu cheeki breeki iv damke off in the distance and looking around frantically for the bandits lurking in the shadows
 Coming to the brutal realization that the snorks in The Zone are not friendly underwater Smurf knockoffsSuch is life in The Zone
But thats not all
 There are a glorious bounty of artifacts just waiting to be found in The Zone
 What do they do you may ask
 Hell if we know, thats why we have you to find out
 Are they radioactive like mostly everything in The Zone
 Could be
So don't just stand there
 Pop in to The Zone some time, it can be fun around here

If Fallout New Vegas and Dark Souls had a baby, it could come out something like this
 One-shot death headshots, weapon deterioration, pack weight limits, fast moving mutant dog packs - its all here
 Coupled with strange goings on in the form of anomalies and emmisions, it all adds up to a game with a great survival atmosphere
Don't forget to buy a new F5 key before starting..
 you'll need it

The STALKER games are to Fallout what Dark Souls is to Skyrim
 You have an immersive, dark, haunting, post-apocalyptic atmosphere paired with highly skilled enemies, terrifying mutants, incredibly difficult gameplay, and what might be the most extensive and consequential weapon modding system I've seen in a game
 There are three STALKER games that are built on the same engine and are basically similar except for a few notable differences that distinguish each game
 They are set in the radioactive wasteland surrounding the abandonded cities of Chernobyl and Pripyat, following the real-life 1986 Chernobyl reactor disaster
 As a result, the abandonded environments are desolate and haunting, featuring late soviet era architecture explorable in an open-world environment
 This wasteland is host to different factions of "Stalkers" or scavengers raiding the abandoned areas looking for valuable "artifacts" of varying rarity
 These artifacts give the bearer passive buffs, and contribute to the themes of supernatural, cosmic horror
 The player may gain or lose favor with each faction, or even join them for certain rewards
 Also in the "Zone" as this wasteland is called, are bandits and soldiers, who will not hesistate to shoot you dead
 Last but not least, at the back of every abandoned tunnel or derelict bunker are the most terrifying mutants ever featured in a video game, each with different abilities, some supernatural
 I can say without a doubt that the STALKER games feature the most terrifying moments, both scripted and unscripted, in a video game
 Furthermore, the game features invisible "anomalies", rifts in time and space, that will insta-kill you with little warning, adding to the extreme difficulty of the game
Each game features a looting system in which vast expanses of empy building yield few resources, making resource management essential
 Furthermore, there are loot caches littered throughout the map full of essential resources
 Instead of leading you to the objective, the game gives you clues as to the location and a marker in the general area, causing you to think on your own to discover the cache/objective
 Apart from that, the only other way to gain resources is to either purchase from merchants or loot defeated enemies
This particular game, "Call of Pripyat" is the third of the series and definitely feels the most refined
 I feel like I could safely recommend this game without the caveat of the other two concerning frequent glitches, crashes, and game breaking bugs
 The graphics seem much more crisp with still retaining the oppressive, haunting, emptiness of the previous games
 The game has an interesting depth of field effect that puts things just out of view out of focus, adding to the tension of traversing the zone at night
 This game feels the most like a traditional game, with a large variety of side quests and a map structure similar to other open world games
 Though this might cause the over-arching narrative to lose a little focus, it does add replayability to the game overall
 In this game, you start out as an undercover military officer charged with investigating the mysterious disappearance of several military helicopters by gathering intel from surrounding stalker factions
 In the meantime, you can take side contracts with NPCs, search for rare artifacts, or discover loot caches
 My favorite aspect of the story is a part where you must storm an underground facility leading to Pripyat accompanied by a crack team of stalkers that you assemble from amidst the NPCs you have helped throughout the game
 This added a level of authenticity and consequence to my actions, and made the crossing that much more significant
All in all, this game is a must have for fans of the post-apocalyptic genre that don't mind the hard-core survival horror elements

STALKER is Fallout for men

I was 15 kilograms over my weight limit when I was looting, so I had to drop 3 of my guns and most of my ammo
 Only then did I realize I was carrying 30 kilograms of vodka

This is how you do atmosphere in a game
This is how you do quest design in a game
This is how you do world design in a game
This is how you do tactical gunplay in a game
This is how you do survival in a game
This is how you do Russians in a game
EDIT: I've been informed they are Ukrainian
 Of course, I'm going to do the American thing and disregard their nationalities entirely because of my own laziness
 God I love America

Call of Pripyat with the Misery 2
1 mod
is the ultimate S.T.A.L.K.E.R
 survival experience and possibly the most challenging and immersive singleplayer FPS/RPG adventure out there
 It's PC gaming at its finest: No holding hands, no dumbed down inventories, no immersion breaking achievements, tons of loot to collect and an unforgiving difficulty level without being unfair
It doesn't get much better than this

Great game
 There's some over-the-top action scenes, some absurd humor, but really nothing game breaking
 Want a piece of advice 
 The coop mode will make it even better 
If you want some fun, alone or with a friend, this game is for you
You just have to know, this sequel is not as serious as the previous game, but again, Saints Row is not really about being serious
 In my opinion, I think Saints Row The Third is better than Saints Row IV

I first played this game on a "Play for free weekend,"..
 I think I played about the first five minutes, and then bought it- seriously it was that good
 This was one of the only games that I actually tried to play slllooowwwwllly, because I wanted to "savor" the storyline
 I would play 1 mission, then go on 5 or 6 sidequests just to make that main storyline last as long as I could
 I love the voiceover acting, the writing, the graphics, the humor..
 where do I stop
 Granted, the humor in this game is at times dark, and sexual..
 so just FYI, but if you're the person that enjoys a good "edgy" joke, you will love the witty banter between the characters in this game
A lot of people have tried to ask about the likeness to GTA IV..
 and called this a GTAIV copycat..
 well maybe..
 if you could say that GTAIV got an actual good port to PC, and maybe if you could say that GTAIV was actually funny..
 and maybe if the missions actually made sense and just walking around didn't absolutely frustrate the living Hotel Echo Lima Lima out of me
 Also, a big part was the driving for me
 GTAIV took the same car, and just copied it with different skins over and over- this game actually makes each car a little different, the handling, the speed, the features- and everything is customizable
 You can put NOS on cars, change the rims, the decals, the paint, the color of the windshields..
 there are literally endless posibilities of driving around your pimped out car- also, it is so much easier to drive
 If this was a GTAIV copycat, then SR did a MAJOR overhaul in the coding and scripting system for the driving because it is a breeze and joy to drive around in this game
 :)Synopsis: Funny, Witty, Enjoyable, (Did I mention Co-op camaign
 Only 2 people though :Notice) you will laugh, cry and connect with the characters and be able to play it over and over again
 Do yourself a favor and get it- you won't regret :)

Saints Row: The Third takes place three years after the previous game
 You are the gangleader of the Third Street Saints
 The Saints are no longer just a brutal and effective criminal operation but now a fully-fledged media empire with their time split equally between doing dirt and setting up legitimate businesses and a popular line of merchandising
After a bank heist gone wrong, the Saints find themselves in Steelport, butting heads with a local crime group known as the Syndicate
 From there it is the classic rise to power story
The appearance and personality of the Saints' leader is completely up to you, thanks to the character editor
 You can make him or her look genuinely cool, or a complete abomination
 If you want to change your look, or even your sex, visit a plastic surgeon in the city and change it
 If you want a new outfit, there are shops full of every type of fashion imaginable
Missions place you in increasingly unpredictable situations
 It starts out fairly low-key with a raid on a military base to steal weapons for the gang, but it finishes with an explosive finale involving tanks, jets and city-levelling explosions
 In between, there is a zombie outbreak, a trip inside a Tron-like computer world and much more, it gets wilder and more varied
There is also an element of choice to the decisions you make
 Certain missions see you choosing between two options that will affect the story, sometimes in quite dramatic ways
The game has a lot of replay value, after finishing the main story you are able to do a lot of side missions, e.g
 car-stealing missions and assassinations
The best way to play Saints Row: The Third is to play with a friend
 The co-op action and the careful attention to detail in the co-op mechanics are masterful
 It is easy to drop in and out of a friends game and the way progress is tracked is very smart
 If you join a game where the other person is further along in the plot than you are, you can still play a plot mission with them
The dialogue between the characters is consistently hilarious
 The game is packed with in-jokes, meta humor and constantly swerves into almost surreal territory
 The graphics may not be mind blowing, instead the game really shines with the sound
 Everything sounds great from the gun battles to the snippets of incidental speech that you get when wandering around
 The voice acting takes it up a notch though with some truly memorable performances
 The best thing is the music selection though
 A great selection of dance, hip hop, indie and metal are on offer from the in-game radio stations
Overall I think the game is fantastic
 It just gives you so much to do and a lot of fun if you play with a friend
 Saints Row: The Third is worth to buy

I knew nothing about the saints row franchise when I started playing this game
 I expected to play a normal, gta-like video game with a character creation
 Boy was I wrong
 This game made me fall in love with the franchise, both new and old style, and you should do the same
 I gave this game the custom nomination vote: "I didn't expect this to happen"
Posted: 6 February, 2016
AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Saints Row: The Third Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: Sandbox; Action; Open-World; Comedy My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-40 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Sandbox gamers; Casual gamers REVIEWSaints Row: The Third is a masterwork of a game, and a quintessential specimen of its genre
 There is a perfect balance of pragmatism and ludicrousness inherent to each and every aspect of the game
 The mosaic of realistic and ridiculous themes is expertly crafted into one of the most enjoyable games in existence, let alone in the sandbox genre
 All but the most extremely discerning gamers should be able to enjoy it
One of the first features of Saints Row: The Third that will jump out at you is the fact it is full of preposterous themes, demonstrated not only in the narrative and atmospheric elements, but also the gameplay itself
 And so, you definitely aren't supposed to approach this game seriously
 That becomes painfully obvious once you learn that you can hop out of a speeding jet and crash face first into the middle of a city with no parachute..
 only to bounce up and run down the street naked, caving in people's skulls with giant purple sex toys
Yet despite being a heavy-handed and purposeful parody of itself, the narrative of the game is actually entertaining and logically sensible (by that I mean it adheres to the logic of the gameworld, not real life)
 And the ludicrousness doesnt ever get so totally out of hand that it starts to feel like a simulator game; there is always some semblance of a purpose and direction
 Saints Row: The Third is a good example of how a game doesnt have to be serious, but also can have an entertaining and somewhat logical narrative
There is also a number of factors which add a significant layer of customization, progression, and statistics to the game all of which contribute to increasing the overall epicness of the experience
 For one, there is a wide range of customizing ability, from your character to your vehicles
 Many hours can be spent just changing the theme of your gang
 There is also a system of XP and level progression, which is uncommon in the genre, but synthesizes perfectly in Saints Row: The Third
 You can use your level-ups to customize certain abilities of your character, and if you devote enough time, you can eventually make yourself invincible purely through the level system (not cheats/codes)
Furthermore, the gameworld in Saints Row: The Third is a very enjoyable sandbox to play in, and there is a lot of potential for riotous fun to be had
 The gameworld is large enough to be interesting, but not so large it becomes a burden to traverse
 To keep you busy between campaign missions, there are dozens of side-missions of various gameplay styles which add pleasant diversity
 Outside the primary and secondary missions, there are numerous minigames and challenges (stunting, base jumping, racing, streaking, etc
) which all contribute to creating an environment where you can spend hours of gameplay just messing around and having fun, without actively pursuing missions or progressing the game
And another amazing feature of this game is the ability to play the actual campaign in co-op mode
Instead of just messing around in the sandbox with friends, you can actually beat the game together
There is also a lot of DLC, which ranges from cosmetic additions to full-blown extra campaigns
 I would say it is definitely worth it to get the GOTY edition right from the start
