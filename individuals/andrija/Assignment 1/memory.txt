Memory barely satisfies
The past steals
It's a passing feeling

Memory wise, memory flies
Memory rarely satisfies
The past tense
Tense and bleeding

You can choke
Or you can focus
I wanna forget
I don't wanna forget
I don't wanna forget

Memory knows, memory goes
Memory dulling, but I'm learning slow
The passing heals
The past is healing

Memory knows, memory stops
The hum is gone when the power's off
The passing heals
The past is healing

And you can choke on it
Or you can focus
I wanna forget
I don't wanna forget
I don't wanna forget

If you have no wishes
You can still have an opinion
Everybody's got one

If you have the free time
I'm sure there's something we can agree on
When you're passing the blame
No one remembers the same

Memory wise, memory flies
Memory barely satisfies
The past steals
It's a passing feeling

Memory knows, memory stops
The hum is gone when the power's off
The passing heals
The past is healing

And you can focus
Or you can smoke it
I wanna forget
And I don't wanna forget

I don't wanna forget
I don't wanna forget
I don't wanna forgetMemory wise, memory flies

The longer I drink the more I know
That you ain't the one for me
Open up the cooler and have one more
Cuz you're just a memory
The longer I drink the more I know
That you ain't the one for me
It's half past 12 and now I know that you're just a memory

It's the middle of the night I'm feeling so right with my fist full drinkin
Baby done gone, when you comin home, I guess thats wishful thinkin
A drunk mans words are a simple mans thoughts, at least thats what I've heard
If that's the case look around this place, because now I'm better off without her

The longer I drink the more I know
That you ain't the one for me
Open up the cooler and have one more
Cuz you're just a memory
The longer I drink the more I know
That you ain't the one for me
It's half past 2 and now I know that you're just a memory

You never did say I was right
Wasn't that hard to do
Now I get a buzz every night
Never made one damn shit to you you told me you love me but baby I don't lie
Might've said this could've said that but you said goodbye
Makes me want to drink till the sun comes up like an old West cowboy
Made my round, every bar in town
Get drunk because I ain't your cowboy no more

The longer I drink the more I know
That you ain't the one for me
Open up the cooler and have one more
Cuz you're just a memory
The longer I drink the more I know
That you ain't the one for me
It's half past 5 and now I know that you're just a memory

You're just a memory

I've been doing a little thinking in a whole lot of drinking
You better call the Coast Guard because baby we sinking
In a river of a love that never did exist
Took a cooler full of beer just realize this
Put a quarter in the jukebox, me and you were on the rocks, play another sad song to see where it stops
In the corner of my mind I knew it wasn't going to last
Pop a top, cut a block, and let's leave it in the past

The longer I drink the more I know
That you ain't the one for me
Open up the cooler and have one more
Cuz you're just a memory
The longer I drink the more I know
That you ain't the one for me
And the sun is up and now I know that you're just a memoryMemory Lane
Doot do do do do doowa
Memory Lane
Doot do do do do doowa
I walk Memory Lane
All alone and blue
You walk Memory Lane
With somebody new
Sharing a kiss
A kiss that used to be mine
Just mine only mine
Oh how strange it seems
Seeing her with you
All our plans and dreams
Never did come true
Oh how I miss
That kiss that used to be mine
Just mine just mine
I need you yes I do
I really really do
I want you to you know I do
I truly truly do
Darling please come back
Let's begin anew
We'll walk hand-in-hand
Like we used to do
Take away the rain
That falls on Memory Lane
Memory Lane
I need you, yes I do
I really really do
I want you to you know I do
I really truly do
Darling please come back
Let's begin anew
We'll walk Memory Lane
Like we used to do
Take away the rain
That falls on memory lane
Woo oo oo oo oo
Memory LaneMemory, can't you see
That's not what I should be
After all she meant to me
I'm just a memory

Hand in hand we used to walk
Heart to heart we used to talk
Now she's gone and it will be
I'm just a memory

Memory, can't you see
That's not what I should be
After all she meant to me
I'm just a memory

Yesterday, when she was mine
There have been no better times
And every night I think of when
She'll come back again

Memory, can't you see
That's not what I should be
After all she meant to me
I'm just a memory

After all she meant to me
I'm just a memoryMemory
Turn your face to the moonlight
Let your memory lead you
Open up, enter in
If you find there
The meaning of what happiness is
Then a new life will begin

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember
A time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning...

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in.
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Sunlight through the trees in summer
Endless masquerading
Like a flower as the dawn is breaking
The memory is fading

Touch me!
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun...
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day

I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in.
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Sunlight through the trees in summer
Endless masquerading
Like a flower as the dawn is breaking
The memory is fading

Touch me!
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun...
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day
Has begunMemory
Turn your face to the moonlight
Let your memory lead you
Open up, enter in
If you find there
The meaning of what happiness is
Then a new life will begin

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember
A time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning...

All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun...
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day
Has begunMemory
Turn your face to the moonlight
Let your memory lead you
Open up, enter in
If you find there
The meaning of what happiness is
Then a new life will begin

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember
A time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning...

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in.
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Sunlight through the trees in summer
Endless masquerading
Like a flower as the dawn is breaking
The memory is fading

Touch me!
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun...

Killing myself to live
A half life, a double pain
Two is power but two is war
One is peace but one is blight

Reason against heart
The choice of negation strikes
Mutilating the newborn god
Reducing His kingdom to ashes

Ashes from which no life can grow again
Except reasonable memory, memory, memory...

The myth is broken: Isolde lies dead on the ground
Who killed Her, what killed the sworn to be everlasting
Both a suicide and a murder
The treacherous whispers of Love acted again sewing both pain and shame

Love is a Lie

Memory must remain
Beyond the present stains of pain
And shame
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Be proud!

Memory

Finding ways
To bring you closer
To take you further
Fast passing somewhere
Every minute going nowhere
Going nowhere

All I've got is a memory to hang on to
One I can't leave behind
All I believe is confused
But we can set it straight together
A better design

Waters from inside
You can't see within
I can't see without
Thousand reasons why
In your absence I've got no sense
I've got no sense

All I've got is a memory to hang on to
One I can't leave behind
All I believe is confused
But we can set it straight together
A better design

All I've got is a memory, memory
Together a better design, design

All I've got is a memory to hang on to
One I can't leave behind
All I believe is confused
But we can set it straight together

When the winter comes
I won't be here to warm you
The fate of your choices
Leaving their mark upon you

You think you hear my voice
Wrapping its arms around you
Just calling you back
leave me but you can't undo

Our love you cannot leave behind
I'm with you though you can't see me

Can you say you are, say you'll be
just fine with the memory, fine with the memory
Say you are, say you'll be
just fine with the memory, fine with the memory of me

Some people wonder if they'll ever find something
Some people wonder if they'll find love

Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can dream of the old days
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Every street lamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp sputters
Soon it will be morning
Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life and
I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
A street lamp dies
Another night is over
Another day is dawning
Touch me,
It is so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you'll touch me,
You'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun...Memory Lyrics

Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember
The time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp sputters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
A street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with my memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Memory Melody,...Memory Of Me
Ferry Tayle ft. Hannah Ray

When the winter comes
I won't be here to warm you
The fate of your choices
Leaving their mark upon you

You think you hear my voice
Wrapping its arms around you
Just calling you back
leave me but you can't undo

Our love you cannot leave behind
I'm with you though you can't see me

Can you say you are, say you'll be
just fine with the memory, fine with the memory
Say you are, say you'll be
just fine with the memory, fine with the memory of me

Some people wonder if they'll ever find something
Some people wonder if they'll find love
If you are living in, in a memory
just please forgive me

I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustnt give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The still cold smell of morning
A street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning
Touch me,
It is so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me,
Youll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun...Memory, memory - only trouble in a sanity, sanity
Memory, memory - you will always bring me down

Nothing to say, empty way
Tell me now would you remember the day
Memory, memory - wish you had a good play

Here I am
With my hands on the wall of the past
You know you got to ignore
The letters you saved in your head before

Digging a hole to hide the thoughts you found

Only gleaming like dream pearls on the ground
I know It's only for now

Here I am
In the house of illusions
I hear a knock on my door once more
It's better to open than feed the core

Painting the walls again, now you see
It's the rule of your own society
And now It's only for me

Read me - Hold me - Write meMemory Melody
Fly away
Tell the world we're free.

Tell the world
Our hopes and dreams
Time has come for the truth it 'seems
Let music make them understand,

Amory
Are you ready for me?
Is she gone?
Amory
In the moment I know
It hurts so bad

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know you’re alone
You’ve been going along
Feeling like everything
Feeling like everything’s wrong

[Chorus]

Give me your skin

I am a ghost
At the controls
I have your body
I have your soul
You’re letting go

Amory
Will you tell her for me
What we have done
Amory
I know you’re capable
Of terrible things

And we’ve been here before
Don’t act so alarmed
You know exactly
What you’ve been angling for

[Chorus]
Open your mind
Let me in
Give me your mouth
Give me your skin

I am a ghost
At the controls
I have your body

You’re letting goMemory awake, they threw a cyclone in Your way
Memory awake through it all
If i'm so cold why does it feel like i'm on fire
River red, melt away

Volcanic energy
Erupt inside my brain
Incinerate

Scarlet burn my head
Scarlet river red
Scarlet burn the rest
Scarlet river red

Molten waves grey
You still sicken me
Melt away

Scarlet burn my head
Scarlet river red
Scarlet burn the rest
Scarlet river red

I caught it today
My sulphur memory
I caught it today
Memory away.Memory,
I don't need you now.
Memory,
I don't need you now,
I don't need you now.
Oh, my love, I must confess,
that I still keep the Crimson Dress
you died in.
Though my mind will tell me so,
there's just no way of letting go,
but I'm trying.
Now and then I think of you
and I wonder what we'd do
if you were gone.
Wondered why it took so long for me
to figure out if something's wrong.
Trying as I to forget you,
this I know for sure.
Memory,
I don't need you now.
Memory,
I don't need you now.
I don't need you now.
I'm going back to sleep in the place
the first time that I saw you face
and I knew.
I discovered happinessMemory Lane

If you walk just a little bit once in a while

Time is a ribbon without end
Love is the lesson we keep learning
Death but a moment we must spend

Last week as I made our lunch
We talked of yesterdays
I remember more than you
That happens lots these days
But how we laughed, I almost cried
And the afternoon flew by
As we sat on the patio sipping our drinks
And the sunlight began to die

Memory moves us past each other
Time is a ribbon without an end
Love is the lesson we keep learning
Death but a moment we must spend

And we try to give each other comfort
We try to hold off that dark night
Each of us careful of the other
Keeping our own fear out of sight

Ah, you know I've always loved you
And I know you've loved me too
So it's hard to watch you crumble
And forget all that you knew

Yesterday while I was driving
Sunlight streaming through the trees
Suddenly my heartache parted
And suddenly I felt at ease
You will love me all your life
And I will love you all of mine
That's the gift we give each other
That's the gift divine

Memory moves us past each other
Though time is a ribbon without an end
Love's still the lesson we keep learning
And death but a moment we must spendMemory Lane

We are waiting for the night to callMemory... (x 17)

Select your memory,
forget who you are.
No longer anything,
a dead, falling star.

Behind the answers,
confusion shows the way.
Out of what is inside,
reality falls away.

Elevate your... (x8)
Momory...

"Objective reality..."


(CHORUS x2)
When we scream,
so supernatural.
Nothing seams to be for real,
any more.

Sometimes our dreams,
are supernatural.
Nothing left for us to feel,
any more.


Memory...

Elevate your intake,
decide what you believe.
Use words to answer some things,
use violence to deceive.

Far beyond the borders,
of what we see as true.
I'm waiting for redemption,
I'm waiting here for you.

Elevate your... (x8)

(CHORUS x 2)

"Objective reality..."Memory save me I'm fuckin up.
Constantly laid on the ground.
Looking for signs on the ceiling
I just have to keep breathing..."
(she wants me to know she wants me around).
Think I was moving to something.
Thought I was sailing along.
Had to be sailing for someplace (thought I was right, but I must have been wrong).
You do make a beautiful blinder, you hide things I don't want to see.
Your arms cover me like a blanket and maybe it's all that I need.
I just have to keep breathing, I just have to keep breathing that's all it is, that's all it is that's keeping us going, that's all it is, is just me breathing, is just me breathing I inhale, and I exhale, and then, and then, then, then, I keep it going for nothing but, but you know, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't mind doing it for people, I just have to keep breathing, I just have to keep breathing..." Memory save me I'm trippin up.
Picking up bones from the ground.
Throw me a chain and I'll climb it up (thought I was up, but I guess I was down).
You look like a dream I was dreaming, a dream of a boy by the sea.
You must have eyes just like mirrors, 'cause I thought I was looking at me.
Close your eyes, think of the Best Thing To Say.
iampathetically lost and maybe you made me this way.
Memory save me I'm fuckin up.
The sun's just a spot on the sea.
I know I was reaching for something (thought it was you, but I guess it was me).
And the world is a wonderful target, she was a wonderful world, but God is a girl who won't listen.
She was an insolent girl.
Close your eyes and see what you're doing to me?
She catches my eye with a cynical smile and says, "
I Cannot Solve All I See".
I had a dream (dreams would fill my head, but I let 'em all slide, american-style, for the blanket that lays on my
bediwaitalldayformysailorandsometimeshecomeswereyousurprisedthathediedtryingto lookforotherpeoplenohewashewasthetypeofpersonwhowoulddefinitelygolookingforthe people)
I wait all day for my sailor and sometimes he comes..."
were you surprised that he died trying to look for other people?... ...
no, he was the type of person, he was, he was...
he was the type of person who would definitely go looking for the people..." I wanted to find An Innocent Mind, but only found myself waiting.
I laid on the floor, You walked through the door and now I feel myself fading.
I wanted to find An Innocent Mind, but only found myself waiting.
I laid on the floor, You walked through the door and now I feel myself fading.
Now I feel myself fading.
I jumped on a meaningful wave that carried me right to the shoreline.
I laughed when my face hit the sand and swam out again for the joyride.
I told you the things that I want and you gave me just what I needed.
It's just like my father would want, but I couldn't smile when he did.
I boarded the windows and doors and took the clock down from the ceiling.
But I kept my head to the floor, 'cause I had a confident feeling.
Somebody called me today, I answered the door kind of hazy.
He told me to leave all my clothes, he told me to tell you you're crazy.
I followed him out to the street, he pointed and quickly departed.
And left me to travel for weeks, till I get to the place where I started.
And I just want to be where I started, I just want to get back where I started, and I just want to be where I started, and I just want to get back where I started.
the other version of that's called, '
I buried me wife and I dance on top of her.' What a cruel thing to do, go dance on top of her, you know that was a, that wasn't a nice thing to do.
Well, but she didn't know the difference anyway..."
Lyrics taken from this pageMemory extends its empire,
holds the frame but blurs the line.
Some other time invades the sense,
a moment caught and lost, second sight.

Suddenly I feel you near me,
worlds away and close as this.
One stolen kiss upon my lips
and the moment slips away in mid-flight.

So many years ago, and now it's hard
to recall just what you meant to me.
Still I wait, I'm patient,
for the memory comes to me eventually.
Here you are, and though you may soon be gone
somehow the song still burns as bright.
I felt it happen here tonight –
here, in the empire of delight.

Dream and ghost the world around me,
you seem as real as ever you were...
but in a blur your breath on my cheek
has gone and the evening come into night.

So many years ago, and now it's hard
to recall quite what you meant to me.
Still I wait, impatient,
though the memory comes to me eventually.
Here I am, forever caught up in this mystery
and then,
that moment when the fire ignites –
I felt it happen here tonight,
here, in the empire of delight.Memory Of The Future

You seem to be
Inevitable to me
Like a memory of the future
I was and will be with you

Over and over again
I keep tasting that sweet madeleine
Looking back to my life now and then
Asking if not later then when?

It's taken me all of my life
It's taken me all of my life to find you
It's taken me all of my life
It's taken me all of my life to find you

You unlock the past
So many scenes revealing fast
At last the right conclusion
Or at least a sweet illusion

If you walk just a little bit once in a while
If you walk down memory lane
Then I hope you're a little bit wiser to know
There's time when you need to let go

You're branded by the lost night
And you're branded by the lights that shine
Colliding with your last night
They are waiting for the nights to come

You can try just a little bit once in a while
Take a walk down memory lane
Now I feel you're a little bit wiser to know
That it strikes you harder each time

You're branded by the lost night
And you're branded by the lights that shine
You're strangers in a lost night
We are waiting for the night to callMemory  shards  are  shattering  into  my  skull  
And  if  I  pry  really  hard  I  can  rake  ’em  all  out  when  they’re  dull  
But  I  still  recognize  the  pieces  that  I’m  keeping  of  you    
And  I’ve  pulverized  the  rest  of  it  since  2002  
Now  these  memory  shards  are  all  that  I  have  to  call  home  

When  all  the  palm  lines  are  poorly  defined  
It’s  ’cause  the  future  isn’t  certain,  not  for  either  of  you  
And  all  the  sharp  lines  form  blurry  designs  
Because  it’s  just  another  part  of  what  is  bigger  than  you  
And  all  of  those  chimes  are  wasting  your  time  
Because  they’re  ringing  in  a  new  year,  not  for  either  of  you  
And  all  the  lost  times  I’m  sure  it  was  fine  
Because  the  runaround  crimes  were  sharper  than  the  lines  

All  the  lost  times  we  were  way  better  off  in  the  dark  
As  it  was  all  the  wrong  minds  that  have  made  their  way  out  of  the  bark  
But  I’ve  analyzed  the  pieces  and  my  thesis  on  you  
And  I’ve  cauterized  the  seams  of  them  since  2002  
Now  these  memory  shards  are  crumbling  all  on  their  own    

I  know  that  these  stars  are  scrawling  their  lines  
I  know  that  these  scars  are  surely  benign  
I  know  that  these  shards  are  far  in  my  mind  
I  know  that  these  stars  are  sure  to  draw  the  lines  
They’re  sure  to  draw  their  lines  
They’re  sure  to  draw  their  lines  
They’re  sure  to  draw  their  linesMemory moves us past each other
Time is a ribbon without an end
Love is the lesson we keep learning
Death but a moment we must spend

Last week as I made our lunch
We talked of yesterdays
I remember more than you
That happens lots these days

But how we laughed, I almost cried
And the afternoon flew by
As we sat on the patio, sipping our drinks
And the sunlight began to die

Memory moves us past each other
Time is a ribbon without an end
Love is the lesson we keep learning
Death but a moment we must spend

And we try to give each other comfort
We try to hold off that dark night
Each of us careful for the other
Keeping our own fear out of sight

Ah, you know I've always loved you
And I know you've loved me too
So it's hard to watch you crumble
And forget all that you knew

Yesterday while I was driving
Sunlight streaming through the trees
Suddenly my heartache parted
And suddenly I felt at ease

You will love me all your life
As I will love you all of mine
That's the gift we give each other
That's the gift divine

Though memory moves us past each other
Though time is a ribbon without an end
Love's still the lesson we keep learning
And death, but a moment we must spendMemory come when memory's old
I am never the first to know
Following the stream up north
Where do people like us float

There is room in my lap
For bruises, asses, hand claps
I will never disappear
For forever I'll be here

Whispering 
Morning keep the streets empty for me
Morning keep the streets empty for me

I'm laying down eating snow
My fur is hot, my tongue is cold
On a bed of spider web
I think of how to change myself

A lot of hope in a one man tent
There's no room for innocence 
So take me home before the storm
Velvet moths will keep us warm

Whispering
Morning keep the streets empty for me 
Morning keep the streets empty for me

Whispering 
Morning keep the streets empty for me
Morning keep the streets empty for me

Uncover our heads and reveal our souls
We were hungry before we were born (x4)Memory of the insane
Of killing in so many ways, homicidal
Seeking redemption through rage
With hacksaws I decapitated them all

Blood covers the groud, my feet are saturated
Rotting flesh scattered around, I feel no remorse
I don't remember my name
Or when blood of the dead flowed so relentlessly

Extracting the brains from the skulls
My anger evolves with the more heads I deform
Sawing the neck, I am engulfed in fantasy
Chew the esophagus, cannibal delicacy

Utterly exacerbated, forever deleterious
Slicing through skin, sundered larynx, veins spraying blood
Tattered windpipe, facial carvings, another head to abhor
Beheading sustains my desire, enhancing my primitive mind
Annihilation without reprieving

Memory of the insane
Of killing in so many ways, homicidal
Seeking redemption through rage
With hacksaws I decapitated them at will

Predacious, violent killing spree
Abolished, putrescent cadavers
Butchered in excrement, sordid obscurity
Feverish hunger to inhale the stench of their deathMemory hide and seek

Look what you done to me
Shadowing shallowing
Yeah, the other sideMemory is fiction, so the past is your invention
Catch yourself, self-dissect, how youth outlives age
How beauty shames skill
Prayer is for dependents and wish is for the will
A struggle for independence, a harmless stage
Art gaining post-mortem fame

Oh Creatice!
Your vibrant portfolio has never shown as brightly
As your latest masterpiece
All efforts' fruition in such a wondrous offspring
How did you manage a piece so perfect?

Entrancing passers-by to lock eyes and gaze, hypnotized
Overcome with a need to outdo the last
A child born so dependent rebels so quickly once he has his footing
Forgets who and where raised him and how he came to be

But a growing pain cannot explain behavior of the like
A perfect child deserves the best
But at the cost of what else did you instill this need
To over-consume without regret?

Broken pencils, charred marble drafts
He leaves destruction in his path
Your one mistake, oh great Creatice
Was giving too large a brain

(This organ, like disease, can disseminate beyond your reach
You didn't predict this, a carnal rebellion in its wake)

Strike back with forces beyond his reach
That even six billion can't defeat
Go lock up the aggressor, quarantine before it's too late
Bred to lose sense of consequence
In his greed he exhausts your milk, your blood, your shelter...
Don't let him escape!

Memory is fiction, so the past is your invention
Catch yourself, self-dissect, how youth outlives age
How beauty shames skill
Prayer is for dependents and wish is for the will
A struggle for independence, a harmless stage
Art gaining post-mortem fame

Throw your blood upon his lands, your skin cracked and depleted
Suck the air out from his lungs, expose him fully, let him burn
Show him to appreciate, discipline the cruel ingrate
You still have the power to reshape - do not let this escalate

Vapors vanish in the night, statuesque guards seconds too late
What rebellion possessed thee?
A dangerous subterfuge, a lonely rampage, anxious fleet
Like limbs tumbling horizontally

Now it's too late - the child has escaped!
Indignant ties, parental constraints
A child protected sets self free
And the ingrate will lie in the bed he has made
As a self-imposed apocalypse finally sets You freeMemory is fiction, so the past is your invention
Catch yourself, self-dissect, how youth outlives age
How beauty shames skill
Prayer is for dependents and wish is for the will
A struggle for independence, a harmless stage
Art gaining post-mortem fame

Oh Creatice!
Your vibrant portfolio has never shown as brightly
As your latest masterpiece
All efforts' fruition in such a wondrous offspring
How did you manage a piece so perfect?

Entrancing passers-by to lock eyes and gaze, hypnotized
Overcome with a need to outdo the last
A child born so dependent rebels so quickly once he has his footing
Forgets who and where raised him and how he came to be

But a growing pain cannot explain behavior of the like
A perfect child deserves the best
But at the cost of what else did you instill this need
To over-consume without regret?

Broken pencils, charred marble drafts
He leaves destruction in his path
Your one mistake, oh great Creatice
Was giving too large a brain

(This organ, like disease, can disseminate beyond your reach
You didn't predict this, a carnal rebellion in its wake)

Strike back with forces beyond his reach
That even six billion can't defeat
Go lock up the aggressor, quarantine before it's too late
Bred to lose sense of consequence
In his greed he exhausts your milk, your blood, your shelter...
Don't let him escape!

Memory is fiction, so the past is your invention
Catch yourself, self-dissect, how youth outlives age
How beauty shames skill
Prayer is for dependents and wish is for the will
A struggle for independence, a harmless stage
Art gaining post-mortem fame

Throw your blood upon his lands, your skin cracked and depleted
Suck the air out from his lungs, expose him fully, let him burn
Show him to appreciate, discipline the cruel ingrate
You still have the power to reshape - do not let this escalate

Vapors vanish in the night, statuesque guards seconds too late
What rebellion possessed thee?
A dangerous subterfuge, a lonely rampage, anxious fleet
Like limbs tumbling horizontally

Now it's too late - the child has escaped!
Indignant ties, parental constraints
A child protected sets self free
And the ingrate will lie in the bed he has made
As a self-imposed apocalypse finally sets You freeMemory is fiction, so the past is your invention

It's back with the wind

Taking it in, no need to release,

I'll be back here again

Promise, keep the memory strong,

And I'll see you againMemory after memory runs through my mind,
you're still in every picture after all this time,
where will we go from here?
Still together after all these years…Memory after memory runs through my mind,
you're still in every picture after all this time,

Still together after all these years…Memory, your lamplight is burning holes
Recover the damage, bring it all home
Follow the bliss just like a summer song
Please stay there forever, I'll try to remember
Come home

Memory, you gave me another note
A voice that is endless, bring it on home
Oh what it is, feels like a summer song
I'll stay there forever, her face I remember

Presenting a new beginning, forever you and I
And when the morning gets lonely and life is out of sight
Then we'll be leaving together, you and I

Happiness, I'm sorry you've been on hold
The doors will be open, bring it all home
Cause what it is, feels like a summer song
I'll stay there forever, now that I remember

Presenting a new beginning, forever you and I
And when the morning gets lonely and life is out of sight
Then we'll be leaving together, you and I

For all these symbols don't open our eyes
We'll close them instead, leave the messenger behind
But one day we will know

Presenting a new beginning, forever you and I
And when the morning gets lonely and life is out of sight
Then we'll be leaving, then we'll be leaving

Presenting a new beginning, forever you and I
And when the morning gets lonely and life is out of sight
Then we'll be leaving together, you and I
Then we'll be leaving together, you and I
