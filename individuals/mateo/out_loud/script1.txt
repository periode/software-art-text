QUESTION:
I am trying to use a button switch in Arduino to trigger a visual display in Processing. I used "HIGH" and "LOW" to identify whether the button is pressed.
However, my code is constantly giving null instead of giving "HIGH" or "LOW" depending on the button state. I think this is pretty basic but I'm just quite lost. Any helps or comments would be appreciated!

According to the above logic, my understanding is that the loop will iterate for 99 times because of the range given, and if the remainder is zero for "i", then it should be appended on the list. Not sure where and why my logic is wrong.
