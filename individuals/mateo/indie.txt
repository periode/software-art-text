Just spent an 8 hour session with a stranger who was willing enough to show me the ropes
 From a basic camp, we managed to establish a good base of operations growing crops, setting up spider lairs, bee hives and beefulo herds
 Definitely appreciate players such as Hxgvamp to take the time to teach a noob what to expect in this new lore

Hop on first server I see
Pick Wilson
Greet new friends and ask what the plan is
Just starting to build camp and get set up
I notice the camp is in the middle of a big forest
I point this out and helpfully comment on how wrong things go if a fire got out of control
 "Perhaps we should relocate for the sake of safety
""Lol don't be such a baby, make your own camp if you dont like it
""Fine I will make my own camp
 with Blackjack and Hookers
 and It'll be better
"Proceed to make own camp with afformentioned Blackjack and Hookers
Few days pass
Come back home after a hard days foraging to find all my Items have been nicked
I am now royally screwed, all my materials, tools ect
 gone
I know it was them
An evil plan for revenge hatches in my mind
 Wait till night time
 sneak over to other camp with torch in hand
Thefoolssuspectnothing
jpgThey still havent removed most of the trees around their camp
Set fire to one tree
Next tree catches fire
Whole forest ablaze in a matter seconds
They all either burn to death or are torn apart by the beasts in the dark as they flee in panic
Retrieve stolen items and also pillage corpses
I am now the king of this world and none can oppose me
Feels good man
Bask in my victory for a while
"Server connection timed out"And thus was the downfall of King Wilson the terrible

UPDATE: This review is severially outdated and it will not be correct
 Sorry for this inconvience
When I first got my key, I got really exicted, To the point where I've gotten over 400+ Days on a world w/ my friends
 Here are some of the basic things you should keep in mind about while playing with your friends
Starting off:Once you start off you have 3 choices or gamemodes to play with your friends, Survival, Wilderness and EndlessSurvival: Basically same twist as if you payed endless just if everyone on the server is Dead, a counter goes down for someone to join (That is alive) or the whole world gets reset with the same generation presets
Wilderness:
When you join the server you spawn in a random location (Sometimes an island if your unlucky) and you need to find your group to set up camp
 Once you die or have died you are taken to the change character screen and respawn in a new location with your camera rotated in a different pos and if you look on your map there will be a small circle on where you've last died
 Keep in mind you die again that Circle updates to where you last died so try to get back to your stuff without dying
Endless: Ah, my favorite of all the gamemodes
 When you join the server you spawn in from a "Jury-Rigged Portal" And begin surviving
 If you die you become a ghost with the character traits of your character
 You can respawn if you haunt one of the following
 (Meat Effigy, Life giving amulet, Touch stone, Jury rigged portal and Tale-Tell heart) If you respawn from the "Jury-Rigged Portal or Tale-Tell heart" You will lose around 20 MAX Health Points
 You can get those lost hit points back from getting a booster shot which requires 3 Papyrus, 2 Healing Salves and 1 Stinger (YES STINGERS FINALLY HAVE A USE)Once you join the server (Depending on the size / max amount of players) You basically play regular Don't Starve, If join a larger server with more people there's a silm chance that you will be able to survive the up coming winter or Night
 Which can be difficult depending if PVP is on or not
 And Since armor has now been changed to take Less damage i
e Wood Armor = 80% (Reg ds) 60% (Dst) Marble = 95% (Reg Ds) 80% (Dst) Football helm = 80% (Reg dst) 60% (Dst)
Characters -Wilson:Pros -Grows a beardCons - None
Wilson is a character that i'm pretty sure everyone is going to see ALOT of since he's the first character and Really has no Downfalls even though it takes 19 days for Wilson to get his Homeless man beard it will protect you in winter
Willow:Pros -Doesn't Take fire damageStarts with a lighter (Infinte torch)Cons -When on low sanity Will cause lots of forest firesCan Grief other players Flamable walls / Crops
Willow is a good character for surviving the Winter and helping out your friends in DST
 But she can be used to be the most annoying person in the entire server
 She can run around starting massive forest fires and buring down vauable resources as well as causing LOTS of lag
Wolfgang:Pros -Gets stronger on a full stomachHas more hpCons - 1
5x the faster Hunger drain at full stomachMoves and deals less damage at a smaller stomachLoses more sanity in Night / AfternoonAh, Wolfgang more of a fighter than a gardener
 Wolfgang can be useful for tanking spiders nest and killing of those annoying Tall birds and getting there eggs the only downfall is If you have a lot of food toghether It's not going to last very long amongest 6 Players, If you are playing as wolf gang only "Power up" to full stomach when in need
 Don't just waste food to be a full stomache because food WILL be eaten fast
Wendy:Pros -Has a ghost sisterDoesn't lose much sanity in darkCons -Does -
25% Less damage than all charactersLoses 50 Sanity when spawning abigail inWendy is one of my personal favorite characters just to add a little challange to the game
 Even though she doesn't hit hard she losses NO Sanity in the Afternoon
 As well she can spawn her sister in after 2 - 4 Days by killing ANY Animal / Creature Near the flower
 She will lose 50 sanity for spawning he in even if another player kills something near the flower
 But the fun part is Abigail does Splash damage to mobs near her
 If you need to fight something send abigail (or your friends) to kill it
 If abilgail dies go pick her flower up, If you can't find it theres a minimap icon for it
WX78:Pros - Can eat ANY Food that is spoiled /
Stale and take no penalty
Can be charged by lightningCan eat gears to level up (Max 400 hp, 200 Hunger, 300 Sanity) Also gears give health, hunger and sanity back if eaten
Cons -Takes Damage in the rainStarts with low stats (100 hp, 100 hunger, 100 Sanity)WX78 Is a good character if you can get to a supply of gears fast as well your going to need to hunt down a pig village for an umbrella
 If you don't get an umbrealla right off the bat you will loss 0
25 of 1 Hp every 3 - 5 Seconds
 If your lucky enough and you make an umbrealla you won't have the chance of being struck by lightning which will cause you too lose 33 Sanity but Not freeze during winter and can glow like a torch the effect only lasts for one day so don't be adventuring in the middle of the night if the Radius of light is shrinking
 But can be benifical if you use if effectively
Wickerbottom:Pro -Starts off with all science machine reciepes unlocked
Able to craft her own booksStarts off with 2 Papyrus
Cons -Can't SleepTakes more penalty for eating Spoiled or Stale foodWickerbottom, The walking science machine, You can pretty much help your friends by going right to an achlemy engine instead of wasting the time of making an Science machine
 Even though you can't Sleep there are multiple ways of getting your sanity back up
 With the abiliy to make your own books
you have the power to instantly grow all crows and Plants, Spawn lots of birds and more for the cost of your sanity
 And yes I know this sounds like wickerbottom is a bad character, as long as you know how to get sanity back without murdering the flower population
The Rest of the characters have no been added while writing this review
Over all this is a great game and I recommend it to any and all players
EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED DON'T STARVE TO PLAY THIS YOU JUST NEED A DON'T STARVE TOGHETHER KEY
 PLEASE STOP ADDING ME

This is the one thing this game was missing, multiplayer
 And it is extremely well done
You can host your server from the game without the need for port forwarding, downloading extra server files etc
The way the servers handle mods is also great, if the server has a special server mod it is automatically transfered to your client (this is unnoticable), with the exception of some client side mods (UI related and such)
All in all, if you love Don't Starve, you MUST get this expansion
Even if you don't have friends, you can play on public servers, the community is great out there

 I gave the extra copy to one of my friends already so please stop adding and asking if I can give you the extra copy
 (I write this only because I have recieved multiple friend requests from people who saw this review asking me if i could give them the extra copy)

Nothing is more satisfying than minding your own business (be it cooking or mining) and having your friend start screaming over Skype and have a death message pop up at the top of your screen

An interesting new twist on the original Don't Starve, it now proves to be quite a challenge
New features include: -Twice as many mouths to feed-People who eat their scarce rations without first cooking it-People who sit at home base and squawk for food like a baby bird to its mother-People who don't wear armour expecting to dodge every attack like an anime character-The ghosts of said people, draining everybody's sanity both in-game and real life-Terribly organised bases-Terribly organised chests-Stuff thrown everywhere by people who just plain despise organisation-People who draw treeguards into our designated tree farm-People who try to tank hounds-People who try to tank tentacles-People who try to tank ANYTHING-People who wander off and then scream when they get lost-People who wander off because they saw a "Truffala tree" (I'm looking at you, Jonah)-Twice the map sizes-Twice the treeguards-Twice the hounds-Twice the spiders-And most importantly, twice the starving to deathAnd I loved every single minute of it

Nov Edit: If you have the aptitude to learn about the game and make things work, yes you should buy the game
 The pace is now smoother(slower
) and the research tree deeper, which adds both the ease to learn early on and the difficulty to progress later
 Beyond the efforts of survival, the end goals are one's own
 See how many cycles you last
 Wish to have the best things for your suplicants
 or do it again, better this time
All these reviews with less than 10 hours on record, telling you the game is uninteresting
 What puts people off, I assume, is the mid-game
 Starting and setting up base is the fun part but is hardly a challenge, which is why most people enjoy it
 The mid-game, presently, is where the base needs planning and strict management to survive - where everything starts to fall down a spiral, probably which is where people have a falling out
 The difficulty spikes during this mid period, where resources, tasks and dupes need to be managed if you wish to go on further - where it becomes a niche genre - some people love it, some don't
 After this difficult and rather annoying period, the game becomes a bit of a sandbox and you can let your creativity flourish, with advanced machineries and systems
 Bases evolve to their final form, mostly sustaining themselves and an easier relaxed life for your dupes
 I love the game, and honestly, if my life allowed it, i'd play it a lot more
 The ai is a tad wonky but perhaps, going out of early access will fix it
Edit: I play on windows ' bootcamp' on macbook 2013 retina; as of the last fix the fps,for me, has improved
Edit: Here is a good guide

Another awesome game by Klei (Creator of Don't Starve, Mark of the Ninja)
For those who like base building simulation, this definitely worth a try
Be aware that it is still in early access state, so the content is not final and have bug/performance issue in some cases
But looking at Klei's history, I can assure you that you won't be disappointed
It's a space colony game where you break & build stuff
Mainly you have to deal with gas, food, temperature, and stress
You aren't controling the character (dupe) directly, instead they are control by AI and you are just giving them a list of orders/job that they have to do/complete
For more info about what this game is about, it's better if you read the game description and see some screenshots or gameplay video
Below are my thoughts about the game
Pros:+ Worth the price
 Already offers lots of contents to play (for Early Access)
+ They have plan and roadmap for future update
Their target for new update is every 4-6weeks (bug & balancing patch in between)
+ Very active Developers & Community+ Can be played casually, hardcore or tryhard mode
+ Awesome Sound & Art
+ Can improve your chemistry grade (maybe, or perhaps make it worst
)
Cons:- I can't take back my 200 hours
This game is so addictive, it's like crack
 Probably illegal in some country, be careful
<<<Spoiler Warning>>>STOP reading here if you don't want to get spoiled
Tips for New Player:1
 Nobody like sleeping with snooring people, so avoid those loud sleeper (negative trait), except they got awesome stat & you know what you are doing
2
 Watch their expected decor, try to get the lowest decor when you start picking your first 3 dupes
3
 Learning, Digging, and Construction are pretty useful for early game
 Another good attribute to consider are Athletics (they move faster, can easily be trained but still useful if they are high from the start) & Strength (currently you can't train this, so definitely has its own value)4
 Stress Response
 Try to avoid Binge Eater if you still learning and you know you won't do well
5
 Start digging (shortcut G), get those sandstone, algae & copper (metal)
6
 At early in the game, you might think you have enough algae
 But NO, you don't
7
 The first thing you need to build is restroom (Outhouse), your dupes need a place to pee and poop
 or they will make a mess
8
 Build Research Station ASAP (research farming first)
 It need to be connected with electricity, so enjoy looking at your dupes running on the hamster wheel9
 Dupes breath oxygen in and emit Carbon Dioxide (they can fart too)
 O2 are light blue & a bit transparant, CO2 are black
 CO2 can stack up pretty fast, be careful with it
 They are heavier than O2, so they will fall at the bottom of your colony/base
 (they also tend to go right)10
 Oxylite produce oxygen, try to open area that have them (you don't need to dig them)
11
 Watch for warning notification, dupes are not the smartest creature in the asteroid, sometime they can kill themselves in the most unpredictable (stupid) scenario
12
 Exploring is good, but be careful not to expand too much or open a big vacuum area when your oxygen production is still low
13
 There is Priority Tools in the bottom right panel
 1 lowest, 9 highest (avoid using 9 for all your job order, setting all to 9 means no 9)
 You should probably check the other tools too, and overlay (top right)
 They are useful
14
 Hatch & puff are useful
 Rule of thumbs, just don't kill any creature before you actually know what they do (good or bad)
15
 Taking new dupe is okay, but be very careful with your oxygen & food supply
16
 You might think mealwood will be your stable food supply
 But NO, it is not17
 Don't freak out with unfriendly/toxic gases, but you should start worrying when they are getting out of control
18
 Electrolizer spit out lots of oxygen but they also spitting out hydrogen
 (they are lighter than O2, so they'll go upward)19
 Some resource are more scarce than the other, be very careful
 Some example: Algae, clean water, and metal (copper, gold) at early game
 Sands and coal at mid-late game
20
 #DupesLivesMatter, remember to take care of your dupe
 When stress hit you hard, it will be a snowball effect and your colony is doom before you realize it21
 Watch your decor, some building have bad decor and it is bad for your dupes
 (use decor overlay)22
 Watch your building temperature, some building emits heat and can be overheated (break & need repair, cost time & resource
 again, use overlay to check)23
 Watch your own necessity, like dupe, your life matter too
 You need food, drink, and sleep

Early Access Review
This is a 50/50 for me
I've enjoyed it, at the same time as I have felt "What's the point
" in true Marvin voice
Rimworld is a title I have played a lot of before - and it had a purpose
Oxygen not included does not, it's just: "Dig, Manage Gas, dig
 Manage water
"It's not really the same category as Rimworld anymore, but rather a manage-the-same-stuff-repeatedly
I've followed it from early start, and I still feel like there's not much purpose being added
Only odd things and more "things" to manage, which others might enjoy endlessly - but I feel a bit "meh" about it
I'm hoping for it to take a turn and start getting some more flesh on those bones at some point
I'll edit this comment whenever that build happens, if it ever happens
-So end result of this
I recomend it to those who enjoy managing things without a purpose beyond "You will die if you don't
"If you're like me and want a carrot at the end, you might find yourself in a "meh" state after you've tried all the gadgets possible to build
It's also a tad too complicated for me personally with HOW to handle Gas / Liquid etc, which I am sure others may find more engaging and hence may be their carrot
So if you enjoy fiddling, get this - if you're like me, wait and see
//Mamabear---------A lot of people seem unable to understand the review
 It is personal opinion, even if YOU love the game 100% and see no faults in it - doesn't mean others feel the same
 I pointed out the flaws I personally found having played a lot of simulation games and similar titles
 I also waited with making a review in the first place until I had spent sufficient amount of time in it, AND waited for a few updates
 All updates so far has added random things to manage, but it doesn't change the fact that you easily feel a lack of purpose for doing said tasks
 As I stated clearly in the review, some may like this type of simulation game - but some of us don't
 It is comparable to rimworld and others, which is what anyone will compare it to
 - I also clearly stated that in it's CURRENT form it feels incomplete and not something I recommend UNLESS you enjoy repetitive things without an end goal
 A lot of people seem to miss this or ignore it simply cause I am giving it a negative review
 No, I have nothing against hard games - if they are hard to -complete-, here it feels like a no end
 I hope people can start reading the entire reviews and think for a few minutes before hitting that comment button, cause I am clearly stating that some can enjoy it in the state it is at - but also pointing out the missing bits for anyone, like me, that may want to hold off buying it until it has more solid content
Thank you for reading it all

Early Access Review
i've been a bit torn about this, but ive decided to give it a thumbs down atm
The game starts out being a blast, learning about managing gasses/liquids, figuring out how to
build your first electrolyzer system, seeking out various gysers, ect, but the game feels a bit repetative, and i feel a bit lost about what i should do when im stable
 (once i built a system where i take advantage of outer areas of the map to produce steam, i kinda didnt have such a need to expand, due to effective hydrogen generator set ups and coal generators)
 anyway, i think the game needs some kind of goal, and perhaps some kind of event system such as rimworld (or something to spice things up between managing things)anyway, hope i helped

Early Access Review
Yep, this is a good game
 It's not finished yet, for sure, but the basics are in place to make for a very nice base-builder
 The thing to keep in mind is that this is not Factorio (which I've played, from GOG) neither Rimworld (which I haven't)
 In OnI the focus is on building systems to generate resources that your dupes need to survive until your colony can reach a critical mass that allows it to go on indefinitely
 Not that I've achieved this, mind, but it's obvious that there are some "loops" that you can exploit to create a self-sustaining economy of sorts
 For example, you can build a hydrogen generator that consumes hydrogen and produces energy
 You can get hydrogen from Electrolyzers that also generate oxygen and consume energy and water
 You can get water from Liquid Pumps that also need energy
 The trick is to find the balance between consuming and generating enough energy to keep a generator, a few Electrolyzers and a couple of pumps going just on their own [Edit: oops
 You also need a gas pump and a gas filter to separate the hydrogen and the oxygen, and those also consume energy
 You can power them pretty comfortably with the Hydrogen Generator however]
 Or, a very simple loop is to start with a pump, feed its output to a couple of Lavatories or Showers clean the polluted water they output through a Water Purifier and output it where it will be pumped by the Liquid Pump, starting the loop all over again
 It's even possible to connect one purifier to one shower and keep the loop closed and going without input from a pump
 (If those loops remind you more of OOP design patterns, oh my god, no
 This is actually fun
 But, yeah, otherwise, the idea is to come up with little functional units that you can then replicate as needed, I guess
)The point of building such loops of course is to keep your dupes alive and for this you need to manage three resources: oxygen, food and their stress
 Failing to plan ahead and manage these resources well can send the entire colony in a tailspin and cause your dupes to start dying out pretty quickly
For example, my latest colony, "Death Trainwreck" (autogenerated names are all optimistic like that) started falling apart when Bubbles, one of my dupes who has the "Binge Eater" stress response trait went crazy for the lack of clean air and proper temperature and started eating all of the available food
 Pretty soon she had eaten mroe than 30k calories
That left very few for the rest of the colony (I suspect that was actually a bug- I think she should have stopped earlier) and then my dupes started dying out because they had nothing to eat
 Game over, man
 So, like I say, all this takes a lot of careful planning and careful resource management
 Thankfully, you get a very detailed control system where you can assign each dupe to any number of different jobs and can also set a priority level for each job
 This way you can even sort of "program" the dupes, by giving a high priority to the jobs that need to be finished first and a lower one to the jobs that depend on the others; say, give a priority of 9 to digging a pit and a priority of 8 to building up the system to fill it with water (or rather, CO2, you generally don't need to move a lot of water around, although it can happen)
 The information you get from the game about the dupes' vitals, the energy your buildings generate or consume, the available oxygen, temperature etc etc is not for the faint hearted either
 The available food is listed down to the kcal, power is listed in Watts, and so on
 This makes it a little harder to eyball the amount of enegy you have, say, or immediately figure out how much you need to heat the colony but there is a certain kind of player that will find this level of detail infinitely satisfying
 More importantly, it provides the precision you need to create the kind of system you want- the limit is your own imagination
 This is something rarely seen in games and makes OnI a unique experience
 (On the other hand, this level of detail can probably put some people off too)
Of course, this being an Early Access game there's a lot of things missing
 For one thing, there are very few options to reduce your dupes' stress
 Some decorations, a massage table and that's it basically
 There's also probably many more buildings that could be added - for instance, something to farm the (currently, only few) animals in the game
 Or, more animals for that matter
This is not a finished game at this point, but if you like resource management and engine-building, you probably want to give this a try, keeping in mind that its price may be a little bit on the steep side for its current state
 Then again, you're also buying a promise of future content and if Klei is still the same company that made Don't Starve, I think we can expect a lot of that
I recommend it _IFF_ you don't mind the fact that it's still unfinished
Otherwise, wait for a year or so

This is easily one of my favourite games, and it isn't for some people, I respect that
 But I see a lot of red reviews from people who are just plain BAD, so I thought I'd try this opinion thing
 Oxygen Not Included (ONI) appears to be a fun, light, happy little game
But it really isn't
 It is clever, difficult, and will punish your mistakes like an ex girlfriend -- quietly and of many magnitudes higher than the original offence
While not always textbook, ONI really takes its science to heart, rewarding players for considering physics, conservation of mass, specific heat capacity, density, etc
 Consider this simple scenario:
Build thing thing needs power, build generator Build battery in basement Battery holds energy electricity -> emits heat Heat rises Base begins to warm Heat builds, plants die, duplicants begin to stress Out of desperation seal betteries in insulated room Base is saved, battery room begins to boil, batteries start to fail ohdamn
jpg Get idea, build air pump Pump hot air from battery room away from base Room cools, but batteries cant disperse heat in a vacuum Batteries break, no power storage, rolling brown outs in base, systems failing, stress mounting Such is life in the rock And lastly, anybody reading about OMG OUTBREAK BROKE MAH GAME:The germs in the game behave like germs, they multiply and spread
 Stop charging into a biohazard zone until you have the resources to handle the diseases it exposes you to
 Things like wash basins, ore scrubbers, air filters, air locks, etc
Pace yourself, think ahead, SURVIVE

> A lot of people are hating me for the review so I'm just making this clear
 THIS IS NOT A BAD GAME
 I said not recommended because there's a lot stuff that needs fixing and I don't want you guys to hate the game because of its current state as this definitely is going to be a masterpiece
This game has turned into a unplayable piece of crap after the new Outbreak update
 There is no way to prevent the germs from spreading after a certain amount of time
 The duplicants now keep stressing for no reason at all
 I played a few games and realised that they were stressed more than 50% in about 15 cycles and once that happens, all hell breaks lose
 They don't care what the need to do, or what you want them to do

Hi,Im an older gamer almost 40 actually
I play games to keep my mind healthy
I like a challenge, something that makes me thing, and something I can play at my own pace
Call of duty is not my thing, nor is dota, starcraft or minecraft
I like factorio, total war games, anno
So I had this game reccomended to me
 I went in blind, and boy do I love it
 It has charm, it's difficult, but not too much
It keeps you on your toes, you WILL restart, many times
I cant see anyone who likes managment games not liking this
Its just done so well
I could probly play this game forever
We'll see
New update coming out soon with oil, adds a lot of new stuff
its not going to cost me anything
Thats pretty great
If it had a little more stoey to it I'd say 10/10for now 9/10

Product received for free
Hand of Fate 2 is a real sequel, with massive improvements, but no drastic changes to the core gameplay (which is good)
If you liked the 1st one, you will definitely like this one even more
-Combat gameplay improved but can get repetitive
 -More gambits (Dice, precision, spin wheel) apart from the Chance cards-Companions, challenges, different ways to play each timeGreat game overall 
 I'm really looking forward to playing Endless mode (to be released soon, but there is already PLENTY to do at the moment)
PS : Luck is still a very important factor to win
 It is a double edged sword
 Sometimes it will make you go insane, but it can also be a great weight off your shoulders
Posted: 8 November
If you enjoyed Hand of Fate you'll enjoy Hand of Fate 2
 It's as simple as that
The good:Combat is a fair amount smoother which was a larger issue in the first game
New mechanics - New card mechanics such as the wheel of fate and dice rolls are a welcome addition, having just the "pick a card" got boring very fast in the first game
Enemy diversity - New enemy types that require their own personal touch to defeat, helps keep you on your toes and makes combat interesting throughout
Challenge diversity - Challenges feel unique with their own encounters and objectives, no more are you just rushing to the exit
Food has been tweaked
 You now only starve if you encounter an unrevealed card with no food
 No more are your runs ended because you took path A and don't have enough food to backtrack
Camping - You can camp before moving allowing you to trade with a minor NPC and consume food without moving
Fame - Certain stronger equipment require fame to use, fame is gained by completing encounters
 Some people will complain about the fame mechanic but I like it, it adds some balance to the stronger equipment you can get and forces you to try out other pieces you otherwise wouldn't touch
The bad:Some nasty FPS drops during the encounter transition phase, not experiencing it anywhere else in the game
Companion AI is pretty terrible, I've been using Colt or whatever his name is and every combat he's swinging at dead enemies while I'm surrounded by the other six
Posted: 7 November
General thoughts:Exactly what I wanted
 Similar to the first game but does enough different to make it feel like a new game
 A lot of the systems have been improved upon and I'm enjoying some of the new mechanics
If you liked the first hand of fate then I fully recommed you buy the game
 They updated some of the features in the last game and improved them for example the combat which some people didn't like in the first game
The Levels:Unlike the first game where all the levels were pretty similar in this one they are very different
 On each level you have a mission to achieve as well as an optional objective to get a gold clear on that level such as getting every relic, keeping potato boy alive or rescuing a certain amount of people in a level
 The levels are really fun and are different to each other and by getting gold clears on levels you unlock additional cards
Weapon systems:The new weapon systems make the combat a lot better
 Unlike the first game where you went for the best damage you have weapons that counter specific enemy types such as dual wield weapons against thieves and heavier weapons against armoured opponents
Companions:The companion that you choose on the card selection will follow you into combat as well as give you skills
 The first companion you get will give you a Force Shield around you that blocks a hit if you use the companion skill button
 They also help out in the board section of the game such as giving you an additional dice if you mess up or allowing you to have a retry on the card wheel
 I found them to be very fun and helps swing the RNG in your favour
Last thoughts:So far everything is just a better Hand of Fate 1 which is what I wanted
 It sticks to the original theme but implements new systems and I'm sure there are more to find as I get further into the game
The game runs very well for me on Ultra and I haven't bumped into any bugs/glitches except for a little fps drop on combat sometimes

Is HoF2 perfect
 No
Is it a vast improvement from HoF
 Yes
Is it FUN
 Heck yes
Honestly, I tend to be very weary of sequels; especially when they're sequels for games I adore
 Hand of Fate is already a great game, so I was both excited and cautious when 2 was going to be different from what I already knew
 Well, turns out it was different in mostly -good- ways
HoF2 is definitely more story-driven than the first, and even when you pull your random encounter cards, it doesn't derail the story that's currently happening
 Rather, it just adds another layer to the story being told in that particular campaign, I think
 There's also the addition of companions and their stories, which was a nice touch, I'm glad they got stories instead of just being 'cards' played in battle
The new chance mechanics are interesting, I actually really like the dice and card wheel as additions
 The pendulum has a weird reaction time (more on reaction times in a bit), but it isn't a deal breaker
 The addition of Fame and its requirements to use certain equipment is pretty cool, too
 There's also a lot of entirely new encounters that add a new level to the gameplay, rather than the regular success/failure mechanic in HoF
Of course the Dealer is back and as sassy as ever, along with some other familiar faces
 I'm also liking that we can customise our player, even if it's as basic as skin tone, hair/hair colour and armour pattern
However it's not all good news, the battles feel a little too unresponsive and 'loose', I prefered the battles in HoF by far
 As I said earlier, the reaction times are pretty off
 I have a really hard time dodging and parrying because I'm constantly 'missing' the prompts
 Again, the pendulum chance suffers the same problem
 If you're expecting tight action controls, unfortunately, you won't find them here as of this review
 (Hopefully they'll be fixed up soon
)Probably the MOST annoying thing however is the little 'warp' cutscene that happens when you enter and exit battles
 They're far too bright and too flashy/busy, so if you're sensitive to bright lights and effects, it's something to keep in mind
 And as of right now there's no Endless Mode (although hardly an issue, there's PLENTY of story content to work through
)
But overall, if you enjoyed Hand of Fate, it's definitely worth picking up
 It's not perfect but it's FUN and you can tell that a lot of love and dedication has gone into making it

Definitely an improvement over the first game
- Combat feels more challenging because it's quicker- More gambling options like Dices- Great environmentThe only thing I'm missing is 21:9 Ultrawide support
	21:9 support since first update
I can only recommend this game, especially to the ones who l oved the first one
Great work Defiant

Ok, so I will give you guys the run down of what I thought of the game; Though I have not played the first game
- Battles: The battles I found to be pretty easy most of the time
- Story: From what i have seen the story is quite enjoyable
- Characters: many of the companions are fun to have around
- RNG: 
I am almost positive the dude gave me loaded dice
- Graphics: HAHAHAHAHA
 I Wouldn't know if it did or not
 I play on the graphic setting of the lowest of the low
ok for those of you that would like some elaboration, I will do that down below
the Battles: [8/10]When I first Bought the game, I went through the reviews and thought "oh god no
" but after launching the game I found that the battles were almost laughably easy
After the first chapter though things got a bit harder
 now we had a SECOND type of attack to watch out for
 OH NO
When a Green Light pops above anyones head, Mearly block and then just spam attack
If it is a Red Light dodge in any direction and then spam attack
Or you know, you could just dodge every type of attack and spam attack
At the start of the third episode, they start adding More types of enemies which make it slightly difficult at worst
Story: [6/10]Ok, so I did not play the first game
 so i'm not entirely sure of the story but I feel like I picked up most of the backstory
I can't say i'm deeply involved in the story
 It's OK
 Not award winning from what I have seen but it is enjoyable
Characters: [7/10]- First, the Main Character
 Your MC is the typical Blank slate of this Genre
 he/she has some slight customablity
 unless
you choose to be a girl, then it's either: shaved head, mohawk, mohawk with Braids, or mohawk with short pony tail
- The Companions from what I have seen are useful and make the game more enjoyable
 when you enter a battle they make remarks that make them feel more alive and made me laugh a few times
thier skills are useful in battle and on the tabletop
- The wizard is that friend who makes D&D great adding extra info and funny quips every now and again
 he will also do his best to kill you
 you have been warned
THE RNG:
(Roll the dice, if you roll higher than an 11, you recieve [8/10] if not [5/10]-RNG is a thing where you forget your good luck and nurture your memories of bad luck
 If i was to be a fair and impartial observer, I would say the game's RNG is well done
though im not
ITS RIGGED
-the encounters that are not combat related are probably the things that kill me the most in the game
[#/#]My Computer is from the dark ages
 It cannot run most games on anything above low graphic settings
 Playing this game on low graphics, I have not had a problem with anything
I would rate [8/10]A solid good game

0/10Bad news first: I've taken off 1 point from a perfect score because of slight flaws
 Although the combat was generally improved, the targeting and camera controls can sometimes still feel a bit unresponsive
 Also, the Dealer seemed to be a stronger character when he was purely your adversary; it's slightly less fun to hate him now that he's technically on your side as your trainer
 But don't worry; unlike what Rock Paper Shotgun's review claims, he's still ultimately the same character you know and love (to hate)
Even with these flaws, Hand of Fate 2 remains only 1 point away from a perfect score, simply because it's so fantastic overall
 It improves upon its already-excellent predecessor in every way it possibly could
 It is more streamlined and elegant, yet simultaneously more diverse and replayable
 I won’t elaborate on its mechanics, as there are many other reviews which explore them in detail, but suffice it to say that at only 5 hours in, I feel safe in my prediction that this game will eventually be recognized as one of the best roguelites of all time, and quite possibly the single best digital board game ever created
Not convinced yet
 Why, is “one of best roguelites of all time, and quite possibly the single best digital board game ever created” not good enough for you
 Then allow me to persuade you further by contrasting this game with the general state of the AAA gaming industry in late 2017:“In Call of Duty: WW2, loot boxes drop from the sky onto Normandy beach and open in front of other players”That is a real headline from Eurogamer
 It is referencing a $60 game, which constantly tempts you to spend yet more of your money in exchange for dropping you some loot boxes out of the sky onto Normandy beach, so you can open them in front of other players, and show them what absolutely-worthless piles of digital feces you got for indulging your possibly-very-real gambling addiction in the hopes of getting slightly-less-worthless piles of digital feces
 Everyone runs around Normandy beach and watches everyone gambling with crates of digital feces, in a manner that I might honestly say is not all THAT tasteless, were I for some reason to completely ignore the fact that it actually exists, as well as any and all of its discernable attributes
Hand of Fate is half the price of CoD:WW2, not even including the loot boxes
 They will soon be releasing an Endless Mode DLC, which will be well worth their asking price of absolutely nothing
 You get an Endless Mode, you get an Endless Mode, all of you get an Endless Mode, because you were smart enough to support the developers that actually think of their customers and community members not as whales, dolphins, and minnows, but as ACTUAL, SENTIENT, HUMAN F***ING BEINGS
TL;DR: Boycott loot boxes
 Buy the best digital board game in the history of video games

Here we are, a sequel to hand of fate and herein lies the rub
 I'm not going to review the entire game, but I am going to pickup on what seems to be the commonly stated problem of the game, the combat
So why all the negative reviews over the combat
 Simple, it's a change from the first one and it's not a carbon copy of the batman arkham games
 Enemies cannot be stun locked into submission anymore and you can't fly half way across the arena to hit someone
 For people coming to this game from the original, it is going to be a jarring experience and I daresay that has led to the acidic response of some people
 But I honestly like it
 Combat is now more methodical and rewards knowing your opponents and been able to second guess their attacks
 Also there are more responses to attacks now, rather than 'attack' 'dodge' and 'stun/guard break'
 The game rewards swapping weapons out and tailoring your loadout to your opponent
 If you liked the first hand of fate and can deal with a change to the combat mechanics, then this is a game you will enjoy

Pros for HoF1 fans:-Same voice actor for the dealer (aw yis)-Holy cheese though, look at him-That poor hooded man-Get him some skin lotion-We did this-More of the same HoF1 formula-Improved combat system-Companions (they're not bad
)-Compelling plot-The soundtrack is everything you would hope it would be-Defiant is still doing their thingPros for everyone else:-Roguelike card game hack and slash roleplaying game with resource management-Play through your own character's story through cards representing events and fate-Fighting is entirely skill based-Certain encounters require luck (dice minigames, picking the 1 success card out of a shuffled hand of 4 that you can track with your eyes reliably with practice, etc
)-Complete game for $30, free endless mode coming (which will be amazing, if the first game is any indication)-Developer is known for consistently delivering quality product, and fixing bugs and offering free DLC when possible (in the first game, 1 DLC required money, the other 4 or 5 were free, and all had a good deal of content)-Gentle learning curve that gives plenty of chances to relearn important information (like special attacks
And finishers
)-Playing first game is not required, but highly recommended-Intuitive gameplay, despite the massive amount of information to process, which is actually pretty impressive
-Beautiful soundtrack and flawless voice acting-Trustworthy developerCons:-Honestly, if you liked the first one, you'll like this one
-The loading screen tends to scorch my eyes with the pure whiteness of it
-Seriously, imagine a sudden bright flash of light, followed by enemies swarming in trying to kill you-Oh, hey, Defiant made their load screen a flashbang-Game took too long to release-idk man, this game is pretty close to perfection so far, though I'm only an hour in at the time of reviewing
Overall: Hokay, so
If you haven't played the first game, you should
This game is basically the same as the first, only better
If you have played the first game, that should be enough to sell you
For those of you who sorta stumbled onto this in the new releases section, here's what you're looking at
You look at a map
There are areas you can explore
Each area has a storyline and quests and so on
You go to an area, and the dealer sets up the area's board, which has lots of face down cards
You control your miniature, which then moves from face-down card to face-down card, turning each one over and resolving the encounters they represent as you move
One face down card might contain a shop where you buy supplies
One face down card might have a thief, who takes some of your gold, and you must chase him to get it back
Maybe you come across peasants fending off highwaymen, and you decide which side to help, if any
Depending on your choices you may have to face a chance-based minigame, such as rolling three dice and trying to get at least 12 on them all combined across 2 rolls
Or picking from 4 face down cards, and finding the one "success" card rather than the 3 "failure cards"
Sometimes there's combat
Then you zoom in, and your miniature comes to life, and suddenly you have to use it to fight off the enemies
 Sometimes you have allies
Eventually you also get companions who help as well
Your equipment is gained through shops and rewards from encounters, and is also visually represented as cards showing stats like defensive or offensive power, and special attributes
Some types of weapons are better against some types of enemies
It's very involved, but very intuitive for how much there is to process, and Defiant did a fantastic job streamlining things to be more intuitive than the first game
You also have three resources: Health, Food, and Gold
You use a food each time you move to a new encounter (but not for retracing your steps over old encounters), and moving with no food results in losing health each step
Health, if it reaches zero, kills you
Duh
And gold is used for shops
Many encounters interact with your resources in some way, such as villagers giving you food for saving them from bandits, or a nobleman paying you to save him instead of the commoners
That's just the surface level view, though, and the gameplay is very deep and takes a lot of effort to really master
There's enough new in this version that I'm relearning a lot
But the first game was fantastic, and this one lives up to the legacy
So I really recommend you give it a shot if you're at all interested
This game hit all the right notes with me when I was burned out on just about everything
As an aside, Defiant really deserves a shout out for going above and beyond to make quality products and to respect the money their customers are paying for their games
I have yet to encounter any bugs
But if I do, I know with a good deal of confidence that they'll have it patched within a month, because that's the type of developer they are
They deserve your money, and they'll earn every penny
Bottom Line: Easy Recommend
Posted: 8 November
It's even better than the first game, which was already an amazing game
 The only thing this game needs is some quality of life updates, such as right click to back out, left click anywhere on the screen to advance text, A-D keys to scroll through cards, skippable pre-combat animations, etc
 The devs already said we could expect some QOL updates after the first few weeks, so there is no reason not to buy the game right now

Remember, when you were a kid, and you got sick
 You got to skip school and stay in bed watching cartoons all day
 But in the evening your sickness got worse
 You had a fever, and when you fell asleep, these cartoons came back to torment you in colorful surreal nightmares
This game is exactly what you saw that night

THIS is how you make a videogame
-Great price for the content it offers-No problems on day 1 for pc users-No stupid season pass or preorder bonus-Great cure for detail and only a few occasional glitchesI tought the best 2D game i played this year was Hollow Knight, but this holds up for a GOTY
Edit : Finally finished the game, took me about 9-10 hoursIt's a great experience if you want an hard and fair challengeEvery single enemy and boss is unique, making the game very diverse and giving you a lot of fun troughout itAnd if you feel like challengin yourself, when you beat the final boss you unlock the expert mode with is insanely difficult
Overall it's a 9/10, because even if it's not too long, the hours you'll have with it will be really fun
Posted: 3 October
If you don't enjoy a good challenge, this might not be your cup of tea

QUICK TIPFirst off if you're planning on using keyboard I would advise a change in key bindings as the default are awful
 I've found that the best combination is:Fire -> RDodge -> ESuper -> WWeapon switch -> QJump -> SpaceGame is fun, game is hard
 Don't like hard games
 Might not be fun

Totally 10/10
+ Hilarious and versatile Boss
+ Brainwashing music
+ Most importanly, nostalgical atmosphere
Remind me of Casper, Donald, Popeye, Contra
 era, when days were just simply happy
Posted: 13 October
Pros:-Amazing art style-Perfect music-Gameplay is fun and challenging-Co-op mode-Winning never felt so good-Tutorial memes-A BRAWL IS SURELY BREWING-THIS IS A HIGH CLASS BATTLE-KNOCKOUT
 *ding ding ding*Cons:-idk man-It's hard
-why does mugman take a sip out of his own cup before every fight-like really wtf is he drinkingOverall: Ok, so
The game is currently rated Overwhelmingly Positive, and there's tons of gameplay footage and hype surrounding this game, so you probably already know if you want this game and whether you'll enjoy it
But in case you're one of the few who doesn't know already, lemme just lay it out for you
This is a platformer bullet hell lite game
Dying carries no penalties
Which is good because you die a lot
There's a guy on isle 2 that keeps track of just how much you died
I hate that guy
Still, it's hard
Bosses have patterns, and the patterns are difficult to master, and sometimes you still screw up even when you know exactly what's about to happen
It takes several tries on each boss, and each boss is its own type of challenging
A lot of people struggled with the flower guy, but I breezed past him
But then I had trouble with the candyland chick, and she's supposedly super easy
So give yourself some slack
But not too much slack
The tutorial is easy
If you struggle with the tutorial, you have a problem
If you don't understand the reference, look up the cuphead tutorial videos
I promise you'll find it
Anyway, winning feels super rewarding because it's hard
But it's not maddening and unforgiving like dark souls
You get an instant retry, with basically no lost progress
And when you finally get it, you'll get that really satisfied feeling that has me addicted to this game
And every boss is beatable, and no boss move is broken or undodgeable, you just have to learn how, and that's part of WHY it's so rewarding
You really feel like you earned it
The game is very focused on boss fights
There are some side scrolling levels with the same general feel to them
The controls are intuitive, the animations are honestly the most fun and entertaining out of any game I've played, bar none
The soundtrack fits perfectly
I laughed at the shift between boss forms several times
It's just
 fun
Try it
You'll know before 2 hours if you like it or not
Obviously, most people did
Personally, I think it's the most refreshing game I've played in a while
Bottom Line: Easy recommend
Posted: 1 October
Fantastic
 I hope the studio can survive the incredible cost of time, money, and blood sweat and tears they poured into this game
Quite frankly, I'd pay to see them make actual Cuphead cartoons

OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
Fun to control, it runs fine on my potato LaptopIts colorfulits funits amazingly well animatedi love the map, i love the bosses so far, i love everythign about this,lock on aiming with RB is awesome, special weapons, parries, and attacks you buy from the shop ^^ this is PURE GOLD
Posted: 4 October
scroll back up and buy it
Posted: 30 September
Just a note
 This game is not very forgiving
 You will die
 A lot
 That being said it's the best $20 I've spent in a while
 Fluid gameplay, pleasing art style, good soundtrack, and general creativity come together to bring Cuphead
Posted: 30 September
it would be even better if it had a workshopfor maps and weapons
Posted: 20 October
its pretty nice, maybe just add in a level editor and workshop compatiblity and you will be good to go
Posted: 2 October
Its pretty good so far
Hope they add a level maker and workshop
 There also needs to be a score some were maybe

Remember when stick figure fight animations were the best thing on YouTube
Now they're the best thing on Steam
Fast-paced and fabulous, and an excellent time killer
 Watch out for bugs though
 Odds are others are going to see something completely different than you do
 Granted, it can add to the experience, but maybe don't play it with someone who gets frustrated easily
8/10
Posted: 29 September
Remember that time a long time ago when stickman fighting videos were the hottest thing
 For the first time ever you can be a part of one
 Every animation, weapon and map have incredible physics which looks like it has been carefully animated by a professional animator, when in reality it's just really good looking physics/physics-based animation
 The many weapons are very fun and different and will have you accidentally kill yourself
 The guns have extremely over exaggerated recoil giving them that cartoony feel
 The gameplay is very fast and the map design is clever (making it very easy to trap-kill your opponents)
 The gameplay is endless and the loadingtimes are non-existent so be prepared to forget about time
A thing to note is that this game is best played locally with atleast 1-3 friends
 The game has an online feature, but since everything in the game is physics-based, the online gameplay will be less fluid and have occasional bugs
To summarize, Stick Fight is an incredible game because of the physics-animations, powerful and silly weapons, clever map design and overall flow
 Tho the game might not be for you if you want more than endless fighing your friends
 Stick Fight is a game I've been waiting for for years without even knowing I needed it
 It's an instant classic
Posted: 2 October
Reminds me of stickpage animations, 10/10
Posted: 15 October
At this point, the game is just a nice little "time waster", in the good way, of course
 Since there's pretty much no goal in the game than just join or host a game and start punching sticks around, it can become boring quickly
 But i'm sure if the devs play their cards right and keep expanding the game, it will be something even better
 But if they have decided this is the final "full version" of the game, it's fine with me too
Posted: 29 September
I bought this game simply because it reminded me of those old stick man fighting animation videos on YouTube
 So far, the gameplay is similar to Duck Game, where you jump around killing your friends with whatever you can get your hands on
 The concept is amazing and leaves a lot of replayability due to the mass amount of levels and weapons
 The demo video above is a very accurate representation of how the game plays, and is 100% worth it for the price listed
 I've only played with my friends online, but for the people without friends, there was the option to play online with randoms
 There's also local multiplayer for those people looking to have some social "IRL" interaction
 Hopefully we get some more levels and weapons in the future or some Steam Workshop integration for the posibility to create our own levels

Well, I found this game kind of randomly
 I think I saw the trailer for it because I had the april fools day Totally Accurate Battle Zombilator or something like that
 And, I'm gonna rate it just like all of my other reviews
 1 to 10 scale
Graphics: 9/10: The graphics in this game are crisp and smooth
 Though, explosions aren't quite optimized, and i'd love to see some sort of extra distinguishing marks like maybe hats or something similar added later
 And certainly a Colorblind Mode for those gamers who can't see certain colors
Audio: 10/10: The Music and Sounds for this game are a mix of funky techno and awesome gunshot noises
 Though I'd have loved to hear an AWP noise from CS:GO for the Sniper Rifle
Gameplay: 9
5/10: I will certainly get hundreds of hours out of this with friends
 The gameplay is like an older PS3 game a friend had where you could Twin Stick and you had a Punch, Kick, and Energy button setup
 And there were random weapons that would spawn
 I would like the ability to go into a Training Room with each of the weapons to learn how they play, and some sort of Health Meter would be nice, but not required
 Maps: 9/10: The maps are great and fun to play, But i'd love to see some sort of Map Creator linked to the Steam Workshop Mods system
 This would help to keep the game alive unlike other similar and still fun Indie titles like Screencheat, where the game is great, but the small map pool killed the game's potential to purely a few hours and then moving on with my life
 Overall: 9/10: People might say that I am being harsh on a brand new Indie title, but these are valid criticisms, and I do only have a few minutes into the game at the time of this review, but I will certainly be racking up the hours as the weeks go by and I need something to put my frustrations into
 I highly recommend this game as a fun Party game
 Controllers are required and I highly recommend learning how to use the Twin Stick fighting style
Posted: 7 November
Wow
 Apparently the game was released by accident and just happened to come across my queue this morning
 So I took a chance and tried it out, not realizing just how "new" it was
The concept is great
 You are assisting the grim reaper and you have to kill as many people as possible
 Each level has three specific targets that are harder to kill and must be lured or tricked in order to get them to come out
 The challenge comes from two areas
 First, some traps are one time or limited use
 So if you don't have people lined up just right, or have every single person in the same area that this trap can hit, then you can't get a perfect score (by killing everyone)
 The second challenge comes in the form of angels
 The more you kill, the more angels show up
 If they see you messing with anything, you loose a heart
 Loose all three, and you restart the level
The absolute best part of the game is simply watching things play out and learning how the levels work
 I've just played through the entire game in the past 4 hours, but that's not necessarily a bad thing
 I'm already going over all the possibilities in my head as to how I can kill some of the little people who got away
The game reminds me quite a bit of The haunting: Starring Poltergeist in that there is so much fun in manipulating objects to see what happens
Level variety is amazing
 Museums with ancient artifacts, temples with hidden totems, giant monsters that can be found and unleashed, a missile factory full of spies (and potential accidents)
 So many cool things to find
Knowing it's early access at the time I'm reviewing this, I am hoping there is some polishing up in the future
 Currently, the biggest issue with the game is simply learning when to use certain objects
 Using one at the wrong time can completely blow your chance at killing a certain person
 An Undo button that takes back your last action or two would be *very* useful
Some levels also seem to have very few traps for the number of people walking around
 The first level for example seems to be incredibly difficult in that most of the traps are one time use
 Mind you, this is coming from the perspective of someone who would like to earn S ranking on each level
 (Edit: Update below)Another complaint would be the long cut scenes that appear to be un-skippable
 This is an easy fix, but it is very annoying to mess up, restart, and have to sit through the whole set-up process again
This game is a lot of fun and definitely worth the money
 It is one of my favorite games I've stumbled on this year
 Now, I'm going back and try to kill a certain "supreme leader" who has evaded me
 This is a must buy if you enjoy puzzle games, exploration, and a sense of humor
Update:So I've gone back and sunk another 4 hours into the game and managed to get perfects on 4 of the 6 levels
 You really get to experience the strategy elements when you are trying to get every single person, which adds depth to the game
 The first level, which I had complained has very few traps for the number of people simply requires making sure you are using the right trap on the right person
 This requires observing their patterns
 One person might cross the path of 5 different traps, however another person may only pass one trap
 So if you use that trap on the wrong person, you will find it impossible to kill the second person
 My advice to those looking for S-rankings is to kill as many people as possible with the repeatable traps first before you start using the one-time usage traps
I sincerely hope there is DLC or a second game in the future
 I want more
Posted: 8 November
Hahaha
 This is awesome
Ok, you could find something morally wrong with killing innocent people by dropping air-conditioners on them or dropping them into man-holes but you're death in this game, so it's expected from you
 Nice little puzzles and a lot of amusing ways to end the lives of the little people on the screen
 Obviously not for kids
Posted: 8 November
I love everything about this game
Except for the fact that the the green arc in front of the Angel Police seems to have no actual bearing on whether they can see you or not
I've breezed right through it and not been caught; conversely, I've been dinking around murdering people across the entire zone from them and gotten hammered
A++ though definitely the most adorable game about murdering as many people as possible
Posted: 10 November
Product received for free
Review copy provided by developerAs a species we have an understandable fascination with death, and in particular the idea that it might not be a simple cessation of biological function
 Most cultures have their version of the Grim Reaper, a being embodying death itself who culls the living according to his own esoteric agenda
 That agenda is yours to execute in Death Coming, engineering accident after accident to remove targeted individuals from the mortal world
 And while it might not be the first or most polished game to tread that path, it's a fantastic mix of clever and cute
You're dead (sorry for your loss), but instead of drifting off to the great beyond you get recruited by a business-minded reaper to assist him in claiming souls
 While you can't do any reaping yourself, you're free to set off Final Destination-style death traps to expunge the life of your targets
 Kill enough people in one area and you get to move on to the next, but killing people also brings down the attentions of death-averse angels
 And if you kill enough of the right people, you might just learn something new about your own demise
The six levels of Death Coming are presented in lovely isometric pixel art, full of colorful signage, bustling shops, humming machinery, and adorable punching-bag-looking people
 It's these precious souls you need to kill, and it's always by clicking on hazardous elements of the level like precarious flowerpots or loose boards or manhole covers to activate the trap
 One click highlights a trap and gives a small description of it, while a second click sets it off
 All it takes to end someone is a click at the right time, but traps range wildly in complexity
 Dropping an A/C unit on someone is hardly a challenge, but in later levels you might be spilling oil in a particular spot, then waiting for it to rain to spread the oil, then triggering a spark to ignite it just as someone walks by at the right moment (or wrong moment for them)
It's important to note that very little of what happens in Death Coming is mundane
 The second level, for example, takes place in a nuclear warhead factory run by a masked dictator
 You're supposed to kill all the employees but you can kill spies to help complete the warhead, or kill the dictator's secret mistress by getting her to sleep with his assistant, or kill his groupies by letting him spy on them changing and then dropping a rack of crates on them as they flee
 The situations you can engineer only get more insane from there, like turning a museum curator into a werewolf or helping a damsel kill mercenaries and free the Kong knock-off from a nearby ship
 The best kills are weird and funny and completely unpredictable, making their discovery a highlight of the game
The obscure nature of these situations also works against them, though
 Many of the traps available can only be used once, and it won't always be obvious what they do before you trigger them
 Falling traps helpfully highlight their killzones for you but more random or multi-phase murders are left up to guesswork
 In the museum I spent several minutes working out how one setpiece worked, only for it to kill no one because its range was so small
 The hit detection can also be terribly finicky, as I've missed more than one simple manhole kill that looked to be dead-on
 Later levels also introduce weather effects which can activate new traps, but also lock off access to earlier ones which makes learning how everything works that much more important
What this all means is that the real puzzle isn't finding ways to kill people, it's finding the specific sequence of ways to kill the most people
 You have quotas to meet to reach the next level but even the lowest one is easy to miss if you flub a few key traps
 That means you have to play the whole level over, including the unskippable intros which get pretty long by the final level
 Oh, and there's also the angels who start patrolling as the body count rises and stop you if they see you fooling with something
 It's a three-strikes policy and while they're not too hard to avoid, they can leave you waiting far longer than necessary for a timing-based trap
 I don't necessarily have a problem with this sort of trial-and-error gameplay but it's not quite the free-form murder simulator I was hoping it would be
 Completing the game should be simple enough but I don't see myself ever going for perfects on any of the levels
If you're the kind of person that feels like mastering the art of reaping though, you'll have plenty to keep you busy here
 Levels are vast and contain dozens upon dozens of ways to end lives
 It'll take around three hours to simply beat all the levels, and then far longer to work out all the special kills and strategies for clearing each locale out
 It's also worth mentioning that the developers are still very active in addressing issues like flawed designs and rough translations since the game was mistakenly released as normal instead of Early Access, and they're treating it as such
 Honestly, despite the little frustrations I really enjoyed spending time in such a charming, zany, detailed world, depriving its inhabitants of life
 Fans of off-beat puzzlers or adorable mayhem should definitely check it out

I absolutely love this game
 It hits that intersection of challenging and fun, the art, animation, and music are charming, the puzzles are creative, there's some philosophy in there to give it a little depth, and a healthy dose of irreverence for fun and flavour
 I was surprised at the amount of replayability as well
 It takes a few tries to perfect your score, but the game is so charming and fun, and the death traps so varied, that I don't find it too frustrating (just frustrating enough to keep me coming back)
 At the current price the game is about the perfect length to feel like a good deal, and I'm really impressed with it for being in early access, but I'm already hoping for an expansion or sequel
 Great job, devs
 Two minor suggestions
 One, if I could skip the opening cutscenes for each level after I've watched them once, that would really streamline the experience
 Two, there are a couple of scenes where the HUD covers dialogue bubbles
Posted: 9 November
Clever idea, well made sprites- charming and silly all at once, and this is a game where the goal is to kill everybody
This is an Early Access build, but I love this so much I had to write a positive review for it ASAP
This is wildly fun, the levels play out like puzzles, and there's little stories in each level as well
You cannot directly touch people, and certain things require you to perform other tasks to use
For instance, you can knock over a telephone pole, cool right
You can break a fire hydrant, IN FRONT of that pole, and then knock it down creating a huge electric spalsh zone that kills far more people
There are some very complex puzzles here, trying to kill everyone is quite a task
 it isn't required to kill EVERY person, there's a score, and a leaderboard as well for every level
 It's really fun to see what you can affect, and the resulting effects from your interactions are pretty inventive at times
You may need to think out of the box if you want the higher scores
( when this is a full release, and if anythign dramatic changes - I'll update the review, until then; consider this my definitive review
 )

Minus its translation kefluffles and some tiny bugs, Death Coming is a great budget title that runs with its premise and turns it into some joyous and silly rather than grotesque
 If you're fond of puzzles blended with absurd replayability, this is definitely up your alley
 Be wary however, this is still in Early Access even if it counts as a full release because of a mistake the dev team made when fixing some bugs in a recent version of the game
 Even with it being in EA, Death Coming is a nice game to play casually between other games

Early Access Review
What a hidden gem this game is
 The grim reaper killing concept juxtaposed with the cheerful music and cutesy reactions is right up my street
Posted: 8 November
Now, this is certainly a walk on the lighter side of death
So far, it's amusing, though those angels are
 in dire need of adjustment or clarification, or both
Released from Early Access by mistake, I'd say this is one of the better mistakes from the storefront
 :PThere's a lot of tweaking to do, though
 and there's something of a mild shortage of ways to die, far as I can tell - not all traps reset themselves, which can be a problem if you miss the crowd
Posted: 8 November
This game is smart and hillarious
 I was hooked instantly
 The puzzles are clever, and the translation might feel off, it is not beyond the ability to comprehend how the game works
 Sometimes you see and death and go "awww" at just how adorable it all is
 This dev team did a great job

This game is simply amazing
 I'm a long time fan of Steven Wilson (of Porcupine Tree fame but actually better as a solo musician in my opinion) so a video game based on one of his best songs and videos was a dream come true and it didn't disappoint
 "Drive Home" was touching and the video was visually stunning and this is also true to this game
 The watercolor-like visuals are smooth and manage to be soothing and melancholic at the sime time
 Steven Wilson's music here is mainly instrumental versions from his solo albums and it works effortlessly as a soundtrack
 The story of the game is mainly stripped down to pure emotions and although simplistic, the raw emotions of the experience are more than enough to keep you intrigued
 So, a basic summary of all the good things here: - Simple and touching story- Great and emotive music sells the feelings- Stunning visuals will suck you in

Let's just say when it was over I had to immediately go and hug and kiss my wife
Posted: 2 September
This game is incredible
 The sheer aesthetic and emotional beauty of the story is breathtaking
 Its simplicity is just one of the things that makes it so enjoyable
 There are options, but not too many
 You'll find yourself going back and forth between characters as you try to lay the foundations in an attempt to achieve a more favorable outcome, but not so much that it gets irritating
 The story will keep you going, pushing toward an ending you wish for - whether you get that or not, I won't reveal, because the beauty of this is the unsurity of what, if anything, you can change
 The music throughout sets the mood wonderfully, and the soundtrack is something I would buy in its own right
 It took me 4
6 hours to complete the game - granted some of that time was chasing my unruly pup away from my mouse lead - but I feel the game is worth the money
 I highly reccommend it
 It really is a thing of beauty

The first time I heard about "Last Day Of June" was a few months ago while reading about and waiting for the newest Steven Wilson's album; at that point I couldn't but wander about: what could offer as a whole a videogame where Steven Wilson is involved
He once told not being the kind of videogames-interested person and almost neglected the idea of ever participating into them
But, content-wise, aren't his songs the kind of emotional stories with all of the necessary elements to develop a proper history and turn them into something else, besides the music and lyrics themselves
 That's what they did with the song "Drive Home" (from the 2013 album "The Raven That Refused To Sing - And Other Stories") in order to bring "Last Day Of June" to life
If you're the kind of person who's really into music, if you're someone who would take its time appart with the sole purpose of enjoying a new album, and, literaly listening to it, you'll easily catch what this game is about
PROS:- Catchy
- Emotional
- Atmospheric
- Trippy
- Really colourful
- Music by Steven Wilson
CONS:- Kleenex tissues not included
- A little bit repetitive in some parts
 
Posted: 26 October
Short and sweet
 It's a bit repetitive - because of how the story is told, granted - but since you can't skip cutscenes it can get a bit tedious when you have to see some of them over and over again
 The game is really short either way though, so it's no big deal
 I liked it
 It's very easy, you will have no hurdles to overcome, but it's just an interactive story after all
 Well-told, without any dialogue; only by gestures and mumbled voices
 The visuals are simple but beautiful, and the music is fantastic - which comes to no surprise if you enjoy Steven Wilson's work, of which this game is based upon
 I recommend it if you're looking for a short, but good, story-driven experience
 The value comes down to how much you're willing to spend for a few hours of story
Posted: 1 September
This game is immensely emotional
 Don't expect to play it without crying
The artwork is gorgeous and nothing needs to be said about Steven Wilson's music - as a huge fan I already knew what I was getting myself into
 even his music videos can make me cry
I think it's fantastic how the faces are drawn - every character is uniquely identifiable by a particular trait but because all of them are "faceless" it's easy to empathise with them; put yourself in their shoes if you will
 Each character has their own (sad) backstory so there's something for everyone who's been down and out in life
 This makes the game so much more relatable and emotional, especially if one has been through emotional trauma
A game about experiencing life, loving and letting go
 sometimes this is just what we need given the stresses of modern life
 It's absolutely worth the money
One gripe though: if you don't get all the achievements in one playthrough it seems like the game forces you to restart at the end which can make it tedious
Posted: 31 August
Highly recommendedGood Story, love the artI cried even more on the neighbor (the girl) than the main character (you will know when you play it)The only problem is the game mechanic that sometime frustrated as you have to watch all the cutscenes all over again if you fail the combination (no skip button)
 Plus the game starts to crash every 10 minutes when approaching the last chapter (the old man)
 Crash 5 times before I get into the ending
 Other than that, no problems
Please watch until the credit roll (Hence, the achievement said 'wait for it')7
5/10Recommended
P/S It is coincidence that the game release when Muslim celebrating Eid al-Adha which is emphasize more on sacrifice for the love one
 Perfect time to release the game
Posted: 31 August
Last Day of June is a good game
So why I don't recommend it 
 First : it's short
 You'll end the story in two hours, maybe less, a bit longer if you want to complete it 100%
 I usually don't mind shorts games, but this one is
 Well
 It's a bit of a puzzle game, where you switch character to solve a problem
 But it's too easy, too quick
 When you start thinking it can give some nice puzzle, it's already over
 I was expecting at least four hours of actual game, and it's not even it
Second : It's not challenging
 I understand the game is supposed to be mostly a story you're being tell, but
 There's no real puzzle
 Everything is too obvious, you almost get the answer before the problem is even there
 I think it's a problem
 I could talk about the price and the actual content, but hey
 It's a good game, the story is nice (but kind of obvious too), but it's really little
 I think the main problem is a lack of ambition
 This game has a nice artistic view, it has nice details, but they're not used
 And I even feel one of the character is underused
 That shouldn't happen in such a short game
 TL;DR : Game is cool, but underexploited
Posted: 6 September
I've played video games for the majority of my 30 years of existence
 Occasionally you'll find that game that is so far exceeds your expectations
 That leaves you mouth gaping and unable to stop thinking about it, even hours after you're done
Last Day of June is one of those games
 The one that spoke to me
 The one that's mechanics intrigued me, that challenged me, that made me slowlly take my time and try to savor each scene
Although it may have it's own flaws, when it stands strong and proud it outshines any gripe I may have had
 The story takes twists that I didn't see coming, made me care and connect with clay people with no eyes -- the same ones who display some of the best traits and signs of emotion
If you are even remotely interested in this game, turn away from this review now
 Don't read anything else
 Put on some headphones, turn down the lights and just let this short (~4
5 hour game) make you run the gamut of emotions
Last Day of June tells a complex story but one that doesn't leave pointless ends loose or show any sign of being pretentious or "heady"
 I can honestly say, from the bottom of my heart, this game is a top 3 and candidate for GOTY
 To say that in 2017 should speak words for itself
Last Day of June is a masterpiece and one that should be played by all
Posted: 12 October
Although visually and audibly an enjoyable game to play, Last Day of June has a few issues that caused me to not be able to recommend it overall
 The first has to do with the story itself
 The story portrays a tragic car accident very early on in the game (which can be seen in the trailer that was released,) and involves the protagonist survivor Carl going back in time to try to prevent June from dying
 During the game, glimpses of their past is shown that reveal how their relationship was in the years prior to the accident
 Memories of several of the other characters can also be collected as an optional part of gameplay that give additional background on them as well as for Carl and June
 The problem is the lack of most of this background before the accident occurs, apart from a short flashback that briefly introduces the characters and explains why Carl and June decided to go to the dock
 The player knows almost nothing about these characters when June dies, and it's difficult (in my opinion, though some may disagree) to have an emotional response about her death
 Later on in the game, after discovering how their relationship had been before she passed, it's much easier to sympathize with Carl's loss
 However, in my opinion, this occurs too late
 Had the player been able to either see sequences of them interacting in the past in the prologue of the game, or better yet to actually play through scenes that highlight the love that they had for each other, the car accident would have been far more impactful, and the urgency of trying to save her would make the story much more enjoyable to experience
 As it stands, however, the story felt a bit mediocre
The second was game design decisions that can cause the game to feel a bit irritating
 The biggest offender was the lack of a method to skip cutscenes
 While most of the cutscenes were integral to the story, some of them are inevitably shown multiple times as the player figures out how to progress
 This is essentially the same as an extended loading screen, and can be very frustrating to wait for
 Another design flaw comes from the memory collection system
 This optional part of the game was a plus, as it promoted exploration of the village as well as revealing background information for the involved characters
 The issue was that although backtracking was enabled in the first three chapters, it is suddenly removed without warning once the story proceeds to the fourth chapter
 This causes any player that missed one of the memories for the kid, best friend, or hunter to have to wipe their save and start the game all over in order to be able to collect them
 This could have been prevented by either separating the sections for the memories of the old man from the others, or by giving a warning when the player has found the correct solution for all characters in chapter 3 that they won't be able to go back if they continue on with that choice
 Another decision that the designers made was to limit the sections that the game would be saved
 While the game can certainly be completed in a few short sessions, players that are forced to replay large sections of the game because they had to turn it off just before reaching a checkpoint can find the game a bit annoying
 Finally, the lack of multiple save files to choose from means that players have to wipe their main save every time they want to show a friend how the game looks or to let them play it from the beginning
Some may argue that the linearity of the game is another problem that this game suffers from
 I disagree, however, as although it is certainly linear, it is not very noticeable unless one plays through the game a second time to collect any missed achievements/trophies, and honestly is fairly typical of games that put a much higher focus on storytelling than on gameplay
 Additionally, some may say that the length of the game is far too short since it can be completed in just a few hours
 Although I do wish it were a bit longer in the case of this story, I have played other games that did not take very long to finish either and enjoyed them quite a bit, so having a short completion time is not necessarily a problem in and of itself
 Finally, some may complain about the artistic style that was used to create the character models
 This shouldn't be a major concern, however, because the trailer and screenshots for the game clearly show this design and does not come as a surprise to anyone that decides to get the game
 Furthermore, they make sense in light of the game being based off of Steven Wilson's song Drive Home, whose music video on YouTube shows a character that looks very similar to Carl
 This last part is not specifically a spoiler and is kept somewhat vague intentionally, but is placed inside spoiler tags in case it is viewed as such
 It is intended to be better understood by those that have already completed the game, and expands a little more on the first paragraph above
One part of the story that doesn't make much sense is the fact that Carl is alone when he wakes up after the accident
 He's been alone for quite some time as evident by the state of the house
 Why is no one helping him or staying with him
 One could argue that the best friend left, but that is illogical considering her background story as well as the fact that she witnessed the car crash
 The old man obviously cared about him, and even the hunter had a sympathetic side as evident by the last cutscene involving him
 If Carl simply shut them out of his life in his grief, why not clarify that
 It seems like a missed opportunity to not mention it all, and could have even made the ending more moving if it had shown him considering how his final idea would affect the other people in the village, assuming that the story had shown them caring for him rather than just being nonexistent
In conclusion, I do wish I could rate this as a recommended game, as it is very well done in regards to the beauty of the environment, and the music is enjoyable to listen to as well
 Unfortunately, though, the problems presented in the first 2 paragraphs above are enough of a concern to cause me to not have much desire to share it with friends, and should be kept in mind in contrast to those that reviewed the game positively here when considering whether to acquire this game or not

Early Access Review
If you're thinking of buying this game, stop hesitating and purchase it, immediately
I started an isolated research facility on a frozen wasteland, as a 74-year-old sociopathic scientist called Geckulon Decktar; I researched robotics to begin with, and constructed some automatons to handle the menial tasks like cleaning, cooking and hauling, etc, leaving me free to conduct my research
 All was well- until a band of vagrants laid siege to my settlement
 I barely survived and resolved to increase my security, installing several auto-turrets around my perimeter
 This would keep the ruffians at bay for a time, but I needed a longer term solution- so I turned my focus to bionic enhancements
 I wanted to turn the human form into the ultimate living weapon
 When a faction of slavers passed through my frozen wasteland, I did not hesitate to inspect their wares
 I wanted a slave, but not just any slave- he should be foreboding, brutal, savage
 And there I found him- His name was Skint Mcgruff
 He was a feared crime lord when they captured him, infamous for killing and then devouring the people who wronged him
 I paid the slavers their due and took Skint in
 I fed him (alas, not human meat, but nutrient paste, made from potatoes- poor fare, but such is life in the frozen wastes) and I clothed him
 By now I was confident in my ability to improve upon the human form, and so I presented the idea to him the very next day
 He was keen- particularly about the notion of having retractable claws- and so the work began
 My medical droid handled most of the surgery, but I crafted the bionic components myself
 It was a long and gruelling process, but eventually, he was complete
 More machine now than man, I felt it necessary to rename him
 to symbolise his departure from prosaic humanity to something more, and thus I named him C
A
N
N
I
B
A
L (Cybernetic Armoured Neutraliser with Neurally Integrated Bionic Attack Limbs)
 He is my pride and joy
 bionic eyes that can see even in the dark, bionic legs that allow him to sprint faster than a cheetah, and retractable claws with which to tear out the throats of my foes, and of course, I give him leave to feast on their corpses afterward as a reward
 Now, I can conduct my research in peace

Early Access Review
I felt like I had to share my experiences with RimWorld so far 
	So I had just established my young but promising new colony, Ashton (a quite ironical name in the end 
)
 The basic needs were all covered, everyone had a nice place to sleep, decent clothing, enough to eat and time to relax
 The people of Ashton were prosperous
 They lived in harmony with nature and each other
 Their wide fields provided them with plenty of food and they sold the surplus to the passing by caravans
Now and then a few warriors of a near tribe, the Pig Face Men, attacked the settlement, but the people of Ashton were safe, relying on the strength of their automated defence systems
 And so the colony grew and I thought: This is it, I finally have a colony which doesn't collapse after a few hours
As if 
Remember when I told you about the harmony between the people and with nature
 I meant there were no rivalries between the colonists, most were friends and there even was a married couple, Tali and Waltz
The harmony with nature also seems pretty coherent; the people relied mostly on their crops, eating only those animals which died by natural causes (e
g
 old age or other animals), so the animal population in the near forests remained stable
 So far so good
 But taking those dead animals in meant of course someone had to leave the safe area of Ashton and wander through the wilds
 Normally that wouldn't have been a problem, everyone was equipped with guns and armor of the Pig Face Men so they were quite ready to take on anything coming in their way
 But then came the tortoise
	Waltz left Ashton to get the still fresh corpse of a chinchilla which had been killed by some other animal
 So Waltz has just grabbed it, when a tortoise nearby turned mad
 I thought ok, those aren't that fast, Waltz will be able to safely carry the chinchilla inside and the turrets will take care of the tortoise
Nope
I'm not quite sure what exactly happened, maybe this animal was on speed or something like thak
 Anyway, when it saw Waltz it charged at him at a horrifying pace
 Waltz had just lifted his weapon when this damn creature reached and hurt him badly
 However, its hard shell was no match for Waltz' gun
 And so he came back home, injured but happy, that now there was even more meat than expected
 But the wraith of the tortoise was unforgiving
 The bite wounds in his upper body infected themselves
 The medical treatment didn't work and he got weaker and weaker
 If the infection at least would've been in one of his limbs, that might had saved him, but you can't just amputate someones chest
At last he couldn't fight any longer, the infection overwhelmed him
 Tali, his wife, carved his story in the sides of his sarcophagus
 The burial ceremony was heartbreaking
 Everyone had come: Tali, his sister Julia, his friends Vas, Jones, Stephan, Boyd and Leia, Vas' tame wolf Nevile and Bacon 1 and Bacon 2
 In the light of the evening sun they all waved a last goodbye to their fallen husband, brother and friend, before the people of Ashton went to bed
 With Waltz dead or not, they had to cary on
But apparently it was all too much for Tali, not very surprising if you think about it
 There was only this one little problem: She was a pyromaniac
 When the rest of the colony slept, she left her big and empty bed
 Driven crazy by grief, she did the only thing able to ease her pain
 She set the forest on fire
 Finally, exhausted almost to unconciousness, she fell back into her bed again
While she slept, the others, waken by the crackling fire, desperately tried to put out the flames which already started to spread over to the buildings
 But they simply weren't enough, they could either try to save the buildings or the forest, not both
 Of course they tended to the buildings, to the food storage to be exact
 However it gave the fire the chance to spread through the forest, completely sorrounding the settlement
In the end it was all too much
Tali died in her own fire that she refused to extinguish, Jones and Boyd followed when they collapsed in the infernal heat
 And then, when no hope was left, the gods, the ancestors, the Flying Spaghetti Monster or whatever thi people of Ashton believed in, heard their cries
 Rain started falling down, putting out the fire
 But it was too late
 More than three quarters of the colony had been taken by the flames
 Vas, Stephan and Leia were unconcious
 Julia was the only one still able to stand
 She did what she could, but with all the medicine burned she had no chance
 Leia died first, Vas second
 This caused his wolf Nevile, who had been laying loyal by his side, to turn mad like the damn tortoise and he ripped the still unconcious Stehpan into pieces before he went on attacking a herd of muffalos (some kind of marshmellow like buffalos) which was his end
Traumatised Julia, who managed to flee when Stephan was killed, wandered through the burnt ruins of Ashton
 Blackened stone walls and pieces of charcoal everywhere
 All the food they stored for the winter was gone, the fields empty
 With no medicine left and her own wounds hurting worse and worse, Julia found a last smokeleaf joint in one of the destroyed buildings
 She leant against her brother's sarcophagus and lit it
 So she didn't feel anything when the Pig Face Men attacked
 With the solar panels a loss to the flames, the turrets didn't react when Ashton's last inhabitant finally exhaled her last breath
12 / 10 - Creates more immersive storys than many RPGs; looking forward to my next colony (and possibly its desastrous destruction 
)
Thanks for reading if you made it this far :-)

Early Access Review
I'm not one to write reviews for games - especially games that are in early access
 So, I'll classify RimWorld as a lifestyle instead of a game
 I was an original kickstarter backer and have played this game (almost) daily for the last 3 years with an estimated 1000 hours of playtime (before the game was avaible on Steam)
 So yes, I'll recommend this game and give it a positive review
 The best way that I can describe RimWorld is the aesthetics of Prison Architect mixed with elements of Dwarf Fortress set in a Firefly styled Universe
 In it's heart, it's a colony simulation game where you take control of colonists who are on a planet away from "civilization"
 You make the decisions to equip, shelter, feed, and protect your colony from the environmental dangers and enemy factions
 Sure, the game is still in Early Access (Alpha 14 at the time of posting), but there are a ton of replayability and mechanics to learn as well as different difficulties and multiple AI types to "guide" your gameplay
 The game is relatively bug free and nicely balanced in the vanilla game
 The modding community is healthy and a lot of really solid mods have been released and updated
With that said, the game may be a little daunting for new players
 There are a lot of elements and core mechanics to the game that take some time to learn
 My suggestion to this is to play the game on a reduced difficulty and learn from your mistakes
 When your colony dies, restart a new map and learn from your mistakes
 Losing is fun
All in all, it's worth the $30 - even if $30 is expensive for an indie game
 I mean, you can cure asthma by replacing a colonist's lungs
 As I said before, I did purchase the game through kickstarter, but the developer added me to the game as a character - so I didn't technically get this game for free, but I did a bit of a bonus

Early Access Review
You're reading the reviews thinking: "Damn, some of these people have like 300+ hours on this, they must really like it
" Then you're looking at the price thinking: "That much
" Definitely worth it in my opinion
 And I've only played for 20 hours (and have gotten not too much done, because there is so much to do)
It's the best base-building survival I've played yet
 You get attached enough to some of your colonists that you become sad if anything happens to them
 You can build your colony however you want to
 Think of it like a top-down minecraft
 You're not limited on how you want to build your base at all, except you can't build multi-leveled buildings
 (Two-story)
Every colonist has their own personality
 IE: My hunter Lumine is probably one of my most useful colonists
 She can snipe targets from long distances with perfect headshots
 However, Lumine is staggeringly ugly and has an annoying voice
 So my colonists don't really like her much
My surgeon Toni has been through so much
 She has gotten her leg and arm ripped off, so I've operated on her and given her a metal arm and leg
 She is literally Edward Elric, except instead of fighting Scar she is healing Scars
 Different Survival Elements
 You need to keep your colonists cool when it's hot, and warm when it's cold
 You can do this in different ways such as crafting them the right clothing, and having heaters/coolers
 Your colonists need to eat
 You can have them eat raw humans and animals like savages, or you can have them butcher animals, and cook different meals so that they can stay healthy
 You need to build a freezer so that your food won't deteriorate
 You need a medical room for the best effective chances of successful operations and treatment
 You'll need to build wind turbines and solar generators so you can give power to the things in your base that require it
 You need to build a research bench and research new
 well, basically everything
 So the game doesn't just give you everything that's available
 You have to work for it
 In the regular mode of the base game, you start off with 3 colonists
 And you stick with them for a while and think: "When am I going to get more
 This is kind of slow since I only have 3 people
" Next thing you know, you have like 10 people who are all doing their own jobs
 Be it people you recruited, or people who fell from cargo pods from space
And I've only been talking about your base
 This game has an entirely randomly generated world that your colony is in
 Which means trade caravans will visit you, different tribes will visit you
 You can visit them by forming caravans of your own
 You can even raid other bases
 You can eventually build comms equipment to contact different trading ships that are in orbit, or the different outposts nearby
 And you will get raided by a lot of different outposts as well, which means you will have to set up defences
 You can take prisoners and either recruit them, release them, eat them, or harvest them for their organs
 Yep
 Don't want those perfectly good kidneys to go to waste now do we
 If you don't want to take prisoners, you can have your colonist slit the injured guys throat
 It's cold, man
 They just walk right up to the injured fella and either shoot them until they die, or brutally stab them to death
Now one important thing that this game offers which any good game offers: Mods
To me, mods fill the important content that the developers have not added yet
 More turrets, more organized menus, more furniture, more everything
 Even the option to show visitors hospitality so that you can better establish friendship, or even recruit them to your colony
I can't imagine playing the game without some of the mods that I have installed
 Not that the vanilla game is bad, it's just that some of the mods are so useful and necessary that I wouldn't want to play without them
 And none of the mods I have are cheats either
 You need to use your valuable recourses in order to craft everything, including objects from mods
 So definitely check the workshop out once you get the game
 The only negative that I have so far isn't very much a negative of the game but just me being a little whiner
Sometimes, some of the random events are very highly not in your favor, and completely unfair
 Which will result in you reloading an autosave or main save, just to prevent the event from happening
 When you reload a save, that event that played out gets replaced with a different random event
 So you're getting raided by a bunch of people while half your colonists have severe illnesses
 No worries
 Just reload a save
 It's saved my colony a bunch of times
 Sometimes I've let some of my colonists die and I've continued the game, but most of the time I just reload an autosave to prevent their deaths
 It's an easy way to cheat the system
 Overall, it's a great game
 There is a reason you're seeing people with hundreds of hours on it
 Every single player's game is different
 Different bases, different colonists
 So many outcomes
 It's why you see so many people posting their stories on their reviews
 It's a game that I didn't even know I wanted until I played it
 Amazing community
 Especially the modding community
 It's making the game so much more than it already is
 10/10 would have one of my rookie hunters shoot at a hare 40 times point blank, only to miss, give up, and go stargaze
 Oh and don't let your colonists go on a mental breakdown
 ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE THE PYROMANIC TRAIT
 My god
 Freakin Engie, literally sets fire to everything she helped build
 Try to arrest them or reload a save
 They will burn everything, slaughter your cats/dogs, fight your own colonists, and wreak havoc as much as the random evented angry hares that can destroy your entire colony if you're not prepared
 I probably missed a lot in my review
 But hey, you will discover that yourself once you play it
 So what are you waiting for

Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony
 Do you want to:1
 Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers
 YOU CAN DO THAT
2
 Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join
 YOU CAN DO THAT
3
 Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist
 YOU CAN DO THAT
4
 Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice
 YOU CAN DO THAT
5
 Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter
 YOU CAN DO THAT
Really, what else do you need in a game

I started quite innocently at a save, three wonderful colonists
 Things were going well, I got some growth up and my happy colonists were making friends with the visitors
 My farms were doing exeptionally well, and after not too long, I had over one thousand in Rice, Potatoes and corn
 In addition to quite a lot of strawberries
 All of this in my refridgerated room
 I figured I didn't have to worry about food for a long while
I was wrong
I got the fine idea of buying a hen and a rooster from a traveller, thinking eggs would make some fine additions to my food storage
 I made a barn and made sure all the animals had access to food
Focusing on other things, I completely forgot about the animals for a while
 Until all of a sudden there were 30 chickens
 I was a little shocked about the rate in which they'd grown, and started a hay farm to give them an alternate food source that didn't ruin me
 This would all be good and dandy in no time
 I was wrong
By the time I'd gotten the hay sowed and partially grown, I was down to less than 500 of all vegetables
 And to top it off, a blight was around the corner and completely destroyed all my crops
I had to start over
 Completely panicked, I slaughtered some chickens
 At this point, it was 70+
 So I figured taking 25 of them to the slaughterhouse would give me some time
I was very wrong
 Desperately looking for a way out, I had to slaughter another 20 something chickens
 Now they were approaching 70 again
 I was just hoping for a caravan to show up so that I could sell some chickens and buy some veggies
I got some hay grown and decided to cut off the chickens access to all other food sources
 Now they were getting past 80
 But I had some hay, hoping it would work out, I kept at it
 I didn't mind the chickens for a while, until I noticed that some of them were starving
 By then, I'd gotten my veggie count back up a few hundreds
 I let the chicken into my pantry
 And forgot about it
Some time later and A LOT of chickens later, a caravan finally appear, so I figure, finally, time to sell some chickens
 Let's check how many I've got

I enjoy Dwarf Fortress
 But I felt disconnected with my dwarves
 Honestly, 80 dwarves in one fort, and I'm supposed to care about how my Baron feels
Then I tried RimWorld
 I got it October 20th of 2016
 And
 I pretty much played it for near 20 hour stretches
 Until that Sunday night when I realized, "I have work on Monday
"My first colony was thrown together in something of a huff as I didn't know what I was really doing, but the game is very straightforward so once I figured things out (and the ingame helper is a nice touch, Devs
 Kudos), I was grooving
My two main colonists were a fighter and doctor, plus a crafter
 They got along
 All was well
 Between the mining, expanding, animal taming, it all felt very easily managable
 There were a few mistakes, but the colony thrived
Until he came along
 The pyromaniac
 He would occassionally start fires, usually after being rebuffed by the good female doctor who had her eyes on someone else
 Often this would lead to him being arrested and thrown into a cell
 If the fires were set away from the compound, then that was fine
It kept getting to the point everyone was tired of his abrasive attitude and having to put out his fires
 Literally
 His mood would always tank after the tribal and pirate raids, yet he seemed ecstatic when it came to lobbing his molotov cocktails at the would be attackers
Then IT landed
 An AI Core
 The crafter had gone out to retrieve something, and that triggered the core
 Out slothed a slow moving, minigun armed slug
 Everyone went on alert and was ready to fight, armed with the pistol, rifle, and knife that remained
 The fighter died in a hail of bullets
 He died
 Blown literally into pieces infront of the good doctor
 She went berserk, broken at the sight of her lover ripped to pieces
 For all of the 5 seconds of rage the slug allowed before she was mowed down as well
The crafter turned tail and ran
 Fear had overtaken him
 He dashed into the recesses of the compound
 The pyro had long since lost his mind, laughing and setting fires, about the colony, then in the compound
 The first to burn up were the dearly dismembered lovers
 The crafter tried to fight back the impending flames by was consumed
As the slug advanced, our moronic miscreant looked to the slug, then back to the flames
 It was a simple choice in his mind
 The loving, warm embrace of a firey death
 The single thing he loved more than anything else in his life
 A deep laugh emanting from the depth of his core as he leapt into the raging inferno
 Meanwhile I'm sitting here watching this all unfold sipping a red bull like, "
 THIS IS FREAKING AWESOME
" Rolled another colony and was up till 5:30am the next day still playing
 This repeated ad nasuem all weekend in a variety of scenarios, now enabled by some mods, because hey, themed plays are fun
 Especially the Cannibal Run
 Oh man
 That was
 That was really bad
Then monday morning I show up to work looking like I'd been partying all weekend: "Dude are you okay

For three or four days now, I have played nothing but "This War of Mine"
 I am a veteran of Iraq and I remember all too well the hardships it brought upon the civilians, especially in the beginning of the war
 I remember being heartbroken at the sight of children crying and begging for food on the side of the road
This "game" puts you square in the middle of the experiences of those civilians
 It is a brutal, kill or be killed world - where an act of unimaginable violence may let you live another day, but it can also break your heart and soul
 Some days, you are offered a chance at compassion - and if you take that chance, risking your own safety and resources for others, you may find you feel a bit better about yourself
Then there are the times where you are stuck between a rock and a hard place
 You are unarmed, scavenging for anything to save your friends, and you peep through a keyhole and see a soldier brutally beating - and possible worse - a woman
 He has an AK-47, you have a lockpick and a rumbling stomach
 So you sit there and watch - afraid that any noise may turn his violent attention upon you
 When it is all done, you hide until he leaves and then, shamefully, pick over the bloodied body of the woman for anything she may have scavenged before the soldier got to her
This is "This War of Mine" - a dark, beautiful, haunting, exhilerating, and horrible tale
What's that tagline, "The first casualty of war is innocence"
 It applies here - in a way you would have never imagined coming from a computer game

Entered a building with other people
The building's description
had said "Danger" which ment hostiles
 Bandits
I grabbed my knife and was ready for those bandits
I saw one bandit and after breaking in through a window, she ran calling for backup
One guy showed up with a shotgun and chased me off but I waited
He searched, and couldn't find me and then I got the drop on him
We fought, he couldn't shoot, and three stabs later he fell
I grabbed the shotgun and went inside
 My friends needed food, and these bandits were killers
 They deserved what they got
I grabbed food, supplies, and another bandit showed up
I fired at them with the shotgun, and they dropped with a gurgling scream
One bandit ran after me
 Surely they had a knife
No
 she ran past me to the man's corpse
She was crying
 She called me a murderer
I fired again and she dropped
There was silence then, and I had to hurry up and grab the rest of the supplies before more bandits showed up
I opened a closet, and snagged the food
But, the inventory of the closet said "Private"Someone owned this wardrobe
 I looked outside toward the other building, and between the two
 a garden someone built
One guy had mentioned they were running low on meds
This
 no
 it couldn't be
 It just couldn't be
This wasn't
 this wasn't an abandoned building being picked clean
This was another group's safehouse
These people are
 were
 survivors
and "I" was the bandit

This is an INCREDIBLE game
 It was recommended to me by a close friend because, me being a former war refugee from the Balkans, he thought I might find the content "a bit familiar
" It went a bit further than that, in fact it kind turned out to be some uncanny early-childhood simulator for me
 I still remember the visceral terror of being a child in that war; I will never forget howling and begging my mother not to go outside to buy bread, out of fear that she would be shot dead by a sniper
 Asking why my grandmother couldn't go instead
This game captures moments like that with a masterful hand
 It is never heavy or hamfisted
 I can't explain how well the developers have encapsulated the hoplessness and the mundane brutality of the Balkan civil war, and it leads me to think that at least one key person involved in the development of this game had to have lived through it, too
 The tone is just perfect, striking that difficult balance between terror and absurdity, and reminds me of all the films I love that came out of Former Yugoslavia after the war
 This is not Angelina Jolie painting Balkan politics with a broad brush dipped in ignorance and a skewed western perspective insensitive of nuance--this is an authentic work of art that is sensitive to the complexities of its subject matter and the individual stories of the thousands of people whose lives were shaped and altered forever by this horrible, unnecessary war
 It's an emotional playthrough, even for people who haven't had any experience with the historical event
 It is a "war game" like no other and I can't recommend it enough
 Take it from someone who was there

This game shows a bad side of war, the dark one
 It shows war from the citizen perspective
 We start surviving with 3 or 4 chosen characters (first we have only one group and we unlock next people by surviving next days)
 The group lives in an emptied house
 The supplies we find in the hideout run out very quickly
 So what to do
Stealing means surviving the next day or two
 We start hiding in shadows and sneaking
 And now comes a very hard choice: what about killing
 I played two times
 First time, i got into pensioners house
 They potted me and ran up to the door
 My friends were starving
 I had no choice
 I attacked the man with fists
 He died after two hits in the head
 Woman ran into the toilet and locked the door
 I took away their food and left the house
 I remember this particular moment all the time
 In "This War of Mine" there i as lot of choices
 Is killing and stealing in order to get some food morally better then starving
 Who
are we decide upon other people's lives
 Is there anything cheerful about the war we see in first person shooters

"War is hell"This game is not about a soldier who destroyes the whole army
This game is not about a massive cool looking war
This game is about people like you and me,surviving in hell named war

Send Katia to scavenge the ‘Quite House’
The preview says it has food and meds and isn’t dangerous
Sounds like a good shout
Turns out it was just an old couple living there, doing their thing
Walk into house
Old man begs me not to take their stuff coz his wife is sick
Feel bad
Take their stuff anyway
Go home
 Now Katia is depressed coz she robbed the old couple
Try to get Emilia to comfort her
Emilia is s*** at comforting
Katia is suicidal
I feel really bad
Decide to go back and try to return their stuff
Maybe I can give them this diamond I found
Go back to the Quite House
Can’t find old couple
Go upstairs
Old couple is dead
Quit game
Sit in corner contemplating what I’ve done

I'm 5 hours in, and that's a straight 5 hours
 Most survival games I've played are either pretty forgiving, or shallow in character
This one is neither
 In the beginning of my hours I was hopeful and treated others I met with the same kidness I normally would, as the going was good
 I shared my supplies, and took in others that needed shelter
 Food was used daily and luxuries were built
36 days later (and still going) the survivors that are left are battered men; hungry, sick and tired
 We've had to kill to survive, even innocent people, because the only other option was our own death
 We have stolen and traded our way through the cold-snap, and the outlook is grim
All that matters now is lasting the few days until outside aid arrives
 But in the end, will that really matter
 We're not the same people we started as, and the atrocities we've commited are ones we have to live with forever
I highly reccomend this game, but be warned: Your decisions WILL have severe consequences, you WILL hate yourself for the evils you have done, necissary as they may feel
 You will learn to know the survivors, what things they find acceptable, who can talk to whom best
 Most of all you will think "Maybe next run, I can do things differently
"
 I know I am at this point, as it looks like my first run will end in failure and misery
10/10, am now broken, tired and hungry IRL
 Soundtrack matches the atmosphere, graphics are a little jarring at first but become normal after a little bit
 Gameplay is solid and needs very little introduction, and you will want to think your decisions through a few times
 It all matters in the end

Day 21: It's been three weeks since we moved into this bombed-out house we've come to call home
 Three weeks since I last saw any members of my family; two since my last hot meal; one since Katia was gunned down scavenging for food and medicine
 Bruno hasn't fared well
 The illness is no longer confined to his body – now his soul is sick, broken
 The snows have come, and we're feeding the heater every day now
 I wept when we burned our only two books
 Bruno scoffed
 “They're children's books,” he muttered from his sick bed
 “It's not as if we read them
” He didn't bother asking whose books they had been
Day 25: I scavenged last night
 We're both starving
 I remembered a house, untouched by the violence
 I had come weeks earlier in the hopes of getting supplies only to find it occupied by an old couple
 living as they had before war came
 They reminded me of my grandparents, and I left
 Katia and Bruno had not been happy, and we did not eat that night
 I returned this evening in the hopes that they had fled
 or worse, shamefully
 But they had not
 The old man struggled, wouldn't let me steal his wife's medicine

10 hours in review: I hate this game
I am a completionist
 I mostly play RPGs and strategy games
 I like to win, so my gaming style primarily involves achieving goals, expanding my powerbase, meeting my targets, improving my strength, all of which to end in a smashing victory
This War of Mine offers very little and frequently none of these things
 The gameplay is inherently simple
 You have a few survivors in a badly damaged house
 During the day they can do simple tasks, like building furniture, patching a hole in the wall or something else to help you survive, cooking meals, distilling hooch, or resting from nightly activities
 During the night one person can go out to scavenge for badly needed supplies, while the rest sleeps (hopefully in a bed) or stands guard, hoping you won't get raided during the night
Rather than adding and expanding, the game constantly offers straightforward but difficult choices
 Does the scavenger bring home raw materials today so somebody can patch a hole in the wall, or does he bring medication in case somebody gets sick or wounded
 Do I risk life and limb to steal from armed bandits or inflict myself with moral guilt stealing from the defenseless elderly
 Do I give my last piece of food to the wounded guy who has to stand guard tonight or to the sick man on the bed
 Do I trade away my last bandages while nobody's wounded so we can all eat tomorrow
 There's no do-overs either so I am stuck with my choices
 Beyond just restarting the entire story of course
This is what makes This War of Mine so damn good
Every day in the game, it's one bad choice or another, all for the sake of staving off immediate disaster
 For one more day
 For the sake of survival
 For the hope that things will be a little bit better tomorrow, if only you can get through the problems right now
 Can you survive without resorting to theft
 If you can't, who do you steal from, how much do you risk in the process
 What about murder, when does that get justified by survival
If as a player you do not get upset by stealing or murdering for the sake of your group of survivors, then your survivors will
 They get sad and depressed, even suicidal, from committing atrocities
 Morale is an important part of the game, and the horrorific actions you commit to in the name of surviving are as relevant as the ones that are inflicted upon you
 Maybe even moreso
Because war is horrible and this glimpse of what living in a warzone is like, just so
 It is atrocious
 It is insecure
 It comes with the realization that while this game has plenty abstractions, these stories are real
 There are people who have lived through this
 Who are trying to live through it in the world today
 Who probably will be trying to live through it in the future
Who only want to survive
 Just one more day
 Maybe tomorrow will be better
I have to stop writing now
 Marko is sick, but he's the only one who is uninjured after last night when bandits tried to raid our shelter again
 We have some rat meat left over so I'd best cook him a meal
 Maybe he'll finally find some medicine tonight
 Hopefully the trader will come by today, we have a few bottles of moonshine ready
 If not, I might drink it
 All of it
 Who am I kidding
 Tomorrow won't be better
 Things will only get worse

**NOTE: This review will constantly update to accomadate any new changes in my opinion, updates, etc
**INTRODUCTIONStardew Valley
I've heard a lot of things about this game
 A lot of extremely positive things
And I was doubtful
 Was Stardew Valley really that good
 I was afraid that people were just giving it attention because they didn't actually know what a good game was
 And as insulting as it may sound, in my defense, uhhm
 Before buying the game I hadn't really seen what it looked like, or knew what it was about
 I just knew that it was published by the same company, Chucklefish, that had developed Starbound
 I had loved Starbound
 So I was playing completely spoiler free
 Haven't watched any videos, no tips & tricks, just the information of a billion recommended reviews stuffed into my head
So I bought Stardew Valley, and had pretty high expectations
 If a game received THAT much popularity, it should be seriously good, right
WHAT STARDEW VALLEY ISPlop
 Into the world of Stardew Valley
 You completely start from the bottom, trailing after a tragedy and responsibility that's struck
 A farm, barely any money, and the mystery of a town left in your hands
 Whew
 That's really a lot when you think about it
 Boy, did I NOT know what I was getting myself into
At first,
it was kind of boring
 And any new game you buy will always be like that
 The beginning's all new and immersive, and the middle
 kind of leaves you stuck
 And that's one of the most challenging parts for a lot of people: getting through that middle
 When you begin, you spot all the challenges you'll face, which is daunting, because you can instantly tell: you're going to have to freaking work hard to be a master at this game
The thing with Stardew Valley, It's all about exploration and management
 Discovering and figuring out secrets and a beautiful story was amazing
 Creative mechanics and powerful creativity had combined to produce a fabulous well-formed game that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth, and I'm going to tell you right now
 it's totally addicting
 I bought the game a few days ago, and literally have played it all day since
 I've NEVER done that with a game before
 I found myself as a kid in a candy shop, gaping at all the different flavors, and being able to savor them all
 And now, in Year 3 of the game
 I still have a lot more to discover
 The creator, ConcernedApe, was brilliant when coding this game
 He created all the aspects of Stardew Valley, and it took him ONLY four years
 How
 I've seen games that took ten years to develop
 and they still had less than Stardew Valley
 (Thank you, commenters
)PLAYINGCompared to others, I've only played around 80 hours of the game thus far
 Buy Stardew Valley
 You really won't regret it
 This game is beautiful
 The music is whimsically lifting, and the soundtrack is wonderful
 It's a work of art
 You will find yourself falling in love with the characters, and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people, and who changes everyone for the better
Let me tell you this right now: the game rewards for the hard-working
And you might be thinking: "what in the world do I mean by that
"I literally mean what I say
 Stardew Valley is a game where you really have to manage things, yet, it allows you to explore the whole art of it
 Work hard as you play the game, and there are sweet rewards
 And I'm talking about rewards sweeter than all the candy in that candy shop
Here's the thing: you can take two routes with Stardew Valley
 You can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game, or you can immerse yourself in exploring the town and what the game has to offer, but with also missing the point that Stardew is a management farming game
Or, you can successfully find the balance between both
 But how
Stardew Valley allows you to store multiple accounts, which is fantastic
 I recommend exploring with your first account, and learning the ropes
 You seriously won't know anything yet, and will be like "OMFG" when you figure out there's a way that makes things one hundred times easier
 After that, create a second account, and start figuring out farm management and what the game has to offer
 I thought I was pretty boss with the second account, but I realized I could get a whole lot more with a third account since I now knew shortcuts and everything
 So I created a third account, and successfully balanced management and exploration
 Now I'm left in a spot where I can successfully thrive, and only continue to grow
THE PROS- Enchanting music that sings as you play- A simple yet fun art design that you can't help but fall in love with- Characters whom capture your heart- A shambled town that begins to thrive- Hidden secrets that you can't help but want to keep discovering- Amazing challenges that leave you wanting more- The awe of wandering through an amazingly formed game- Brilliant originality, which is incredibly difficult to find- A storyline that changes your perspective beautifully- Lots of fun, and I mean lots
- Mods created by the community to make your game more fun and immersive- however, I play without mods
THE CONS- As I said, the game rewards you for hard work
 But only for hard work
 It can be a grueling process, but it is extremely profitable
 Those who don't like putting effort into a game won't enjoy Stardew Valley as much as other games
- Time
 Stardew Valley takes a lot of time to play through
 It's a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on
- Repetitive
 The game can be grueling
 To reach certain goals you have to go through processes that you will SERIOUSLY hate
 But, in the end, it's definitely worth the labor
PLACES TO IMPROVE**NOTE: Some of these "improvements" may have spoilers, however, none of them reveal any actual information about the game and what happens, as it is common knowledge and will really not spoil anything
 This category talks about bugs and things that need to be fixed
 So if you haven't bought Stardew Valley, it's not too concerning, but you may read it if you wish
- According to MasterBlade's review, there was a crash that deleted all his/her's progress of 61 hours
 I haven't come across this problem, yet
- In the Egg Festival during the Egg Hunt, there is an egg in the right corner of a bush next to Mayor Lewis' house
 When you try to click on the egg, Jas' dialogue pops up, even though she has already walked off-screen
 I find this annoying, as the triggered text prevents you from moving, and thus, lose the Egg Hunt
 (I lost once because of that
 Not a big deal, but it may be for new players
)- In the Egg Festival there is also an out-of-bounds glitch
 If you go to the top area (where you would walk to the Community Center) and walk up to the very top barrier (to where you can't walk forward anymore)
 Then, go left, and you're out-of-bounds
WHY IT'S JUST STELLAR Stardew Valley offers a lot of things, and has changed the lives of many people
 Perhaps in peace, wonder, open-mindedness, the game gives a lot
 But I have one thing that's been bothering me for a long time
 How in the damn world did one single person spit out a freaking awesome game
Even though it's a farming game, which is commonly found everywhere, it's original with its own spins
 It's extremely difficult to find a game that has such a captivating message that's been developed so well
 Stardew Valley is a lot of fun and awe, and it really draws a blank in your mind
Buy Stardew Valley
 At first, it might seem boring
 but keep playing
 Trust me, the candies are still sweet
 And they really only get sweeter

This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years
 I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory
 I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA
 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game
 Farming
 The farming is fantastic
 It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy
 Being able to design your farm any way you want it
 yes please
 Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold
 it's so enjoyable and addictive
 Fishing
 The fishing is outstanding
 From playing WoW and Runescape
 or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun
 At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time
Mining and combat
 Mining and combat is incredible
 Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard
 (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder
) Social
 Social interactions are great
 Being able to become friends with the people in the town,
and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them
 what's not to like about that
 And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses
 The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice
 Main story
 The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you "complete" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did
 Yes, I was a tester for the game
 Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours
 It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this
 However you have to remember, I was a tester
 I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes
 I still love this game
 I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them
 And that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too
 ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game
 And that's true
 The experience that you have with this game IS amazing
 Minutes playing turn into hours
 Hours turn into "oh no it's time to sleep"
You will forget about time
 You will forget about sleep
 You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back
 So yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to "escape" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016

I'm genuinely impressed an indie game of this scale made by one guy isn't stuck in an eternal early access, but is instead provided as the full package right off the bat
 This is how it was done a decade ago, and this is how it should still be done

Can I just say thankyou to the developer of this game I suffer with depression and stardew valley gives me a reason to do somethng other than sleep it makes me feel like I have an impact of peoples lives (even if its only in game people)
 I have played 200+ hours playing this game that's 200 hours distracted from my real life problems
 I have oped(SP) in to be a beta tester, this is the first game I've ever done this with thanks to the developer for saying how to do that I really admire him for creating such a good game and hope he goes far in his career and he never loses the magic, Thankyou

I spent three years building up hype, and I was still blown away
If you enjoyed Harvest Moon, Rune Factory or Animal Crossing - then get this
 It captures all the same things that made those games great, and it's the perfect game to play either casually or seriously
 There are so many different ways to earn money and they're all developed and fun, the hardest part is choosing which one to spend your time doing
The progression curve in the game is fantastic too
 Every day you'll feel like you're making progress but there's still always something to work towards and you won't 'beat it' after a couple of hours earning as much money as possible, as there's always something to spend your money on
 Even after 20 hours of playing, I feel like I'm nowhere near the endgame, and I could easily see myself playing through again and doing things differently
 I'm even doing a playthrough on YouTube and the progress feels dramatically different even in its early stages
I'm easily disappointed by games, so you can imagine my surprise when I was so impressed by a game made by one person
 Congratulations, ConcernedApe, you've made one of the best games I've ever played

Overview
Stardew Valley is a game that borrows heavily from similar titles in the Harvest Moon series
 You start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables
 The game is simple in its understanding: build a farm, make profits, live your life
 What the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered
 You're left with the freedom to explore the town, its residence, mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time
 Sure, there are events to attend, festivals to see, men/women to romance and marry, kids to have, buildings to construct, fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay (Dragon Warrior, anyone
), but how and when you do those things is up to you
 In essence, the game offers you very similar things to do as a Harvest Moon game does: Build and upgrade your farm, plant crops, upgrade tools, mine in the never-ending dungeon for precious ore, go fishing, romance and get married
etc
 While some of your old favorites are back, new aspects have been introduced as well, but I won't spoil those in this review
 Let's just say there's a nice story that evolves over time
The freedom to do as you please is what makes this game, and Harvest Moon in general, so enjoyable
 It's a chance to mellow out, play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer
 What Stardew Valley does, it does right
 It's charming, cute and feels rewarding, even when all you're doing is cuttings weeds
 It doesn't pull any punches or try to be something its not; the developer had a goal in mind and Stardew Valley is a reflection of just that
 You can feel the effort, the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years
 Stardew Valley is a gem and worth looking at
 If you loved Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley
To date, Stardew Valley is a single player game, though the developer as mentioned some form of co-op or multiplayer availability in the future
 Pros
Character Customization - Always good, always wanted
Visuals - In the style of the SNES
 They're colorful detailed and a delight
 Game Pace - Fast, slow, or somewhere in the middle
 It's your call to make
 Content - There is a lot more to do than I first imagined
 There are many hidden layers inside the game as you progress the storyline
Cons
Combat - It's a tad basic since that isn't the core of the gameplay
 A single hack/n slash mechanic Citizens - I'd love to see more citizens (even temporary ones during the year) come and go to make the town feel more "alive"Overall, Stardew Valley is a pleasure
 I haven't put a ton of time into it (yet), but I easily see that happening
 It's fun, lighthearted and addictive
 As I said earlier in this review, if you've ever played Harvest Moon, you'll enjoy Stardew Valley
 It's worth checking out and I highly recommend it
 This will easily become one of my most played games on my list
 You won't be disappointed, so check it out

The new update promises to improve the quality of your marriage
 Doesnt work, my wife is still pretty upset I play Stardew Valley so much

Ok so far from my game this is what I got:> farming for first week> mayor tells me to socialize with the townfolk> decide to talk to random people> lots of talking> finally think i met everyone> try to interact with trashcan> find a salad in trash, untouched> girl sees me digging in trash> girl gets grossed out from me digging in the trash> get mad, decide to follow her> catch her walking towards lake> turns out shes pretty> want to know how to marry her> find out that i can gift people> dont know what to gift> remembered i had salad from the trash that she saw me grab> give salad to her> she loves it> advance a year or two later> me and girl are marriedI don't understand women, both in this game and in real life
10/10 would dig in trash again 
Posted: 4 December, 2016
I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories
 She would always buy me the new one for Christmas, and we would play it all day, filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry
 Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum
 Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed
 It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work
 Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created
 I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game
 I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten

There is a character in this game that is suffering from depression, it has helped me see my own illness and I have learned to deal with it in a much healthier way soley because of how my character interacts and helps them
 The characters in this game are beautiful, and not just in their artwork
 Their stories and the cutscenes have drawn me in more than just a regular farming game
 I was truely excited to marry Leah and nervous that she would turn me down (Even though she was at 10 hearts and I knew she wouldn't)
I have spent 80 hours in this game so far and I am in spring of year 3 waiting on my first child
 This game has kept my attention and I am looking forward to many more hours
 I give this game 10/10 rating

You feel an evil presence watching you
 This is the sort of game that you boot up thinking you'll spend an hour or two on, only to one day wake up face down on your keyboard surrounded by bottles and plates wondering where the past 3 weeks went
 100 hours in and I've still not defeated the current 'final' boss, something that's a mixture of the games' excellent difficulty curve, and a melancholy realisation that once I defeat him, my time with the game will naturally come to an end
 Primarily, Terraria is a sandbox game
 You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instruction, eventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the night, discover some form of corruption eating away at the world, encounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies
 Despite all this, you are given little direction, these are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wish, encountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace
 Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earlier, meaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle
 Although traditional RPG elements are largely absent, a discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeated, meaning if you don't progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesn't become more difficult
 In fact, the first boss doesn't spawn until you're suitably equipped with armour and health
 My hours in the game are split roughly equally between single and multiplayer
 Single player stands up on its own perfectly fine, but in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bosses, as the feeling of reaching new goals is shared, and the ammount of 'grinding' for materials is spread across multiple people
 It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrack, as if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expected
 Enemy design is exciting and unique, with floating eyes, possessed suits of armour, giant robotic worms, and a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances
 That being said, whoever on the design team is responsible for 'hellbats' has earned a special sort of hatred from myself
All in all Terraria is an amazing experience from beginning to end, its tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its exploration, and fearful excitement at its combat
 It's a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories I've made, and to forge new ones
 It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubt, these hours I have spent were not wasted
 I heartily recommend that you purchase this game
Fortune and glory kid

Honestly, I don't know why Terraria has so many haters
 This game literally has everything
 Fun to play, tons of things to do, bosses to kill, ofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friends, items to farm, a lot of stuff and decorations to build with, not to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the game, you can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new features, items, ect 
When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it
 That's just how the game works
 Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting day, but it's also the perfect entertainment for your free time
 10/10

You can be a werewolf riding a unicorn while shooting rainbows from a gun
 You can build teleporters, find a hair dresser in a spider cavern, and get a sword that shoots cats
 You can take on the lord of the moon using a yoyo, summon a sharknado minion that shoots sharks at your enemies, and find sky temples where air wyverns spawn
 You can buy a music box from a wizard and go record the music that you like the most so you can have it playing in your base whenever you want, and then you can go build a castle made entirely out of white marble
 It would seem the only thing Minecraft has over this game is 1 dimension
 Trust me, once you get used to it and start learning about the game, Terraria is simply one of the most satisfying sandbox experiences out there
 It may sound rude, but compared to this, Minecraft just has no imagination

UPDATED EDIT 7/6/2015: With the release of Update 1
3, Terraria has become three hundred times better
 Update 1
3 adds in loads of new items, monsters, bosses, events, and more
 The new bosses are a really big challenge and very cleverly done
 The addition of achievements is addicting to any player who loves to hunt achievements, like myself
 Including the new gamemode known as "Expert Mode" which is basically like turning the difficulty up to 'brutal'
 Lots of other changes as well, like new textures and sounds, and the new addition of world stats to keep track of how many of each type of monster you kill (Which now rewards you with banners)
 How I Found Out About "Terraria"I found out about Terraria the same way I use to always find games, YouTube
 I randomly came across a video called "Terraria"
 I took a look, and instantly fell in love with what I saw, and knew I had to have the game for myself
 It looked like a great combination of gerne' that I love to bits
 Being a Minecraft fan since the beggining of Alpha, I knew I MUST have it
Unfair First ImpressionsWhen ever you ask someone about Terraria, read a review, or watch a video, 95% of the time you hear "Minecraft clone" or "2D Minecraft"
 Which is incorrect on so many levels
 If you have heard this many times, and are thinking twice about actually playing Terraria, please read on as it is nothing like Minecraft
 Review Of Terraria Terraria is a very unique game for what it does
 There have been games like it in the past, but the amount of content and play ability is beyond anything I've ever seen before
 Terraria is a sandbox, RPG, action, etc
 2D game
 It does it's thing very well
 I haven't noticed any UI bugs, or ones that I have, are fixed almost instantly after the patch is released
 The gameplay it provides is not only smooth, it is addicting and fun
 The combat system in the game is perfect for me, and a lot of others
 There are so many enemy types in this game that are not copy paste, each one does their own thing and has their own weaknesses & strength's Example on the kind of enemies you could come across
 Normal walking/running enemies, that have a soul objective to charge you until death
 These may include enemies like the zombie or skeleton
As there are other enemies who will do the same thing, but in a different way (So not everything is copy/paste
)
 Like the slime enemy type, which come in many varieties, which will bounce towards you
 Or the spider enemy type, which will walk on the ground, but can also climb on the walls to get to you quicker
 Just to name a few
"Well, how do I defend myself against these enemies
"Good question
 Let's get that
Items & FurnitureThis is where Terraria gets big
 Even though the world's are limited, they provide so much that you could spend 800 hours of game time on a single small world and still have many things to do
In the world of Terraria, there are alternate versions of almost everything
 What I mean by this is, each world you have will not be the same
 For example, there is a 50/50 chance when loading a world to have the default version of something, or the alternate
 Such as the music that plays, there are different tracks for the same biomes, just depends on what random one you got
 Or for textures on things like, grass, and trees
 Also things like ore, in a default world you would have Copper as your basic ore, but in an alternate world, you'd have Tin as your basic ore
 What this does is really expands the play time someone can spend in Terraria
 Allowing a single person to play the game over and over, and never have the same experience
 Below the surface are loads of blocks, dirts, ores, and more
 Ore like Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, Silver, Platinum, Gold, Cobalt, etc
 And blocks like normal dirt, clay, stone, mud, cobwebs, and so many more
 You need these ores to make your weapons and armor
 You can find treasure deep underground, that holds many valuable things
 You can increase your maximum health by finding Life Crystals underground
The weapon range in this game is massive
 You even have magic weapons, like spell books, and mana weapons
 There are also bows, swords, pickaxes, axes, guns, lazers, cannons, familiars, and so much more
I won't get into to much detail here, but the amount of content in this game is massive, and it's still being updated
 Sure, Terraria has been through some rough times with updates, but when it gets an update, the update is full of new things and changes
 Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating)Overall, Terraria is a great game that you can spend hours of time in, and still be having fun in many years to come
 It's a steal for the price of $9
99, and especially when there is a sale that lowers the game to $2
00 or less
 This game is definitely a choice for sandbox gamers looking for an easy to slip into, addicting experience
 Pro's:+Loads of content for hours of game time
+Great combat system
+Smooth gameplay, that's easy to slip into
+Provides a good challenge
+Fun and creative boss battles
+Amazing side events that you cannot resist
+Achievements are addicting to those achievement hunters
+Expert & Hardcore modes add hundreds more hours of gameplay and possibility
Con's:-No infinite world option
 (Doesn't drop overall score - But can be annoying to some players)-No easy way to edit worlds before creation (Like choosing whether to have Crimson or Corruption)Overall Rating: Is about a 14
5/15 (Must Own

 I prefer Minecraft for the building and the survival
 Terraria has a good array of things you can use to build but I like to use Minecraft because of the complexity of machinery you can make using all the complicated gizmos and gadgets in it
 As for survival, it's exceptionally fun in Terraria but I like it in Minecraft as well due to the sheer size and randomness of a world
 In Terraria everything is more or less always the same; corruption/crimson, hell, space, etc
 but in Minecraft there are so many more places to choose from
 But all the same, Terraria can be fun too
So, opinions aside, due to our comparisons
 TERRARIA WINS
right
 You see, it isn't about who has more of what
 It's about the way to play
 The way to enjoy it
 You enjoy building, being creative, making pixel art
 Play Minecraft, it's the perfect game for you
 Don't have much taste for being a super builder, but like adventuring, fighting, bosses, etcetera
 Play Terraria

If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them
If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone
If you don't have the game to play, get the money for it
If you don't have the money for it, get a job
If you don't have a job, rob the bank
If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried

Early Access Review
I started a co-op factory with a close friend
 After a day of work, I stepped back, looked at what we built, and came to some realizations
Posted: 12 April
Early Access Review
Help for new players
Rule #1
 When you think you have enough iron, you don't
 Trust me
Rule #2
 When you have backups in your system, don't worry, you'll have shortages later
 Get more iron
Rule #3
 Leave enough room to expand without having to do crazy stuff with your belts
Rule #4
 When you have backups, start storing extras in chests
 You'll need it later
Rule #5
 Crap, I'm out of copper
 Get more copper
Rule #6
 Create entire factory towns for iron plates and copper plates, and build gear wheels and copper cables on site
 You'll thank me later
Rule #6
 Wait, there is automation for automation
 Flying robots
 Check
Rule #7
 Aliens love radars
 Don't put radars near things that matter (like your steam engines) unless you support them with a ton of turrets
Rule #7-a
 Flamethrowers are your friend for killing aliens
 Unless you're in the middle of your town, in which case they are not
Rule #8
 Take enough ammo with you when you go to fight aliens
 It's lots of fun to run out of ammo in the middle of a battle, and it goes quickly
Rule #9
 Don't stand on train tracks when trains are automated
Rule #10
 Blueprints are amazing
Rule #11
 Deconstruction planning forests is amazing
 Clear out wood and gain resources quickly
Rule #12
 Logistics robots change your world
Rule #12-a
 You always need more power
Rule #13
 Oh, there's a better way to build that
 Let me start over
 Again
Rule #14
 Wait, is that the sun coming up already
Rule #15
 Remember your family fondly
Rule #16
 Get more iron
Cracktorio is more accurate

Early Access
 These words may now instantly turn you off a game after buggy games like DayZ or lack of content games like Killing Floor 2 but this game is truly different
 Never have I played an early access which is so well polished, bug free and complete that it feels like you aren’t buying an early version of the game, instead you are buying a complete game which will get a load of free DLC
You start crash landed on a planet with only a few machines and your mind
 You start mining some stone to build more miners but it takes too long, luckily you have a mining drill which will automatically mine for you, great
 But you need a way to power it so you mine some coal and power it
 But where is it going to be stored
 You cut down a few trees to build a chest to place it in and then you got your first set up complete
 But one machine will take ages and you got to mine more coal, copper and iron (as well as smelt it) too
 After some more mining and tree cutting you have a set-up which will mine all the ores you need
 But having to run around and place coal in is inefficient and having 6 different chests for each resource is messy
 “There’s got to be a better way
” you say like an infomercial, well there is Kevin
 Inserters which will pick up items and place them behind the inserters and conveyer belts which move items
 After some fiddling around with this you make a set up which mines everything and stores it into one box
 But you still have to power everything with coal, is there a way to improve it
 Of course, there always is
 This is the basics of the game, you are constantly improving on what you have with the goal of making the factory as efficient and automated as possible
Combat – Although this seems weird in a factory building game, it is actually implement really well
 It keeps you on your toes and limits what you can do
 If you focus just on production you aren’t going to be able to fight off an attack which can wipe your factory out, forcing you to start again
 You can’t skimp out on any factory or risk losing everything and the more you pollute, the more powerful enemies you will have to face, the more turrets you will have to place
 Weapons & defence – Fear not, you are also able to craft weapons and armour which will help you fight off enemies
 Pistols, Shotguns, Grenades, Mines, even personal defence robots which automatically fire at enemies
 But what about defence
 Do I just have simple iron and copper armour
 Nope, Power Armour
 Armour which you can install modules which can increase speed, generate shields, shoot enemies and more
 My personal favourite is the roboport which allows you to summon robots who can build blueprints and repair them, allowing me to set up a fortified base in seconds
Advance & interesting Technology – Later in the game you unlock more advance and interesting technology, some which allow you to automate object crafting extremely quickly which can further be improved by modules
 Robots which can be ordered to supply machines with crafting components so you never have to refill one again or robots which can build entire bases and repair them when they get damaged
 Cars, tanks, trains, ways to transport you and supplies around, allowing you to create separate bases with each having a different focus
 You are constantly unlocking more and more technology which will make you rethink your entire factory set-up
Gameplay – I am constantly put into “the flow” where I am completely focused which causes time to go by much faster than it feels like
 I am constantly fixing one thing only to find out another is broken, restructuring my factory to be more efficient, and fortifying my bases
 There is something quite satisfying about having a compact base which just works
 Multiplayer – This game features a full multiplayer co-op experience which works flawlessly
 The only thing more fun than building a factory by yourself is building it with your mates
 50 hours on one multiplayer game, and we haven’t even modded the game yet
This is seriously one of the most interesting games I’ve played on steam, I’ve already got well over my money’s worth and I have no intention of stopping
 I can't recommend this game enough to anyone who likes management games
Note: Killing Floor 2 is not a bad game at all, the way they are handling early acess is the problem

I got Factorio out of boredom
 You see, I'm sick, I got the flu so I'm home and none of my usual games are doing it for me
 So I got Factorio
 25 bucks, 350 MB
 The hell is this
 I feel I got robbed
 So I give it a whirl
 14 hours later I stumble into the kitchen for my first meal of the day
 Bloodshot eyes, head throbbing, ears buzzing with the sound of inserters doing their thing and then I go to sleep
 I can't sleep because all I dream about is building a better automated factory
 10/10 would ruin my life again

Early Access Review
This isn't so much a game as it is a digital Zen Garden
 I've lost hours (400+ apparently) tweaking my factory
 Sometimes to make it look prettier
 Sometimes to rebuild it because I need space for yeah another stream of components
 Sometimes just because I've approached Zen and don't want to give it up
For every bottleneck in material flow you find and fix, you'll create two more
 And once you've got everything working perfectly, Your factory will be stalled because of resource exhaustion, spitters and bitters, or a new production option changes your resource needs
 If that sounds like the kind of challange you enjoy, this game will provide you rediculous value for your money

Early Access Review
Factorio is a game that sneaks up on you
 You start out so simple, harvesting some coal and iron, chopping down a tree or two
 Then you plonk down a machine that starts mining iron ore for you, and you feed the result into a furnace
 You build more machines, then some inserters
 More machines, and it becomes easier to link up a few things with conveyor belts
Four hours later you look down on a factory system so complex you couldn't have designed it; and yet it grew so gradually, so organically, that at no point you felt overwhelmed
You look at the time - maybe ten more minutes; you want to quickly redesign this bit around your assemblers to fit in another conveyor belt
 It would speed up the production of green electronic circuits
Three hours later you realize that you should have been in bed for hours, but you can't stop now - you just build a tank and you really want to try it out on that alien base that has been growing way too much
Factorio is fun
 As simple as that

If you are looking for a game that requires you to manage your time, resources, power, and even amunition, look no further
 I have looked for a game like this for years
 A game that is survival, but you can thrive instead of just surviving by making robots and machines do everything for you
 I have already recomended this game to 5 or 6 of my friends
 If you have the money, and like using your brain to overcome problems and build things, BUY THIS GAME
The good-Great for unlimited play
 There is always more to do
-Multiplayer is super fun, and much less laggy then anticipated
-The enemy progression system is near perfect-Runs very well, even with over 300 robots all doing different things on the screen
-Very customisable world-Very smooth controls-The combat robots are awesome-Modules and suit upgrades out the wazoo-The logic systems and rail systems are very polished and well done-Most early access games I have played, I have found many bugs
 I have not found a single bug in this game
-The blueprint system is easy, efficiant, and well done
-Robots are very polished and do what they're supposed to very well
-Devs are awesome
-Best builder/tower defence game I have ever playedCould use some work-Vehicles are a little sub par, but still fun to use-Armor augmentatin system is a little broken
 I should not be able to run faster then a train, or take on a max level enemy base with a shotgun-Inserter speed is limited for extreme late game
 I found myself needing 2 or 3 fast inserters just to load enough copper into one assembler for wire-lack of enemy types-Water and lake boundries, and some way to clear them or build over them

This game doesn't feel like a Early Access game at all
Addicting and very satisfying when your factory works
 I find myself staring at different parts of it for a few moments, it's captivating
 Also frustrating when you thought something would work and it doesn't, then you have to change your setup
I never built massive factories nor did I launch a rocket, but I still enjoy making my factory grow modestly
 Being attacked is an annoyance but wrecking the bugs' nests feels good

So before i begin with this review : Yeah we all know Rust is a laggy piece of sh*t sometimes, so i won`t discuss this here
Pros- Great concept- Stunning graphics- Game mechanics are great- The combat system is good- The crafting system is very good- Weekly updates
 Which is one of the most important things for an Early Access game
- Good and serious developers, who listen to the community- Modding is easy, and the community has almost full access to modding- SkinsCons- Not optimised for extreme potato users, but that is not a main problem i
m
o- The community can be cancerous at times, but that is life
 Not everyone you meet will be nice or help you
- Server creation is a little complicated, but if you are stubborn enough you will learn how to do it / manage it

I love this game, I built a house around a guys house and made him my prisoner, I fed him cans of tuna and cooked chicken when it was available, and some times I would drop in spare logs of wood(when they were available)
 The best part
 he talks to me, keeps telling me his clans going to raid my structure and save him
 I simply respond with 
” It puts the lotion on its skin, or it gets the hose again” and by hose I mean I dump charcoal on him
-Great game hope the servers come up soon, I think my pet may need to eat

Early Access Review
After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust
 I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped
 Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust)
 I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith
 After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear
 We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them
 I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it
 I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across
 A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow
 I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away
 When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones
 The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined
 Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start
 I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me
 It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking
 I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines
 He simply wrote "Sorry guys :D" This is the single problem that I have with games like this
 Why does it have to be "shoot-on-sight
" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us
 Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area
 But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets
 Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players
 All in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while
 I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game
 People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience

Day 1I seem to have woken up on a mysterious island, I don't remember much
 All I have is a rock
 I'm scared
There seems to be no sign of other humans
 I do not have any food or shelter yet, however, I was able to obtain a few logs by hitting a tree with this rock multiple times
 What a mysterious island
Day 2I have found a chicken, some more wood, and a few stones, I was able to conceive an amateur, handmade axe, it only took a few seconds to make, so I was able to kill the chicken too
 I have also gathered a fairly large pile of wood, I might be able to build a makeshift shelter, but for now
Tonight I feast
Day 3Today is the day, I will finally build a shelter, I can feel the warmth of a warm bed and fire already
 I haven't felt this good since I was a child, playing with my toys, I remember one toy more than most, it was called a "Steam", ahh, the good ol' days
I will be home soon
 I promise
Day 4I'm sorry
I have killed a man
It all happened so fast, he was holding a gun, I was debating on making peace with him, but he seemed the brutal sort
And all of his gear, it was
 Enticing
He must have had a family, but I am becoming selfish it seems, I don't care about the man that I have killed
All that I can think of is one thing, not my family, not his family
But tonight I feast
Day 5I've come across a small, abandoned town, there seems to be a lot of loot within the area
The only problem is that I obtain a heavy dose of radiation if I go into the barriers
I have a choice: Obtain what's necessary to survive and die from radiation, or live on how I am now
 In poverty
I think I'll live
Just for a while longer
Day 6I saw a man today, outside of my cabin, he was naked and he had a rock
 He seemed to have been yelling incomprehensible jibberish, he must be insane
 I remember when I was like that
I still am in a way
Day 7I don't know what to do
The man that I saw yesterday came into my cabin while I was asleep, he held a rock to my head and struck
My life flashed before my eyes, stupid reflex, I grabbed my journal
Remember when I said that I was coming home
 Sadly my dear, you'll have to meet me in heaven
I am bleeding out
 I am in god's hands now

To anyone reading these reviews who is confused by the massive swings between positive and negative, you need to know one thing: Darkest Dungeon is an emotional game
 To people just starting out, it can seem baffling, unfair, and deliberately obscure
 To people who have been playing since Early Access, and who have seen favourite party compositions and strategies rendered obsolete, the Steam reviews page is more of an extension of Reddit than anything else - a place to air grievances (legitimate or otherwise) over a game that they have dedicated a lot of time to
What a lot of these reviews miss out is
 y'know
 the actual review part
 On that front, I would say the following: the core gameplay is rock solid
 At its heart, Darkest Dungeon has taken a minimalist, turn-based, four-man combat system and imbued it with massive potential for tactical thought and personal flair
 Figuring out the best role for each of your heroes (chosen from a fairly generous pool of classes) and suddenly realising a unique way of getting them to synergise is immensely gratifying
 Unlike a lot of games, it doesn't feel like there is a a ring-fenced area of "correct", vanilla play that only the very high-level players can get past; instead, you are encouraged and rewarded for coming up with your own strategies from the get go
 The central combat system is smart, it pushes you to experiment, and there is a lot of room to come up with a playstyle that feels like your own, unique creation
HOWEVER
 If that's all Darkest Dungeon was, it would be a neat tablet-based distraction, but ultimately sterile
 It is the stuff that comes layered on top of it that is the source of its intrigue - and also the source of a lot of the frustration you'll see directed at it
 As a typical RPG player, you naturally do everything you can to guarantee the safety and efficacy of your character(s), and it feels inherently uncomfortable to work in a game environment that leaves you perpetually on your toes and at risk of failure
 DD refuses to let you settle into a comfortable routine, and a massive enemy critical attack, an ambush in pitch-dark while camping, or a series of misses on your part can topple you from a seemingly-unassailable position to a very desperate one
 The potential for a fail-cascade is what turns off many new players, and even drives experienced ones to the occasional rage-review, but it is also vital to the fundamental risk-reward balance of the game, which is designed to punish complacency and encourage the utmost thought on your part
As you progress through a dungeon, you constantly need to balance a dwindling supply of light, food, sanity and health (although they can be restored in some ways), while also trying to complete objectives and collect much-needed loot with limited backpack space
 Usually, this is the sort of gameplay I dislike; feeling that there is a time-limit, that I can't plough through something at my own speed in relative safety, is an uncomfortable experience after most games
 However, the actual result is some very effective tension
 In a normal RPG (say
 Diablo), the steady drip of ever-increasing numbers is satisfying in a functional sort of way, but in DD the stakes are so high that getting a critical hit or dodging a huge attack always feels like a
moment
rather than just a nice bonus
 It can initially feel punishing and unfair, since most gamers are hard-wired to see a hero death (which is permanent), a catastrophic turn-around, or a "tactical retreat" as a failure
 Likewise, the element of randomness can make it feel like your hard work and smart play has not been rewarded, like you're just a random collection of atoms buzzing around in a meaningless void where there is no God or higher authority to dispense justice or distinguish right or wrong
 It takes time to realise that you were never
meant
to have it easy, that it's
always
been a gamble, and you can't expect a perfect S ranking - all you can do is make the best play you can with the information you have
 It takes time to realise that the game is pushing you to accept loss and difficulty as part of the game, rather than a failure
 Even I rage quit every now and then - but I always come back, because, as I said, Darkest Dungeon is an emotional game
 You invest (real) time and (fake) money in your group of heroes, the odds are massively stacked in the House's favour, none of your guys is going to come out unscarred, you are going to face some serious setbacks, but you return because actually making it, actually landing that last hit at the last possible moment, realising you've scraped through again, is always a surprise, and an amazing one at that
Posted: 19 June
Reviewers blaming this game's RNG for their failures is frankly embarrassing
 especially when they say "the game is not hard, but the RNG is unfair
"
RNG management is the game
It's like saying "golf isn't a hard game, but it's unfair that I'm expected to get the ball in the cup
" Darkest Dungeon is a great game; don't let people who are bad at adapting and/or assessing their skill level deter you from getting it
I'm no slouch at these kinds of games, but I've had zero full party wipes in 150+ hours, and one-shotted the final two dungeons going in blind on my first playthrough
In short:
"These nightmarish creatures can be felled
 They can be beaten
"

Early Access Review
This is a living review, I will continue to update it as my experience evolves; see comments for additional updates
TL; DR Overall, the game is fun and I can foresee getting many hours of solid gameplay out of it which is why I have recommended it
Be prepared to experience the consensus "cons"; which can be blisteringly frustrating in the early game
If you think those things will be enough to trump the enjoyment you would get from the things the game does well, do not purchase it
The most common criticisms of Darkest Dugeon are the inability to turn off combat animations, combat speed, dialogue animations causing you to be unable to interact with anything until completed, and RNG
All of these things exist in varying degrees
Combat animations + dialogue have the potential to draw combat out for far too long
The animations themselves, while cool, can start to feel really repetitive if you're having a bad stroke of RNG (missing a lot, despite a high chance to hit)
They also are very herky-jerky (there's a zoom during an animation) that leaves me feeling like I'm rocking on a boat
If I play on an empty stomach, sometimes I feel slightly nauseous
The chat bubbles also leave something to be desired
They become repetitive very quickly and interupt the flow of exploration and combat
I suspect they were included to create atmosphere, but I find they actually detract from it because of how herky-jerky they become - this causes your immersion to be regularly broken up/halted
This is typically only an issue if your party is afflicted by negative quirks or your torchlight is dimming
Characters become more talkative when things are going poorly
RNG
I originally wrote that I didn't find this particularly irritating and chalked up the experience to most people just being unfamiliar with game mechanics (IE Chance to Hit, Resistances, etc)
I've chosen to recant that
RNG is crippling, but only in the early game
Darkest Dungeon's biggest
problem, in my opinion, is the early vs late game balance
Early on, resources are tight
You don't have a ton of gold that can afford you to recoup your losses if you have to abandon a mission
You don't have a town that has been upgraded to reduce the cost of removing negative quirks/high stress levels
Due to this, you often feel overwhelmed - particularly if you have a bad stroke of RNG (IE
 You get crit multiple times early in a dungeon, multiple characters have very high stress levels from it, etc)
Later in the game, once you've upgraded your town some, prices aren't has crippling (maybe 750-1000 gold instead of 1500) AND you're getting more money from missions
In addition, you might be able to remove quirks from 2 characters at a time, instead of just one
As the game progresses, you almost start to feel overpowered - not in the traditional sense, as things can still go terribly wrong, but when compared to your early experience where EVERY thing feels stressful
Getting crit increases stress by 15-20
Landing a crit reduces stress by 5-10
Therein lies many of the inherent problems in every facet of this game
When something goes wrong it is always nearly TWICE as punishing as the beneficial aspect of something going right
My personal biggest qualm has to be the lack of an easy way to discern combat attack order
There exists a "SPD" stat, which I assume is speed and I also assume determines attack order
Rifling through each monsters' stat in an effort to figure out what will be attacking when is not an intuitive, efficient, or easy system
It also feels like the order isn't static, as the encounter progresses the same monster isn't always attacking in the same spot (or so it seems - I could be incorrect in this claim)
The reason this is problematic is because it forces you to pay astronomically close attention/have an excellent memory of when something attacked to determine whether you should disable (stun) or gamble for a kill (powerful regular attack)
This becomes further complicated when trying to "combo" attacks
IE
 Stun with a character so another class that has an attack with a dmg increase against stunned targets can eliminate it
Since combat positioning matters, if I stun, then my character gets pushed into a different position, and the new position renders me unable to use my bonus dmg against stunned targets attack, I have essentially wasted that initial action
Beyond some of these troubling mechanics, most of which I foresee being tweaked to be less punishing/better tuned, the game has some very neat features
Stress, while annoying to some, was a big selling point for me
I would like to see stress become more balanced around fight/flight
What I mean by that is, currently, it feels like the vast majority of stress mechanics are negative
Indeed, I would say upwards of 80% of the time my characters have become stressed they have suffered negative mechanics as opposed to positive
I would like to see this number brought closer to 50/50
Not to get too invested in "real life" comparisons, since this game is hardly reminscent of "real life", but stress serves a pretty strong evolutionary purpose and definitely is not something that is 80% negative (even if it has been shown to reduce your life span)
The same could be said of what happens when you "gamble" on opening chests/sarcophagus
It feels, more often than not, like this is a greater risk than potential reward
Combat positioning and class synergy are very cool
Unfortunately, I don't think they are explained in a proficient way for new players which leaves one floundering in the dark for quite some time
This type of trial and error experience feels a little bit exhausting
Perhaps the addition of a tutorial or "practice" mode that has some examples of "combos" would be helpful
IE
 a guide that says, "Try using class X ability Y following using class Z ability T"
The town is also neat
The availability of upgrades makes it highly customizable and meaningful
Much like the class system and synergy, though, it can feel quite confusing and overwhelming
Resources are definitely finite early on and with so many different options and features to upgrade, I have often felt at a bit of a loss
Discerning what is important in the early game versus what can be ignored until resources start to become plentiful in the late game is extremely difficult
I've heard some argue that upgrading character abilities and weapons/armor doesn't feel worth it for the cost
I whole-heartedly disagree
Upgrades are ABSOLUTELY worth it
Sure, your damage doesn't go up astronomically, but your accuracy does
Accuracy, to me, is probably the most important stat
Also, they aren't that pricey as long as you invest in reducing cost - something that I think people aren't doing
Class balance could be improved
There are a few classes that just feel worthless when compared to their counterparts
I think both Plague Doctor and Leper are worthless
Jester, other than people abusing their "stress heal" mechanic, leaves a lot to be desired as well
Ultimately, this game is really about two phases of gameplay
Early game is soul-crushing and you feel like a victim to every mechanic
When I read negative reviews, I can see why people are frustrated
Early game can be THAT frustrating
Frustrating to the point of wanting to smash your keyboard against the wall
Most of these things are resolved by mid-late game, though
If you survive early game, Darkest Dungeon opens up and becomes incredibly fun
My hope is we will see some tuning regarding early versus late game
I suspect we will
If you don't think early game will be too frustrating or are willing to soldier through that frustration, pick up Darkest Dungeon
The game is done remarkably well and, despite being in an older genre, has a lot of innovation which makes it stand out from its peers
Posted: 2 June
60 hours into the game and I write this review because I've read people mentioning the most simple and constant fact about this game: that it is brutal
 Don't expect to always win, or that everyone will always survive
 Somebody will eventually die, somebody will eventually go insane, and after that there's just more of that
 This games throws whatever it can to make you lose, and even if you win the biggest of fights you won't always be able to win in the end
 Why
 Because this game takes planning and thinking forward to the extreme, and it will trick you into overextending in some way just so that you will die
 And that's great
The game itself, being an RPG, has many stats and many mechanics that interact in one way or another with everything else
 Then why draw a point to it
 Because you must NEVER, EVER underestimate or overestimate those values
 The fact that an attack has 80% of hit chance vs a 95% hit chance is huge in the early levels, and as you go up in difficulty those rifts keep getting bigger and bigger, specially when you can find enemies in the early levels with evasion as high as 25
 It means you need to plan for it
 The fact that an enemy can inflict stress damage to your party, that it can protect another enemy, and that it has particular resistances to certain status can change drastically your aproach to each encounter, and the fact that depending on where you're going you will be facing a specific group of enemies plus some more generic ones
 It means you need to plan for it
 The fact that you can specialize certain classes to be more oriented towards a particular role (most of the time) and that you have only so much money at hand to do so, and that you need to divide it between that, buying better gear so that they won't die (and further specialize them) and keeping them sane
 It means you need to plan for it
 If nothing else, this game is a game about planning as carefully as you can, letting as little to chance as you can
 Because the more you leave up to chance, the higher the chances something will wipe you out, or that you'll drive yourself into a corner you may not want to go into
 But then again, as many other reviewers have said, the game gets too hard if you care too much about all of your characters
 Having to take care of a roster of up to 26 someway-or-another twisted people can only get you so far, and you won't always be able to keep them safe or have enought money to do so
 It is ultimately your choice if you wish to stop caring about everyone but the ones you like the most, or if you wish to go as far a you can trying to veil for both your interests and your whole party's safety
 Also, you must learn about everything anything in the game can do, and plan accordingly to that, ALWAYS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT WHAT HAPPENS IF EVERYTHING GOES WRONG
 If you knows there are enemies that aren't weak to a specific kind of ailment, don't take too many characters that rely on that kind of ailment to do their stuff
 If you know an enemy can heal or deal more damage than another, priotize getting rid of either it or the next biggest threat there is besides it
 If you know your characters have quirks or traits that affect them in certain scenarios, take those too into account when choosing your party and where to go, if not also how much stuff to take to that mission
 If you're trying to kill a enemy that is quite devastating but it can evade everything you throw at him, don't always try to kill it with everything if you are leaving more vulnerable targets that you can kill with less effort stacking up bits of damage against you
 Every action, every health, every miss, every hit, every fight and every event inside the dungeons can make a huge difference when stacked
 So try to always think over what's the optimal way of doing stuff and, if you don't want to get everyone killed, when you're far enough gone that your only reasonable option is to run away
 Luck can be in your favor, but never try to abuse it
Yes
 Darkest Dungeon is unfair

Imagine being stuck in a car for a fourteen hour drive
 With three people you hate
 While every other driver on the road is either drunk or deliberately trying to run you off the road
 And you only have one sandwich left
 And no head lights
 Thats basically what the first few missions feel like
 After that, it only gets harder because your driver has been blighted, your navigator was killed, and the other guy ate the sandwich because he had been driven insane
 Eventually, after replacing a few people, you get to the point where, after a few pit stops, you manage to get rid of them and youre happily riding along with great people, and you think nothing bad is going to happen because youve got the perfect group of passengers
 Then an eightteen-wheeler smashes your car killing all of you
 Thats basically how this game plays
 10/10 would make that drive again

Early Access Review
Games like this are the reason why I really wish Steam's "do you recommend" question had more than just two options
 Here's why: because I would very, very highly recommend this game
 to a certain breed of gamer
 Let me explain
First, the good
Darkest Dungeon is a masterfully crafted game
 The artwork is beautifully grotesque and animation is smooth
 The game is balanced fairly well, even if it is balanced towards the "hard" end of the spectrum
 Even in early access there is nothing about this game that feels sloppy or poorly considered
The stress mechanic, in which your characters accumulate stress which can affect them in various negative (and sometimes even positive) ways, is a really interesting idea and something that you don't really see a whole lot in video games
 The only place I've seen anything like this before would be the Cthulhu games, and I honestly feel like it's handled a lot better here
Oh, and the fact that it's constantly auto-saving, while intended to prevent save-scumming, also has the effect of allowing you to quit and pick back up whenever you want without losing progress, great for people who don't have a lot of time to sit down and play a game
The game wasn't my cup of tea (I'll get to why in a minute) but I can't honestly call it bad just because of that
 It's not bad
 In fact
KR Rating: [5] GREATBut wait, don't stop reading yet, because now it's time for the bad
 As I said before, Darkest Dungeon is a hard game
Well, no, that's not really accurate
 Etrian Odyssey is hard
 That's why I like that series, and it's why I thought I would like this game too
 Darkest Dungeon is not hard, it's unfair
See, you can be riding high one minute, dominating every encounter and getting a ton of good items from the various chests and cupboards (called "curios" in the game) that litter the dungeons
 Then you get into that one battle
 You know the one I mean
 It's the one that doesn't even seem like it should be all that hard
 It's the same enemies you've been wasting with ease this whole time
 Except this time you do nothing but miss your attacks over and over, while they stack critical hit upon critical hit
 Before you can even click the "retreat" button half your force is at Death's Door
 or through it
 It's a little like Dark Souls in a way
And the thing is, that's not an accident
 I said this game was masterfully crafted and it honestly is
 This isn't poor game balance, it's the entire point
 It's the underlying design philosophy of the game
The developers never intended this to be a game where you train up max level badasses and retake the estate
There are no badasses in the Darkest Dungeon
 There are no heroes
No, this is a game where you recruit expendable idiots by the wagon-load (literally) and send them to die for the greater good
 (This is also why there are so few levels of upgrades for your characters: so that restarting when your top character dies is easier
)That's why I say, I really wish that Steam allowed more options than just "recommend" or "not recommend
" Because, on the one hand, the game is very well made
 It has become exactly what I feel the developers wanted it to be
 It is a GREAT GAME
But "great" and "universally enjoyable" are not the same thing
 A lot of people don't like hard games
 I do like hard games and even I was turned off by the unfairness and the inability to properly take care of my people
If I really had to choose (and for the purposes of the Steam version of this review I kind of do) I would say that I don't recommend the game, if only because I think the number of people who would enjoy it are in the minority
That said, if you're the type who thinks you might enjoy that then by all means buy the game right now
 It's only $19
99 USD on Steam right now, and for that you get one Hell of a solid classic-style RPG with an interesting twist
If you're more like me and you get attached to your characters and don't want to see them die (or if you just don't like hard games) then skip this one

I feel like I have to post a new review because all of the reviews that are pre-December, site problems that have been addressed
 Red Hook released a huge bug fix and ease of use patch that was specifically designed so that players who dislike certain mechanics (like the stress for "delaying" a fight) can just turn them off
 Red Hook is a company that does pay attention to the player base, the problem is that the player base is greatly divided
 There is also an extremely vocal minority running a massive smear campaign on the internet, going so far as creating new steam accounts for the sole purpose of going through every positive comment and marking them unhelpful
 While I don't want to get into that, if you want, you can absolutely find information about it
Now that the game is released, you may have seen a certain top review, I urge you to look at his time played in the last two weeks (which includes the time since the game was actually released), and notice that he has not played the game since the release, which means he cannot say whether or not the content has improved
 He has been attacking the game for months, and was (as far as I can tell) initially enraged by the fact that the devs were not interested in incorporating his opinion into their artistic vision, please keep this in mind when considering your purchase
This game is amazing, and I've been playing since early summer
 It has come incredibly far, and anyone who says otherwise is making snap judgements, or flat out lying
 Darkest Dungeon has XCOM levels of difficulty
 It has XCOM level "WTF" moments
 Occasionally you will miss 99% chance to hit attacks, and occasionally enemies will get nigh impossible critical strings
 But just like XCOM, through base building and experience, you can minimize risk and become a force to be reckoned with
 This game is challenging, but not nearly as hard as most negative reviews would lead you to believe
 Most of them say things like "The devs have been trying to remove every winning strategy" or "the game is anti-fun now", but in reality, I haven't met any players new to the game that have problems with it
 This leads me to believe that throughout the development of the game, players found certain strategies that were drastically over-powered (which is why in the discussion boards, there are players that rant about the game being too easy), and the devs introduced changes which reduced the efficacy of these imbalanced strategies (which in any other game would be considered a "balance patch", but apparently in this game, people think it is intended to be "fun-killing")
 One of these strategies (early on) was to get 4 of the same class, and use the exact same attack every turn until you won everything
 This is no longer possible
 This seems like a reasonable balance patch to me
I'm really disappointed that I have to write this review in this fashion
 There is no reason I should be justifying the game against the recent torrent of bad reviews
 This is an amazing game for anyone who likes strategy and/or Lovecraft
 I have 300+ hours for a reason, you might not get that much time out of it, but for context, out of the current 3 difficulty tiers of dungeons, I didnt hit level 2 until 80ish hours
 I really hope you give this game a chance
Edit: Due to some feedback, I would like to make something clear, this game is not XCOM
 It does not have XCOM's production value or quality, and it is not worth 60 dollars
 It is certainly worth it's current price tag, and buying it on sale is a no brainer
Release Edit: Now that the game is out, I can say that the devs really came through, they added a huge number of improvements and content with the final release
 I recommend this game 100%, and it will only get better from here, as there are free content updates scheduled for the next few months

You say you like hard games
You've played Dark Souls, and that's your jam
You're looking through steam titles for something new to try, and this game shows up
Let me tell you:
THIS IS NOT DARK SOULS
I get it, you like hard games which rely on perfect timings and knowledge of the individual frames each move takes up
This isn't that sort of game
It's difficult, but it's strategically difficult
You will always have time to think over your decisions before you make them
This also means that in order to prevent there always being one perfect move, there is an element of RNG in this game
Some people enjoy it, some people hate it, some people use it as an excuse for losing
I hate to break it to you, but if you're losing you're probably making poor decisions
Just because you lowrolled an occultist heal and that caused a character to die doesn't mean you lost to RNG
Maybe you went for damage instead of throwing out a stun
Maybe you didn't bring any stuns
There are many decisions that go into every consequence in this game, and although you might think you are playing perfectly, you're probably not
I know I make mistakes quite often
So take a moment on this game, give it a try
Remember: an element of RNG does not mean your decisions don't matter
If you're playing correctly, you'll pull through
But you will lose characters
You will be forced to explore in the dark, as your gold runs out and stresses run high
If you think you play this game well but you're losing to RNG, recall these wise words:
"Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer"

The Forest is hands down the best Alpha game I have ever purchased
 With that being said, i'd like to list the pros and cons of the gamePROS:-Open world sandbox survival done rightWhen I first got this game, I thought it would just be another one of those build a castle and live forever kind of games
 I was wrong, thankfully
 In The Forest, you can build incredible structures, but the enemies make your life difficult regardless of how good your defenses are
 Want to eat but your food reserves are low
 Too bad
 There's a raiding party of 6 cannibals outside yelling at you about your destruction of the environment
 The more you cut down trees and kil cannibals, the more enemies will come for you

================================https://www

com/user/fdreviews================================Journal Entry 1 After crash landing I have gathered all resources at the plane, walked a short distance from the crash and found a nice hill to build fire and setup camp
 Journal Entry 2 I went down to the beach and started fishing, found lots of beer bottles in the sand, I even found a tent pitched on the beach
 where is everyone
 Journal Entry 3 While setting up camp I saw a group of 3 tribesmen doing a beach patrol in the area where I was fishing, I didn't engage only observed them
 Its getting dark now and I know now that im not alone
 I'm not sure of these tribesmen's intentions but Its starting to rain and I need to build a shelter
 I'm going to the woods to collect some logs
Journal Entry 4 While heading back with a fresh cut log I noticed multiple lit torches heading towards my camp, about 12 of them from what I counted, Indeed it appears there are many more tribesmen than I originally thought
 They appear to be scanning my camp looking for survivors
Journal Entry 5 After observing the tribesmen for 10 or so mins I approached one of the females of the pack, she stared at me in shock for about 30 seconds then screamed and ran away
 She did not attack
 perhaps they are a friendly people after all
 Journal Entry 6 I should have just left them alone, apparently the female ran back to get the rest of the tribe
 I was attacked and chased, I was able to kill three of them before accidentally backing up off a cliff and falling to (what I thought was my death)
 Journal Entry 7 I have awoken in a cave of hanging bodies, I am badly injured from my cliff fall and only have my terribly lit Bic lighter to guide my way through the cave
 this may be my last journal entry as I am starving and going to die soon
 Thank you

WOW
Got out of the plane and ran away as quickly as I could(first time I played they attacked the plane like 3 minutes in the game) So I figured they were attracted by the crash
 Found a quiet place, I built a shelter and made a fire
 Cooked a rabbit, but it started raining so I couldn't keep the fire up, so I found some berries and luckely, they were not poisenous
 Went to sleep woke up early morning and there was 3 naked guys stalking me outside, they attacked me and I ended up slaying all of them
 I built one statue with their heads and legs
Later in the morning, 3 other naked guys came near my shelter, I burned the statue and they ran away
 They came back 5 minutes later with 3 more
 I couldn't handle their attacks, so they kidnapped me
 I woke up in a dark cave with only a lighter to show me the way
 I heared a distant shouting that scared the living crap out of me and I saw about 30 passengers hanged upside down above me
I tried to find my way out of the cave, I almost couldn't see anything and I could hear them, I know they were watching me
 Then after a lot of stress and sweating, I found the exit
 I was so glad to finally see the sun, then some extremelly weird texture rendering just started spawning trees, flowers and life in front of me
 Then went on a run trying to find my shelter but I was very low health
 Got cold
 I got jumped on by a naked girl who were on top of a tree
 She took me by surprise, I shouted in real life, I saw my cat running out of the room scared of me
Finally, I take a close look at the naked girl just before she gives me the final blow, the last comment I have before to die: '' Hey
 I can see her tities''
I survived 2 days
This game has a lot of bugs, they still have a ton of work to do on this game
 But if you are not the kind of person that expect a finished game when you play an early release, you know this game is going to be great
 Keep supporting it, make your friends play it and this could be without a doubt the best survival game ever

This game has oodles of potential
 Nothing more romantic than strolling down a sunset beach being chased by a bunch of naked cannibals
 Makes you feel like a celebrity
Depending on your nature I would suggest, if you are patient: You don't mind set backs,and have a good sense of humour
 Get it now
 It's pretty awesome even with all the flaws
 Regular updates mean you're generally not stuck too long with one issue
 of course with each update you'll generally stumble upon something else to perplex you
 think of it as hurdles
 But everything looks pretty so that's okay
 If you don't enjoy being murdered by flying tables, eaten by land sharks, dislike leviatating geese, backwards rabbits and other such oddities then I suggest you wait it out till the game is more developed

Early Access Review
EDIT: Looks like the reviews that were on top that shouldn't have been are now downvoted
 Thank you everyone for supporting good reviews and motivating the few that do so to continue making quality reviews
***THIS IS A PRE-ALPHA
 This review and the final game are subject to change**Main Menu & Optionshttp://imgur
com/a/DqypyThe Forest is a unique survival game that pits the player against a bunch of mutants in a forest
 Chopping down trees, foraging food and staying warm are just some of the survival aspects that can be found within this game
 [4
5/5] Gameplay - For an early access game, you're spoiled for choice when it comes to building
 It's interesting to note that every plane crash/new game puts you in a different location, at a different time of hour
 I found pleasure in cutting down the trees in the game, as well as carving off the flesh of animals and wearing it as armour
 The backpack system is pretty neat, especially how it's laid out
 What's interesting is how you can get infected from having blood on your body, and needing to wash it off
 I thought that was a pretty neat feature
 Stealth actually works if you aren't already seen, and I've snuck up on my fair share of mutants and initiating
[3
5/5] Combat - NO, there are no conventional guns (only a flare gun) and never will be (although bows are something that might be implemented I hope)
 I can see how that would ruin gameplay
 Now that's out of the way, I feel as though this could be improved or at least more forgiving
 It takes a considerable amount of hits to kill each one, so it's best to tackle one at a time or run if there's a group
 The mutants are pretty aggressive when in close proximity, and god forbit you attack one and more will come
 Whether or not this is a feature or a bug is beyond me, but in it's current state I can say it's not as fleshed out as I would have thought
 In addition, blocking is not implemented, or if it is I don't know what the controls are because
[3
5/5] Controls - Are not shown anywhere
 Yeah this game doesn't hold your hand (which is great, but at the very least provide a control scheme or something
) I checked the options menu as well as the in-game survival guide for instructions but to no avail
 Hopefully they do patch this into the game, and I will update the review accordingly
 From what I've deduced from button mashing and relying on other games for a template, the controls are pretty accessible
 In the future I wouldn't mind rebinding them however
 On the forums, I hear of mouse input going awry or latency issues, but I haven't experienced any as of yet so I cannot comment on that
 What I can comment on though is the
[4
5/5] AI - Which I might say is very polished
 I didn't expect much from the alpha, but everything the developers said about them was true
 Sadly I haven't seen any mutants other than the naked female/male and tribes ones, no "ugly mofos" as of yet (probably due to a distinct fear of delving into these caverns)

Early Access Review
TL:DRIt's worth the money in it's current state
Fiddly building system that allows for very intricate base building
Story is optional
 No need to due anything story related in order to get all game content
Regular updates
Beautiful game
Interesting crafting system
You get to kill cannibals in ever more interesting ways
 (This is worth $15 alone)You get to hunt animals, use skins for crafting, and mount heads on wall of your house
Co-opEven in it's current state, EA, I feel I've gotten more than my moneys worth out of the game
 I haven't finished the game yet, but I've seen videos of people who have
 I'm more interested in base building and waging war on cannibals
 There isn't much of a story
 Your plane crashes, kid is abducted by cannibals, you need to save him
 That's all there is to it
 No quests or anything like that
 As you explore you find pictures drawn by kids, and photos, and empty camps that show others have been here before you
 You need to put forth a good effort to piece together a story
 Almost like a detective
 Find the clues to explain the situation
 It's there if you want it, but seems to be something the devs threw in there as an afterthought
 It's well done imo though
As for the base building
 It's a bit fiddly, and takes some effort to make a really intricate base
 The system of base building allows you to build very complex bases though
 Which is great for when you get a large group of cannibals attacking your base you can make all kinds of fun ways to trap or funnel them into choke points for maximum cannibal crushing carnage
 After every update all the trees you've cut down will respawn
 So getting a bunch of trees suddenly appearing right through the middle of your house is a possibility
 Make sure you build your base around the trees you've cut down, just leave the stumps and build around them
 Cutting the trees that are growing through structures will destroy the structure
The crafting system is fun imo
 No crazy animations or wait times for making rope, molotovs, axes, spears, etc
 Just open the inventory and start combining ingredients
 Certain herbs can be combined to restore health/stam
 Combine 2 deer skin with rope and cloth to make a waterskin
 Feathers and sticks to make arrows
 Add cloth and booze to arrows to make fire arrows
 A watch+coins+booze+circuit board to make a bomb
 Add sap for a sticky bomb
 Pretty simple
 Once you add an item to the crafting mat in the inventory (just right click something to add it to the crafting mat, no clicking and dragging nonsense), a stick for example, a list appears telling you every item you can make using a stick
 A bow, spear, upgraded spear, snowshoes, arrows, club, etc
 It doesn't tell you which ingredients, or how many you will need to make each item though
 So trial and error, or google, is needed
 It's kinda fun
 Almost like a mini game
No voice acting, hand holding, tutorial (besides a very simplistic manual that explains the very basics), or anything like that
 As soon as you wake up in the crashed plane you have the freedom to do whatever it is you want
 No time constraints or anything like that
 This is what i love about the game
 Nothing is worse than having a 30 minute opening tutorial to explain that you have to eat/sleep/drink in order to survive
 Also, no stupid plot points that open up more content
 Like doing a certain part of the story in order to craft fire arrows or whatever
The game is still being worked on with regular updates
 Bug fixes and more content, like craftable/findable items, come every 15 days I think it is
 Something like that
 There are a few items that have no use
 Snowshoes for example
 I would imagine that you will need them in the snow areas, but in the games current state they aren't needed at all
 I see this as a good thing
 It means there's alot more tweaking and game mechanics to be implemented
There is co-op but I've never played it
 Therefore, I will leave this out of the review
 Plenty of other reviews cover this subject I'm sure
At the end of the day, it all comes down to if it's worth the money or not
 In it's current state, I have gotten my moneys worth of enjoyment out of the game many times over
 With more content and updates being added on a regular schedule It will only get more enjoyable

Early Access Review
I highly recommend this game to anyone who can tolerate nudity and gore
 This can be just a survival game as you can turn the cannibals off on the main menu, but to me the cannibals are the meat and potatoes of this game and I find myself sorely missing them should they not come visit me a couple of times a day
 The AI in this game is honestly the best I’ve encountered
 The game now features different types of cannibals with tribes that will fight if you watch silently, but will mostly unite in their hatred of the guy deforesting their land, (you)
 The cannibals will still throw a couple of punches at each other if there’s enough of them around however
 There are starving cannibals who will try to stalk you to find out where you live and try to scavenge off any kills you make, scouts for larger tribes who will often simply run away to alert others of your locations, hunting parties (though I’m pretty sure they’re only hunting you), and cannibals just trying to live out their lives in peace that you can finding sleeping in camps or caves
 Cannibals will duck and roll to evade attacks, climb trees to escape, light tennis balls on fire and throw them at you, wreck your base if you’re not careful, but they’ll also do things like drop effigies which you can catch them praying at if left uninterrupted, they’ll drag their wounded out of battle if they can, and will run off to retrieve others if you let them escape

How many people have you seen in the review section with 100 hours
 That's right
 But I'm not just going to be one of those people who just says, "Yeah, its ok i guess," hinting at their 10000 hours
 Before I go into the review, I would like to give some context
 So, I bought this game around v0
03, and I spent a lot of time just base building, not really caving 'cause I be a wus
 Finally, a while later, I saw the game was at v0
29
 That was when I added 80 hours to my game time
I know the location of every useful item, I have gotten down into the sinkhole, found and alternate route to the katana, ect
 I have enjoyed every last bit
 I'm a bit bored, and waiting till v0
31 to see what it brings, but for know, I will just review
Pros-Can run on a potato, but expect some VERY scaled down resouldtion
 I mean like 520x420
 But that is an extreme
-Can be very smexy, at 1080p with ultra settings, it is truely gorgeous, but you need a supercomputer
-The building system is very flexable
 There is very little snapping, and that is somehing I like
-I know it was added forever ago, but multiplayer was probaly the most beneficial thing to this game
 Ever
-It's fifteen f*cking dollars
 FOR ALL OF THIS
-Still in alpha stages, so more could be added
 (Though I have played more hours of this than there are hours of Dishonored's campaign, so its already worth my money
)-Great community, unless you join a game with a five-year-old who says, "Your in big trouble," and kicks you from game
 That legitimately happened before I wrote this review
 Srsly
 Give me a reason
-Multitude of collectable items
-Interesting lore, or so I think
 There is no wiki page, so you have to explore and find all the burial sites and photos to figure it out yourself
 I could be way wrong
 Look at the end of this review for my personal opnion on the story
-Devs are fantabulous
 Thats not a word
Cons-It is in alpha, so there is more to be desired
-When running The Forest on PotatOS 6
7 [Like that pun :3= 
] and you have it in low res mode, it is so pixelated, my friend thought that a tennis ball was a lemon, and proudly proclaimed, "This is my lemon
"-Feels a but empty once you have gotten to the sinkhole
 So don't rush to get in there
-The inventory system is set up so you can carry a certain amount of a certain item
 It is always the same
 The katana goes to the upper-left, the rebreather next to it, you can only carry 5 dynamite, ect
 The downside in this I find is the lack of inventory management
 It might just be me, but I relish in the orginazational pleasure of shifting item around in my inventory to make room for new ones
 Maybe it is just me and I'm a weirdo, but it's a con for me so it's on the list
-Want an axe for a weapon
 No
 well, tough luck
 Katana is a bit later game so
-I like a heavy focus on the range of items and fauna to be found in a game
 The game is doing better, but my soul is a void, so keep adding to fill it devs :3=Lore- The sinkhole is called a cetone` in the patch notes, which is a Mayan word for abyss
 These cetone`s formed in the yucatun peninsula in Mexico
 This said, the area is not an island, but is blocked of by a mountainous region, indicating it is the southern yucatan peninsula
 The compass points north to the mountains, so it must take place in the southern region of Guatamala
 The Cetone`s were worshiped by the Mayans
 This must mean that the massive Cetone` in the middle of the map was a hub of mayan civilization, as the cetone` there is many times bigger than any one in our knowledge, as they are generally only 30 feet deep
 Perhaps a strange a race had hid in these caves and slowly mutated over time to adapt to cannibalistic dietary habits
 As the Mayans discovered the place, they also discovered its unruly inhabitants
 Perhaps that was why the Mayans disappeared
 As memory faded of the hellish place, the sinkhole was rediscovered and put on the front pages of caving magazines worldwide
 As you explore, you can see evidence of early 20th century spelunking equipment
 After the explorers never returned, the incident was forgotten, and became a sort of bermuda triangle
 In 1982, a family went on a boat trip to explore the region
 They lost thier son and looked for him
 It is assumed he was eaten
 The grave near the yacht may show that one of the parents died by starvation
 The final parent is gone without trace
 The several campgrounds indicate people who explored the region, not believing the rumors of cannibals
 A film crew's camp can also be found by Goose Lake
 James Blanc (you) and Timmy Blanc (your relative) crash in the forest
 The Virginias, or six-legged female mutants, are the only cannibals with genitalia, indicated that the malformed cannibal babies surrounding them are its offspring
Like this review so others can see and revise my theories

For $15 they could have removed the cannibals altogether, renamed the game ''camping simulator'' and it would still be better than most games of double the price

This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated
 Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day
 And if that's not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machine
An alternate title for this game could be "Zen and the Art of Logistics"

Upon a winter's night quite coldI loaded up a game Steam soldThe trucking sim of much acclaimWhile thinking, “what a stupid game
”At first I tried to play my wayBy squishing peds and bringing pain“Where are the cops
” I asked myselfTrying to earn my place in Hell
But time went on I grew boredI'd do one run and then ignoreThis game that they’d called 'Comfy Truck'And then move on without a-BUT WAIT
 I'm almost out of time
Just have some faith, I'll cross that line
But time was past and pay was dockedMy world was shattered, faith was rocked
“Well just one more
” I grumbled lowI loaded up and hit the road"I've got it now
" as off I wentSoon to delete local content
Passed peaceful pastures in the nightI saw a sunrise blinding brightI guess this game's not all that badThough not the best I've ever had
Pop playing on the radioIn harmony with my VolvoThis siren sought to bring me sleepWhile consciousness I fought to keep
I showed up, docked and dropped my chargeAt a nondescriptive harbor yard“Just one more time,” said my girlfriend“Tomorrow you can play again
”But no, I knew I couldn't stopThe needs of commerce never dropIf it be chemicals or steelI had to keep turning those wheels
So down the road I charged once moreThrough France, Poland and LuxembourgAnd soon a thought occurred to meCould this be what they call ‘comfy’
If slow and peaceful is your aimYou'll not do better than this gameNow just real quick here's a rundownSo you’re running when you hit the ground
You move cargo from A to BI'd recommend quite hastilyIf you do well and earn your payThen manage other drivers days
And so with that ends my reviewI hope maybe you’ll try it tooIn here you'll find no gun or knifeBut I enjoy the trucking life

As a retired truck driver of 40 years I never though I would end up playing a game about truck driving but I find it a pleasing experiance when I can travel the European roads which I traveled daily
 The experiance is so realistic I would recomend this game to all who would like a glimps of the life of a European trucker without all the grind and hardship which goes along with the job
 Congratulations SCS you have a realistic product even taking into account the suicidal AI

You know, it honestly feels like a joke at first
 There’s thousands of games out there – some offer compelling storylines, others offer non-stop thrills, and pretty much all of them let us escape the dull monotony and grind of daily life
 And then there’s Euro Truck Simulator 2
 Which, unsurprisingly, is a simulation game where you drive trucks around a crude rendition of Europe
 Okaaaay
 To emphasise the absurdity of things, you only need to look at the basic gameplay loop that’s taking place here; you pick a job from a list of options in your area
 You go and hitch up your cargo
 Then you slowly trundle towards your destination, taking into account every road law and speed limit, and spending the great majority of your time on vast highways and never-ending strips of asphalt
 After dragging yourself to your destination for 20 to 30 real-time minutes, you drop off the cargo – and do the whole thing again
Suffice to say, then, that this isn’t for everyone; there’s a good chance a few of you have fell asleep merely reading the last paragraph
 If you do actually get to the point where you boot up the game for the first time, it even does a lot to try and immediately frighten you off
 You’re instantly met with a plethora of menus that are incredibly overwhelming, allowing you to do everything from create a profile to adjusting your X-axis sensitivity for
 Well, something
 The tutorial then doesn’t help matters, basically stemming down to telling you “Just drive the truck”, and then buggering off and leaving you to work out how exactly you do that in the first place
 Yet give it a chance to get things rolling and – amazingly and most crucially – it really works
 There’s a bunch of reasons why this is the case, that go way beyond the primal satisfaction that comes with driving a hulking great big rig
 For one, there’s an incredibly calming sense of slow progression constantly burning away in the background, with the sat-nav in the corner of your screen always slowly ticking down the miles left towards your destination
 It’s surprisingly satisfying to watch the numbers keep dropping, and finally whittling a distance that seemed impossible to begin with down to nothing
 Secondly, there's the option to turn on your own music while driving, or even tune in to actual radio stations across Europe
 Set one of these up and hit the perfect moment, where the right song comes on as you watch the sun slowly rise and peep through the trees, and it all just feels… Right
 Heck, take my word for it when I say that having AC/DC’s “Highway to Hell” blasting out your speakers as you’re racing down the road at max speed is something that’s hard to beat
 If you’re daring, you can even pop a video or TV show up in another window and zone out
 But just like real life, the chances of you suddenly finding yourself wrapped round the nearest streetlight rapidly increase if you do this
 Still, it’s fun to try
 In the game, that is
 There’s also a healthy degree of strategy mixed in as well
 Your truck needs fuel and your driver needs rest, and managing the two becomes a delicate balancing act of effective time management, where you are constantly checking out your route and seeing how far you can push yourself before you literally fall asleep at the wheel
 While it takes way too long if you’re not wishing to put yourself in a position of extreme bank debt (so much so it actually gets a little frustrating), you can even make enough money to hire other truckers to your cause
 Suddenly you’re busy plotting out an empire, trucks roaming across all of Europe, and your hard work being rewarded with a skyrocketing bank account
 You can even make the core game more complicated, if you’re that way inclined
 An automatic gearbox might be the obvious choice, but there’s nothing stopping you from having to switch through all the gears manually, or even hooking a wheel up and going totally crazy
 The choice, as they say, is yours
It’s also worth pointing out all the mods that are available to enhance or change things up – from the big changes to the little tweaks, there’s a lot you can bolt on to the base experience
 Whether it be branding the sides of trucks with famous logos, or subtly changing the map and the way your truck handles, there’s a lot you can tinker about with if things are starting to feel a little dry
 Special shout out to the mod that lets you personalise the inside of your truck – because there’s something irresistible about decking out your cabin with a giant BB-8 and a bunch of other nerdy bits and bobs that fill up every empty space
 While not offered in the game or mods themselves (and I can't say I tried this myself), there’s also means out there to take things online, hitting the road with truckers all over the world
 Chances are you’ll end up in a traffic jam trying to get a ferry to somewhere, but hey, whatever floats your boat
 In the end, whatever you choose to do and however seriously you take what’s on offer, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is perhaps the definite chilled out experience; with everything always just coming back down to you and the open road
 It’s the perfect game to unwind after a stressful day, where the challenge or intensity of most other games simply doesn't appeal, and that's what makes it something so much more than something to laugh at

Top-notch truck driving simulator
With support for TrackIR, wheels and pedals, this game has become a gem of the simulation genre
Before having tried it, it's hard to see why this game will be so addicting
I suspect much of that feeling comes from the progression from a lowly truck driver not even owning a truck to a multi-country Logistics company owning a hundred trucks and employing as many drivers
You "level up" various skills which improve the rewards you get from certain types of deliveries or open up more jobs such as longer distances or different categories of dangerous cargo
Driving the trucks is a pleasure
It's surprisingly therapeutic driving from city to city, obeying the road rules rather than smashing things up like a madman
That said, if you disable the speed-limiter in options (90kph) you can get a bit crazy, getting as high as 150kph+ on some routes, a bit of a thrill considering the cargo you have in tow
Speed cameras will become your enemy though
Unfortunately the AI of the other traffic can at times frustrate
In some instances such as in underpasses under freeways you can find intersections where the cars always fail to give way, probably because the intersection was not programmed correctly
Don't get me started on the kamikaze AI at roundabouts either
In any case, this is the most fun you can have driving a truck in a game
Having a controller or steering wheel would be highly recommended, and if you have head-tracking equipment it's icing on the cake

Much like my sentiments of Farming Simulator 2013, I fell in love with Euro Truck Simulator 2 and I have no idea why
 Mundane job simulators are overwhelmingly garbage, but a select few (including ETS2) are surprisingly compelling
There is no way I can think of to describe this game without sounding terribly drab
 You’re a truck driver, and are starting your own shipping company
 You have to drive according to the law, take rest breaks, buy fuel, pay for upkeep
 There is nothing on paper that should be exceptional about this game, yet for what it is, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is disturbingly enjoyable
 I recommend everyone to give it a try
Posted: 16 July, 2015
Euro Truck Simulator 2 isnt a game you play
 its a game that consumes you
 its a drug
 you dont buy this game knowing that you will loose your social life
 but ETS2 takes what it wants
 my entire family has abandoned me
 all thats left is my fleet of 50 trucks
 my girlfriend crys from our bed "turn off the game, its time to go to sleep" she dosnt understand
 its not a game
 I run a Multi-Million doller International trucking empire, sleeping is for the noobs
 this game recieves a perfect 10/10 from me, i have lost everything i have ever loved
 but, i do have 20 Volvo trucks now

It's just one of those games you can turn on the radio (Game has an interface for internet radio) and just space out as you're driving through Europe's highways
 Great game, would recommend to every single person out there

Players choose their HQ's location in any of the game map's cities
 At first, the player can only take what are known as Quick jobs—these jobs involve making hired driver deliveries while employed by a delivery company, with a provided truck and all expenses (fuel, road tolls, ferry crossings) covered
 As the player earns money or takes bank loans, they can eventually afford to buy themselves a truck, acquire a home garage, and start making more money by delivering cargo using their own truck instead of just being a driver for hire
 Money earned in the game can be spent on upgrading or purchasing new trucks, hiring NPC drivers to take on deliveries, buying more garages and expanding the home garage to accommodate more trucks and drivers
The player gains experience points after each delivery
 A skill point is awarded after each level-up
 Skill points can be used to unlock deliveries that require different ADR classes, longer distance deliveries, special cargo loads, fragile cargo loads, deliveries that are urgent and eco-driving
 This progression allows the player to take on better paid jobs
The game features 77 cities in thirteen different countries, over twenty different types of cargo and over fifteen fictional European companies
The game also features a "Radio" feature, which allows players to play MP3 and OGG files
 It also allows the player to listen to Internet radio
Version 2 includes two new truck companies, Scania and Renault, with MAN returning from the original game
 DAF, Iveco, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo trucks were not officially licensed and had their names changed to DAV, Ivedo, Majestic and Valiant respectively
 Later updates included the official branding for the DAF XF,Volvo FH, Iveco Stralis and Mercedes-Benz Actros

I've been playing Path of Exile since 2011 closed beta and it's remarkable how far the game has come purely from crowd funding
The passion of the userbase is equally matched by it's developers
They've shown throughout the years to constantly improve and tweak the game with regularly scheduled content additions
I still feel I don't know everything there is to know about this game, and that isn't changing any time soon
Path of Exile is an incredibly complex and rewarding game that is definitely worth your time
Outside of having an absurdly intricate skill tree and a fantastic crafting/currency system,
the other large appeal of this game is the end-game
Most ARPGs fail to offer incentive to continue to play your character after you've exhausted the content
Usually this just comes in the form of a easily attainable level cap or grinding the same final zone of the game at length
Instead, in POE you are given item drop instances, as described by the developers: "Maps can drop as normal, magic, rare or unique with higher rarity Maps yielding more items
 Using a Map item opens six portals to the area, which can each only be used once
 Like most other items in Path of Exile, Maps have mods that change their risks and rewards
 Map mods can affect the size or complexity of the level, monster packs, monster properties or even alter characters while in the level
 Players can modify Maps themselves using their currency items
 For example, you can use an Orb of Transmutation to turn a normal Map into a magic Map, or use an Orb of Alteration to reroll its mods
"It goes to say that each and every map is a different experience, with room for countless variation in modifiers letting you push the limits of your character
Not all characters are equal
You will find that some characters that excell in early progression have difficulty in the end-game and visa versa
Each character I've made has informed the next which is critical in a game that rewards experience and skill
And if that wasn't enough, POE offers alternative ARPG experiences in the form of daily race events which are time based leveling with unique modifiers that you won't see in the real game like 'Turbo Mode'
Moreover some of these races have entirely unique content like Descent: Champions or Endless Ledge which offer players the ability to win special art reskins of legendary items for the leagues of their choice
All in all POE is a truly exciting game and a breath of fresh air for the genre
Posted: 13 August, 2014
Warning: this game will consume big part of your life
 If you start playing it, you will keep coming back for more all the time
 Before I started playing Path of Exile, my attitude towards Hack'n'Slash genre was
 let's say bad
 This is my first game of such genre and I am completly satisfied
Now let's go straight to good and bad points of PoE
-PROS:+ truly Free To Play model, there is no such thing as Pay To Win, there are microtransactions that are all about purchasing visual effects for your character and his abilities (you can also purchase more tabs in stash, but that does not impact the game),+ developers actually care about the game, listen to their community and keep fixing bugs, creating new content or reworking old visual effects (I have been watching development of PoE since open beta and it constantly changes until this day, successfully becoming better),+ the desynchronisation issue has been fixed with the introduction of the update 2
0
0 - this was one of the biggest flaws of this game, it is gone now
 Hurray
+ new leagues and events are started on a regular basis,+ huge amount of passive skill points which gives you enormous combinations for character developement, every build is unique (unless you begin copying others' builds which kills the fun)
 There are so many possibilities that you are even able to turn an archer into a melee character
+ large variety of active skills - you want to sweep your axe
 You want to cleave through enemies with your sword
 Maybe you fancy raining arrows or using various kinds of magic
 No problem, you can choose anything you want and upgrade your skills so they can consume less mana, become faster or fire more projectiles at once and that is not everything
+ many armors and weapons: one handed or two handed: axes, maces, swords also daggers, claws, bows, wands and staves, items also have different stats and 4 grades: normal, magic, rare and unique, same thing applies to monsters,+ crafting-currency trade system, it might come out to be hard to understand at first, but then you keep realising that everything has its value, there is no gold, just barter trade system
 Crafting-currency items have one important function - they slow / prevent inflation which is a disadvantage of gold based systems,+ this game has challenging end-game consisting of large variety of special maps that can be modified to become more rewarding and demanding at once, if you reach high level [80+] with decent items and statistics you will simply feel satisfied + nice, vivid and helpful community,+ with the introduction of version 2
0
0 majority of in-game locations have been reworked, thanks to that some quests are now less time-consuming and do not get you bored
-CONS:** - with the introduction of version 2
0
0 this game has become flawless in my opinion
I hope that I managed to describe this game generally, but I have to say one more thing: you will not be able to experience the game by reading others' reviews, just give it a try and you might fall in eternal love

If you like Action RPG but have not played this game yet, you must
 Grinding Gear Games, an indie gaming company with their entirely free-to-play game, have created one of the most complex, in-depth and innovative ARPG in the gaming industry
Business ModelFirst of all, this game has one of the most fair and ethical business model you could ever see in the free-to-play market
 Absolutely nothing you can get with real money gives you advantage over other players
 This encourage players to support the game because they actually want to donate for the developing and its developers and not because they are forced to progress
Audiovisual artThe developers have stated that they "are sick of the recent trend towards bright, cartoony RPGs
 The art style [they] chose for Path of Exile is dark, gritty and realistic"
 The graphics are beautifully detailed, the music is iconig and the voice acting is outstanding
Gameplay & MechanicsThe customization and character progression in Path of Exile is complex and impressively in-depth, with a vast diversity in their mechanics
ClassesEach one of the 7 classes starts at different location of a passive skill tree, composed by 1325 nodes, with non-linear progression (the tree is actually a web)
Items & GearsSet items is a horrible decision for builds diversity, so this is not what you will find here
 Of course there are Unique items, but having a full set of Uniques of the same theme/type does not grant you bonus mods
 This is meant to be this way to avoid forcing players to play with sets, breaking their character building freedom
The item drops: maps, divination cards, jewels, gear items (their category, rarity, mods, gem sockets and links), are randomly generated
JewelsThere are socketable nodes in the Passive Skill Tree that makes possible to socket Jewels that grants bonus and special attributes to your skill tree
 These jewels have rarity, mods and can be crafted too
SkillsThe skill system made by gems makes possible that the characters are not limitative to a few skills, so the game does not dictate how the player is going to play
 These gems have level and attribute requirements according to their color (Strength, red; Dexterity, green; Intelligence, blue), they can be leveled up, have quality % and can be corrupted for bonus mods
Divination CardsThis kind of items are collectibles that gives you a specific item once you have gather enough cards of a set
 Each card is dropped in a specific areas of the map
 This system allow players to systematically work their way to the acquisition of the items they want, without having to rely on an eternal grinding
MapsTheir structures and pack of monsters are randomly generated, and is the main focus of the end-game, since they can be crafted
Currency & CraftingThere is no gold in Path of Exile, there are 25 currency items (orbs) that have crafting functionality
 They can add/remove/re-roll the mods of the items, modify the sockets (number, colors and links) of the gear items, they can corrupt the items, change their rarity, etc
 Basically people trade items for items they are going to use, and not for gold
 This makes the trade highly in-depth and open
Forsaken MastersThere are 6 Masters (NPCs)
 Each one of them can be leveled up to level 8 by doing daily missions, and they offer crafting bench and hideouts that can be decorated and customized as the player wish
The variety of builds and the hideout customization is so open that the developers runs two series called Build of the Week and Hideout of the Week
Developers & SupportThe developers work along side with the community to improve the game and add new content
 They do a great job balancing the game and deploying constant patches and updates
 The support is surprisingly responsive and open to any kind of feedback
ConclusionAll these elements makes the different ways a character may progress literally infinite, and the game always encourage to make new builds and try different mechanics
 Some players likes to experiment with builds and other players likes to break the "rules" and metas to come with insane mechanics
 The developers are, as explained, the most ethical and responsive gaming company you could find out there considering the success of their game
 Reason to be disclosed: they are hardcore gamers creating a game after all, what would be better than that
Posted: 24 October, 2014
Simply the most in-depth Hack'n'Slash out there and the best according to me
 Character customization is top-notch and replayability is huge
 I have a little bit over 1k hours played on it (did not link the game to my steam account immediately) and I still
have many things to discover
 However, it is a "hardcore game" less accessible than Diablo 3 or others games
Pros:- Huge passive skill tree offering in-depth character customisation- Interesting spell customisation using gems (close to FFVII's materia system)- Interesting trading system relying on barter only (no gold or any other in-game currency)- Interesting crafting system allowing to modify dropped items- Game is very skill based (rare for a hack'n'slash
)- Very little Faceroll/OP builds, almost every build has drawbacks and strengthCons:- Can be hard to get into: trading system can seem overwhelming and in-game mechanics are quite complicated so use of the wiki and forum is much advised- Animation can seem clunky at the beginning and game seems to play slow at the beginning- Player can feel like reaching a gear-ceiling at the beginning of end-game if playign self-found (much better since Forsaken Master's 1
2 update though)- Will eat your life if you get into it
Posted: 6 August
If I'm being honest, I actually hate this game
 I personally find it a boring, time consuming adventure
Why am I recommending it
Because I know quality when I play it
 In addition to the great reviews this game has, I can personally attest to its uniqueness
 Its skill system is complex and, like I said, can take years off your life if you let it
 It seems as though the developers really put care into the game and I love seeing that in the gaming industry
If you want a game that improves on the Diablo formula, you should play this game
 If you want a game that you can go into and get something done within an hour, this isn't it
 I understand it's a more 'hardcore' game where time and effort is rewarded and 'laziness' isn't
 It's just not for me, the once hardcore player-turned casual
9/10
Posted: 11 October
I came here to let everyone know that this game is indeed ok
Posted: 27 July
Important disclosure : I started playing on Steam, but migrated my account to the standalone client
 Hence, Steam thinks I havent played "recently"
TL;DR : I love this game
Since you came here to read a review for a F2P game, here goes :Good :1
 diversity
 7 classes, each with 3 sub-classes (except the 7th, she has only 1, but she can also pick points from any of the other 6 classes, fair, imho)2
 playerbase
 want to buy stuff
 want to sell stuff
 want to party up
 want to chat up
 u wont find an "empty" game, ever
 people play at all times3
 DIVERSITY
 want to play a manly tattoo'd dude swinging a huge axe
 done
 want to play a quick, mobile huntress that shreds enemies with hundreds of arrows
 can do
 want to play a demented girl who lost her friends in a fire and has "replaced" them with raised zombies
 OH BOY BET YOU CAN
 BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE
 if YOU want, then that manly dude can swing his axe thrice as fast, for a small damage loss
 or he can make his attacks BLEED his enemies
 that huntress can electrify her arrows, or even make them chain off to nearby enemies
 and if that sad girl ever gets bored of her new friends, she can always call up cute little flaming skulls of death that automatically seek out and destroy any that would harm her
 ALL BY CHANGING A SINGLE GEM
 seriously
 i could go onnnn and onnnn
 not enough space to write down everything
4
 its free
 all content updates are free as in free beer
 no obligations to pay or tell others what you're playing
the bad :1
 the cosmetics cost a bit too much
 however, they look SWEET
 other than on a templar
 #spoilers i guess
2
 some older content is not updated
 mostly this is about old skills from 5 years back
 yes, the game is that old
3
 rich people like to ruin everything
 there's some people whose only motive is to hoard everything and deny it to others
 good thing that no matter how much they hoard, others just farm more of the item in question :)4
 somewhat hard to play on older computers
 yeah, if you're firing off a hundred spells per second, your PC WILL die of overheating lol
There are absolutely NO paywalls
 There is nothing a F2P player cant do that a paying player can
 Well the only exception to this rule would be stash tabs, but I played for almost a year with the basic 4 tabs
Be warned, this is not your traditional farmville style game
 This game is BRUTAL if you arent paying attention
Playing casually is an option, however, you need to learn atleast SOME game mechanics to not get insta-gibbed by white mobs in the tougher zones
Once you understand how this game works, you will realize what a hidden gem it is
 But, that requires sweat, blood and tears
 You dont become an exile just by strutting around whacking at bosses with an unlinked Heavy Strike socketed in a white weapon, no
 You become and exile by studying the masters
Welcome to Wraeclast, (hopefully) exile
 I wish you maxed resists and multiple mirror drops

Title: This confused me for a while
 I interpreted it in a manner similar to "George of the Jungle", and spent a good space of time believing that the protagonist was named Mark
 Somewhere, deep in my heart, I still believe his name is Mark
 As such, I will be referring to the protagonist as Mark for the duration of this review, and afterwards as well
 Graphics: It's like playing a cartoon which is kind of cool
 I watched Samurai Jack one time, and he was pretty neat
 I like to consider Mark as like his cousin on his mother's husband's side or something
 The graphics contain many cool features such as ninjas, lights, and enemies
 Some people consider the characters to be two-dimensional, but I think that they're just drawn that way so we shouldn't make fun of them
 Everything is nice and fluid, it's like the characters are made of water or maybe filled with *blood
 Sound: The characters have voices and they use them to say things like"HURGH" or "BLARGLREGARGLEBLARGH" when you stab themGameplay: Gameplay is very stealth-centric, meaning it may be difficult to notice at first
 Once you manage to spot it, however, you'll be hooked
 And so will the guards
 There are lots of great ways to sneak around, like kill the guards, or hide from the guards, or scare the guards so much that they shoot their friends and kill them for you #Teamwork2014 #JustGuardThings #Livin'ItYou get gadgets and they're usefulYou can think in this game, and I've grown to appreciate how thinking stops time so you can decide where you want to throw things like darts and smoke bombs
 I find it very distracting how much the game is based on distraction and getting guards to squander their attention on arbitrary things in the environment like the noise mine you threw behind them
 Story: Mark bears the mark of the ninja, which gives him extra abilities
 One of those abilities is the ability to take Revengeance upon the bad guys by killing them and stuff
 Another ability is to go insane and kill your friends, which would be sad, but I guess they'd stop being your friends when they saw you trying to kill them so then you wouldn't be killing your friends it would just be a mob of angry dead not-friend ninjas which is entirely morally justifiable by comparison
 Title: 1Sounds: a lotGraphics: Probably more than ten, I wasn't really counting when I played it so I dont know the exact number of graphical assets involvedStory: 2 if you have the DLC thing, 3 if you count the two different endings based on your final choice
 ---------------------------Total: pretty good game, almost bought again but realized that would be pointless*This has, in multiple instances of gameplay, been confirmed true
Posted: 25 November, 2013
Mark of the Ninja is a mix between 2D platform and stealth killing, in wich you can always clearly see what's happening around you, making it easy to plan your moves
Controls are greatly responsive and you have a good variety of ways to complete the interesting and diversified levels, in wich you can find optional stuff and complete secondary objectives; this and a New Game+ option make it easily replayable
Graphics are very clear, and overall style is enjoyable
Story felt uninteresting to me, but with solid mechanics like the ones this game has I can deal with it
Posted: 2 November, 2014
Mark of the Ninja is an aesthetically pleasing, 2-D, stealth-based, side-scrolling platformer
a
k
a
 a masterpiece
 For those of you who want a brief overview without looking at it in the steam store, think of it as combining the best qualities of Thief, Dishonored, and Assassin's Creed and giving it all to you in a different, albeit wonderful, 2-D perspective
 To give you a sense of the story itself, you play as a ninja (no way, right
) who accepts the "First Mark," a tattoo which imbues mystical powers to the one who accepts it upon their body
 While this seems like a fantastic benefit, accepting the mark means sacrificing yourself in the future because the ink is said to drive people to insanity (e
g
, hallucinations)
 Your purpose-without spoilers-is to avenge your clan that was recently attacked by an evil arms corporation by utilizing your newly-acquired powers
 As the story progresses, you receive more marks, more abilities, and more means to uncover the irreconcilable truth about your role, your clan itself, and those of power who essentially mean to save and/or destroy it
 Now if this hasn't already got you hooked or clicking off of my review to go buy it, then please allow me to further elaborate the feel of the gameplay
 Mark of the Ninja does not care precisely how you play the game
to a certain extent
 Yes, the stealth aspect is a given
 This is not simply because this is the major theme/tag for the game itself (who knew
), but also because while you can dish out hits, you can't take many more hits than other enemies in the game
 This is exceedingly true if you try to go in "weapons blazing" (expect to be punished and killed relentlessly if you do this)
 Despite this sometimes perceived "limitation" by some players, there are multiple routes and means of accomplishing each level through various stealth-based tactics
 You can choose to be cruel, fast, and terrorizing, or merciful, meticulous, and tactful--or even a mix of these depending on the situation/your mood at any given moment
 That's one of the most glorious aspects of the game: Freedom of choice to accomplish objectives
 Combine this with the gorgeous settings for each level, and the 2-D game does not feel at all linear or dimensionally flat
 Finally, there are a couple of minor details I'd like to state that may or may not apply to other players (skip this if you like): 1) I admit that I played this game on steam with an Xbox 360 controller and not with the keyboard and mouse
 I recommend doing so for the sake of the ease of controls
 However, you may have your own preferences and be able to get used to keyboard/mouse controls faster in comparison to me
2) At some points my computer lagged terribly due to how many various processes were going on in the game with the visual effects (e
g
, when there was a raging sandstorm in one level)
 The creators even comment upon this minor flaw if you turn on the in-game commentary within the game itself (which I also recommend because it reveals some really awesome facets of the making of the game
)
 3) Mark of the Ninja is a highly addictive game with major replay value
 It took me 14 hours to complete it the first time through, and I intend on replaying it once again on new game+ mode in the future
Hopefully, all of the aforementioned reasons will sway you to spend some money in steam to purchase a game that has certainly left its "mark" on me
 Please don't think me insane for adamantly urging you to acquire this game instead of letting it sneak past some gamers unnoticed
 I recommend picking it up immediately, but if you want to wait until it goes on sale in the steam store that's fine too
 I doubt it will let you down regardless :) In short, Mark of the Ninja gets a well-deserved 10/10 (ninja) stars in my book, and I'd like to thank Klei Entertainment for allowing me to play through this utterly amazing story

Bear the MarkAwesome sidescrolling platformer with excellent stealth gameplay with varied gameplay
 Plenty of routes you can take and a variety of weapons and equipment at your disposal
 Levels felt unique and boss battles didn't force you out of being stealthy
 Also love it when games let you replay specific levels to improve score, find collectibles, etc
 A definite must have if you enjoy stealth games

A superb 2D platform stealth game
 Lots of fun and great value for money
One of those games that caught me by suprise and opened my eyes to the world of 2D stealth games, Mark of the Ninja is a fairly simple idea
 You are a 'ninja' that is granted special powers and a terrible curse, and you must fulfill your deadly mission

Do you like ninjas
 Real ninjas
Buy this game
Please join me as I explain why this game deserves TONS of praise and credit
There are many ninjas in video games
 Being a gamer, youve probably heard of a few of them
 Ryu Hayabusa from ninja gaiden
 Strider from his self titled games, Scorpion and sub zero from mortal kombat, Grey Fox from metal gear, etc, etc
But you havent heard of the main character of Mark of the Ninja
 because nobody has
 And why havent they
 BECAUSE HES ACTUALLY A NINJA
In popular culture, ninjas have turned into something that they historically never were to pander to the masses
 They are portrayed (in games, movies, cartoons, and all popular media) as super invincible Rambos who come in and lethally destroy hundreds of people who should on all accounts kill them immediately
 theyre given super human strength, agility, reflexes, to the point of being rediculous, because people like to watch that
 It makes them appeal to the audiences who want to watch them do exactly that
 The problem is that is NOT what ninjas did
 In fact, you couldnt make them do anything that was MORE against the souce material
The biggest point to this that makes it kind of insulting is that they are making these changes to ninjas to make them more badass, when ninjas were already badass to begin with, and didnt need any help
 The art of the ninja was the art of nonexistence
 They were shadows
 Whispers
 They were sent on missions that noone else could be sent on
 They would sneak through places undetected to gather information, or yes, sometimes to assassinate people
 They were very skilled at killing people, but did so ONLY at the absolute last resort, to prevent themselves from being discovered
 They kept their identities secret
 They covered their faces
 They tried their hardest to NOT EXIST
The fact that everyone knows ryu hayabusa and strider (even in their oen worlds) and that characters like them run around in the open massacreing hundreds of people and not caring who knows means that they are NOT ninjas
 not even that they are bad ninjas
 they arent ninjas at all
 This game lets you play as a REAL ninja, and is one of the only examples of a game Ie seen that actually lets you do that
 You cant fight the gaurds, or at least its VERY difficult to beat them in combat, even one on one
 Why
 I thoght you were a ninja
 You are, but they have GUNS
 Just because youre a ninja doesnt give you the ability to easily defeat a trained soldier with a loaded gun in fair combat
 But you can very easily defeat them if you sneak up on them
 thats what a ninja would do if he had to kill
 the game also gives you extra points for hiding bodies, which is again, what a ninja would do
 The game gives you MORE points if you can go through the level without killing people or being detected
 The goals a ninja would have
 The game is very fun
 and it points out that you can have
REAL ninja, as opposed to a hollywood ninja, and still be badass
 arguably even more badass
 Give the game a try
Posted: 6 October, 2013
Before the chit-chat, let me say something upfront: Mark of the Ninja is an exceptional stealth-action game, that will change your way of thinking about Indie titles if you had ambiguous feelings before
 It isn't simply a great game, but also has character, story, depth and uniqueness
Our hero is an unnamed ninja of the Hisomu clan
 Just after getting tattooed with an ink from a special flower that will make him have extraordinary power his clan is attacked by soldiers and his mentor is taken hostage
 After freeing him, the journey begins
 Yes, it's revenge time
 It's not the most well cooked stories out there and the ending lacks a real punch, but from an indie title of this kind it's very ambitious
 After sending our hero on his mission it is explained to him that the ink under his skin not only will make him stronger but after some time it'll drive him mad
 Before that could happen he sworn to commit suicide
 But, the mission first
As we progress through the levels our hero will learn (we unlock) new abilities that help us deal with enemy soldiers
 With the increasing number of light sources, lasers, detectors and enemies the game gets more and more challenging, but never too difficult to frustrate the player
 With common sense and orientation you can always find the right path to clear the room or pass by the enemies undetected
And exactly this is the biggest fun source of the game
 There isn't a definite way to finish a level or even to solve a room
 You have a wast array of items you can choose from and you can use any environmental object to be successful
 You rarely HAVE to kill a guard to reach the next room, there's always a second option
The game tracks your progress all the time
 Finishing a level without being detected or doing all the side tasks in a level will earn you more points to spend on special abilities and more effective distraction/attack items
When you feel the game is beginning to get somewhat repetitive it always throws you something new to play with, to make the fun lasting
 You can even change your outfit after some time
 And this isn't a pointless dress change you see in many games
 With the new suit you get new abilities, but you're reduced with other ones
 It is really awesomely balanced, where everybody can find the clothes that fit the player's style
With exceptional game design comes exceptional art design
 The game isn't the most beautiful you've ever seen nor packs the most polygons, but it's art and it's unique
 On the audio side the lighting strikes and dog sniffles are great
 The OST consists of well composed pieces that support the ninja-feel and stealth nature of the game
After finishing the game you can start again on New Game + mode which is essentially a hard mode and it's really challenging where your viewing angles are reduced and the enemies are more aware
Mark of the Ninja executes and delivers on every part you can imagine
 It's a definitive standard for indie titles
 If you like stealth games, play it
 If you like 2D action games, play it
 If you like platformers, play it

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Mark of the Ninja Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: 2D; Stealth; Platformer; Action; Ninja
My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 10-20 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWMark of the Ninja is an instant indie classic
It is very easy to digest and has an alluring simplicity to it; but at the same time it boasts exciting gameplay and a very refined atmosphere
Elements of 2D platforming, stealth, and action combine to create a distinguished and enjoyable identity for the game
 If you generally appreciate this style of game, then you should consider checking out Mark of the Ninja
The core gameplay is relatively simple and easy to dive right into
The controls are mostly comfortable and intuitive, and the design style allows each person to tailor their play to their preferences
Each mission allows for a little improvisation at times, as there are often different routes you can take to reach your goals
 And as you unlock new items and abilities, you can experiment with new approaches to keep the game fresh
There isn't much per way of the story, but there is enough information offered to give you a basic purpose to your actions
 But even though the story elements are minimal, the game has an outstanding atmosphere
The art style is very pleasing, especially the hand-painted backdrops
 And the lighting effects are exquisite, particularly due to the importance of staying in the shadows
 Add in the fitting weather effects and the soundscape and you are left with a truly pleasurable and captivating atmosphere
 Mark of the Ninja also was designed to be challenging without being overly difficult
 I personally felt that it was perfectly balanced to not be too easy and not be too hard, dwelling within that perfect “Goldilocks-zone” that allows the game to appeal to a vast majority of gamers
 And since most people won’t be able to just breeze right through it unchallenged, it can take over a dozen hours to complete— even though it isn’t necessarily a long game
 On top of that, there is also a NewGame+ mode to add some replay value for those who would be interested
In summary, I posit that grabbing Mark of the Ninja is an easy choice for any true fan of the genre
 And due to the high quality of the game design, I also would suggest that more casual fans of the genre give it some strong consideration as well

I'm long time due with a review about Mark of the Ninja, as it's gameplay and way of presentation captivated me from it's first level
Gameplay-wise the game is an stealth game - but unlike games like Thief series, here you can dispatch your enemies in various ways - if you want to
 You can arm yourself with incredible variety of tools - you can change your skin/cloth, resulting in a different combat style that can alter your health, pool of distraction or offense items, and sometimes introducing unique traits to that combat style
I mentioned items - you can use sound crackers to throw and distract your enemies, flares to make them dizzy or blind, a good old cardboard box to hide in plain view, or some bombs, plus some extra
 In addition, all items have upgrades, for example smoke bomb blocks laser path and vision, but the upgraded one chokes and stuns enemies unlucky enough to be caught inside the cloud
If you're into more offensive gameplay, you can use darts that will incite terror in your poor victim, who will see enemies in every corner, very likely killing his guard-mates
 Or you can use flesh-devouring bugs to make a body disappear or kill someone in a noisy fashion *yikes*, or a spike trap
 Besides the straight "kill the poor sod who's targeted" effect offensive weapons are very likely will plant fear in other enemies who see their friends perish, so these simple tools actually have much more strategic usage as it would seem
Or who need tools
 You're a ninja
 You can get upgrades that improves your hand-to-hand skills by giving takedown abilities, various ways to catch your enemies off-guard by attacking from above, below, or behind close doors, or you can learn how to float a while after a jump
The best thing in all of these upgrades that there is no skill tree, no various classes - you unlock whatever you want if you have enough points for them
 Said points can be acquired by completing levels with 1-2-3 medals - this require you to get enough points for the three tiers
And now after mentioning points, back to the gameplay
 Getting points is actually really easy, and easy to count on
 You can get points for killing an enemy, hiding the body, distracting them in various ways, passing them unnoticed, panicking them, etc, etc
 The game is made in a way that it can be completed in a non-lethal fashion (though as story requires you to kill the target, he and his guard in chief are killed in both gameplay styles) and you can still easily get enough point on a level to get all 2 medals
The game plays wonderfully
 Movement is responsive and easy to get used to, the game features a focus mode that's not breaking the game's immersion while let you aim carefully with your tools / re-think your strategy
 All the weapons are very easy to use, their indicators are clear, while the whole system absolutely lacks the feel of spoonfeeding
 Basically the game features a system that makes really easy to use your gadgets but doesn't really limits you how and when to use them - for good or bad, depending on your choices and the ability of aim that pesky smoke bomb :)I wanted to point out another feature in the game: New Game Plus
 You can keep everything you have from the first gameplay, and the game reasonably makes the game more difficult
 Guns will kill in one shot, enemies' cone of sight will be invisible, there won't be visual feedback about how far some noises can be heard, and you too will get a cone of sigh: anything above, below or behind you will be heavily blurred
 I was tremendously happy to see such change in the game, because the game's difficulty scales not by the number of the enemies, but making the game technically harder, requiring more attention (Which shouldn't be hard after completing it beforehand)The game's visual presentation can be seen as plain at a first glance because of the lot of dark areas, but it's really accurate and original
 Various styled levels are presented across the game, from the modern city with it's stark edges, catacombs with darkness and decayed, uneven surfaces to the ruins of an old city where most things just want to fall apart, resulting in various traps unique to that few level
Between the levels the cutscenes use cartoon-like style, which really fits the overall design, and it's really well done - features tell-tale facial expressions while masking parts of the story
 Obviously, there's a lot of work in writing the game's story and make the story, design, style, gameplay elements to fit together
 And as a last thing, still part of the graphical feats I'd like to mention one of the game's cutscene (no spoilers) I've found uploaded here: and the game's final level as both are gems of the art-like presentation in games - I'm sure I'll remember the closing level of the game in decades, it was so strong and influential, uncovering some things from the story while letting others in darkness
 Feel free to look it up, but I won't link it here, being an obvious spoiler
At the end, if I'd need to rephrase all these things in a sentence of two, it would be pretty hard, as there's so much great things to say about the game, while I haven't found any negatives
 The game perfectly mixes the elements of platformer and stealth games supported by a great variety of tools and moves to enhance the gameplay, while staying similarly outstanding level design, storytelling and art style
 Huge bonus point for alternate non-lethal ways, and letting the player experience and discover parts of the levels and the story, the forced focus from cutscenes could have destroy the player's pace, and spoil the feeling of true discovery or enlightenment
One of the best and most rewarding games I've been playing - I honestly recommend it to anyone who likes platform based and stealth(y) games

Early Access Review
Another match-3 game from SakuraGame, mixed with short visual novel segments
 I assume it's similar to Hell Girls, although I don't have much time playing that one so I can't make good comparisons
 I'm writing this review after playing the first 2 1/2 chapters of Mirror (out of 8 total in the current build)
Bottom line: For a day-1 Early Access game, this is easily worth two bucks
 Even if development stopped today, I would have expected to pay between $5 and $10 for what's there now
The artwork is very high quality, both for the characters and the backgrounds, and there's a lot of variety for both
 The visuals overall are the best part of the game, on par with some of the more expensive VNs on Steam - Example (SFW)[steamuserimages-a
akamaihd
net]
 The only fault I could see is that the style isn't always consistent - some backgrounds have a watercolor-style appearance while others are crisp and CG-like, but it didn't bother me at all
 Music is okay - mostly unmemorable but it fits the game fine
 The title track is a standout
The English translation is not great, but it's better than most other games published by SG on Steam
 There seems to be at least some human involvement in it - not completely done by machine
 I didn't have any trouble understanding what was being said 80% of the time
 Hopefully they will make another pass or two and by the final release it could be relatively polished
Each chapter of the game appears to be a self-contained story, with unique characters and plot
 Although the gameplay is primarily match-3 in the style of Puzzle Quest and the like, there are also short visual novel vignettes before each battle
 They are a few minutes in length, and each one has a dialogue choice that results in gameplay modifier (e
g
 -10% enemy health, +20% enemy attack, etc)
The modifiers don't seem to have much impact so I wouldn't worry about making a bad choice
 This is because there isn't a lot of strategy involved in the battles
 There are only 4 primary icons on each 8x7 board, so you'll be getting a lot 5x and higher combo chains without really trying
 These battles are the weakest aspect of the game
 I hope they take the time to add some more variety and make them less luck-based, but I don't think that's likely to happen by the time the game is finished
There is an in-game shop where you can upgrade stats and get new abilities, but I haven't spent much time experimenting with it because I've only lost a single battle so far
 Again though I don't think it would make a difference
At the end of each chapter is a slightly longer VN section with a sex minigame with the opponent you defeated
 The sexual content appears to be mostly bondage-related - nothing unusual for these sorts of games
 The explicit portions are censored and there's no patch to undo it at the time I'm writing this, but pretty much every other SG release has one so I would expect it to appear before too long

Early Access Review
If you liked Huniepop but thought to yourself, man, I wish the scenes with the girls were slightly animated and more lewd
 This game is for you
 Since it is early access there are a few things I hope can be improved before the game offically comes out, mainly the dialouge/ translation, its a bit off here and there, but overall the art is beautiful and I love the 'intimate' scenes
 Not so patiently waiting for a patch so we can see more than flowers and rabbits
Overall 9/10

Early Access Review
First ImpressionMy first impression is that this game is that the games will be full of nudes, just a linear elimination games
 That's all
 I bought it since the early purchase will entitle customers to 2 more free gift games
 Maybe sooner or later will start having cards, so it is an investment
Playing Experience	But, I was wrong, not about the nudes things, yes there a lots of them
 Few of them are somehow a bit too much for me
 (maybe i am a bit conservative)
 I was wrong that this game is just a game that use sexy anime girl to attracts weebs
 They offer more than that
The animation is nicely done, story lines created are interesting and different for each of chapters/levels/girls
 The elimination gem games combined rpg character skills builds so that the gems eliminated will have difference effects
The music is pretty good
 It is enjoyable to play this game while listening to them
 Character voices are good and such and ear candy for me
Since it is just early access game, i hope they will add more contents, more characters, and more diversity in the game play
 I personally would recommend the game
 It is not a waste will worth every cents spent

Interesting puzzle game
 I thought the back story is rather interesting too
 You have a little choices matter sort of dialogue
 I have a few SakuraGame titles, lives up to their art style, to put it simply
 A little on the lewd side
 R rated but not completely full frontal, but then again its more echi than adult manga
 Honestly I'm very surprised they charge so little for this title
 And
with a promotion of 40% off at launch, its a no brainer

>Observer_ is the latest game from the developers behind Layers of Fear
 Set in a dystopian cyberpunk world, you play as Dan Lazarski, a neural detective known as an Observer
 With your augmentations, you can hack into peoples minds to solve crimes all while reliving some of their biggest fears and nightmares
 One rainy night you get a call from your estranged son, seemingly in danger and asking for help
 Once you trace that call to a decrepit apartment complex in the slums of Krakow, your investigation begins
This game hit me just like Soma did
 I wasn't sure what to expect at first, but the environment immediately grabbed my attention and before long, i was immersed completely in the world and its characters
 With a mix of Blade Runner, Midgar from Final Fantasy 7, the movie Brazil and the developers own unique touch, the gritty look, feel and atmosphere of Observer are pretty much perfect
 We're talking Rapture/Arkham Asylum/Tallon IV (Metroid Prime), level of detail and quality here
 While most of the game takes place in and around a single apartment complex, its size and labyrinth like layout are deceiving
 I was often reminded of how Stanley Kubrick purposely built the hotel in The Shining to be confusing and off-putting
 You constantly feel a sense of unease at the multitude of tight hallways with rooms that are so close, or at such odd places, they couldn't possibly fit inside the building
 While the observing (hacking minds) parts are interesting, thrilling and a nice change of pace, the true star of the show in my opinion is the incredibly realized "real world" aspect of the game
 Whether you're going door to door learning about the residents, or finding rooms that are open/unlockable and searching them for clues, or simply just exploring this steamy, crumbling, wire-strewn slum, each aspect is immensely enjoyable and rewarding
 I would love to see a sequel someday focused purely on these things
The gameplay strikes a nice balance between a walking simulator and a more action orientated title
 While you can't jump (something i always miss when it's left out of a game), you can kneel, run, interact/pick up certain items and open things like drawers and cabinets
 You can also use two different scanning devices (think of Metroid Prime's scanning ability) to search for clues or learn more about important objects
 Although most of the apartments can't be entered, the majority do have someone to talk to inside them, whom you interact with by using a video device located on the door
 You can ask/answer different questions which will give you different responses from the tenants (adding to the replay factor of the game)
 At first i didn't know if this would get old/boring after awhile, but because the personalities from room to room were so different and entertaining, by the end i was like an addict running around to each door again just make sure i hadn't missed one
 Add on top of that the gruff voice-over work of Rutger Hauer (the actor that played Roy Batty in Blade Runner
) and you have one of the highlights of the game
 When it comes to the horror aspect, just like with Layers of Fear, the developers chose to use more psychological means than just jump scares (although there a few of those thrown in for good measure)
 This is most apparent when you've hacked into a persons brain, where it can genuinely feel like you're in a bad nightmare
 Once you make it through one of these segments, you definitely feel a sense of relief since most of these people have some pretty dark places in their minds
 And even when you aren’t in someone else's thoughts, you can still find yourself in some disturbing situations like where you have to make a decision to end a life (which in this case, might be the better choice), or safe a life, or just walk away and not deal with it yourself, since neither option is a particularly good one
 There are also few chase/hide sequences as well, but nothing too bad once you realize where to hide and what path to take
Graphically, Observer is a joy to behold
 The art direction is so dang good, even simple hallways looked like expensive movie sets
 Sometimes you'd have slick Matrix like computer code running all over the walls, while other times it would just be filth (this has some of the grossest bathrooms i've ever seen), dangling wires and computer parts
 Regardless of where you are in the game though, there’s always something interesting to look at or examine and because each room/area has a unique look or layout you're always excited to see what's around the next corner or doorway
 The lighting, texture work and effects are really well done too, adding another layer of polish to the presentation
 I especially like the heat/light rays coming from the lights behind windows
 The graphics menu has a decent amount of options although there are two things i think people would like to see added
 One is a FOV adjustment since it feels a bit low and is only made worse by the claustrophobic design of the building, and the other is a way to turn off the Chromatic Aberration (which i turned off in the 
ini config files)
 Hopefully they'll consider these options for upcoming patches
 The music, like everything else, is top notch, mixing dark and dreary segments with more futuristic sci-fi pieces and has a very cinematic tone overall
 As you can probably tell by now, i really loved Observer
 I played through it twice, one right after the other (it should take around 8-10 hours to beat), even though i knew most of the story's twists and turns
 I think that speaks to the compelling nature of the world Bloober Team has created
 If you're a fan the cyberpunk aesthetic and/or psychological horror, this is probably a must play
 But even if you're not the biggest fan of either of those things, you might still want to look into this one, since it just might change your mind
 Highly highly recommended
Thanks to Bloober Team for the review copy

The game is really good, but it's too buggy
 I encountered two game breaking bugs so far
 The support was really friendly in resolving the first by sending me a savegame from after the bug
 Of course, this lost some of my achievement and side progress, but that's fine
 Shortly thereafter, another game breaking bug appeared and all the support could tell me is that I should restart the whole game
 What's the guarantee that everything would work when I get to that point again
 It's just not fun like this
I'll have to give it a "no", because it's just unreliably playable at this point
Posted: 17 August
I
 don't even know what I don't know
 I just got finished beating the game in ~9 hours in one sitting
 To be fair, I could have finished it faster but I explored and attempted to do side missions and achievement based things
 That being said
 WTF did I just play
 I finished the game feeling immensely satisfied, but left with more questions than I could even possibly think of answers for
 My mind has never felt so royally scrambled after playing a game before
 The story itself gives you just enough to follow along and piece together the complexity of it if you REALLY take the time to focus and decipher the situation and all the subtle twists
 On the surface it's easy to follow, but each area has SO much more to it
 Even without understanding the nuanced undertones to the journey, the story itself leaves you feeling breathless
 This is one of those games that I feel MUST be played a second time to even remotely begin to understand all the details that are easily missed or not understood the first time around
 And the great thing about this game
 I'm left feeling as though I actually *want* to play through it again
 This was a HUGE win for Bloober Team
____ Overall, 9/10 rating
Graphics are incredible and gorgeous throughout
Story is
 out of this world
 As someone who does research in Psychology, this was
wow
 Game Engine was very smooth and didn't have any issues with controls or functionality
ONLY reason the game isn't 10/10 is because there were a few areas that didn't seem wholly optimized
 Experienced a couple spots where framerate went from 60's to mid-high 20's
 I feel, given this is such a newly released game, that this will probably be addressed in future patches
 If that's the case, I'll amend my review as necessary
But again, I cannot recommend this game more
 I still am just left with an utter sense of astonishment and "Wow
" If I had the time, I'd start a second playthrough right now

Bite-sized review Mind matters Review in 30 seconds There is no denying that visually and audibly ">Observer_" is a tour de force
 Incredibly stylized, with some of the prettiest and most striking graphics you will see all year, not to mention one hell of a harrowing soundscape, playing ">Observer_" often feels at times like one is being violently assaulted in a dark alley by a dangerous entity
 ">Observer_" starts out as a cyberpunk thriller set in an futuristic apartment block where a detective, Daniel Lazarski (Rutger Hauer), is summoned by his own son - who it appears is in some kind of mortal danger -
but gradually becomes bone-chillingly more patricidal the further into its labyrinth of broken memories you venture where past, present and future collide in such a way that it would make M
 Night Shyamalan turn green with envy
 While not perfect (it takes a bit too long to get going and therefore might lose some of its audience) but once the game kicks in proper you had better make sure you are strapped in tight
 Absolutely hair-raising stuff and next to "Resident Evil 7" one of 2017's crowning chillers
 One word to sum up the experience Mind-bending Performance/Bug related incidents Some slight FPS dips but for the majority ">Observer_" runs really well
Similar to games "Resident Evil 7"; "Layers of Fear"; "SOMA""; "Narcosis" Suitable for Suitable for teens and up and those with a strong stomaches
 At times ">Observer_" gets all "Alien: Isolation"-like scary
 Position in my games of 2017 cleared list 7th favorite

This
 is a tough review to write
The game has hundreds of points of exceeding brilliance
The game is frequently a battle with the level layout and the UI, trying to figure what's desired of the player next
 (especially in the "dream" bits)The game explores topics in ways that haven't been adequately covered in years
 (think: puree Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner, and William Gibson books; add salt and rat poison to taste)The game has an autosave system, and at least one point-of-no-return w/o a clear warning of the same
If you're looking to feel like you've mainlined Noir and cyberpunk-based drain cleaner
If you're looking to feel confused and bewildered most of the time
If you want to wade neck-deep in poverty, despair, and black humor
Then get it
 (on sale, natch)Otherwise, just wait for some poor b@stard to make a Let's Play, and laugh as they proceed to lose their minds
TL;DR: I have no way to reduce this one to a number which will do my feelings justice
I really liked it, but I'm still not sure if I hate it too

If you enjoy Bladerunner and other cyberpunk movies/games alike, this is the game for you
Pros:- Amazing voiceacting (Rutger Hauer being in this is beyond cool)- Great atmosphere - Intriguing story- Very unique- Incredible original soundtrack- Fantastic Visuals Cons:- Confusing at times- Could be boring if you don't enjoy heavy narrative- No combat could be a con for many people, didn't really affect the game for meThis isn't my type of game at all, but I enjoyed my entire playthrough :)Hope this review was helpful :D
Posted: 15 August
I'll say right off the bat that this game has insane atmosphere and detalization
 From what I can tell, the horror of this game is not about the jumpscares
 It's about psychology
 This game tells you the story about people's scars through masterful surrealistic visuals and amazing dialogues which brought to my mind some famous movie directors known for their artistic vision that is quite uneasy for the general public
 Not to mention that you're playing as a Rutger Hauer himself, which is pretty symbolic for me as a Blade Runner fan who enjoyed his performance as Roy Batty
 Sounds and music of this game match the overwhelming tone of a dystopian world just wonderfully
 But if you're not a fan of slow paced games, observer might not be for you
Posted: 13 October
SUMMARY	In a life full of technology there are only a few ways to try and keep order and the people around you safe
One of which is to be an observer
 Play as an oberver and hack into peoples minds to discover clues and hints to connect a wild story to unravel the truth about your son and see if the problems around you call for a bigger concern
 FIRST IMPRESSION	My first thought was that the story i was already going to love and the graphics were fantastic
 The cyber punk enviroment was just extrodanary to say the least
 The controls were easy and simple to use and even later on in the game theres not much more you so
 This is a great game if you liked the Outlast series
 Most youll do is walk around and experience an amazing story about a corrupt world and how your son got into a mess
 MY THOUGHTS
My thoughts are simple
 This game is a must play for any horror fan oranyone the enjoys a story rich game with an awesome twist
 Not just jump scares but one who can appriciate true terror
 Its very easy to be emmerssed in the story and the characters will hold your atttention
 I absolutley love the style and atmostphere of this high tech cyber world
 Very slummy and always leaveing you wondering in disgust
 MY RATING
I had fun playing this game and would deffinetly reccomend it to a friend to play
 My rating, considering the graphics, controls, characters, story, and overall gameplay would have to be
9
5/10
 Its an excelent game and it does best for what its genre is and i see no room for improvment other than the HUD
 its not easy to know when to take medicine or not
 Other than that it was truly a plessure playing this gameIf you found this review helpful check out this cool page

Early Access Review
This is one of the few games that are worth buying on early access unlike those that get ditched by the devs once they milk their product enough
 Slime Rancher will appeal to the audience that like to play and relax on their games
 With so many games out there that make us frustrated, angry and anxious, Slime Rancher tries to oppose those feelings, and to me, it succeeds easily
 My only complaint about this game is the lack of content, but considering it's early access, and that the devs are still updating the game, more content will be added in the future
Overall, I recommend this game to all my fellow gamers that are bored of being competitive and anxious all the time and that just want to have fun just like the old days

The game has a huge amount of potential
 The art and music are perfect for the setting and the gameplay is fun and addicting
 The only problem with this game is lack of content, which is to be expected since it just hit early access
 If your looking for a complete package i would reccomend waiting for a few more updates before buying
 If the developers stay on top of this game and release frequent meaningfull updates this game could become a real gem

Early Access Review
You see, poop is an extremely valuable resource 
Slime Rancher [EARLY ACCESS] ReviewI caught a first glimpse of this game when one of my steam friends posted a link about it on the activity feed
 I checked the game out briefly, but quickly went back to other stuff as it did not really peek my interest
 The game seemed a little bit weird to me (as in: it looks boring and stupid) and I was about sure I wouldn't enjoy it
 About a week later, I saw one of my favourite youtubers play it and decided to eventually give it a watch
 The video was over before I knew it and I clicked on the next one
 And the next
 After a while it was clear to me: I want this game
 NOW
 There was just something about it that I can't really describe, but it drew me in
 And a lot of other people got drawn in too
 It's like a disease being spread, the only difference being that it's a good disease
 I admit I've been a little bit too quick in my (wrongful) judging of this game, and will therefore give it a (fair) second chance in this review
You play as Beatrix LeBeau who decides to leave earth and set out for the Far, Far Range; a magical and adorable planet filled with slimes
 Your goal
 Finding slimes to Suck up their plorts (aka slime poop) with your VAC to 
 sell them
 Yes, correct
 Plorts come in many forms and are used for various things on earth; mainly food and products (eww
)
 You sell these plorts on the plort market to earn some cash, which can then be spend on upgrades (for either yourself or the ranch)
 When slimes are fed, they'll leave one of these treasures behind for you, or two even if you are lucky
 As of now, there are 3 main categories of food: fruits, veggies and meat
 Each category has different types of food for you to find and feed to your slimes
 If you so desire, you can also plant your own food - you'll run out less slowly (and it's fun too
)
 Believe me, your slimey friends will be thankful if you do
 It is especially useful to plant your friends' favourite food; they'll love you for that and will definitely return the favour via plorts
 I hope it is now clear that plorts are extremely valuable and so is your task as slime rancher
The gameplay, however a bit unoriginal (find slimes --> feed slimes --> get plorts --> get money --> get upgrades etc) is very satisfying
 Finding new slimes is always exciting, especially since you can create mixed breeds that are more efficient for money making (and they are just so adorable too
)
 The game thus encourages you to explore the planet on your 'quest' to find more and different slimes, find food and start your own farms 
 and getting upgrades will make all of that easier
 Be careful though, not everything is peaceful on the Far, Far Range
 Under certain circumstances, a Tarr slime will come out and devour all the slimes in the vicinity - even you
 So be cautious and take good care of your 'pets'
The 'thing' that makes Slime Rancher so much fun for me, is the fact that there is so much freedom as to how you play
 You can approach this game in a very casual way, and just go on an adventure, enjoying the different and beautiful areas with their inhabitant slimes (I could see this game used for therapy so to speak)
 The total opposite would be finding the most profitable slimes, combining them, putting them in a corral and making a lot of money - a dream for people who want to create a very efficient farm (or ranch rather)
 Or you could go inbetween and do a little of both: enjoy the slimes in their natural surroundings, but take a few home to take care of because they're so darn cute
 The game is also suited for all ages, which is great
 I'm pretty sure both young and old will find a certain joy playing this game and I love it for that
 I could totally see a grandfather and his grandchild play this game together having a lot of fun
The game in its current state is already super fun and stable, with minimal bugs
 I estimate about 5-10 hours of content
 There is still a lot of content waiting to be added, like more slimes, more types of food, more areas 
 more everything
 I also hope that they will add different 'modes' besides the "do-whatever-you-want" experience
 I think it would make for much more replayability, which is what I'm looking for in the long run
 I want to be able to play this cute game for a long time, without it getting tedious, hence my idea for different modes
 (Ofcourse, this list is totally personal, and I will still love this game if it keeps up development like this - whether there be different modes or not)
 I'm thinking about: A story mode: right now there is a little bit of background in the form of mail that you receive, but I think playing through a real story would be pretty amazing
 Maybe one where you have to save the slimes from evil or something
 I don't know, maybe I'm just babbling nonsense, but I think some kind of story would make things even more interesting
Challenge mode: Think about having to complete certain objectives in a certain amount of days
 That way, players would have to make smart use of the day-night cycle
Sandbox mode: The current mode (aka do what you want)Pros and Cons+ Unique concept + Relaxing and/or challenging + Nice, soothing soundtrack+ Satisfying gameplay+ Excellent tutorial+ Gorgeous looking world+ Cuteness overload
+- (this is temporary): lack of content +- (this is temporary): some may find it a little bit too expensive in its current state- The gameplay is not very innovative (as in: get slimes -> get money -> get upgrades -- repeat)The VerdictI definitely recommend this game, but please keep in mind that it is still early access
 Not all the content is in the game yet, and weird stuff (buggs) may happen
 If you don't mind that, by all means, please support the devs
 Otherwise, just wait a couple of months for the game to be a little bit more polished
I will revisit this review when the game is fully released, as to edit it accordingly

First of all, you may look at this and see a kids game
 Cutesy characters, no BFG to frag tight corridors full of baddies
 But sit down and give this game 15 Minutes and you will see why I am recommending it
 Without giving anything away, you are a slime rancher on a distant planet and you collect plorps (which are slime poo) and trade it within the global economy
 You can coop and breed chickens as well as farm a wide variety of fruits and vegetables

How I feel about this game
0
24bWhen I saw it on the steam store I was like "Hmm
"After I got some money I thought about the game, I looked at Jacksepticeye's playthrough of it a bit, and it was awesome
 I really liked the way it looked so I bought it
 First few minutes i was getting used to the controls, doing the tutorial
 Seemed easy enough; Though the one thing is, is that having too many slimes in one carrol is hard to do/ hard to take care of them all at once
Knowing this, I take care of as many slimes as I can handle
 When I came across the cat slime, I was going so crazy over it; but then, it ate a pink slime's poop thingy [Plorts] (I can't believe I already forget it) and it turned into a big pink kitty
 There was also these rocky spike slimes; they are adorable
 but hurt you
 ;u; I took care of the kitty with my other slimes but kept it outside
 Then
 I discovered the tarr
 A really messed up slime that you cannot absorb or keep; well because it's evil
 I had to throw them into the sea so i could easily destroy them
 Then i found out i could take water and shoot it at them till they died or put them into water
 Where is when i found boom slimes
 Well they explode; that's pretty much it, but they have a good worth of newbucks(
)
There are different slimes and they can all combine into a largo which is a big slime that is both of the slimes through eating the [plorts] poop stuff
 0
25Graphics and music update
The music transitions very nicely between areas keeping an alike theme, making it feel like you are actually going places
 Alot of lighting difference with slimes and the ground
 Water texture is a bit too blue but i get the point it's supposed to be fresh water
 Geysers look fantastic, slime sea has seaweeds now and a bit of a tint change
 In all 0

Definitely a great game
 This is great for my down time and I use my steam account for the entire household and allow younger kids to play it while I am babysitting, or I can just play it on the big TV screen and all the kids love it
 They are so happy to learn each new slime or area
 The bright colors to the strategy and monetary system helps the little ones learn

Early Access Review
One of my favorite games that I have played in the past five years has got to be 7 Days to Die, hands down, maybe even my absolute favorite
Whenever I try out a game, I dont play it for three or four hours before rating it, you're barely into a game to even rate it, in my opinion
 At this moment, I'm 529 hours in, so I felt the time to review it was approaching fast, so here I am
Where do I begin
 Well, I had been scrolling around on YouTube, looking for games to watch people play, when I accidentaly stubled upon this gem
 I only saw Alpha 1 gameplay at the time, which barely resembles what this game is now
 Despite how it looked, I had been looking for a survival base building game for a long time, so I bought it one weekend, and it absorbed my soul and then some
Whenever you first start, you have little to nothing on you
 You have a bottle of water, a bandage, and some food to start with
 You can loot your surroundings to get some basic materials to start making a stone axe to start getting wood to make a simple shack
 If you don't want to build a base in the beginning, you can claim one of the many buildings and fortify it so it works as a home until you decide what you want
This task won't be easy, with zombies added into the mix
 Depending on your difficulty, the zombies might be a niusance or an absolute nightmare to deal with
 Every 7 days, a Zombie horde will come to attack you and destroy the precious progress you've made on your base, hence the name 7 Days to Die
 In those 7 days, you will build your base, and get traps and weapons ready to survive the night and emerge victorious from your base when the morning comes
As the game goes on, it senses how well you're doing
 If you're sweeping through the zombie hordes and haven't died in a while, It will send stronger zombies in more numbers to try to give the hardcorre people a challenge
There is a whole lot I could add into here, but for the sake of people who get bored of reading reviews all day, let me get to my pros and cons
Pros:-Lots of replayability
 You can play a whole lot of this game and get the best stuff, and start all over again on another world with different settings to give your veteran self a bigger challenge, to keep the game fresh
 EDIT: Even though the updates come rarely, there is SO MUCH added each update it's sometimes like you're playing an entirely different game
-Smart building
 You can't just build a castle in the sky here
 There is structual intergity in this game, so if you build a structure incorrectly or a zombie takes out an important support beam, the building could fall apart around you, along with your supplies being cast into the void
-Friendly Community
 This community isn't like DayZ or some of the other communities that have murderous players lurking everywhere, there is a huge variety of servers, some being PvE(Player verses Enemy), others being PvP(Player verses Player), other servers being modded to give the game even more life
Cons:-Updates
 The game does have updates, but they happen at least 3 or 4 times a year, so you will be playing the same thing for at least a couple of months before anything new is added, which is annoying at times
-Learning Curve
 There are games like Space Engineer that have a very steep learning curve that makes casual players not want to pick these games up
 7 Days to Die can have this problem with new players at first, with so much to do and a horde on Day 7 being a problem that might overwhelm some players
 I would reccomend watching some people play this first before jumping in, mainly so you have a vague idea on what you are doing
 After that initial curve, the game definitely gets easier
-Graphics
 If you are a big graphics gamer, then this game might be a bit dissapointing for you
 The models, especially for the players, aren't too pretty to look at
 The zombies are a bit better, but like I said, the graphics are a bit dissapointing to look at
 The landscape is kind of blocky, but It is a minecraft-like game, so it is to be expected
Overall, this is one of my favorite games of all time
 It does have it's flaws, like not super good graphics, a bit of a learning curve, few updates, and the occasional bug, but what it has far outclasses its cons, like solid gameplay, lots of repalyability, and having building physics that make you build smart and realistic
 I would reccomend at least trying this game out, I think that you will enjoy it

Early Access Review
( Updates at bottom
 )A friend got this game for me, I looked at the title, looked at the screenshots and groaned
 "Not another 'zombicide game' trying to say it's a 'survival game'
" But he got it for me, and it woud be rude to not atleast give it another shot
 I'm rather glad I did
I started play in a -private game- with my friend, set to the medium difficulty
 Day one was a mess, I figured I was playing another left4dead 'survival' game which was all about killing as many zombies as one humanly can before wandering to the next area
 Well, after breaking a few weapons on zombies and getting no reward outside of what lint was in the zombie's pockets, I knew I was wrong, and night had begun to set in
 My friend luckily -had- played before and warned me that things got a lot different at night, so we managed to make it through with no deaths, but many close calls
50 days in, I'm more than hooked
 Survival is the key- Food, water, scavving, repairs and building at day
 Shelter, security and stealth at night
 Crafting damn near anything in a Alpha game, from multiple layers of cobblestone walls outside of what used to be a log cabin
 Each peice taken the long crafting process of finding rocks, chopping them down into stone and then turning into cobblestone
 More
 We built a second story for storing items

Three friends and I spawn in the wasteland biome
Thought we could make a shelter out of this apartment complex
Was going well at first
Gathered many supplies
Fortified the door
Was supposed to be temporary, started turning into something permanent
Everything was going well
they broke down the door
Everything went to hell
They started pouring through the stairwell
Dogs everywhere
The only way out was down
Started running down and dodging walkers
We got separated in half
Two of my friends made it out
My other friend and I were still stuck inside
Figured we'd spend the last night, hiding
The moaning of walkers never stopped
Morning came
It was time
We had to go
My friend and I continued to drill down passed the horde
Got desperate
I jumped out the second floor
Broke my legs
They were everywhere
Managed to limp through the horde
Met up with my other three friendsDon't look back
We crossed the river into a forest
Started off with a small shack
Turned it into a four house village
We had a wall, a trench around it
We had something
We never did forget about what happened that day in the wasteland
That right there, is just a small story (that wasn't even in full detail) of what 7 Days to Die is like
 Very few may say that "Oh, it's just another zombie survival game" or "Oh, it's just a DayZ knockoff"
 Well, I'm here to tell you that this is not the case at all
 I own H1Z1, DayZ, and 7dtd
 I have to say that this is the best one
 Why
1
 The developers are actually going in the right path
2
 Loot system is pretty awesome
3
 Crafting system is also pretty awesome, may take a bit to get used to
 But, still awesome
4
 Instead of just piling blocks and making a box-house, there are actually physics to the building system
 Like, in some cases, you actually have to put support
 Otherwise that sniper tower or that neat house will collapse on you
 Which has happened to my friends
 It's kind of satisfying to watch, but damn you're mad if it's your structure
5
 The different variety in enemies is cool
 Right now, you have: bees, dogs, and zombies; and other different kind of zombies to add to that
6
 Speaking of zombies
 This game's zombies have something that DayZ doesn't have
 You know
 They actually pose a threat and can move in numbers
 There are moments when you see that police station surrounded by a horde of zombies and you think to yourself "No, I'm good", because they actually threaten you
 The fact that they sprint at night by default (settings can be changed) also adds a thrill to the game
 To a point in which you don't even want to leave your shelter at night because you can hear a spider zombie calling a nearby horde
 Hordes also happen randomly at anytime and anywhere
 This is also unheard of in DayZ
 You never see a horde in that game
 Also, as the days go on, the zombies start to get a little tougher
 You start to feel that the apocalypse is worsening
 Zombies are also smart
7
 There's nothing more satisfying than fortifying your base to prepare for the undead
 This game does a very good job at that
 You can do almost whatever your mind imagines
 Wanna put a trench that surrounds your base and put spikes at the bottom of it
 Do it
 Want to salvage land mines from an overrun military base and use them as your own
 Do it
 Want to build a huge wall around your base
 Do it
 However, don't think that just putting a wall around your base will help
 Zombies will rip through it and actually dig under the wall
 We've seen this done in our server before, and it's frustrating, but it's so awesome having to constantly keep maintanence on your base and look for new ways to prevent them and to see your weak spots
These are just some of my points, and you wanna know the awesome thing
 This right here, is just an alpha

First time playing when it turned night I had no choice but to burry myself in the dirt
Sitting in the pitch black hole just listening to the insane sounds of the zombies outside
I felt a real rush and fear not knowing what would happen
Its rare a game can do that to you
Pros:Great extensive crafting mechanicLootingZombies present an actual challenege especially at night when they runMining for resources feels like you actually acomplished somethingCons:DOGS, $^#@ themStill in alpha so some glitches may occurPerformance can be rough on older systems unless you turn graphics all the way downAll in all though i give this game a strong 8/10 -The Fun Pimps seem to care about the game and are quick with fixes-It can be insanely addicting to play-I love the mining and crafting mechanics-The fun to be had in this game is only limited to your own creativity-LOTS OF REPLAY VALUEI am not good at writing reviews but I hope this helps at least one personFINAL VERDICT:
BUY THE GAME

I have been playing this game since Alpha2, it is my and my son's favorite game to play together (he's 14)
 We have written a few suggestions that would increase longevity of gameplay, efficiency and fun
1
 Decrease the stupid wasp noise, way too loud and obnoxious2
 Incorporate rope, and simple machines including but not limited: pulleys for drawbridge function, trip wire, netting, and levers
3
 Equipable ruck sack for additional storage, but decreased speed
4
 Weather
 rain would dampen smell and sound sensed by zombies, slow player
 etcetera
5
 A zoomable minimap6
 Ladder lock, jump to eject, I have died way too many times falling off of a ladder
7
 Easier book reading for recipes
8
 Laser sight, red dot sight, and mechanical sight
 Add a sword and a spear
9
 Alliances, groups, clans
10
 Big military base instead of those small camps
 a lot of loot a lot of risk
11
 First aid kit to restore either half or full health
12
 Restaurant food prep/ovens and MREs13
 Fall breaking: IE pressing space bar breaks fall
14
 Silencers for the weapons15
 ammo in inventory carries to belt with a reloading speed penalty instead of having to manually transfer16
 Stamina regens faster when undected, slower when detected or hunted

Minecraft was too boring for me (I'm not a creator for creations sake)
Terraria was fun, I enjoyed the additional combat focus
 DayZ didn't have 'it' for me, I didn't like the lack of building (at least when I played it)Ark was fun (dinos
), but it got stale as there was no forced conflict
 No reason to explore, no reason to keep building
 So it fell into the minecraft trap
7 Days to Die allows me to be creative, but gives me a good solid foundation of conflict and purpose to my building
 Not only that, but it creatively forces/encourages me to get out of my safe keep and risk exploring which causes me to engage with the game content in a very enjoyable fashion
This was a recommendation from a friend based on the steam sale, and I've dedicated 90% of my gaming hours to this since I bought it over the holiday break
 Strongly recommend
Posted: 13 November, 2016
Early Access Review
Considering the amount of hours I've poured into this game, I believe a proper review is far overdue
 To give a bit of background, I first discovered this game back when alpha 9 was the current build
 My adventure began when I logged into a singleplayer game in Navezgane with all the settings on easy
 This was the first game of its kind that I had ever played, and I had no idea what to expect or how to play
 This was evident, as I spent my first day sprinting through the Wasteland in which I had spawned, completely panicked because I had no idea what the game controls were and I had no idea how to get the endless trail of zombies off my back
 I never did, either; I ended up dying multiple times and that was where my solo beginning of 7 Days to Die ended
 Then, a few months later when alpha 9 got updated to alpha 10, I convinced my friend to buy the game when it was on sale so that he could help me learn how to play it and actually enjoy it
 He caved, and so our adventure began in Navezgane once more
 Of course, we spawned in the wasteland again, and it was like the horror of my solo journey all over again as we desperately tried to escape the zombies while scavenging for what little supplies we could manage to stop and gather without getting bitten by a dog or smacked by a cheerleader
 By the time the 7th day had rolled around, we had finally gotten a grasp on how to play the game
 or at least we thought we did at the time
 I say this lightly, as we also considered killing ourselves a better alternative than the progressive zombie infection, broken legs, and the endless dysentery that we always seemed to have - probably because food was so hard to come by that we were filling ourselves with old sham sandwiches, rotten flesh, and raw eggs
 We hadn't the slightest clue that we were completely destroying our chances of survival as our wellness plummeted down from 100 to 60
 Then, our blissful ignorance turned to incredible terror as nighttime rolled around, and the hordes came for us
 We had shacked up in the desert by the river and made twin towers out of the incredibly ineffective log cabin wood, which the sprinting, bloodthirsty masses of zombies tore through in a matter of minutes
 We had little choice but to hide ourselves on our top floors, watching and waiting in horror as the dead simply demolished everything we had spent the last 7 days working for
 But then, in a final moment of hope and desperation, we whipped out the chainsaws we had found and quite literally blasted our way through the masses, only to escape in the night and return in the morning to pick up the pieces and kill off the stragglers
 We considered calling it quits and starting over, but ultimately decided against it and decided to dig ourselves a series of bunkers connected by tunnels across the desert
 As time passed, we became wiser, and we grew stronger
 It was day 35 that we had finally built ourselves and our base up enough to fight off the hordes of the 7th night
 We were victorious
From that game on, we've stayed ever-faithful to this game
 With every new alpha that's been released, we've been waiting on baited breath to launch a new game, each time slowly but surely helping us progress from the dark, early days of alpha 10 to the hardened, survivalist veterans that we are now in alpha 15
 With countless play-throughs on both Navezgane and Random Gen, on servers belonging to friends, random people, and eventually even ourselves, we have learned the game, though we are far from masters
 Each new alpha released is like an entirely new game, and we revel in the chance to start anew and work at the chance to better ourselves and our tactics even more
So, do I recommend this game
 Well, that would depend on what you're looking for, and what you're expecting to take from the game
 You will pour an endless amount hours into this game, you will sometimes regret it, but most of the time you won't
 You will be frustrated, you will be terrified, you will be inspired, you will be determined, you will be devastated, you will be excited
 The accomplishment you will feel is immense, and it will keep bringing you back to this game even when you think it won't
 So, yes, I do recommend this game, because this game is golden, and it just keeps getting better and better
10/10 will continue to be terrified by dogs but explore the wastelands and cities unarmed anyway

Day 1 - Got attacked and almost killed on my first night
 Then I went Rambo
 Fought my way out and ran to a house
 Hid in the attic until the sun came up
Day 2 - Found a few weapons and some rudimentary armor in the house next door
 And the upper half of the owner
 Gotta stay mobile until I find a place to settle in and make it defensible
Day 5 - Snuck around and scavenged houses for food and potable water
 No sign of
people
 Am I the last one alive
Day 10 - Found an abandoned military outpost
 Made a door and barricaded myself inside of the largest tent for now
 Will scavenge the surrounding area during daylight only
Night of the 10th day - They're everywhere
 Oh God
 They walk right by my tent
 I'm cowering in a corner behind a desk with a pistol and a wooden club that I wrapped in some scrap iron
 Only 15 rounds of 9mm for the pistol
 I hope that they don't decide to tear the tent down around me
Day 11 - Began collecting resources
 I think that I'll try sleeping tonight
Day 12 - They woke me up 2 times, but never took notice of me
 I'm glad that I don't snore
Day 25 - Have been fortifying my position, dug a trench to trap the undead
 Only the "Spider Zombies" can get out
 I need to contain them somehow
 Day 50 - Currently I have a fortress surrounded by metal tipped log spike traps 3 deep so they can't escape
 Then I just stand on my roof and snipe the spider zombies
 Collect loot and smile
 I think that I'll be ok
Day 79 - Been farming
 Food is plentiful now
 Weapons and ammo are easy to make
 I built my fortress on top of a deposit of iron, lead and potassium nitrate, with coal deposits poking out of the ground all around me
 What luck
Day 1
 - There's no end to them
 I heard a scream the other night
 Not one of them
 It sounded
human
 Female
 Close
 By the time I made it outside at first light, all I found was a pool of blood and entrails a half mile from my fortress
 Next to the carnage I found a purse with some pictures of a pretty young blonde lady with a cheerleading outfit on in one picture, in another she was in an expensive looking dress cuddled up to who was probably the star quarterback at her high school
 The last picture was her with what must have been her family on vacation at an expensive looking beach house
 They looked so happy
 Her driver's license said that her name was Cindy Batross and she was 17 years old
 There was a notepad with illegible scribbles and crude drawings of people eating each other
 I cried as I realized that she saw my lights and was desperately trying to make it to the safety of my home
 What may have been my only hope for companionship was now in the rotting stomach of the undead
Stardate 4/20 Delta V - Venison stew is good
 It's lonely here
 I found pictures in houses and I talk to the nice people in them
 You want to be my friend, Jimmy
 Ok
 I promise that I won't chew on your bones
 Day whatever - What was that noise
 They scratch inside my skull sometimes
 I saw the cheerleader
 She doesn't have a stomach anymore, but she walks around with a little smile on her face and coos sometimes
 Then she screams when I try to talk to her from my roof
 Maybe I should let her in
 Maybe she just wants to be friends
Night time now
 She didn't want to be friends
 Only my iron helmet kept her from chewing my face off
 I cut her head off with my hunting knife
 She didn't have any manners at all
Hump Day - I sewed her head back on and sat her in a chair
 We talked for hours while I cooked some vension stew for us
 She's nice, but a little cold
 I hope that she's on the pill

I am speechless
I bought this game together with two friends after we ran out of Coop-Games to play
And since this game has been on my wishlist forever, I decided to go with it
 It was on sale, after all
After a 5
5h session on the first sitting, we became addicted
And I mean, really addicted
 Couldn't wait to come home from work and continue
To prepare
To survive
This game is basically a survival-bulding game
 DayZ+Minecraft, to be
really general
You can build and destroy blocks, create furniture, traps, weapons, houses, etc
You can find blueprints and craft even more things
There is also a skillsystem in place where you can teach yourself recepies and f
ex
 craft ammunition
But most of the time you're just gathering resources to set up a base and not die
And of course you alos have to eat, drink, stay warm and dry and not get sick
There are multiple ways to do so and the more you play, the more you'll learn
Pros:- Big world for you to explore (Either a map or randomly generated)- Lots of stuff to craft and build- New enemies with 7 days- Upgrade your weapon parts and build weapons from scratch- Change the world the way you want to
 Dig caves, live in trees, etc
- Play with friends together / against / or alone- A lot of places to discover, change, upgrade and live in
Cons:- It lags when zombies spawn (Down to 20-30fps)- You can get stuck underneath the ground when you join a server- A few minor glitches- Not easy to get started; you need to read most stuff on the wikiOver all, I do recommend this game
In 3 days I logged 23hours of game time and I do not regret it
 There's a lot to do, a lot to plan and a lot of fun involved
 You get better, quicker and smarter with each day & move
If you love a scare, some pressure, crafting, harvesting, looting, creating, building and shooting, this game is for you

A16 ReviewAs a die hard veteran of this game it has been 'suggested' by various friends on Steam that i write a review
(Write a reivew after only 6,000 hours
 Pfft
FINE)Away we go
Buy this game only if you fully understand what Early Access and Alpha stage game development truly mean
This game is incomplete and yet it still is one of most playable and enjoyable Early Access titles on Steam
Watch some current videos and educate yourself on what you're getting into before you buy this game
This game has a steep learning curve and while in game tutorials have been added the game does not hold your hand,Buy this game if you enjoy:-Fully destructable, randomly generated, ludicrously large game worlds
-Zombies-Crafting-Zombies-Survival-Zombie DOGS-Building system with structural integrity-Zombie BEARS-Mining-Exploration-Base defense (A16 added turrents and traps)-And yes, good ole' first person, zombie shootin' goodness
Did i mention that this game is incomplete
Yes
 Well ok then, let's all say it together
7 Days to Die is an Early Access game which means that it is not finished yet
The developer plans on completion sometime in 2018
Updates for the game are about every 6 months
The developer is active but wants the game to be built right so is taking it's time
This game will not run well on a potato
Performance is good but rough on average hardware
Summary: Highly recommended for the reasons listed above
Worth every penny of the $25 i spent on it

I've been playing this game obsessively for a couple months now, and still can't get enough of it
Learning the patterns of all the enemies is one of the most satisfying things I've ever done in any game
When you start out, you're just fumbling around, faceplanting into enemies and getting torn apart
If you practice enough, though, you'll be able to take on any situation without suffering so much as a scratch
Every part of the game is very doable with the default equipment, so you're never just screwed because the right items didn't drop for you
The weapons and spells that you can find all work differently and cause you to change your method of attack, but they're all pretty balanced
There are a ton of different weapons types with their own unique advantages and drawbacks, rather than traditional "tiers" of weapons (1 damage, 2 damage, 3 damage, etc
)
And there's an instant replay feature upon death, where you can look and see what you could have done differently to save yourself (there's always SOMETHING)
This is quite possibly the most well-balanced game I've ever played, and I adore it
Pick this game up right now if you can
Edit: If you have any doubts, just look at how many hours I've logged on it ;)Edited again, after launch day: Early access is over
The game is complete and it's AMAZING
I cannot believe how much better the game has gotten with time
The final area and extra bosses have been added, and they really went all-out with the monster designs for the last zone
And suddenly there are two entire new soundtracks to choose from
Yes, please
I cannot tell you how happy I am with how the final product came out
I still play this all the time :)

Hard as balls, fantastic music, great gameplay, and a great premise in the story
It also has the side benefit of being completely unique, nothing else like it out there at the moment
A game I keep cursing at, rage quiting, and yet keep coming back to
Truly rewarding, as the game gets better as you get better
Can't recommend it enough

Early Access Review
"Kick
 Punch
 It's all in the mind
"These words were spoken by the great Tamanegi Sensei (better known as Chop Chop Master Onion) over 15 years ago when music-based games were first making a name, and they ring even truer today as the rhythm genre takes an evolutionary step into the dungeon crawling arena
NecroDancer is the holy matrimony between addictive rhythm game grooviness and challenging roguelike complexity, and I'll be damned if it doesn't hit the spot
 It's amazing that a concept this unique took as long as it did to come to fruition, but it's been more than worth the wait
Not only is the concept unique but it's done right, something we hardly ever see when a new mechanic or gimmick is introduced to the gaming world for the first time
 We see so many "new" ideas that are merely just a melting pot of previously established genres
 Lo and behold, these developers have obviously set out to refine and perfect their concoction of varied gameplay elements on their first attempt and that is highly admirable
 Necrodancer stands not only as a magnificently well-realized combination of genres but as a completely new experience of it's own and the start of what is hopefully a new trend of taking fun and risky chances in game development
The in-game music is dark, fantastic and quite danceable itself lending to the blissful feeling of hitting each beat of the song with perfect timing
 The precision of the music-based movement has lead lots of early adopters of the game to swear by playing with DDR dancepads which apparently add a lot to the fun and engaging nature of exploring the Crypt
 This shows a serious level of dedication from the rhythm game community and has already garnered enough attention to spawn it's own design of custom NecroDancer dancepads[necrodancer
com]
And if you somehow are crazy enough to get tired of renowned composer Danny Baranowsky's heavy electronic horror jams, the game features an intuitive beat detection function for usage of songs from your own library
 The detection of beats in your songs is generally spot on, and makes trying and discovering those perfect tunes for the game infinitely explorable and replayable for audiophiles in the same way games like Audiosurf and Beat Hazard Ultra provide endless entertainment
 Even for those songs that might be a bit too fast or slow for manageable NecroDancing, there's a feature to alter the speed of in-game beats to give more accessibility for a wider range of genres
 No form of music shall go undanced in the heart of these Crypts
There are four main floors to the game with three levels and a boss-type enemy each, but beating any single one of them won't be an easy task
 You will retry many times being forced to scour every diamond, buy up all the upgrades, and loot your way through multiple plays before you succeed, but what makes this so much more of a pleasure to replay than any other games which borrow rogue elements is the musical nature of the game
 NecroDancer replaces the repetitive and stale turn-based combat of traditional roguelikes with the fun and engaging audio interaction of the best rhythm games made to date
With a touch of the strategic approach of traditional tactics games, the enemies each have a very distinct pattern to their movements and attacks that the player must learn through multiple failures and awareness
 Starting out you encounter the easier monsters such as slimes that move passively back and forth as well as skeletons that follow behind in a predictable way that is easy to counter
 Protecting the exit of each floor are the harder and more complex mini-bosses, ranging from hulking Minotaurs that charge towards you in a straight path or determined Dragons that you must outsmart and keep just out of harm's way in order to retain your doomed life just a little longer
Throughout your journeys into the crypt you'll have two different forms of currency, first being gold coins that you can spend within the levels at merchants on equipment and items to help you on your current run
 Second, and most importantly are the much harder to find Diamonds which are the only thing that carry over into the lobby after death, allowing you to purchase upgrades to the gear and loot you come across during your runs
 This adds an insanely addictive level of persistence in the same way that the character growth in Rogue Legacy or shortcut system of Spelunky do
The shops you purchase these upgrades from won't be made available to you that easily, however, as each of the different merchants and trainers you need will be imprisoned and strewn about the various dungeons forcing you to dance deeper and deeper to rescue the people you will rely on in the future
 The game is hard and you'll die many times, but the deeper you go the more you discover, and the more you discover the easier your respective trips will become
 This adds a ridiculous amount of replayability and persistence to an already engaging and genre defying new formula
Here I am hopping and slashing away to the beat of Castlevania's 'Vampire Killer', and I come across a Blood Whip
 Things could not be more perfect
 Necrodancer isn't just a gimmick, it's the start of something beautiful, it's a new kind of entertainment that can be enjoyed from the hardecore-est of dungeon delving roguelite aficionados to the most casual of rhythm game fans, but there is one thing that all of these demographics must have in common; a dedication to the sound of music

Crypt of the NecroDancer is quietly genius
It's exactly what you would imagine a game to be like if you were told it's a roguelike, but in real time, with the turns lasting as long as the beat of a soundtrack — because they are, in fact, set to a soundtrack
 This kind of "X meets Y" high concept game (roguelike meets rhythm game, in this case) is easy to think up, but not as easy to turn into a good game, if the failed examples littering Steam are any indication
 NecroDancer not only works, but works well — it's an astounding feat of game design, and it's likely you won't even notice that while you're playing because it just feels natural
This is one of the few roguelikes that deserves the description "easy to pick up, hard to master", as most roguelikes are not even all that easy to pick up
 NecroDancer has a tutorial that lasts all of 90 seconds, and contains everything you need to get started
 Getting through the first set of levels will take a little more time, but can still be done in an hour or two
 But make no mistake, the difficulty ramps up over a total of four zones (each with three levels and a boss level, for a total of 16 levels)
 And if you think that's the end of it, you're wrong — there's a separate story mode to play through all the zones in sequence rather than separately, and to unlock all the characters (each with their own gimmicks that change the way you play) you have to complete the game multiple times
 This is a true roguelike in that the peak difficulty is insane and completing the game with every character is a challenge restricted to only a handful of demigods, but it's also a true roguelike in that it's fair and rewards strategic play and perseverance
 And all that to a great beat
I haven't even completed the third zone yet and I can already tell it will be many hours more before I chip my teeth on the really difficult parts, but I felt like I needed to get this review out before the current sale is over, even if my experience is incomplete
 This game is almost certainly worth it at full price if you're into roguelikes, but at sale price it's a no-brainer
 If it looks like anything you might like, buy it
 Even if you can't make your way through it, you'll still get your money's worth for the time you're playing it
Posted: 16 December, 2015
In the store page, it says the price is 14,99 €
But this is not true
The actual price includes your soul

There have been plenty of rogue-like games in the last few years, but this is definitely one of the most unique and original
 The concept is strangely brilliant, the art is great, and the music is awesome, so the whole package seems pretty stunning at first glance
 However, when you look under the hood, it's not flawless
the concept may be amazing, but the execution is a little bit janky at times
 There are times when I know that I'm 100% on the beat, and yet the game simply isn't registering that I'm on target, leading to my untimely death
 I'm a musician, so I have a good sense of rhythm and timing - something seemed off here
 There's just not enough precision to the mechanics, which can really sink you when you're facing a boss or going up against a
big room filled with tough enemies
 There are definitely a few frustrations that you'll have to deal with to get into a groove here
 I would defintely still recommend this, despite
whatever shortcomings it may have, because the idea is great and the development team has gotten pretty dang close to nailing it
 There's also the ability to add in your own music, which is a fantastic feature
I pumped in some Tribe Called Quest, Wu-Tang, Biggie, etc
, and then the game was really bumping and twice as fun
 Get this on sale and it'll be money well-spent, as long as you recognize that there's gonna be a serious learning curve when it comes to getting into the game's idea of rhythm

I've played this game for last 4 months of its Early Access
 It already looked very promising and awesome
 With the release it took me only a few hours of playtime to confirm everything I was ready to write about
This is a rogue-like rhythm dungeon crawler, as you've probably read on the store page
 The genre is quite unique - its gameplay is a blend of turn-based combat but it's constrained by the boundaries of the "beats" of the music of the level (unlike a lot of rhythm games it's very forgiving on beat accuracy and there's a reason for that: it's quite action-packed, so when you have a few skeletons, fiery dogs and a dragon converging on you - you can't really follow the beats within 20% margin what is usual for rhythm games)
First things first: this is a rhythm game and its soundtrack wirtten by Danny Baranowsky is just pure essence of awesomeness
 Randomly generated levels are extremely well done
 When I say extremely I mean it
 This game doesn't have unbeatable generations
 It may be easier or harder, but it's a fair rogue-like, if you die - it's your fault
 It's not like rogue's tale when you can be killed on first turn the moment you spawn
 So you won't really be stomped by something you can't beat
With the release the game has been augmented with some kind of plot which makes it a bit more beautiful than a rogue-like w/o a plot
 Also this game even during Early Access didn't have any gamebreaking bugs
 In 80h I never had a single crash or anything else that'd ruin my gaming experience, since technically this is kind of a day1 for this game - it's exremely polished, which is a good example what Early Access system should be used for and how
With cutscenes you are being rewarded with when you complete "zones" with different characters, with easier and harder characters themselves, with a big variety of items, leaderboards, daily challenges - delivering beatdowns to the beat in this game is guaranteed to be one your best rogue-like experiences ever

Early Access Review
One day my daughter came home from school and asked me "Have people actually travelled to the Moon
How is it possible
"Two years ago, I would have answered "yes, but I don't really know how
It's very complicated, with lots of math and science
You might learn about it in a physics class in 10 years time
"Instead, I answered "Here, let me show you
" and fired up Kerbal Space Program
We built a moon rocket and launched it, me steering and she hitting the separation detonation buttons when needed
30 minutes later we had landed on the moon
Thank you, Squad, for enabling me to give that answer
Posted: 29 May
Love this game to bits
 - Developers output updates semi-often (couple months between them) and none of them ruin the game in any way
- Absurd amounts of content that make the game very well worth the hefty pricetag
- Mod-compatible (although they are not on the steam workshop)- A very friendly community
 Easily one of the best I've seen
- Well-polished physics that (hopefully) won't bug out on you much
 For a 3D physics-based game, it works astoundingly well
- If you're interested in the science and physics part of the game, it can be fairly math-based, which is probably good if you're into science and physics anyways
Issues:- Very hard to understand at first
 I'll admit to watching 3 let's plays about KSP before knowing how to play it
- UI and controls are a bit confusing
 They get more comfortable later on, but at the start it's frustrating
- Takes a good amount of previous knowledge
Get to know the game and it's really enjoyable
 I'd highly recommend going on youtube if you don't understand it

My 8 year old son broke away from Minecraft today
 He sat on my lap while we made a rocket
 He asked questions about rockets
 We made it into space and he asked, "Are we in space
" We came down and the friction caused our heat shield to glow
 His eyes were wide open as we slowed down
 We pressed the space bar to deploy our parachutes but were going too fast and our chutes failed
 We crashed and he asked if the kerbal was OK
 I said yes as I hit ESC and went back to the VAB and changed a few things
 A few minutes later, we landed our capsule safely and he had the biggest smile on his face
 I haven't heard a word about Minecraft since
 Thank you for making this wonderful game
Posted: 11 June, 2015
Words alone cannot express how amazing KSP is
To be honest, this is not a game for everyone
If you are in the market for some fast-paced "space combat sim" with all kinds of weapons and big explosions, then this isn't what you are looking for
(Except for the big explosions
 KSP has you covered there)
However, if you ever dreamed of actually being an astronaut, this is definitely for you
If you sometimes forget to breath when watching recordings of the Apollo moon landings, this is definitely for you
If precise, measured flying; careful planning; and delta-v budgeting are what drives you, this is definitely for you
If you want to learn about Orbital Mechanics and are dying to know what the Oberth Effect or a Hofman Transfer Orbit are, this is definitely for you
 If you like Physics, this is definitely for you
Optionally, if you just like building rediculously large rockets and watching them explode with glorious comedy when they fail catastrophically because you forgot ONE PART
 then this is also definitely for you
Kerbal Space Program is challenging, fun, frustrating, mind boggling, huge, hilarious, complicated, deep, and just plain awesome
Posted: 15 June
"See that little grey circle in the night sky, impossibly far away
 You can go there
">Spend the next few hours building and testing rockets, trying to get one into orbit
 Laugh at all the explosions, and the ever-increasing body count
 Realize you have no idea how orbital mechanics work
>Research how actual rockets achieve an orbit, maybe watch a Youtube video
 Maybe take a step back and spend a few hundred hours just exploring your home planet with a plane or rover
>Get into orbit
 Realize you have no idea how to get to the moon
 Research a whole different type of orbital mechanics
>Get to the moon
 Realize parachutes don't work
>Land on the moon, more-or-less in one piece
 Realize there's another moon, a bunch of other planets, asteroids that you can capture and bring into orbit, resources that you can harvest into rocket-fuel on the surface of other planets, AND an amazing modding scene that can infinitely more gameplay

As a Physics student I never quite understood entirely Classical Mechanics till I met Jebediah Kerman
 He taght me everything, the real thing, he became de facto my true master and I couldn't be more grateful for what he did for me
 We became best buddies, he gave me courage to continue with my studies
 I can't recall how many long nights have we spent exploring other worlds completely drunk and having existencial talks
 Though, I never quite understood a damn word of what he said
 I love this guy to death
 I would die if something ever happened to him
 RIP Jebediah (for the 42th time)

This game should be standard issue in school physic classes
 Taught me more about orbital mechanics than anything else

Early Access Review
1st hour playing: WHAT DO I DO WHY IS IT BLOWING UP400th hour playing: If my calculations serve me right with this T/W ratio It will take me 1 minute 43 seconds to burn at my periapsis to reach duna insertion at which point I will get into an eliptical equatoral orbit and perform an aerobrake at 16km to get into a steady circular orbit and then I will descend with one of my 4 spaceplanes I took to go to the north pole at which I will set up base at my already existing rover while getting TAC resources to monitor life support and make sure my colony of 212 kerbals can live
11/10Edit because for some reason this gained popularity, proper review:Pros:Endless fun, so much to do
 Bored of building rockets
 Build a space plane
 Fed up of the mun
 Go to Duna
 Don't want to leave the atmosphere
 Build whatever you want
 The list goes on
Fantastic modding community and fantastic mods
 So much more expansion on an already amazing game
Fantastic community in general, some of the nicest people I've met have came from this game
 They are such a helpful bunch and I'm glad I'm with them
 They'll most likely love to help you
 There's also a bunch of fantastic YouTubers such as Scott Manley and others
 (too many to name) :)YOU CAN LEARN STUFF FROM THIS AND GAIN NEW INTERESTS
 Before I played this I had no interest in space or space exploration whatsoever but now I actively follow space news and am quite knowledgable on the subject
 I have also learnt a fantastic deal of orbital mechanics just from playing and learning the game
Cons:The engine and optimisation
 This game uses Unity and it only uses 1 CPU core
 This can be a major problem if running a multicore with low clock speed
 The 32bit version of the game is a whole lot more stable but limits your RAM meaning that if you have a ton of mods you can run into a lot of crashes but thankfully there are mods out there such as ATM (Active Texture Management) and texture replacer to limit the amount of RAM the game uses
 64bit as of now is still pretty unstable with mods
The learning curve and tutorials
 The learning curve on this game is huge, I'm not complaining much about this one as rocket science isn't exactly easy is it
 You can learn from trial and error and it's how I learnt alot but some things you just have to read up about or watch a tutorial on youtube
 There isn't really much of a tutorial in game either
Conclusion: Buy it
 It's really fantastic

A great game if you know what you're doing
 If you don't know what you're doing, it becomes mindless fun involving explosions and terrified astronauts
Posted: 8 December, 2014
To remove any doubts, this is by far THE best space simulator out there
 The Good Amazing learning experience Choose where you want to go, with what, when, and how
 HUGE planets to discover, literally, thousands upon thousands of kilometers to walk, drive, or fly your epic creations (or, if your not very creative, preset or other players' ships) Create awesome rockets, landers,ore collection/ astronaut housing bases on other planets, and spaceplanes, the way you want them Fun science mode to work your way up, earning "science" in order to get better equipment and rocket parts (I recommend for newish players who know at least basic orbits / how to get to the Mun) "Creative" mode where all parts are unlocked (great for testing and trying new things) "Career" mode for those really wanting a challenge (balance economy, science, and reputation for your own space organization, I recommend having a little more experience before jumping right in) The Career mode adds A LOT of purpose to the game, as well as adding new challenges such as having to make landings in certain locations, sending satellites in specific orbits, making space stations at specific altitudes, placing a flag on a certain body, collecting ore from a planet, etc
 They are still adding to this game
 Additionally, there are several user created mods that really expand on the experience, adding new parts or game mechanics
 Built off of real physics
 One doesn't just lop space junk up into the sky; one must deliver that space junk the realistic and correct way, thus rendering Kepler and Newton proud
 (generally speaking, it allows one to see how actual launches and orbits work in the real world) Many other great aspects to this game (however, this would be a long list with all of them)The Bad Graphics aren't the best, however, they are still good and create a real sense of depth and can deliver a "lost-in-space" kind of a feel
 It makes me feel so small compared to the vastness of our world
 Plus, the graphical style really fits the style of the overall game
Somewhat steep learning curve- It took me a while to learn to get to the "Mun
" After this achievement, it was a lot easier to get to Minmus after this
 It was difficult to get to Duna, however, once I got there, I have gradually learned enough to go pretty much anywhere and have made a permanent base on Laythe complete with science lab, crew pod and a brand spanking new air breathing engine jet transport, as well as a souped up Rover for them to drive
 I have been to almost all of the planets
 So basically, it takes time to get "good" at this game, but I assure you, it's rewarding and so spectacular to see how huge this world is (And this one is scaled down, too
)
 However, new tutorials should be very helpful for the beginner
not too much music (it's still good, just gets repetitive sometimes) (*ahem* devs please add more music)
Getting to further out planets can take a long time, because it is a little more difficult and takes more resourcefulness
 (several hours if your like me and really take your time, especially if you send a 3 manned mission to Eeloo
 [you'll get faster the more experience you get though])Overall, this is a wonderful simulator offering a lot of real science with fun, providing lots of hours of engaging gameplay
 I am so happy the developers have successfully brought this amazing game out of beta
 I have purchased this game so long ago, and the updates have vastly improved the game and have solved many of the problems I have dealt with
 Thank you for reading this book of a review, and I hope this really helps
 Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions, I have over 400 hours logged and played the demo for several hours
 I will try to get to them as soon as possible
 Happy Kerballing

Have you ever noticed how, in a typical RPG (and, now that I think about it, most games in general) battles don’t really mean anything
 How many times have you defeated a miniboss, only to have it stand back up and laugh at you, saying “I have underestimated you
 You are a worthy opponent
 This is not the end
 We shall meet again
” and make a getaway
 Think about it
 How many times do you beat up Balrog in Cave Story only to have him fly away without a scratch
 How is Black Knight able to keep running away after Shovel Knight stabs the hell out of him
 How come you black out if you lose a Pokémon battle, but none of the other trainers do
 And how does the big bad villain always seem to get away, even if their HP hits zero, so they can reappear in the sequel
Undertale asks the question, “What if defeating an enemy in battle always means that they die
”This might seem quite inconsequential in random encounters, but Undertale will also pit you against several main characters
 If you defeat a main character in battle, they’re dead for good, and the whole story changes to reflect it
 Heavy stuff
But thankfully, as the game advertises, you don’t actually have to kill anyone
 The game offers a second option to get out of battles: talking the enemy out of fighting
 This involves solving a simple puzzle, almost always involving the “Act” menu in battle
 The puzzle changes depending on what kind of enemy you’re fighting; sometimes you’ll just need to give them a compliment, other times you’ll need to survive several of their attacks, and so on
 Once they’re not emotionally invested in the battle anymore, you can “spare” them, and the battle ends
 You won’t get any EXP for it, but you’ll still get gold
 It’s a very unique fighting mechanic
I admit, after my first playthrough of the game, I was disappointed in the story’s presentation
 I thought that both the very beginning and the final area of the game were fantastic, dripping with shocking emotional dilemmas, but the middle 80% of the game’s content seemed like it relied too much on oddball humor and not much else
 The game hilariously plays with expectations and has no shortage of genuinely witty satire of its genre, and I found myself amused by nearly all of it, but after the first two hours as I was walking across long linear worlds and listening to dozens of characters try to tell me jokes, I started to wonder where the emotional gravity had gone
 “Why is this game making me laugh, when I thought it was supposed to make me cry
” I asked myself
 “Where are the feelings
 After such an excellent and powerful prologue, why is the game taking so long to show me more
”Later that night, as I was lying awake in bed, the answer hit me: the game was quirky and lighthearted because I was sparing everyone’s life
 I wasn’t playing as a murderer
 If you want this game to have drama, you have to cause it
 And I think that’s where all the hype is coming from, all the talk about player choice
 This is a game about being a tree-hugging pacifist, or a murderous psychopath who kills anyone who gets in the way, or anything in between
 You only need to live with whomever you decide to be, because the game won’t let you ignore what you have done
Though it isn’t the most visually impressive game, and the stage design isn’t always the best, Undertale has left me feeling that I have just witnessed a work of art
 It tried some new and ambitious things and isn’t ashamed of what it wanted to be
 It's about 6 hours long; I’d recommend anyone to play it at least twice, just to be able to say that they've made their own choices and seen what the game has to offer
 It’s hard to imagine that anyone would regret the experience
Posted: 10 November, 2015
Ten dollars
 Only a few hours of gameplay
 16-bit graphics compared to the flashy 1080p stuff in standard games
But
 wow
 Undertale blew me away
 It doesn't need flashy graphics or even fanservice to falsify its enjoyment
 It just does things right, and boy that was one immensely enjoyable experience
I think most of the magic of this game comes from knowing absolutely nothing about it
 I got this game from a friend and just decided to play it since it looked very interesting and it was getting good responses
 So I went in completely blind, knowing nothing but the game's name
 And I'm glad I did, because everything the game presented to me was unexpected, notably dark in places, and very emotional, which would have been lost entirely if i watched someone else play it
 So, if you happened to have been flooded by everything Undertale on tumblr (god help us) and the entire story's already laid out for you, the magic has been lost and the game won't be as incredible of an experience
 I'm sorry
Of course, I call Undertale an "experience", not a game, only because it does such a fantastic job at it
 Following the motto on the store page, "the game where you don't have to destroy anyone", the game always tries to nudge you in that direction, taking a back seat in your mind and reminding you to "Spare them
"
 And of course, you answer with "Why
 Why should I do that when it offers me the option to kill anyone I want right in front of me
 What's in it for me
" And that's where the game literally turns into a personal experience, as everyone has a different response for the game's selling point
 And boy, does it turn to black or white pretty fast from here
Undertale's ability to completely turn the tables of its story depending on your actions is massive
 Upon your game's startup, every little thing you do will be set in stone in the game's story pathing
 If you're the type who immerses yourself into the game's charming music, laughs at the childish but hiliarious anctics, and is willing to hork down healing items just to prevent yourself from killing a monster just because a fight is difficult, the game rewards you
 It opens up a very character-developing and world-unfolding story, along with some of the most emotionally invested boss battles I have ever experienced
 You know a game is good when it breaks the fourth wall so well that you're shaking in your seat in true fear and can't stop the shivers, all while having to fight a hopelessly overpowered god of a boss
 The amazing writing only starts once you beat the final few bosses, and the story doesn't stop being good from there onwards
On the other hand, what makes this game different is that it keeps its dark side from you, and its entirely your choice to experience it
 If you scoff at the game's sparing choice since you're too cool or grown up to possibly be nice to people, you can go around and intentionally sink your weapon into a monster who just wants to be a friend
 And unlike many other games, this isn't just a simple moment of "Oops, I killed another unnamed enemy, let's reset the game and nothing changes"
 the weight of a dark choice is huge
 Nothing can be taken back, and it forever changes your playthrough
 Reset the game, and the characters know
 Events change
 And with each curious kill, you, in turn, turn from the only human in a land of monsters into the biggest monster in a land of innocents
 In the end, ignoring what Undertale sets out to do, which is to let you experience childlike innocence and fun, only makes it delibrately change the game into a quieter, more grim story
 Very little character development, and the world isn't explained to you, nothing
 There's very little reward for going through this route
 Yet it is a choice you can do
 Granted, you get two of the hardest boss battles by becoming the murderer and will be forced into Game Overs repeatedly from them, but even that is a message from the game
 It's trying to stop you from getting to the end of this route
 Before its too late
It's as if you're doing deeds in an actual living, breathing world
 And that's what makes it even more terrifying when you decide to become a murderer instead of a savior, because only you know that you're willingly going forward to obliterate every weakling in front of you
 It's a test of your willpower, and it's your choice
 The worst thing
 The damage cannot be repaired
 Go clean, or go home tainted
 The game even gives you the choice to completely delete everyone's happiness after the most satisfying happy ending
 The happiness you worked so hard to earn
 And you can even become the murderer after saving the world, which will only permanently taint your game and never let you have a satisfying ending again
 That's absolutely brutal, and yet that's still a choice
 Amazing
Yes, this game might not be for everyone
 The humour may become dry after a while for some people, and tons of gamers nowadays like to bash at popular games instead of trying it out, just because they feel accomplished by doing it
 But, if like me, you are willing to experience why everyone's been talking about this game, give it a shot
 Hell, even if you hate the game to bits and want to kill everyone, buy the game, do so, and at least have your own personal experience before refunding it
 This game does the morality concept so well that other games can only dream of doing the same, and it is one not to be forgotten
It is a sin to call Undertale a game
 Doing that would categorize Undertale into the bland and consequence-free "kill-em-all" genres that a lot of games are falling into now
Undertale is a story-driven, emotional experience

This is one of those few games that come along when times are bleak, and games have become regularly bland and heartless
 Where you feel disenfranchised with the whole idea of video games
 And you begin to start ask "Why
"
 Like "Why should we play games
", "Why are games different from other media
", "Why should you use games as a form of expression
" and even "Why even play games at all
" Undertale come along and says, "This is why
"

(Mostly spoiler-free review)I hate turn-based RPGs
 This is my Game of the Year
 What
After becoming ULTRA-JADED about gaming with the cancellation of Silent Hills, this game re-established that games can be really, really frickin good
This thing was made with an incredible amount of love, and it shows in every nook and cranny, every joke, every secret conversation you never thought a game dev would have thought to include
 Tobyfox is the most thorough dev ever
 I'm continuously impressed with how many things he thought to include in this game, and how he managed to make it all extremely fun the entire way through
 You'd think you've seen everything in this game, but you haven't
 There's always another amazing thing, another way to turn the genre on its head, another great joke you didn't see coming
 And it stays engaging the entire time, supported by a cast of fantastic, endearing, hilarious characters
 Great puzzles too, imo
 It avoids all the things about (turn-based and non) RPGs that I despise: -There's no grinding (unless you want to)-Battles are a great length and never overstayed their welcome for me-There's no boring menu-navigation-only-based combat (bullet dodging/timing-based stuff really spices it up, as well as bossfights always having a new, really fun gameplay twist on them
)-There's no unlikable/unrelatable characters that go on and on about you being the "Chosen One" or whatever-No plot where you gotta go to the 7 temples and find the 7 sacred whatevers and then oh wait now that you've gotten those 7 sacred whatevers, you gotta go to 4 extra places and get 4 SUPER sacred whatevers
 -No backtracking (unless you want to
 Backtracking is actually usually rewarded with more fun conversations and such
)-No constant equipping and unequipping items because, oh, this one is +2 Def but -3 Speed but THIS one is +3 Speed and -2 Def but THIS one is immune to fire and this one is
-It actually has a way more complex, useful moral than "Evil is Bad, Good is Good
" Everyone has relateable motivations
-The writing doesn't suck like 90% of RPGs
 It has a wonderful sense of humor and a simple plot that is underlaid with complex emotions
-Has jokes about anime, doesn't take itself seriously
I could gush about it forever
 Undertale's not only made me less jaded about gaming, but also less jaded about real life
 It has a strong message about empathy that stays everpresent, while somehow not being cloying about it, or shoving the message down your throat
 It's simply a wonderful experience, please play this thing

Early Access Review
Holdfast: Nations At War was a long awaited game to succeed its closest predecessor in style - Mount and Blade Warband: Napoleonic Wars
 It is set in the perilous reign of Napoleon Bonaparte, a French Emperor who managed to bring nations to their knees before a mighty coalition repulsed the tyrant and restored order to Europe
 History lesson over
It is worth noting that despite the fact that I positively reviewed this game, it does have shortcomings, and unfortunately, they are quite critical to the feel of the game
 I, personally, recommend it regardless
but if you were after a well-made game with relatively few flaws, this is not a title you should be looking at just yet
 To start off with, the first thing you'll notice in this game is that the graphics are amazing
 Keeping in mind that it was made by three developers who self-funded the project, it puts modern titles made by bigger companies to shame
 The developers did an excellent job with everything about the visuals of this game, from adding realistic lighting, appealing textures, realistic weathers to which the environment realistically reacts and so much more
 The gun smoke looks incredible and really helps to make the battles feel just that bit more immersive
 The detail in the game is also incredible
 The uniforms are designed very well, and look authentic to the era and the faction under which they are used
 Weapons are historically accurate, and designed both differently and extremely well, with the French using the Charleville muskets - noticeably different to the British Brown Bess, and the officer's pistols also being accurate in design to that of their respective nation
 Nothing in this game looks out of place
 As well as looking, this game also feels very realistic
 Aided immensely by the graphics and the detail that went into the authentic props and the battlefield carnage, the game also makes it surprisingly hard to identify friend from foe
 This is not done in a game destroying way, but in that from a distance, you can see a soldier, but you cannot often make out his side
 While the standard Red (British) and Blue (French) uniforms for line infantry are easy to understand, it is when you get Musicians, Sailors, and sharpshooters that you will find yourself firing at your own team
 This is realistic, and such mistakes have happened in historical battles
 The game also feels realistic with regards to how the weapons work
 While reload times are not 30 seconds (because that would be boring) the sequence is accurate to that of the era, and how the weapons actually fire is too
 You can be spread out in close quarter combat firing at each other with surprisingly few casualties - as it would have been like back in the day due the lack of reliability and accuracy of the weapons
 This was the reason they used to fight in lines in the first place
 And finally, the integration of Naval Battles and Coastal Siege etc was a very welcomed introduction
 The cross over from land to Naval warfare all within one theatre of combat is wild, and extremely fun to take part in
 The Naval battles do only feature small ships such as sloops, but they are well designed and take visible damage, as well as having many functional parts, and unlike Warband, the game can handle it
 It is not glitchy and everything from the ship to the cannons to the muskets handle well
 For all of its good points, though, there are things that let this game down, and they should be addressed, so as both to inform the buyer, and hopefully aid the developers in refining this so-far amazing project which they have undertaken
 In no particular order, then, here are things about the game that I cannot praise: - The Melee
 It uses a similar system to Warband in that there are 4 ways of block and attack (or two ways of attack for muskets) but the system is very badly made, and consequently, melee is unbelievably hard
 Attack animations are slow, and not very responsive
 Melee at the moment is a lot more down to luck than skill, unlike in Warband where skill was critical
 This leads me on to responsiveness of controls in general
 Switching from melee to shooting is slow, and sometimes does not work, which means that you cannot break your reload and will inevitably be killed as you can only walk while reloading a weapon
 It would be nice to see this fixed, sooner rather than later
 - No server filters
 As of yet, you cannot filter out just the servers that you want, excluding those with high ping and no players, etc
 For ease of use, this feature does need adding to the game, but while not convenient, it is not crippling to its quality
 It is worth noting too, that sometimes the server player count is wrong, and will give the impression that there are a certain number of players on a server which is not true
 It may be full, for example, or empty, and be showing 78 players in it
 - No character customisation
 This would be a much-appreciated feature to the game
 I don't expect the choice of a female character if they are aiming for realism, but at least the option to do something with the appearance of your character would be welcomed by a lot of us
 - Lack of nations and cavalry
 The game has only got Navy and Infantry classes at the time of this review, and the only two nations available are France and the United Kingdom
 The developers are working on adding more content to the game, though, so this isn't something that should put you off buying it
- Lack of sub-classes in units, and descriptions of loadout etc
 Finally, the only other disadvantage I can think of is that the spawn menu allows you to pick “Line officer”, “Line Infantry”, “Light Infantry”, “Rifles”, “Guards” etc, but there are no sub-options like there was in Mount and Blade: Warband
 There is no way to play as a “Guard Captain” for example, or a “Rifleman Bugler” etc
 This does feel quite limiting, and I hope that the developers will implement this feature soon
 It would also be nice to see a description of each class’ loadout so we can assess the advantages and disadvantages of playing as one of them
 As an extra level of detail, it would be good to have the option to change the loadout slightly where possible, say from a pistol as a sailor to a musket, which they would also have used
 Overall, though, this game has done really well
 It is only early days, and with a lot of support and feedback from the community, I feel like the developers can do a very good job of this title
 You can tell that a lot of time and hard work went into the creation of it, and I am keen to see it succeed both for the developers and for the community
 I would give this game a strong 7/10, for what we have is largely well made
 It would just be so much better were the faults to be fixed, but of course, we must give them time
 Thank you for taking the time to read my review

Early Access Review
The Good Stuff++Very active devs (A team of literally 3 guys) that constantly release bug fixes and updates and reply to user feedback to keep the game going
 They're treating Early Access like it should be treated++An awesome community
 Being as I bought this having played the Napoleonic Wars DLC for Warband for over 300 hours, I knew how good a community could be
 I was expecting the same coming into this game and it is as good as I had hoped
 Yes there's the occassional whiner or gamethrower, but in a game with 125-150 players it's expected there's at least one of those morons+Very nice graphics, colors are very vibrant and the characters look fairly sharp+Line battles, sieges and naval battles on 125-150 player servers+Multiple official servers that are always active plus fast respawns in the battle make it to where you are not sitting there for long when you are not engaged directly in combat, and therefore not bored waiting in a stale moment+Multiple unit types, each with their own specialties and design+Gunplay is very nice especially with the bullet drop
 The weapons are for the most part historical accurate because they are somewhat more accurate than you'd think they'd beThe Ok Stuff=There's in game voice chat
 You can imagine the chaos with 125 players talking at once for various reasons=I don't use it really and don't have trouble with it, but the artillery interface is difficult and confusing for some people to use=The interface for character voice commands (V key) is nice but also a little cluttered seeing as there's 50+ commands and it covers a chunk of the screen in the middleThe Bad Stuff-Certain controls are very slow to respond regardless of how good your computer is
 (Crouching, melee attack, melee defense, reloading, and some minor ones)-When melee does work after a second or two, it's very buggy and rather random if you hit someone or get stabbed yourself
 It's nowhere near as clean and sharp as the Napoleonic Wars DLCTL:DRA great alternate to the Napoleonic Wars DLC for Warband but the controls are rather unresponsive at times
 like every girl I've ever texted

Early Access Review
my first game:I spawn as a carpenter on a large ship, with maybe twenty other people on it, in the middle of the ocean
 We approach a fleet of British ships ready for a bloody fight
 The boom of cannons and the ring of muskets deafen us as swarms of projectiles fly in our direction, smashing into our ship
 We fire back, and watch with joy as the large metal balls from our cannons smash into the enemy
 After about another minute of fighting, our ship is stuck between several of the enemy's
 We are barraged until our ship slowly begins to sink into the water
 The last few remaining crewmates boarded a nearby British ship, attempting to take control, but are quickly mowed down by musket-fire
 I pushed a rowboat off of the ship, attempting to get away from the massive amount of bullets being shot in our direction
 I watched as the rest of my crewmates were all easily killed
 I hid in the water until the enemy boats had moved on to their next target, narrowly evaing death
 I pulled myself up onto a lifeboat, looking for any other survivors in the debris
 One man swam out of the wooden rubble and came aboard
 I began to steer the boat toward a friendly ship
 Suddenly, the man pulled out a violen and began to play the most beautiful songs, filling my ringing ears with wonderful tunes
 We slowly made our way back towards the battle, all the way listening to his beautiful music
 As we approached an enemy ship on out lifeboat, we drew our weapons, but were unable to get out of the way of the massive boat and were run over and killed
 10/10 would die in a lifeboat listenting to music again

Early Access Review
As somebody who has been active in the Napoleonic Wars Linebattle community for over 8 years now, starting back in Battlegrounds 2, and following Mount and Musket and M&B Napoleonic Wars, I was really looking forward to the early access release of Holdfast: Nations at War and from all what I have seen so far, I have not been disappointed although you can clearly see that the game is still in an Alpha Status
 So let's start with a the pros & cons before going into the summary and recommendation:Pros:+ The games graphics are quite nice and enjoyable, especially on high graphic settings, although I must admit that the graphic style might not be liked by everybody
 The graphic details especially
are really nice and show the devotion to the game by the developers
+ The game mechanics are, all in all, quite solid for an early access game compared to other early access games I have played so far
 The game is playable and enjoyable, although you can clearly see that there is need for more updates, tuning and reworking things like the melee system
+ The different game modes are enjoyable and already have a high variation from 'Army Battle' - which is basically the Linebattle mode - over Siege, Coastal Siege or classic TDM to full Navy Battles where you fight ship against ship
 Everybody who enjoys playing in the Napoleonic era can find a play style for himself
+ The great potential the game has to offer is also a positive argument for Holdfast in my opinion
 Especially seeing the roadmap of the developers to include features like cavalry and more, I think that the game can become quite great
 Although I am sure it is still a lot of work to include all the mentioned features and fixes, the current status of the game already shows the developers' devotion towards it
Cons- The game mechanics still show a kind of roughness, especially the melee system
 There needs to be a reworking of this so that for example the melee fights become enjoyable and smooth
 The hit-box detection can be quite frustrating at the moment when you hit an enemy on your screen but the hit is not counted, so your opponent doesn't take damage
 The same goes for the Naval Battles where the end status of the ships is not taken into consideration for the round result - also the handling of the ships is quite weird in the sense of manoeuvring and hit reactions on enemy ships
 These things need to be fixed soon, but I am confident that this is not a feasible goal
- The problem with high server latency is something that is currently being worked on but at the current state of the game it is quite a huge problem, because it makes playing on a full server nearly impossible
 But as I said, the developers are currently working on this
- Some animations are missing or need some reworking, like for example the hit reaction in melee, which is missing at the moment
 I would appreciate some reworking of the sword fighting animations since they look quite unnatural
 Summary & RecommendationAll in all I can say Holdfast: Nations at War is a solid early access game in which you can learn the basic game mechanics and enjoy different game modes already with nice graphics
 It is a great opportunity to get an impression of battles in the Napoleonic era although some things are tarnishing the game experience
 The melee system needs reworking and attentive updates so it becomes smoother and more reactive towards the players mouse input, for example in blocking
 Warband shows a very good example of how a smooth and quick melee system can work and I am sure the developers have this topic on their to-do-list
 Still the very basic game mechanics are working and the game is not "unplayable" as some other reviews might suggest
 For people like me, that enjoy the Napoleonic era in general, playing as a
Napoleonic soldier and fighting in melee or with a gunpowder weapon, may it be on land or on sea, it is an enjoyable experience already
 Especially as soon as the high latency issue is fixed
 But keep in mind that the game is still early access and some people might get frustrated by the weird hit-box detection or the very slow and unresponsive melee game play
 If you expect to be frustrated by those current issues I would suggest you wait for further updates and development before you actually buy Holdfast
For everyone else I can recommend the game
 As future updates release I will update the review

Early Access Review
This video pretty sums up my experience with Holdfast https://www
youtube
com/watch
v=fCe4NXhxlfoFirst of all, this game has tons of protential and a lot of people are expecting way too much to be completed considering this is an alpha with its' first week of being released, and already the devs have done a lot
 People need to understand that we pay for early access so devs recieve money to fund their game- that is the entire point of early access
 It's good to know that they're using the money well, and I hope to see their dev team expand
On to the review
 This game is pretty much the same as NW-Warband with the addition of enjoyable naval battles, naval sieges, better graphics and character animations
 That isn't a bad thing, as Napoleonic Wars was perfect in its' own way, it's great to see a game that was left barren by the community be revived in Holdfast
 I rejoined a regiment I left almost 3 years ago, and have been addicted to it since release
 The problem is; this game will not survive under nostalgia
 I seriously do hope that they can add far more than their planned tornuments, maybe in the far future, a coop campaign to play in all of Napoleons battles with your regiment and to fight against large AI armies could be a promising change of pace for those who don't always want a loose multiplayer experience and might want a fun campaign in their with characters
 And should Holdfast be stuck in the Napoleonic wars
 I don't think so, why not move this into multiple eras and fronts
 The War of 1812, the American Revolution, the American Civil War, the 7 years war and so on
 I'm sure once mods are enabled, people will attempt these anyway- but why not include them into the base game
 Of course, this is all far out of the minds of the devs who are just trying to build upon the base game
 Though I hope they read this and consider the massive possibilities of creating a huge game that people will come back to for years
 I would not want to see this game fade like NW
Anyway, this is just my first review
 Once the devs move this into beta, I'll make a final opinion on it
 I recommend this ONLY IF you are willing to push through expected bugs from an early access game
 These guys aren't AAA, they are a small team and have done a great job so far and are already active in fixing bugs
 Buy at your own risk
 If you aren't an NW player, then you may feel less inclined to play this until it has more content

NOTE: I have been bug testing this game for the last 3 months, these opinions of the game are my own and I have not been paid to say them, the developers of the game have given me a key to bug test and help with stress tests other than that as of the 21st of september I'm just another player like everyone else, these are my honest opinions on the game
Holdfast: Nations at War is a beautiful Napoleonic Era game, the sounds are truly stunning and never fail to impress, I've been following this game for sometime now and have seen it develop so much
 With new updates and content comming soon for this game this is for sure a good purchase for those who love this era
 Pros:- Stunning graphics- Great community- Amazing sounds- Smooth gameplay (not so much animations)- Perfect shooting mechanics - Musicians
- Interesting maps- Nice admin commands once you learn how to use them- Easy to form formations- In game voice chat is a nice touch too- Nice developers- And lots more- Server Lobby Filters- Admin Panel
Cons:- Currently the melee is a little lacking but that will improve over time- Naval optimisations could be better- Some animations aren't very smoothFor £15 you can't go wrong
 The game is for sure worth a buy and people should give the game a chance if they're unsure :)

A Hat in Time is one of the best platformers you'll find on steam
Pros:+Colorful Artstyle+Easy to grab+Full Voice Acting+Funny/Cute Story Line+Funny/interesting characters+Gives Super Mario Sunshine/ Legend of Zelda: Windwaker feels
Cons:-I didn't support the kickstarter and now i'm sad
Overall a pecking good time
Posted: 5 October
this is one of the prime examples of a succesful kickstarter, i have pre-ordered this game in 2014 and i have no regrets in supporting it for so long
i have played the alpha, beta, speedrunning event, had fun in all of those, though they were only 6 levels of the game
the game as it is right now is a much more upgraded version from the beta (well duh, its released), it features many more interesting mechanics, improved graphics and well, its finished
 i definitely wont play through it only once, as it has a special spot in my heart, anticipating a game for so long cant be healthy :Pit is one of the best 3D platformers you can get on steam, if you are an enthusiast for this type of game just get it, and if you are interested in the genre, you will have no regrets
you will smile from pure fun, and actually funny writing
 it puts humour where it belongs, and in very precise moments just to get that chuckle out of you
characters are cheerful and memorable, they have great design, atleast i think they do, they look great for the art style the game points torward to, their voice acting is great (you will find exceptions for this, though
), and they are just all around loveable

Posted: 8 October
Absolutely one of my favorite games ever
 Probably the only game I've ever 100%'d
 I was a slacker backer for the Kickstarter, so I bought my copy like
 2 or 3 years ago
 And honestly, it was like a gift from my past self to my present self
This game made me feel like a kid again
 The absolute joy of taking control of Hat Kid for the first time, discovering what kind of jumps and leaps you can do onto platforms
 The controls are just so tight and responsive, and everything just works together so well
 The worlds are all so incredibly unique, and no mission is like any other
 The characters you interact with are well voice-acted and full of character
 The bosses you fight are unique and memorable
 The music is STELLAR
 There is not a single song in the game that I don't love
 One issue is that the game does not keep track of your progress on certain collectables such as the pages in Time Rifts (unless you're currently in said Time Rift), yarn, or tokens
 It's very difficult to tell if you've completely cleaned out a world of its things to do when there's no stats on the menus to tell you
 This is pretty minor, as it doesn't really detract of the general experience
 It'd just be icing on the cake if they fixed it
This game is getting workshop soon
 Which will involve custom hats as well as custom made levels with modding tools
 Meaning that when you're done with the game, you won't truly be done
 Even after I 100%'d this game I still want to play more
 Hopefully we can get some level ports of Super Mario 64 so we can play through them as Hat Kid
Overall, the entire game is fantastic
 It's unforgettable to me
 It made me genuinely feel like I was playing Mario Sunshine for the first time again
 It's truly unique, and a great result of a long time development cycle
Posted: 6 October
Here's some pretty extensive thoughts of A Hat in Time after playing it for 8-9 hours & completing about half of the game (my percentage on my main file is about 50% done right now, & I've completed 21/40 levels the game has so far
A Hat in Time's story follows a nameless girl (aka Hat Kid) who is an alien who's ship runs on hourglasses that store time, having the ability to rewind & freeze time
 Due to some silly shenanigans involving the mafia on a planet she's passing, her ship crashes and her 40 hourglasses spread across the planet
 She goes off to collect them all, meeting a colorful cast of characters along the way
 The game's story isn't going to win any awards, but I've been surprised how much I've enjoyed it thus far
 The characters are voice acted, & so far the voice acting is pretty good (there's also a badge you can equip which makes them to 'mumble' speak if you wish
 more on badges in a bit)
A few of the characters I've already come to love, plenty have time to let you come to know them & find them likable or not
 I also appreciate the game's villain angle, everything is kind of a gray area in the game
 The good guys aren't wholly good, the bad guys aren't wholly bad
 Hat Kid actually doesn't seem to care about good vs evil, there's a do-gooder who has a morale high-ground of sorts & can't understand why Hat Kid doesn't want to use her hourglases for good, but Hat Kid just wants her hourglasses back
 The bosses you face aren't strictly because they're the bad guys, just they're in your way to collect your hourglasses back
 Motives for the bosses so far often have to do with wanting the hourglasses to go back in time & undo a mistake in their past, something they'll do anything to change rather than because they're evil, which I find an interesting dynamic
 I don't know obviously if the story holds up all the way through yet, but I like it for what it is so far
Game has a hub world, which is Hat Kid's ship
 The ship loses power & needs the hourglasses to restore it
 Get more hourglasses, & more of the ship unlocks as well as access to a new world becomes available to play
 The hub world is fun to explore & gets more added to it over time, including patrons who decide to board & do small things for you (ranging from allowing you to switch music in stages to selling you something or just loitering with flavor text)
 Out of the many collectibles in the game are souvenirs you can find (split into pieces though), which you bring back to your ship & you organize on one of a few pedestals (you have to manually stack them though)
 If you complete a souvenir, you unlock a new bonus level in one of the stages you can then access, which includes a harder than usual level with collectible pictures that give you a picturebook story (no text, all pictures though) of the backgrounds of the characters who live there
Speaking of collectibles, the collectibles here are well done, which works well for a collectathon
 Every one is linked to something, there's no 'useless' collectible
 Green orbs you get everywhere is your main currency, which you can use at a shopkeeper to buy new badges, to buy some new missions in levels, & some other misc things
 There's different types of yarn you can collect, which gives you different hats
 The hats all give you different powers, & you can change them on the fly with the d-pad or choose one from a menu of hats that slows down times
 The hats abilities range from letting you speed forward, doing a statue-esque ground pound, an aura which makes certain transparent objects appear, & more
 You also can collect customizable looks for your hats, as well as different colors for your main character
There's also badges, which are kind of your power-ups in the game
 You buy them from the store mostly, but some you get from other means
 At the start of the game you can only equip one badge, but there's two upgrade slots you can buy from the shop to equip three badges total
 Badges do everything from giving you a grappling hook to decreasing hat ability charge time to a map showing you where nearby souvenirs are, among many other things
 You can change them on the fly in the middle of the level whenever you like, & they're fun to mess around with & think what's best for a situation
 And then of course, the main goal of the game is to collect back your 40 hourglasses
I feel the game's controls are going to have some mixed reactions, but I actually REALLY like them
 They're a bit floatier than some platformers, & some may have different preferences here to me, but once you begin to get a handle on them you can do some crazy stuff
 They can do a great job at making you kind of feel like you're parkouring, as you can run up walls for a short time, wall jump, slide to go faster, dash in the air, do a double jump, & you can begin combo-ing these things like jump, double jump while in the air, dash in the air ahead, hit a wall, wall jump off the wall, dash in the air again & do a double jump off that dash
 It also can combo well into the other abilities you begin to get, like the running ability can run up walls a bit higher (as faster), or the grappling hook can chain very well into things
 One ability I was not expecting at all is kind of a homing attack similar to Sonic, where if you're close enough to an enemy in the air you can press the attack button to dash towards them in the air as a homing strike
 It's not all very complex, but well handled in my opinion, I personally really like the movement & almost parkour element the game has sometimes
All of this wouldn't matter if the game wasn't fun, which at least I think it's insanely fun
 The missions are very creative with a lot of twists & turns
 I don't want to speak too much in-depth here, but there's a LOT of variety of what you're doing
 The game shows all sorts of inspirations everywhere in its worlds & missions, & has its own set of unique twists on each one
 The game is the sort of game where one level is a murder mystery on a train & you're collecting suspects while avoiding being caught, to a previously fine island level being loaded with lava and having to maneuver in a whole new way due to the change, to a sort of Luigi's Mansion/Resident Evil/Amnesia hybrid horror level, to a level where you rush to go from press meet to press meet trying to become a diva & get your reputation up by publicity stunts, or going behind the scenes of a studio in a segment that almost has tinges of something like Portal
 There's a lot that happens, & then in what happens there's a lot of twists within the twists, & a lot of cleverly timed and amusing jokes & surprises
The game never loses its identity through this, but you end up going through a large variety of scenarios, & different kinds of stages (the main kind of stages are kind of open-world playgrounds that Collectathoners may know, something akin to Mario 64/Sunshine esque style, but there's some very different other types of levels, including these challenge levels that heavily remind me of Mario Sunshine, more linear affairs or sub-areas in the levels with their own flavor & level design)
I've fought two bosses so far
 The bosses in this game are surprisingly not that easy, they take like 20-30 hits before they die & have multiple phases
 The second boss I fought I REALLY liked, so much so I won't spoil it
Music is fantastic, it has some stand-out tracks but all of it I've heard so far is quite good
 There's also several variations of most themes which kick in during different gameplay moments, which does amp up & do what's intended
I need to see if this game falls apart in the second half of the game, & I won't claim everyone will love it as much as I have so far, but this I think is going to be a top five Collectathon title for me
 It has made me smile on multiple occasions, I've had a lot of fun with its mechanics, surprises, level design, missions, characters, and collecting

SCROLL DOWN FOR TL;DRThis is one of the best 3D platformers I've played in a long time
 Tight controls, great abilities and creative level design
"How does it stack up to Yooka Laylee
" you might ask
Well, in terms of level design, humor and characters, it surpasses Yooka Laylee in several points, or at the very least matches it
 The catch
 The game is WAY too short
 Only 5 levels and only 40 hourglasses to collect, 24 of which are needed to beat the game
 However, the sheer amount of mission variety is staggering, and the attention to detail in every level is marvelous
 You never seem to be doing the same thing twice
 If I had to compare it to an existing game, the overall mission structure is like a heavily abridged version of Super Mario Sunshine, complete with platforming levels in a void
The character cast has an incredible amount of heart and soul in it
 Even the bad guys are immensely likable
 The Cook Mafia has to be my favorite band of crooks in the history of video games
 Hat Kid herself doesn't have much personality beyond "cute and happy" during most of the gameplay, but her character becomes more apparent in her diary entires, relic descriptions and the way she comments on various world objects
The bosses are easily the most challenging aspect of the game
 They're fast, have a lot of attacks, and the fights can go on for ages with no midpoints if you die
 Some of them can even get you in a stunlock, which is quite infuriating
Overall, A Hat In Time is a solid little gem, with its biggest problem being that there isn't enough of it
PROS + Great level design + Great controls + Great characters and humorCONS - Way too short - Some bosses can stunlock youSCORE: 8

I have never seen so many interesting "scare mechanics" in one game before
 The whole game plays like you are walking through a haunted house, and it is GREAT
 Every time you walk into a new room, you never know what to expect
Bear in mind however, this game is VERY dark, and I'm not talking about brightness settings
 Some themes in this game can be very disturbing
A very short but very good horror game with a dark and interesting storyline
Highly Recommended

I picked up Layers of Fear after I noticed it had come out of early access
 I refuse to buy games in early access anymore, so I just add them to my wish lish and wait for them to be "finished"
I am posting this review after I played and beat the game
Layers of fear is kind of an interactive story, puzzle, survival horror kind of game
 You play as an artist returning home to work on his opus magnum
At what first appears to be a basic jaunt around his home, quickly turns into a psychological horror, the house appears to be (possibly) haunted as the layouts change, you are confronted by visions of your dead wife and other various paranormal-esc situations
Along the way, you'll collect notes and other memorabilia within the house that offers quick glimpses into the painter's past life, his family and even the state of his mental health
 The game isn't as "scary" as other games of this nature may be and in fact, you are put in several situations in which you can avoid confrontation entirely if so desired
 As far as I am aware, there isn't really a way to die in the traditional sense, which is nice, because the game is set up in a way that you won't have to restart entire chapters of a mistake you may have made
 The writing for the story is farily good, I'd say much better then games such as Penumbra
 It's a fairly unqiue and engaging story that made me want to continue playing just to find out a little bit more
 The puzzles are (generally) not too hard and there was very few moments I was actually stuck
 Unfortunately the game doesn't help you in any real sense, besides some hints scattered about the game and as a result some of the more obscure puzzles can leave players scratching their head
While I did enjoy the time I spent with the game, there are issues with it that I feel inclined to inform people of
 For starters, when you first start playing the game, it's fun and fascinating to explore the artist's big, beautiful house
 The problem is that very early in the game, the exploration aspect of the game is all but removed, Instead the game becomes somewhat of an "on-rails" adventure game, instead of walking freely through the house, instead you'll be traversing hallways and single rooms
 9 out of 10 times, as you enter one room, the door will close and lock behind you, denying any sort of back tracking in the game
 This can become an issue, because the game feels as if it were meant to be explored and it was just a concept that was throw to the side
 On occasion you may be given the opportunity to travel off the beaten path, but it is almost always just for a moment and it usually results in a dead end or locked door
 The missing exploration concept bothers me, because I have always loved horror books, games and movies that involved big, old, beautiful mansions
Another problem that I had with the game is it never really changes scenery too much
 A large majority of the game just looks the same
 Expect to see a lot of dark, dingy rooms, broken walls and floors and broken furniture
 Also expect to see the same art, furniture and random junk over and over and over again
 This becomes an even bigger issue when the game starts to begin recycling rooms
 Finally, the last problem I had with the game was the story
 Remember earlier when I said they had a good story
 They do, the problem stems from the fact that there's a lot of information presented for players to process and it's never really tied together or explained in any real sort of meaningful way
 While I enjoyed the game while I played it, after I beat it, I felt very dissatisfied because I really didn't learn all that much and the game doesn't really make a good attempt at helping you understand
 I have questions, no one appears to have answers and frankly, I am no really into the entire "fan theory community" in which the developers of a game simply don't inform or release information to players, instead they just wait to see if someone gets it "right"
 For me, it just seems like a really lazy form of writing and I tend to get high aggravated with it
Don't get me wrong, I love reading long books, I like guessing at the story, or the plots or even coming up with theories as I enjoy whatever book/movie/game I am playing
 But I expect the writers to eventually tie down and explain what is going on in a clear, concise and satisfying way
If you like games of this nature, if you have enjoyed games like 'A Machine for Pigs' and 'Penumbra', you'll enjoy this game a lot
 If you like psychological horror, you'll appreciate this game
 I can without hesitation recommend this game to horror fans, even given the rough spots of the game

This is a game that genuinely tried to scare me by throwing a bunch of garlic in my general direction
THE BAD Here's how the plot of this kind of games is structured
1
 You launch the title
2
 You know that everything that happens around you is a visual metaphor for one of the following (because it always is): you being dead you dying right now you being an, ahem, bad person your family/children/loved one being dead your family/children/loved one dying right now your family/children/loved one being, ahem, bad people you having killed someone you having killed yourself you planning to kill yourself you being in denial about a traumatizing memory trying to resurface3
 You then play the game, eliminating the wrong options and thus arriving at which inevitable MINDBLOWING AND UNEXPECTED twist this particular one features
 (In case you're curious, in LoF's case it's a combination of
3, 4, 6, and 9
)What I'm trying to say is, the plot of Layers of Fear is so horribly cliche and delivered in such a stilted, overwritten, and unnatural way that it actively hurts the game
 The story of a Super Tortured Artist living with a Super Tragic-slash-Insane Wife (who is also a person of art, a musician) in a Super Posh Mansion is one that would fit on fanfiction
net, not in a game with a price tag
 The worst part is, the writer of the game that is supposedly about art seems to know very little about it, which is why all plot points, letters, and discussions of art remain incompetently vague, afraid to go into specifics
 We keep reading how the main character's art became bad, but—how
 Why
 Did his linework become weak
 The use of colors, blurry and muted
 The composition, skewed
 Did he become repetitive and second-hand
 What was the context of his creations
For a game supposedly about art, Layers of Fear has surprisingly little to say on the subject, if anything at all
THE GOODFortunately, the rest of the game is good—great even
 Keep in mind that this is a walking simulator with mild optional puzzles (either skippable or impossible to fail)
 However, among walking simulators, this is definitely the most visually impressive and robust I've played
 It tried very hard to reinvent something as simple as walking—often successfully
For the most part you will follow a linear path along a corridor of rooms
 Each room is a carefully-crafted separate experience that does its best to be surprising while still using an extremely limited number of mechanics
 Sometimes you need to find an item in a drawer
 Or walk past a painting
 Or, say, look up
 Or turn around twice, with the room changing behind your back
 Or maybe just move along unobstructed
 And then something surreal happens
 It also thows original challenges at you, like instructing the player not to look back and then playing an intriguing/scary sound behind them
It's not too complex, but it's hard not to respect the thought that went into turning Layers of Fear into something more engaging and interactive than a common walking simulator
THE PRETTYThe horrors are of the common screamer variety—you won't find subtlety or taste here
 However, there was a particular type of screamer that I really liked, and that was huge paintings sometimes appearing behind your back
 They do nothing, they don't even move—but unnatural size and proximity definitely make them uncanny in a not-so-overused way
And yes, the paintings are beautiful, as are the rest of the designs
All in all, I would recommend Layers of Fear to fellow lovers of the genre—especially those who are ready to look past the cliches and enjoy this beautiful and oftentimes inventive game for what it is

This is a great horror game:1
 It's not build up on jump scares, there are some jump scares, but not to the point where it gets annoying
2
 The graphics is very very decent3
 The controls are okish, but could be awkward sometimes4
 The music and sound effect
 OMG
5
 The way the atmosphere and sense of horror builds up gets scarier and scarier as you play
 Man, this is some true horror6
 You can actually get killed7
 The story is good and very rewarding as you reveal it

Early Access Review
Being a huge fan of horror games, I absolutely had to pick up Layers of Fear
 As described it as a “psychedelic horror” game, as you play a painter who is feverishly attempting to complete a true masterpiece, while going mad in the process
“Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter
” ~ Oscar Wilde The game mechanics are incredibly refreshing, as there was no specific villain you were trying to escape from, for the most part, which meant that the 'environment' was what you needed to fear, including several jump scares along your way
 http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=519450951Atmospherically, Layers of Fear is astounding from the moment you enter the house you will be exploring
 Rain is falling heavily outside, with occasional bursts of thunder crackling behind you
 The entire game is influenced by art and décor from previous centuries, particularly the architecture and design of the 19th century, and the visuals are very well tied together with this theme
What also worth mentioning is the incredibly alluring and chilling soundtrack during the gameplay, that gives you the emotions the situation pulls you in
 https://www
youtube
com/watch
v=7sB_6mk-XTwI’d recommend the game to anyone who enjoys horror games as a genre, particularly if you don’t mind games where you can’t defend yourself and it’s all about you, the antagonist, and the spooky atmosphere
 Despite the game 'still' being in Early Access, what IS available to play is deeply engaging, if in need of a little polish here and there
The game relies heavily on its ability to set you on edge, so if you’re the type with nerves of steel you likely won’t get too much out of it
 To horror fans, however
 I wholeheartedly recommend Layers of Fear to you
9/10

Early Access Review
This is a keeper
 I don't usually play scary game's unless they're top-notch in terms of overall quality and production, and this game is one of them
 A high quality horror/thriller game that I really hate myself for playing and continually playing
 So far an hour in and screw me, screw this game, but love the quality in the controls, gameplay, features and voice acting
https://www
youtube
com/watch
v=MpweuoNAgdQThe graphics are really great and beautiful alongside the atmosphere being really tense and immersive
 The level of quality in this game and the attention to detail can be put just below P
T
 if not alongside it
The voice acting is just lovely and the dialogue that it has in relation to what you see in the game alongside to what you interact with that's story specific is really awesome to read
 And speaking of story, from what I understand so far it's pitting crazy with crazy and I love it
If you're wondering about jump-scares, there are in the game but within the realm of confusion and mystery the game has so I appreciate it more so than the usual crap in other scary games
Still playing it and will continue to hate myself as I continue to play it
 I whole-heartily recommend this game because of the combination of the high quality production in every aspect, the low price point and the amount of crazy in it in terms of features and story
Update: So I finished it, the "early access version" in about 2 hours, but damn was it fun
 Yes, a horror game that I had "fun" in, and even though I mentioned that I hate myself for/while playing it, I wanted more
 The game is just a joy and I don't mind if the price goes up if they add more and more crazy and content to it
To re-confirm what I said, I love the game because it's high quality and has a lot of crazy trips in it, and it's definitely worth the purchase
Here's my shameless link[www

Posted: 18 October
My five-year-old daughter likes to scare me occasionally, sneaking into my room while I’m busy brushing my teeth and screaming as loud as her distressingly-powerful lungs will let her
 It’s jarring and unpleasant but I laugh it off because she’s just trying to be funny, and more importantly she doesn’t do it that often
 If she screamed in my face every morning and afternoon and evening it would quickly reach tiresome and cruise straight on to aggravating
 My five-year-old daughter understands this, but for some reason the people behind Layers of Fear do not, despite crafting an otherwise beautiful and fascinating game to house their cheap jumpscares
The game opens with very little explanation, you alone in a palatial Victorian mansion stuffed full of art supplies
 It soon becomes clear that you are a painter, a husband, and a father, and these aspects of your life do not coexist peacefully
 You are compelled to complete your greatest work, but there are demons pulling at you every step of the way and the further you get in the closer to home they hit
 As you battle through the twisted mansion to achieve your goal, the true nature of your painter avatar is made shockingly clear
In gameplay terms, this is a walking simulator
 You wander the halls of your mansion, free to open drawers and cabinets in search of collectibles or rare discoveries like keys, ever onward towards your goal
 Every chapter starts in your studio and takes you through a seemingly random assortment of nightmarish halls and chambers
 There are points where your path will branch in subtle ways but it always ends in the same place, a dramatic setpiece that reveals key events in your character’s past and supplies him with one of the necessary pieces of his masterpiece
I don’t use the term “walking simulator” derisively, in fact I rather enjoy these guided tours of nightmare mindscapes
 Layers of Fear is near the top of the pile in aesthetic, at least, with an impressive amount of detail on every wall fixture, desk drawer, and pile of rubble
 The many halls of the manor are distinct enough to be memorable, and setpieces often use huge numbers of small objects like checkers or books to give locations a tactile, lived-in feel
 It’s a wonderfully dreary place topped off with some incredible effects like melting furniture and paint flows that make you feel right at home in a twisted projection of reality
There’s plenty to marvel at as you explore the vast mansion, but you’ll be scouting around under a permanent air of dread
 This is a horror game after all, and all those magical details are designed to make you feel as fraught and threatened as possible
 Flickering lights, broken doors, scrabbling in the walls, melting paintings, and darker things still will accost you as you slip further into the madhouse
 The atmosphere reaches a number of feverishly oppressive peaks, always capped off with a shock like hurtling books or slamming doors or screaming ghosts
And honestly, that’s where the game loses me
 It doesn’t just lose me, it actively drives me away in a huff because as much as I love the atmosphere, I DESPISE the jumpscares
 I’m a jumpy person and I don’t care much for big shocks like screamers, but I’ll tolerate ones in games like SOMA and Oxenfree because they’re infrequent and earned
 Layers of Fear, in stark contrast, ends almost every single one of their building spooks with a loud noise and jarring visual
 There’s hardly any break between them, as scares usually come only three or four rooms apart
 What’s worse is that they’re often telegraphed, too… anytime a door locks behind you or the next one doesn’t open immediately, you’re in Scarytown for the duration
Combined with the ultimately linear nature of the game, this sucks a ton of the fun out of an otherwise promising horror game and turns it into a cheap carnival ride
 Walk 10 steps, watch a screamer
 Walk another 20, get books thrown at you
 Turn the corner, a window bangs
 It becomes utterly perfunctory, yet keeps trying harder and harder to shock you by getting louder and more audacious
 By the end Layers of Fear feels like a game that was designed to be moody and atmospheric, and then was harangued endlessly for not being scary enough until it was completely over-tuned
 The cheap jumpscares are so much more annoying because they’re not even necessary, yet they persist and fight ever harder to shock you
That should tell you everything you need to know to decide on this one yourself, but if you’re in the mood for spoilers I’m going to talk about the story a bit
 I don’t normally dabble in spoilers but by the end I was so fed up with the main character that I simply couldn’t manage my ire anymore
 Your dude is a tortured artist who is obsessed with his work, obsessed with professional validation, and obsessed enough to neglect his family to literal death
 Ostensibly this is a story about redemption but you’ll soon find he’s so irredeemable that you’ll almost wish his demons would just kill him
 I actually did that in the later chapters where his dead wife is wandering around, I would run him right into her cold, fatal embrace because after everything I had seen and heard from him he deserved nothing more
 Seriously, to complete his masterwork he’s searching for pieces of his family, tanned skin and blood vials and an actual eyeball, to paint with
 The man turned his wife and daughter into art supplies and we’re supposed to believe his soul can be saved
 Really
Ultimately, Layers of Fear is a horror game with an incredibly promising base and a painfully inept structure built upon it
 The technology and artistry on display is undeniable, the game looks amazing and has a talent for surprising and impressing
 But instead of using that talent to build a compelling story and atmosphere, the game settles for cheap, mindless scares and a story that simply doesn’t work
 I won’t deny that I enjoyed admiring the squalor of the mansion and rifling through dressers for clues, but the knowledge that another dumb room with a dumb screaming scare was coming up always filled me with the wrong kind of dread
 When I finished the game I felt such relief, not at the conclusion of a compelling story or at the accomplishment of a goal, but at the fact that I would never have to play this wretched thing again

THIS GAME IS TERRIFYING
To be completely honest, I was nearly scared into a coma by this game
 Layers of Fear offers a truly immersive horror experience
 The story takes you on a tour through the mind of a madman
 As you progress, you find clues that give you details about life of the character before he went crazy
 I actually had chills during certain areas of the game
 The environment is constantly changing around you, and you never know what is waiting for you at the next turn
I would definitely suggest picking this game up while it is in EA (Early Access)
 I was left hanging because the game is unfinished
 The cool thing about being a part of this game while it is in EA is that the game is constantly changing
 You can help the developers iron out the kinks and help make this game better
 Plus, you get the game much cheaper than people who will purchase the full game when it is released
I cannot wait to see where the developers take this story
 Even though it is unfinished, I consider this game a horror masterpiece

I'm going to start this right off the bat by saying this is by far one of the best horror games I've ever played
 I cannot get enough of it
 It's a bit slow paced at first, but it builds you up for all that's to come - and does an amazing job at that thus far
 The graphics are phenomenal, the game is absolutely stunning
 It does need a bit of optimizing, but that's understandable at early access
 The voice acting is amazing, the attention to detail, the music and sounds, everything is just superb
 It all came together so nicely and the developers can only make it better from here on out
Now I, and most people, have come accross a bug in which a room just goes pitch black - causing you to go back to the menu and then back to the game
 A bit of a drawback, but can be fixed nonetheless
 This game outshines most games and I just cannot recommend it enough
 If you're an avid horror fan looking to add something new to your library, this is it
10/10 buy this game naow
EDIT: My goodness, this game just gets better and better with every update
 Layers of Fear is incredibly unpredictable and because everything just comes together so nicely, you're constantly on alert; I have yet to come across a game that does that so smoothly and efficiently as this one
 You're in for one hell of a ride if you get this game

Papers, please
What do you mean
 I just want to review the game
Due to a recent acts of vandalism, reviewers are required to provide proper id
Posted: 28 December, 2013
I had no idea what I was getting into with this game
 From what I'd heard you just sit at a border checkpoint and decide if people are allowed to enter the country or not
 And that's exactly what I got, but Papers, Please is so much more than that
 It's not just a job simulation, it's a story of moral choices and corrupt government
 It's not just about a border guard, it's about a man who struggles to provide for his family, who must work for the smallest of wages to make some of the toughest choices
 You sit in your little checkpoint booth
 A man comes up and hands you his passport
 You skim over the information and stamp a big green "APPROVED" for him
 He thanks you and starts to walk away, but before he does he says, "my wife is right behind me, please be nice to her
" Sure enough, up steps a nice young woman
 There's her passport
 You look down and see an expiration date of last month
 "This document is expired" you say
 She stares at you, eyes wide and pleading: "Please, if I go back to my country they will kill me
 Please let me in
" What do you do
 Do you risk losing your paycheck and therefore leave yourself unable to buy medicine for your sick son
 Or do you abandon all morality and turn the woman away
Papers, Please is not an easy game, nor is it free of consequences
 Not only does it become insanely difficult to reivew piles of papers and make sure every little details is accrate and correct, but every choice you make determines who you are and the path you take
 Will you work tirelessly for the glory of Arstotzka, or will you join the Order and be a part of the uprising against the tyrannical, corrupt government

In theory papers please should not be a fun game
It is literally a simulation of performing a monotonous, tedious and thankless job
But the game is definitely a good game
So what makes the game fun
I have concluded that the game survives almost completely upon atmosphere
There is a tragic realism to horrible job you have in this third world nation
You live in so much poverty with the risk of illness or starvation being a very real threat
It gives you many moral dilemmas and will test your principles in ways games do not normally expect you to
You are paid so little that you find yourself accepting bribes to let terrorists, smugglers, etc
 into Arstotzka
And you will accept the bribes, because often it is the difference between eating and not
Yet at the same time the game is humorous
The customers make it so and some have very humorous personalities
You will get to know your favorite customers and favorite scenes
The world is so overblown with propaganda, corruption, etc
 that the grim world becomes humorous (to those not in it)
Finally, the world reacts to the player
You’d be amazed how big of an impact deciding who to let into the nation can have on the nation
You let an assassin into the nation a high ranking official may die and the government will respond with harder boarder policies
It is generally simple things, but these really complete the atmosphere
The game play itself is a point and click adventure
 Were you will face a number of customers which you must either let in or find the error in their paperwork
It is all done on a timer forcing you to be quick
It almost becomes stressful
The graphics look like they belong on an Atari and yet somehow seem appropriate
You are matching blurry faces to other blurry faces
 In conclusion I recommend this game
 It is fun and addictive
Glory to Arstotzka

Papers, Please has no right to be as fun as it is
 Papers, Please has no right to be as poignant as it is
 Papers, Please has no right to be possibly the best PC game of 2013 I've played
 Papers, Please is all of these things
The gameplay of Papers, Please is more or less a tedium simulator
 It's Paperwork: The Game
 And yet, you know that you need to process as many of these poor people as you can so that your family won't starve
 You know that the old lady who you just denied will probably never see her son again; you know the young man you just let through has less than glorious ambitions in your city
 Will you support the rebels
 Will you toe the party line
 Will you let the young lady through, even though her passport is clearly fake, because her fiance was just before her and bribed you to do so
 The choice in this game is staggering, and the simplicity of the game itself allows for complete assimilation of your mind into the mind of your character
 You feel bad when your child gets sick, but you know that food is sometimes more important than heat
Papers, Please is a work of video game brilliance - a work of art
 I give it seven out of seven stars

 His voice is loud and cheerful, and I just can't help but wonder what the heck is wrong with him
 There's nothing to be so happy about in this rotten place, you old geezer
«Papers, please» I simply say, ignoring his greetings
 He grins while handing me his brand new passport
 I chuckle
 Definitely better than the last one, at least this one is not pre-approved
«So this time you're from Obristan, I see, Mr
 Jorji Costava
 Is this even your real name
»
His grin grows even wider and he starts laughing again
«You a funny guy
 I didn't like Cobrastan that much anymore
 Obristan sure is a better country»
 He speaks with a tick foreign accent that makes me wonder where he is really from
 «Cobrastan isn't even a real country, in the first place» I point out matter-of-factly
 «Where's your entry ticket
»
His smile fades a little
 «Arstotzka so great, we don't need an entry ticket
»
 «This is the same thing you said last time about passports
 I'm sorry, an entry ticket is required»
 I hand his passport back
«Wow, you run very strict border here»
 He puts his paper back in the pocket of his trousers, shrugging
 «That is good
 Do job right
 I look for entry thing and come back»
Before leaving the booth, he stares intensely at me
«You a good guy, but I have business in Arstotzka
 I see you soon»
 He waves me goodbye and then disappears in the crowd, with that big careless smile on his face
*I keep staring at the ceiling of my bedroom
 In the end, it seems I can't really sleep at all tonight
I can hear my wife coughing weakly beside me
 The doctor said it's just a cold, but she's getting worse day after day
 I'm slightly worried
Our son is sleeping in the next room, the only one lit by the sun in the morning
 He is turning 7 next week
 I'd really want to buy him a special present for his birthday
We are currently living in a small apartment provided by the Ministry of Admission, here in East Grestin
 The rooms are small and the heather doesn't work half the time
 On top of that, our neighbours are awfully nosy
 Living here is not that great, but there's really nothing I can do about it
*A week has passed since Jorji Costava last showed up
 Maybe he is having a hard time finding a fake entry permit
 Maybe he just gave up
 Quite unlikely
The siren's ringing, another day of work is starting
 A tall figure silently enters the booth
 He's wearing a green hood and his face is hidden behind a grey mask
 I'm about to call the security, but he gently slides a paper note under the window and stares at me
«There's no much time, be quick please»
 His voice sounds young- he's probably younger than me- and unusually relaxed
My hands are shaking and I don't even know why
There's an odd symbol drawn on top of the card, a star-shaped one
 I slowly open the note and start reading
 I can feel the masked guy's staring gaze on me
ARSTOTZKA IS GREAT COUNTRY POISONED BY CORRUPT LEADERSWAR HAS MADE GOV'T GREEDY AND PARANOID - YOU HAVE SEEN FOR YOURSELFHELP US FREE ARSTOTZKA FROM ITS SHACKLES+ THE ORDER OF THE EZIC STAR
I'm in a cold sweat
I look up at the masked guy, I'm at a loss for words
«Our agents are ready», he helds out his hand, eyeing the card
 «Starting tomorrow
 Let them pass»
 In Papers, Please you play as an immigration inspector working for the Ministry of Admission of Arstotzka in East Grestin
 Your job is to check on people trying to enter Arstotzka and decide who can pass through the border and who has to be denied or even arrested
Most of the time, your decisions will lead to a different ending (not always a good one
)
Choose wisely, the destiny of Arstotzka, your family and many other people is in your hands
 Pros: -Well written dystopian settings-20 different endings-Lovely retro graphics-Jorji Costava-Great plot and sub-plots-Shooting terrorists from your inspection booth since 1982-Did I already mention Jorji Costava
 Cons:-Maybe old school graphics are not everyone's cup of tea (I personally love it though)-Stamping visas and check out papers will probably sound boring to someone-There's no "Escape to Obristan with your newfound best friend Jorji" endingPapers, Please is hands-down one of my favorite games
 Be sure to give it a try, you definitely won't regret it

"Ideas are more powerful than guns
 We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas
" - Joseph StalinCongratulations
 You've won the lottery and earned the "right" to become a nameless, faceless little bureaucrat who is responsible from the border station of a fictional socialist country in 1980s, alongside countless entrants and their tons of paperwork
 Glory to Arstotzka
Before describing any kind of gameplay, I'd like to warn you: Papers, Please is a highly political satire that parodies Stalin's Russia, or any oppressive totalitarian regime in human history
 The humor of the game is comedy noir: cold, immediate and careless with an appropriate dose of existentialism, presenting some genuine examples of your good old-fashioned political dystopia
 If you like your sarcasm served cold, and patient enough to go through a simulation of routine banality to observe a comment on the dynamics of government, keep reading
 The game manages to set the mood for it perfectly
Papers, Please doesn't even closely resemble any game that I've played so far
 It is a basic simulation that lets you try and decide whomever is eligible to enter the country, and whomever is not
 And guess what
 The rules change daily, always getting more and more complicated until the point you cannot possibly "not" hate the government
 Endless political conflicts between the government, the neighboring countries and terrorist groups that are ever present don't make things easier or even safer
 You live, work and try to earn enough to feed your family, but life is impossible for the honest as always
 So things start to get interesting both financially and politically for our bureaucrat as the scenario progresses
The game has 20 or so ending, which presents huge replayability and contains some hidden achievements to hunt for
 As a plus, the game takes each save file for each day separately, so it is real easy to load a specific day and replay for the achievement or ending needed
As the last call: I really liked the game, and probably gonna try to achievement hunt for a while
 I advise the game for the curious, the bitter and the know-it-all
 The graphic lovers won't find anything satisfactory though

Papers, Please is one unique snowflake in the massive ammount of Indie Games that is turning up lately on Steam
 If you get to pick one Indie game to play, make it this one
While playing it you will not only be confronted with moral dilemmas and unexpected inspections, you might also be encouraged to think about oppressive regimes and what they mean for the people that have to live in them
 Bonus points to you if you start pondering about what a state should do for its citizens and what not
And even if you are unable to grasp the deeper facettes of this game, you will have still a great time stamping "Denied" or "Approved" into Visa markings
The game gets more and more complex the longer you play it
 Discovering all the endings and unlocking Achievements also add to the fun
 I also enjoyed the music in this game, its suprisingly nice
You should plan your next holiday in Arstotzka, make sure you get your Papers in time
Glory to Arstotzka

"Papers, please
" *man hands me poorly drawn picture of himself* "Sir thats not a valid passport" Man: "ok that fine I come back later" *comes back the next day with name scribbled below picture*

Posted: 19 October, 2014
General Thoughts / ReviewEvery once in a while an indie game comes along that, to me, is not a clear like or dislike
I started playing Papers, Please and go to day eight before quitting the first time
I thought to myself, "Who the hell wants to play a game based on stamping visas
I can't wait to get done working for the day at my REAL job
"Two days later I found myself thinking about the game
I wanted to know what happened to the people I approved or denied
Was it better to deny them entry, or to be a tyrant and detain them
I mean, who doesn't know that their visa information is incorrect
LIAR
YOU ARE A CRIMINAL
It is just a game though, why do I care
I did not, really
I played again, anyway
The game kept my enthusiasm up as the difficulty ramped up, money was tight, and I seemed to be responsible for the lives of so many more pixel people than I anticiapted
I enjoyed it up until the very end
Good job, author
Pros Amazingly enough, makes stamping visas intriguing if you are the type of player that can get immersed in pixels
 The save system is AWESOME
Almost like a source code repository, if you start playing at an existing day, you create a branch at that day and continue playing in a parallel universe
 Many different endings depending on choices made throughout the game
Reminiscent of Chrono Trigger, you do not have to get to the last day to trigger some endings
 Even though simple and interactions are quick, you can feel sympathy or opposed to certain characters
Cons Replayability was low for me
The game has very varied endings, but I found that after I meta-gamed the Steam Achievements out, I was not inclined to go back through and try to get the endings for which there are no achievements for
 Certain things feel pointless in the game - although that might have been the developers intent
 Can be frustrating and wig out your OCD
RecommendationI would recommend Papers, Please if you are type of gamer who does not need flashy graphics or rapid game play to be entertained
If you are a fan of indie game development, Papers, Please is an enjoyable title that may grow on you as it has grown on me

Should You Buy Kingdoms and Castles
 I have made a short video to help you decide that:https://www
youtube
com/watch
v=0ttpFpTxA4EPros:- The price is right- Developers are very active in updating and transparent with their community- There are already FREE future DLC's planned- 3 different game modes: Easy, Normal, and Hard- I have put in 20+ hours of fun(played it before it was on Steam) and still want to play it
lots more- The music is quite good and relaxingEither:- The art style is very simplistic and(I think) cuteCons:- I have still encountered a few new bugs after every game update but nothing has been game breaking- The advisors in the game are a bit underwhelming and not useful after the first 5 minutes or so - in fact the notification "
" can be a bit annoying when there's nothing important to learn- On normal mode, the viking attacks can sometimes be frustratingly close together and not allowing you time to recover from the previous attack, but there is always peaceful mode if it becomes too much for youOverall I have had a lot of fun with this game(around 20 hours played including time outside of Steam) and the price is so low that, if you enjoy simulation and city building games, you will surely get your money's worth of fun out of it
 Hope this helps
Edit: Adding Q/A here from comments:Q: Is it hard to keep a working economy or does the city run itself like in many other builders once you have the basics down
A: It runs itself in the sense that you don't have to click on each civilian and tell them what to do - jobs are taken care of automatically once you build the thing that needs workers
 However, sometimes you may have the need to close or open the building if you already have enough of that material or you want your people to focus on something else instead
 So, in a sense it runs itself but you still have to balance how many foresters you want, how many quarries, blacksmiths, farmers, etc
Q: Are there goals in the game or is it just build a big a city as possible
A: It is an open sandbox game so the goals are what you make for yourself
 If you need more structure than that then you'll probably get bored fast
 But for me, I like to make goals such as - can I actually be
successful enough to build my entire city within castle walls
 Can I get my defenses up high enough that I'll be able to have minimal damages when invaded
 Can I build an army big enough that I can send my general in and conquer their armies and constantly have bonus happiness from winning battles
 Can I expand my kingdom enough to encompass the entire land that is provided to me
 Can I have a really happy kingdom while taxing them to the max
 So far I have not achieved any of those completely so I am still working towards them
Q: Are there multiple ways to build a city or will every game take the same course
A: You can build your city however you want - but there will always be things you need such as wood, stone, and food
 You can make the layout however you want as well, and if you don't feel like building churches you don't have to build churches, it will make your citizens unhappy but you can choose to try and make up that deficit with something else
Q: How many options are there for aesthetics individualiziation of your city
 A: It is a visually simplistic game which I touched on that may be either a pro or con for people depending on personal taste
 Every building has one design
Posted: 1 August
I was actually going to recommend it, because the basics are great and I thought that with time it will only get better, but after I've read the roadmap I'm a bit disappointed
 The next thing that will be added will be Ports and Merchants, which is great, but the next steps are Twitch integration and VR
 Really
 I'm a huge VR fan and the Twitch integration sounds good, but that's not what this game needs right now
Like I said, the basics are great, but that's what this game is, basic
 It needs much more things to do, more buildings, more production chains, more strategy, more ways to defend, more ways to be destroyed; it's just not there right now
 I hope it will get better and I will change my review then, but for now, I'm on the edge
 It's a good start but the developers seems to prioritise making it popular first by adding Twitch and VR support, instead of focusing on expanding gameplay and actually finishing the game

EDIT 2: I checked the patchnotes from the 26
07
2017 update
 What I say in this review still stands
 The devs only changed the way trees grow and fire spreads
 Therefore, the main complaint, pathfinding, and the lack of content, have yet to be fixed
 EDIT: IF YOU'RE UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS REVIEW, ALL ANSWERS ARE ALREADY REPLIED IN THE COMMENTS OF THIS REVIEW
Original review: I don’t recommend this game in its current state
Why don’t I recommend it
 This is supposed to be a FULL GAME for 9
99€
 Full game means there must be some content to justify the price, as well as a working core gameplay
 The game in its current state doesn’t have any of those
 Main mechanics are broken and there’s about 4 hours of content (unless you want to build anything decent which becomes idling and grinding)
1
 Pathfinding is rubbish
 You can have charcoal makers right next to storages FILLED with wood and they’ll still claim “no wood”
 Distributing food is a nightmare
 From the farms food has to go to silos, and from silos to marketplaces
 It does work, except the marketplaces will then struggle to even distribute enough food to a single house
 In the long term, you’re looking at a constant list of peasants dying of starvation, even if they had a pile of food right next to them
2
 Enemies and soldiers are a joke
 Completely useless
 You would expect them to AT LEAST attack the enemy when in range, but no
 First you have to select your troops, then keep clicking on the enemy (as your units won’t lock on them) and keep clicking until they attack
 As soon as the enemy moves a tile, you’ll have to tell your units to move again
 With such rubbish mechanics, why putting them in in the first place
3
 The framerate will soon go down as you build up your island
 Once you reach 3K population you’re looking at barely 20 fps with frequent lag when moving around the map
4
 Buildings have NO upgrades
 You need more wood
 Bad luck, go and build an extra forester
 Only two types of food production, farms and orchards
 Not even fishing
5
 The map is extremely small
 Space is an issue as soon as the first hour in
 6
 Only 3 game modes available, which are pretty much the same: "sandbox" (no enemies), "normal" (with random enemy attacks & dragons) and "hard" (basically, harsh winters)
 There’s probably a ton more of things to say against the game
 Once you’ve built everything, the only incentive to stay in the game are the achievements and trying to build a city that you like
 If the game was in “Early Access”, I wouldn’t be this harsh
 But it is sold as a full game
 So sorry, but this is rubbish and an insult to city-building games
 Go get Banished instead
 Or Tropico
 Or any other city-building/management game
Posted: 4 August
The dragon's lifeless body fell right onto the exact spot where I laid the foundation of my town
 As I watched the dragon's body clip through the Keep, a sense of relief washed over me
 Not relief for my townsfolk, whom I had just saved from a fiery demise
 No, not for them, but for me
With the slaying of that dragon notched on my archers' scoreboards, I had done everything there was to do in Kingdoms and Castles
and I had just hit the six hour mark
Technically, I hadn't done everything
there were some Steam achievements leftover for hitting certain population milestones, which would take a lot more downtime than I was willing to pump into Kingdoms and Castles
 So, more accurately, I had done everything there was that was worth doing, in the game
Kingdoms and Castles started out as straightforward, town-building, strategy game
 With around two-dozen buildings to construct, everything had a clear purpose and their functions alongside the other buildings made sense
 There were no obscure rules to learn, or elaborate game mechanics to keep track of
 Wood, stone, food,
and population were the only major things that needed monitoring; adequate water coverage (either from coastlines or wells), citizen happiness level (boosted by the presence of churches or taverns), and smart guard tower placement (to defend against invaders) were the only other facets of the game that necessitated the most attention
There are a handful of other resource systems that need monitoring, but those that I mentioned represent the core of the game
 As far as strategy city-building games go, they don't come much simpler and easy-to-play than Kingdoms and Castles
The game's graphic style mirrors that simplicity
 Featuring peg-like peasants, the game's visual appeal comes from watching the dozens or hundreds of peasants scurrying around doing their duties
 Once open housing is available, peasants will randomly "move in" to your town and they will automatically pick up on any available task that needs doing
 It was fun to zoom out and watch the town in action
 Watching the peasants all hopping around doing their own jobs reminded me a lot of watching tiny fish in a fish tank
 For awhile anyway, it was quite a relaxing time
Unfortunately, as pleasant as it was to watch
I could only watch so much before I found myself rapping my fingers on my keyboard, awaiting progressing
 Once I had read all of the little tooltips for every building there was to build, and had a basic understanding of what a good city layout in Kingdoms and Castles should look like, I had very little else to do as I waited for more citizens to move in, or for more resources to be collected
Occasionally a viking raid would arrive, and while they increase in strength over time, they're easy enough to repel that a few archer towers will do you just fine for the first hour of gameplay
 They show up, slowly make their way into your town, steal resources and peasants, and make their way back to their boat
 If you kill all the vikings you get to keep your resources, if not, you lose all they managed to snag on their way out
Dragons would also show up, but their presence was a complete joke
 The dragons would fly in at random times and mostly just float above my city
 Perhaps the dragons in these lands had some sort of amnesia, because they acted more like butterflies than dragons
 Only occasionally did they every drop a fire-blast or two down onto my town
 Sometimes they never even flew near my town to begin with
But I finally encountered a dragon that flew right through the heart of my city
 After being pelted by arrows for a good half-minute, it was over
 The dragon's body vanished as it fell into my Keep, I breathed a partially-annoyed sigh of relief, and my peasants scurried on, unaware that their lives were about to end forever
Kingdoms and Castles wasn't a bad game in that it was broken, and it was even fun for a short time, but after I killed that dragon and I unlocked the achievement, I resigned as Lord of [Tom Already Forgot What He Named His Town] forever
 I just can't recommend Kingdoms and Castles; the game was not fun enough for long enough, and gave me absolutely no reason to play it all over again
[[Not recommended]] There just wasn't enough variety of things to do to keep my attention past an hour or two
 Feels very much like a stable, early-access release, rather than a full retail game
 I will monitor Kingdoms and Castles for major developments and update this review as necessary

For the $10 price tag, I can recommend this game
 However, any future increase in price must be accompanied by new content, in my opinion
 What I like about the game is that it is very relaxing
 In-game music is soothing, and it's interesting sitting back and watching your townspeople complete their everyday tasks
 It's a simple game, making it very easy for you to get the hang of very quick
 What I don't like about the game is that it lacks depth
 While this might be a plus for someone who's just looking to blow off some steam in a casual/relaxing video game, there's just not enough here to keep me interested
 Every building can be built within the first hour of gameplay
 Aside from watching your town grow, there's no incentive such as advanced buildings to keep on playing
 The game strikes me as Tropico lite in block form
 Since I own Tropico 4 and 5, two games that I really enjoyed, I can say that this game is nowhere near their caliber, especially Tropico 5
In conclusion, this game is a quintessential example of "you get what you pay for"
 It's a simple game for a simple price
Posted: 24 July
First of all:I have played 10 hours until this review and tried 3 cities on hard
If I can recommand this title
 It depends strongly on what you expect
If you expect a full price title like settlers or something like that, please don't buy this game
 It will not make you happy
If you expect some casual gaming title, then it could be right for you
It is a very basic game, which will allow you to run a decent city with some (or none, if on easy diffuclty) threads
 Named they are: Dragons, which try to burn your city and vikings which try to steal your gold, food and people
 Oh, they also burn your city
 And last, but not least there are heavy thunderstorms, which will also burn your city
The world itself is not very huge, but it will keep you going for some time
 So i would expect around 20 hours of gameplay, until the world is completely full
 I would like to compare this to some Tropico titles
Although you have to experience one major issue with this game
 Within the version, i have written this review (104s) there is no multi-threading
 The game does not scale towards other CPU cores, which will get worse the more people you have
 On my machine the limit was around ~300 people
 If you hit this spot, then the game will slow you down very much
 I expect the developer to fix that in future patches

This is a fairly simple but effective and well thought out city builder with combat
 Kingdoms and Castles allows you to create a city using colourful voxel pieces, make an efficient working supply chain, ensure your citizens are happy, command a small army and defeat rampaging vikings and creatures
 There is a fairly small and limited set of buildings so I found it fairly easy to get my supply up and running efficiently, but then a plague wiped out half my citizens in one year
 Damn, should have built that hospital sooner
 You have to contend with winter, fires, disease and rampaging enemies
Bands of Vikings will periodically raid and terrorize your city, whilst a dragon flies overhead and targets buildings to burn to a crisp
 I even had an ogre destroy an entire section of wall, which I thought was quite rude
 The Vikings will go around walls, so you can build your city to kite them through archer towers and ballista, ensuring that they're dead before they reach your population
 Don't leave the centre undefended though - because of course, a dragon can simply fly over your fortifications
You can build an army and you can control them (well, you can control a general and his recruits will follow), so there is an extra level of action to the game there
Pros:* Attractive voxel graphics* Simple, but fun gameplay* Static defenses such as archer towers and ballista* Commandable units through an army* Extra strategy required from both land and air units attacking
* 3 difficulties, with easy having no attacks - so a relaxing city builder, or a more taxing RTS
* Planned updates already listed so looks like it will only improve in the future
Cons:* Very small maps with odd shapes, a world editor or larger maps would be good
* Most maps feel very similar (developer has said adding random "unique" things is on the table for an update though
)* Eventually you will hit the limit for what you can do on a map
 It certainly has replayability - but it's not endless
* Very experienced city builders may find the game a little too simple
For me, sometimes it's nice to play a city builder that is engaging but not too complicated
 I'm really looking forward to the future updates
It's very fun to play and set at a price point that makes me highly recommend it to fans of the genre

An indie masterpiece made by only two dudes who had a lot of talent
 Hotline Miami is a top-down action video game mixed with a lot of ecstasy
 Mostly influenced by the excellent movie "Drive" (by Nicolas Winding Refn in 2011), Dennis Wedin and Jonatan Söderström have crafted a clever mix of extreme violence and an awesome 80's atmosphere
 The gameplay is demanding but fair, one bullet, you're dead
 It's a sort of die & retry game considering the fact that you have to know the spot where the enemies are and how to kill'em
 The great twist about it is the system of masks, each mask has an effect on the character's abilities
 Artistically, the 16 bits style is not beautiful but it fits perfectly the overall atmosphere and the environment will be covered in blood most of the time
 The plot is mysterious and offers a lot of questions but is averagely good enough to keep you interested
 But what is really special about Hotline Miami is its soundtrack, it's absolute perfection
 Composed by various artists, this electronic hyperactivity is a gigantic asset to an already great mix
 To conclude, Hotline miami is a hard drug that will be hard for you to let go
Still playing

HOTLINE MIAMI - Fun, Fast, Challenging & Compelling
|| 9 || Score Comment
Graphics 8 The 16-Bit style retro graphics are detailed and stylish, really adding to the overall atmosphere of the game
 Everything from the characters you meet, the decor of buildings, the white 80's suits of the enemies to your car are all extremely well done and all add to the 80's Miami feel
Audio 9 Game music and effects are outstanding, you can hear the pounding beat of the music increase
in intensity as the levels progress and the game becomes ever more frantic
 Although the music is looped it isn't repetitive and I found, even after dying for the tenth time in a row, it still felt fresh and exciting helping to throw you back into the fight
Gameplay 9 Hotline Miami is full of fast packed action, even best laid plans go astray in a moment forcing you to improvise, think on your feet and when all else fails rely on quick button pressing
 As the levels progress the game becomes more challenging, but by this point your hooked and need to see the story through to the bitter end
Story 9 Dark & suspenseful, the story is surprising deep and engaging (for what on the surface appears to be a fairly simple game)
 Sometimes the game will leave you wondering exactly what is happening to you, sometimes small details will change between levels (who's that person in my apartment
 who is ringing my phone
) but they all help to weave they story of the characters decent into a world of crime, murder and madness
Replayability 5 There isn't much to say here, the story is linear so it mostly depends on how much you enjoyed playing the first time round
 There are lots of masks to collect which give you certain bonuses that might appeal to completionists
Overall 9 A true gaming classic, retro 80's, ultra-violent, stylish, solid challenging game play with awesome music and a great story
 lots of fun to play, highly recommended

If I had to sum this game up in two words, those two words would be frustratingly addictive
 You will die
 A lot
 Don't make the assumption that this is a run-and-gun game
 This is a thinking mans psychedelic 80's murder simulator
 You will die learning a map layout
 You will die figuring out when enemies will respond to gunfire
 You will die due to glitchy doors
 There is a lot of you dying in this game
 But guess what there's also a lot of
Heart-pumping Adrenaline-gorged violence
 No other game evokes the same sense of crazed desperateness as you pummel some poor Russian mobsters face into the dance floor, only to get up a split second later, grab his shotgun, and blow away the other Russian Mobsters who've been unfortunate to be in the same building as you
While the action is split second and fast-paced, the game rewards tactical planning and thinking more than twitch reactions
 You will not succeed trying to run through a building swinging a baseball bat like a madman
 You're going to have to bait enemies, burst into a room when no one's looking, and die several times perfecting ways to murder people
My only complaint is how vague the boss fights are
 While I've only encountered two thus far, both of them have been pretty vague on how you actually win them
 How the hell was a I supposed to figure out that I could only damage biker once he's throw his weapon when that isn't how the gameplay mechanics works at any other point previously
 The boss battles are inconsistent with the rest of the game
It can get frustrating, but it is intensely satisfying when you've cleared four separate floors after countless deaths trying
 8/10, would recommend

Hotline Miami made me feel like a monster
As the music drove me forward and the hypnotic neon visuals swelled around the edges of a stage, I lost track of the number of people I had so brutally and ruthlessly murdered
 The first kill was shocking, fast, and pointless
 I felt sick and angry at the person who’d forced me into it
 Then they gave me a pipe, and then a gun, and I kept killing
 For as disturbing as the mutilated corpses and pools of blood around me were, the feedback I was being given was intoxicating, and the thrill of barely avoiding death only heightening the sensation
Hotline Miami doesn’t revel in violence, but it never attempts to shy away or filter it
 It knows it’s depraved, but also that there’s some twisted part inside of us that enjoys, even craves violence
 It fills our entertainment and history, but rarely asks us to recognize the horror of hurting someone
 There’s always a justification, a clear line drawn between the “good” and “bad” people or those who “deserve it”
 It’s what allows us to explore violence in media without becoming psychotic or repulsed, but it also seems to grant a lot of leeway for what is considered acceptable, a gap that only widens the more we consume and the less it registers
I’ve played a lot of violent games, many far more graphic and realistically rendered than Hotline Miami, but I don’t know that I’ve ever played one that made me more disturbed of myself
 Hotline Miami does this not by any narrative reason or even because it’s violence is so grotesque, but because of how fun it makes killing someone, and how it constantly pushes you to do it better, faster, more interestingly
 It’s mechanics are tight and focused, reworking its top-down shooter framework into some more puzzle-like and melee focused
 It rewards you for every action but always dangles the carrot slightly beyond your reach, challenging do it again, this time with style
The more I played, the better I became at thinking like the sociopathic machine my character had become
 I forgot about people I was killing or the reason I was doing so (if there ever was one); they were just pieces in an elaborate, deadly puzzle which I needed to clear as efficiently as possible
It’s the tiny things that make Hotline Miami so mesmerizing
 The way points explode after every kill, or that the music never stops when you die, leaving you no chance to back out
 Everything is so tightly knit and ferociously intense, you aren’t afforded the space to think before acting
 You just move and let your instincts take over
But all of this wouldn’t mean anything if the game was nothing but violent, strategic rooms for you to exploit
 It’s the moments that come later that remind you that you’re human and exist in a world not of exploding meat bags, but living people, that make Hotline Miami’s violence mean something
 Picking up a pizza or talking to the video store clerk, there’s the haunting feeling of desperately trying to pretend you’re still sane; that you have some connection to the world you seem only capable of destroying
 When you’re finally pushed out of the world, it’s disorienting and frightening, and left me with only more people to kill as every remaining aspect of my sanity evaporated
If Hotline Miami has any major faults, it’s that it’s often as fragile as its protagonist, and by the end has similarly fallen to pieces
 Enemy AI is barely present, somewhat intentionally to give you time to react but usually because it’s broken or suddenly hyper aware of your position
 Hit detection is wonky and unpredictable, and the game crashed more than a few times before I was through
 It level designs are also exceedingly front-loaded, with many of the later missions stripping you of any freedom and pitting you against tedious death loops
 A handful of truly horrendous scripted sequences also caused me more deaths than the entire rest of the game combined, and ruined the excellent pacing up to that point
Part of me thinks those flaws are almost worth having though, as they were a reminder that at the end of the day Hotline Miami is still a game
 With how overwhelming its audio and visuals are, I often became intensely absorbed in what I was doing, so being broken out of it by a bad level or glitch was almost welcomed
 Because Hotline Miami is dark, twisted, perverse, and I had an astounding amount of fun with it, which is what really scares me

Hotline Miami, is the most fun arcade game, i have played so far throughout my entire life
 It has a sweet retro 80s feeling to it, kickass fast paced gameplay, and awesome soundtrack
 Altough it has some frustrating levels, when you execute a high combo, you cant help but feel awesome
+Sweet Artwork+Satisfying Gameplay+Amazing soundtrack+It has Charm+Great Atmosphere+Great Ending (in my opinion)-Short-Frustrating at timesHotline Miami is a game that makes you feel like a badass
 Even tough you might not be into theese type of games, you'll still enjoy this game
 It can go as low as 2€ on sale, so if you are still doubting to get this must have, get it cheap on the sale
9/10

At one point this was my fav game ive ever played and then the devs got bought by kabam and kabam made this a pay to win like no other
 and pretty much all the old players quit, and you can tell kabam only wants money from this

Realm Of the Mad God(EDIT for those who dont really understand)ok i admit its all 100% a pay to win
its more of a pay to have fun, and make any real progress
pets to heal you, regen all your stuff, and attack for you, gotta pay to make them work
theres, backpacks,potions, item drop enhancers, very powerful items right off from the start
 only way you can get any of these is with money
 NOW , i wouldnt mind, skins, colors, things like that you know

Used to play this back on Kongregate (I believe it was on there) and a bit when it came on Steam
 Was probably the best perma-death RPG game you could find
 Didn't have demanding PC requirements, cool and clean pixelated visuals, easy-to-pick up hard-to-master bullet hell-style gameplay
 Overall, it was great fun and I enjoyed my time with it
So I thought this game had died out a while ago (some time since I had played it regularly), but it turns out the game is still going strong
really strong actually
 I was pretty excited and saw that this game has the VERY POSITIVE rating on Steam
 As I was strolling down to read some of the top reviews, I noticed a new publisher called Kabam in the game's description area
 Interesting
 So I finally make it to the reviews and what I see is a bunch of negative reviews about how pay-2-win this game is after Kabam took over
I couldn't believe it was THAT bad so I tried it out myself a few weeks ago
 Downloaded it through Steam, loaded it up
Wow
 Another example of an amazing game ruined by greedy companies tainting the free-2-play model
 No one wonder people are hating on free-2-play games when we got so much greedy companies these days
 But Kabam really butchered this game
 Everything good requires money
 Skill is irrevelant
 I can't believe they actually managed to take the skill factor out of a bullet-hell game
 What's the world coming to

)

This game was great
 and then Kabam it's gone
Posted: 24 May, 2015
I used to play this game a far long time ago, back on Kongregate
 It was a good game, plenty of fun to be had, and the perma-death, while annoying, only made me more determined to do better in the future, work with my friends, and pursue a higher goal
But that was a different time entirely; a golden age long since past
So, around 2 years later, being a more experienced and wisened individual, I decided to check this game out again, seeing it was on Steam
 I went into the reviews, and noticed
a surprising negative reaction among a bulk of the players, even ones who've spent over hundreds of hours
 I thought to myself, Well it just can't be as bad as these people say, right
 People love to use hyperbole to make a point
 In my lack of judgement, I decided to play this again
I regretted said decision
[GETTING STARTED]So I started up the game after a shockingly-fast install time of roughly 2 seconds
 Flash games, gotta love'em
 I start things up, go into my character menu, and realize that half the screen's dedicated to selling me crap
 That's not a good sign
I start up my one character slot, and I go through the motions of picking my first hero, a Warrior
 The tutorial's straight-forward, I blitzed through fairly quickly, and reached the point where I named the account
 For review sake, I'll disclose my account username in-game was DMNTDxNem
[MY EXPERIENCE]When I first started up my warrior, in the first server I selected, things went overall decently for me
 I stuck to the beach, like the game said to, and leveled up to 3 before taking on a little deeper in the forest areas
 Reaching around level 5 now, fighting against not only the enemies, but the server lag, I decide a quick respite at the Nexus was in order
Now, from when I was playing this back on Kongregate, I used to love the Nexus
 It was crowded pretty often, yeah, but there tended to be a lot of friendly player interaction; people helping each other, constantly working in each other's benefit to get better gear and equipment, there was always strong community there
But on my return trip to the Nexus during this refresher playthrough, I realized the game's first critical issue:Bots
 Bots everywhere
 I couldn't speak to any of the players, as few as there even were around, without bots running up and drowning us out
 I cannot tell you how much I desperately wanted to kill some of these players; physically
 In real life
 I was that angry
Aside from that, though, there was also the issue of the shop items
 Originally, pre-dev change, the shop items, while difficult to acquire, were completely do-able, and it was rather straight-forward; you earn coins, you go to the shop, you spend coins on an item you want (and eventually die and lose, but I digress,) and you got said item
 Now, shop items range from the hundreds to the thousands in coin value
 And if you came back into the game with 50 coins earned, many of the shop items that were once 50 are now 51, meaning you'd be forced to pay for one more bloody coin
 Slowly, I was realizing that people's anger was rather justified
Enough about the Nexus and the broken shop, though
 I went back in, enjoyed my time fighting through enemy territory, until it appeared the server I was on had a server-wide boss battle occurring
 Everyone was teleported into a dangerous, high-level world dungeon: Oryx's Castle
 I, among many players, was ill-equipped for the encounter, so I ended up dying along heaps of other players, who all probably experienced the same game-breaking lag spikes that I did
 Congratulations, RotMG; you, a flash game, made my high-performance gaming computer buckle onto its knees
Second go, another warrior, and I was definitely getting the hang of things
 I beat a few dungeon bosses, went into the ruins and killed a few mini-bosses strewn across the world, and grabbed some decent equipment
 Things were going good, and the whole thing went just as I'd hoped
 Barring the several passing exchanges I gave the bots advertising their crummy products, to which I had some choice opinions of them, I finally came across an actual, breathing player; they were running around like the flash, and when I strolled up, they told me about a dungeon where they could help me get some better equipment
 Now, I'll say in advance that I read the reviews extensively, and knew there were players who got their kicks off of getting people with good characters killed
 I thought to myself, Well, my guy's crap, so he'd be wasting his time if he just wanted to off me
How wrong I was
First off, the dungeon he dragged me into was from some candy dude that was prancing around like the Gingerbread Man
 I insisted on being the one to take him down, so a little Looney Tunes-style chase went on, me using mana potions to keep up like Lance Armstrong used drugs for the Tour De France, and finally was able to dead him to death
 Me and the guy go in, and before my eyes, he vanishes through a wall
and when he returned, every enemy he could alert in the area was with him
 Running as far as I could, not long, considering I used up all my mana, I was eventually shot to death by a unicorn pinata barfing rainbows
 And so, at level 9, Sir Gullible II was found dead due to overdose on vibrant colors
 The last words he ever heard were from his once-thought ally, typing in "#rekt" about 7 times
 Fun times were had
[GAMEPLAY]Now, the fact the game now being a botting trollfest of epic proportions notwithstanding, it's still incredibly functional
 The base game works as intended, and the system hasn't changed all that much since 2 years ago
 Now, I'll admit the difficulty curve's definitely become harder to cope with, especially how the higher-tier equipment is even harder to acquire than ever before, unless you throw your wallet at the screen, but by the by, it hasn't really changed all that much
 You still work with other players, you still try for the best loot, and you still fight towards the ultimate goal of taking down the Mad God
You have your four slots, weapon, helmet, armor, and ring, and equipment is divided amongst different classes, rings being the only ones where any class can use anything they find for that slot
 Each class has different advantages and disadvantages; warriors can buff allies and face-tank, wizards can do solid damage, archers can hit multiple enemies at once, they're all viable for different reasons
Remember, of course, about the perma-death mechanic; once a character's dead, they're dead
 Anything they had, if you didn't get it sorted out or saved, is gone, so it's incredibly important to manage the equipment that you find, so that the next time someone throws a death-spewing unicorn at you, you'll have plenty of equipment for the next character that hits the ground
[SUMMARY/FINAL THOUGHTS]In all, the game's as it's always been: you play, you die, you improve, you die again, the cycle continues
 Granted, there are the more-than-occasional hacking players that either screw you out of loot, or, in my experience, send sentient pinatas to murder you with rainbows, so the cycle is a bit less off a circle, and more of a triangle, where every corner is a slap to the face

Micro-transactions became too dominant in the game's design and it's suffered greatly for it
 Used to be a lot of fun, though
Posted: 3 December, 2013
Hoo, this game
Was a lot of fun for the first 60 hours
before the company got bought out by a bigger company
Apparently that company had big ideas in terms of monetizing the hell out of this fairly enjoyable free to play game
I enjoyed it back when it was catching on, but I think the game has definitely taken a turn for the worse when it got bought out
The design is more focused towards getting your money than making the game more enjoyable
When a game does that, even if I already invested 60 hours, I walk away rather than get treated like a bag of money by the game's designers and publishers
Posted: 4 September, 2015
Before you say I have no experience with this game, I have played for a good few hundred hours on the browser version
This game USED to be good
 It really was
 Back then, a company called Wildshadow owned the game
 It was truly f2p, with skill and no money required
Then, a company called Kabam took over
 They changed the game into a cashgrab
 Skins
 Buy gold
 Vaults and characters
 Buy gold
 1-life weapons or keys
 Buy gold
 Everything is gold gold gold
 Updates are rare, and even when they come they just add more items to be purchased with gold
 In fact, the way they 'celebrate' holidays is by creating cheap weapon reskins for more people to buy with
 you guessed it, gold
You might be thinking, at least there's player interaction
 No, there isn't
 The game is infested with hackers, scammers, enemy draggers, spambots, etc
 Kabam doesn't care at all
 After all, you don't make any money from clearing away hackers, so why bother
TL;DR: Stay away

Let's be real, if you played Life is Strange you're probably starved for any way to revisit our favorite heroines and would buy this game even if it were rated "Overwhelmingly Negative"
 The good news is that you don't really have to worry about that
 This is a good game, though it lacks the ambitious exposition of the original
 While Life is Strange violently plunged you into a world of secrets and conflict armed with a rewind button, Before the Storm focuses on smaller, and maybe more mundane happenings of Aradia Bay like teen angst, familial strife, betrayal, and the fast formed bond between two very different girls
 Without the superpowers of her best friend Max, Chloe's tale in Before the Storm shapes up to be a much more intimate, personal, and human tale than the original

The saddest part is to wait the next episode
Posted: 31 August
Episode start: Ah this is just normal and relaxedEpisode finished: I WASN'T READY FOR THESE EMOTIONS
Posted: 31 August
There are a few cringe moments, but I guess that comes with playing a teenage girl as a man
 Nevertheless, if you enjoyed the original, the first episode is pretty solid
Posted: 1 September
Deck Nine had an impossible task in Before the Storm: Not just to create a prequel to a story-driven game with a cult fandom, but to do it with:- A different game engine- Different writers- Different voice actors- Different music- No rewind mechanic(Is now a good time to mention that Deck Nine's previous work includes "Neopets: The Darkest Faerie," some remastered Playstation ports, and a forgettable snowboarding franchise
)In light of that, my expectations coming in were pretty low 
 and they've been absolutely blown away
 Episode 1 of Before the Storm isn't just true to the original game — as a one-to-one comparison, it's better than Episode 1 of the original Life is Strange
 I feel exactly like I felt playing the first game, and I haven't felt that way since the first game ended more than 2 years ago
 10/10 I'm not sure how this is even possible; go play it

I want my homie Max back
Posted: 3 September
This is probably the most thorough review I'll ever write on Steam, so I want to say some things before I start:I'm only reviewing the first episode in its release state
 I don't know yet if I'm going to update
I'm going to refer to the original game as LiS, to this one as BfS
LiS was a great game
 People are hyped and give BfS 10/10 ratings, disregarding its obvious flaws
 I would give it neither a thumb up nor a thumb down, but a "meh" rating
BfS isn't developed by the same studio and you notice that extremely
My review will get lots of thumbs down because the review system is broken
 Giving a thumb down means telling that the review isn't helpful
 People abuse the thumbs to vote down everything that doesn't agree with their opinion while voting up single sentence reviews that don't help anyone
I'll try to keep spoilers out of my review as much as possible
Let's take a look at some negative aspects, starting with technical stuff and proceeding into more "relevant" things:- GraphicsWhile LiS was based on the Unreal Engine, BfS uses the Unity Engine
 Believe it or not, but the simple graphics are a lot worse
 I actually loved the art style of LiS, but in BfS I actually deleted every single screenshot I took (and I take a lot of screenshots) because they just weren't pleasant to look at
 Textures often completely lack detail, anti-aliasing is non-existent (even on maxed out AA settings) which is actually a huge problem in this game, even though I usually don't care much about AA
 All my screenshots were heavilypixelated
- ControlsRemember how you chose an action in LiS by holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse into the direction of the action
 In BfS, you hold the left mouse button and use WASD to choose
 In other words, in order to look at stuff or interact you need two hands now instead of only one
 It's not a big deal, it just makes the game less comfortable at many scenes
- VoicesYou've probably heard already that Chloe has a new voice
 You probably still have her accent from LiS inside your head
 That's gone
 Not a big deal, you could get used to that - the problem is that her new actress just isn't good
 At
some points she sounds completely unmotivated and just talks her text down without any motivation at all
 Near the end of the game you will also notice heavy breathing and hear clearly that she was standing to close at the microphone
Chloe isn't the only character with a new voice, for example the famous angry David Madsen sounds really soft now
- AnimationsLots of animations look really clunky and unnatural
 I wanted to call an exorcist when Rachel was turning her head
 In dialogues, characters often lack facial expressions
 David gets angry and raises his voice, but his soft and calm expression stays
 Until BfS I never noticed what a killer missing facial expressions can be
- Paradoxes and other minor flawsFor example, there's a photo of pirate Chloe and pirate Max hanging in Chloe's living room
 However, the Max with the eyepatch on the photo isn't the young Max we know from flashbacks, but the old Max you play as in LiS
In Chloe's diary entry about a schoolmate she writes something such as "He's exactly like my class schedule
 We have history, but no chemistry
" You can read this while following the task "Go to your chemistry class
"The game is full of those details
- Chloe's characterAlright, Chloe's a rebel
 But sometimes it's just too much
 In the beginning of the game you can look at a knife stuck inside a wooden wall and Chloe says something like "This looks exactly like the knife my mom didn't want to buy me for my birthday
" She also likes tossing items just to the ground after using them, even if she borrowed them from a friend few seconds ago
 I mean, come on
- DialoguesSome dialogues actually make me cringe
 I won't go into details here due to possible spoilers
 There's a new feature which enables you to argue with people
 Everytime you have to persuade someone, just look out for the "arguing" sign and you know that's the way to go
 It triggers a minigame like in Monkey Island, where your enemy delivers a statement and you have to counter with a fitting insult
 Despite the fact that everyone beyond twelve years of age knows that you basically lose an argument as soon as you just start insulting your opponent, the arguing dialogues are just the worst in the game
 They are just completely incoherent
 You answer to a statement and suddenly your opponent starts about a completely different matter
 After winning the minigame, it always seems to me like people stop arguing because they are annoyed by Chloes inability to argue, not because she "won"
 But of course Chloe had to be as rebel as possible and so it works in the game's context
Furthermore, the reactions and answers of characters sometimes don't seem logical at all
- Other charactersExcept for Chloe and Rachel, the characters in this game mostly completely lack depth
 You meet them, they start talking about a topic, you choose one or two answers, you go on with the game
 I don't even remember what we talked about
I didn't like Rachel at all until the ending of the episode, but that's just my personal opinion
- ExplorationRemember how you strolled around in LiS, trying to find out everything about the world and its inhabitants
 Trying to find motives for a good photo
 It's almost non-existent in BfS
 Chloe's a rebel and there's a stage play coming up at school
 Everything you'll find are some posters about drug abuse and the upcoming stage play, without giving you any more information
 Instead of taking photos, you can draw graffitis at walls now
 There's a graffiti in every scene, so you just walk along walls until you find the spot to get your achievement
Now, some more positive aspects:+ ClothesAfter the intro you have to change clothes
 You can choose the outfit you want to wear during the episode
 There are two different T-shirts in the base game, you unlock three more outfits if you buy the deluxe edition and you can play as classic Chloe (without blue hair) if you preordered the game
- I probably don't have to mention that this feature is just a huge cashgrab for Square Enix
 It's a neat feature anyway
+ SoundtrackJust like LiS, BfS has a nice indie rock soundtrack which fits well into the game
- Remember the scenes in LiS, where you just enjoyed the scenery and a nice song to it
 They are in BfS too, but somehow they don't seem to fit into the game or they were just executed half-heartedly
 They are nice to have anyway
+ GameplayWell, the gameplay won't surprise you
 If you liked the gameplay of LiS and can live without time travel puzzles, you'll be satisfied
+ New ideasAfter the cool intro and the unfortunately very tedious middle part, the developers suddenly had their own ideas in the end and this is where the game finally shine
 This might be a little spoiler, but there's a difference between Max and Chloe
 While Max was very calm, Chloe can become very angry
 At some part in the game it suddenly gets emotional, and instead of only showing Chloe's emotions, you actually get to live out Chloe's emotions
 And it feels great
The arguing minigame is actually quite exciting, despite it's obvious lack of logic
For each graffiti, you can choose between two different messages which will also show up in your graffiti diary
 Neat little gimmick
+ The endingJust like every LiS episode, episode 1 of BfS has a great ending
 It didn't only leave me sitting with my mouth open, it actually sent a chill down my spine
Conclusion:If it wasn't for the first 20 minutes and especially the last 20 minutes of the episode (3
5 hours in total), I would actually give the game a clear thumb down
 I give it a "meh" rating
 It has very obvious flaws, but it's quite enjoyable if you're a LiS fan

I love this game
 It's different, rich in story, and will make even the coldest of hearts feel emotional
 First time finishing the game (before I got it on Steam) I was up at 3 in the morning bubbling like a baby when I finished I chose the save Arcadia Bay ending and if you played it you know how upseting that ending was
 This game, although it has it's flaws, is a masterpiece
 DontNod made a wonderful game and has proven that their small team can make an amazing, beautiful, heartfelt game
 I paid for the 1st episode before it was released on Steam for free, but even spending a few extra dollars was worth it, as this game has taken me through the incredible and emotional journey of Max Caulfield and Chloe Price
Pros:Beautiful indie sountrackFun use of timetraveling powersDifferent (and stunning) graphicsRelatable characters/situationsNot afraid to talk about uncomfortable topics (assault, deaths of loved ones, suicide, ect)Most small choices still have a meaningful impactStrong replay valueMany subtle refrences to shows/movies/memes Likable charactersVery atmospheric, it feels like a real townHas an unusual but nice mechanism where you can take a "Moment of Calm" and sit down on a bed/swing/bench, and just look at the world around you while calming music playsBeautiful locations and sceneryCons:Voice acting/script can be cringy at timesDespite the choices you make there are only two absolute endingsIs short (but as stated before is replayable)Can be cliche at timesOverall this game is not one to miss
 Even with it's flaws, Life is Strange is one game you shouldn't miss

I wish I could rewind and play this game for the first time again

It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game
 I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror
 And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute
When I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it
 I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag
 It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning
 I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined
 Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless
 Imagine if games held this standard
 Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution
 You can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way
 The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it
Most adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games
I've never felt so fulfilled after "playing a game" as I did today
 Original, beautiful and masterfully executed
 I can't wait for the next episode

 Make monumentally poor choice
 8
 Open the bottle of Jack Daniels you keep by your desk

 Remember why you failed Philosophy
11
 Drink some more
12
 Ponder if this game has set an impossible bar for videogame storytelling
13
 Conclude it has
14
 Decide to write negative review of game because it made you feel sad

 Change it to positive BECAUSE it managed to make you feel sad
 16
 Begin the slightly hollow search for something that can offer a similar experience

This is probably the realest review for a game I will ever do
Coming from a guy who never shows emotions, has been gaming for a good 12 years and has mainly been playing horror, FPS, and MMOs those twelve years
I both see and feel why this game has a warning about support groups for real life
This game guilt-trips you so hard and then kicks your emotions around like it's a soccer ball
I haven't had this much of an emotional roller coaster in, well
 ever
I've never had a video game make me tear up before
Life Is Strange changed that
Easily my "Game Of The Year"
 I know a lot of triple-a titles came out this year, and I know Life Is Strange doesn't get as much attention as other game
 but holy hell you guys
I've never played a game with such an in-depth story as I have with Life Is Strange
Hell, I've NEVER even played a game that kept me up all night, wondering about what the next episode will be, or how my actions in the last episode might impact me
This is a game that I will never forget, and it is most likely a game that I will always come back to

Posted: 23 September
I bought this game for £5
 I now realise it is worth so much more; how I missed this game for two years I don't know, I'm glad I finally got around to playing it; I haven't felt like this in a long time after playing a game, a completely lifechanging experience
 Life is Strange is slightly similar to games of the Telltale series, your choices affect the outcome of the game and make subtle and huge changes throughout
 You feel empathy for the characters in the world, and whilst handling mature themes such as depression, the game grips you to your seat
 It is amazing
 A masterpiece
 The writers are on par with some of the best TV shows and films out there, it makes you question every choice you make, your own reality
 As a player you actually feel like you affect the relationships between the characters
The music and art design are unique and aesthetically pleasing, which is a nice change from the usual games I play
 The voice acting's brilliant, the lip synchronization is not so much, but it is not awful
 Without spoiling anything, the twists in this game, WOW
 I can see why this game has critical acclaim
Finally I must end saying how much I recommend this game
 I've experienced nothing like it before, if you read this
 Please try this game
 You won't regret it
Posted: 26 December, 2015
Life is Strange isn't hard, yet it hits you hard
Life is Strange isn't challenging, yet it shows daily challenges
Life is Strange isn't long, yet its impact lasts long
Life is Strange isn't a puzzle, yet it leaves you puzzled
Life is Strange isn't giving questions, yet it offers answers
Life is Strange isn't replayable, yet finds in the replay its core
Life is Strange isn't real, yet it feels so
Life is Strange isn't about relationship, friensdhip, love, hate, light or darkness
 It's about the most underestimated gift: life
I am unable to call it "game" as it would lose all the artistic veil surrounding Arcadia Bay
 Art is something you perceive, it is something that comes out of the blue without a reason or a purpose
 Art is something you can perceive in every step Max takes, and this is how I would label Life is Strange: art
Dontnod has made a terrific job and gives us lessons that we can easily detatch from this title and apply it in our everyday life
 All the serious themes covered in such a little time amount made me understand the reason why the developers have opened a support group for those who felt really affected by some of them
And perhaps the core of this experience is simple and complicated at the same time:Life is hard, life is challenging, life is short, life is puzzling, life is uncertain, life is one only, life is strange
 But life
is life

Stunning
The online mode is incredibly fun
It's one of the funniest games i've ever played
 There is only one problem: It ends
If there were a mechanism to avoid the ending of the game, it would be one of my top 3 favourite games
Just something like a LEVEL CREATOR attached to Steam Workshop
 To sum up, a way to create objects and maps to publish at Workshop would be amazing for "Human: Fall Flat"

Wonderfull fun little puzzle game, the game is half figuring out the puzzle and the other half is making the "Human" do what you want him to do
 Other than that i really really loved the Polygen art this game contains, a 10/10 buy, PS

(I'm 47, so you may have different results if you're younger) Nice game
 Really fun, and not too hard to grasp the movement
 There's a slight learning curve when climbing, but it's easy once you learn how
 For some reason, tho, this game gives me motion sickness something fierce
 So, only good in short bursts for me

Posted: 8 January
This game is truly amazing
 At first, you spend a bit of time grasping the controls and marvelling at your ability to climb and move things
 Then the puzzles become more complicated (but sometimes menial)
 There isn't just one way to do things, either
 I passed an entire part of a level because I broke a window, stacked some matresses and clambered through
 You could also use a rope swing to cross a chasm instead of jumping your way across big rocks
 Basically, the game has some replayability, if you wanna go back and do the level a different way
 You can also do local co-op (NOTE: It's only with two gamepads, no keyboard
 But you use the keyboard and mouse in singleplayer
) Co-op just makes it more ridiculous, but the puzzles stay the same
 You could use your new buddy to try new ways of doing them, though
 I'd say this game is worth whatever it's being sold at, because you can't put a pricetag on honest fun

Human: Fall Flat is one those hidden gems that manages to take you by surprise and offer you a really well thought-out experience
 The game itself is visually simple in style, but fantastic in its presentation
 There is a genuine adventure to find here and it can only be achieved if you continue playing it
At first glance, it gives the impression for being a linear puzzle game
 From the mechanics and controls to the environment - it does seem like just an ordinary game that relies on its experimental physics
 Yet, there is a layer of wonder to it and shows us that a lot of love and care went into making it very fun for the player
 Once you've progressed past the first couple of stages, get ready to discover huge areas to explore
You are free to approach each stage however you please
 Many of them encourage creativity since it offers you more than one way of completing an obstacle
 Not to mention that every one of them is challenging enough to feel rewarding at the end, because there is a clear logic to their design
 While the motions of the character may seem confusing at first, you will eventually learn how to control them and be more accurate with their actions
The soundtrack is perfect, helping you relax as you try to figure out the puzzle in front of you, which fits in with the gentle nature of this game
 And if you think the solo playthrough isn't pleasing, then you are in luck
 With split-screen support you can invite a friend over and complete the game together, making the adventure a lot more hilarious
 Go for it
I'm definitely going to recommend Human: Fall Flat

Geometry Dash is way better
 Let's Compare:Geometry Dash:- Over 20 main levels- Level editor with endless possibilites- Loads of combinations with the character creator- Community of awesome people that make awesome levels for you to download- 120 FRICKIN ACHIEVEMENTS (much more actually
 120 is just the amount on steam
)- 7 different transformations, from Ship to Ball to SpiderImpossible Game:- 4 main levels- External level editor with very little possibilities- No character customization- None of the levels are as good as a Geo-Dash one
 - Last time I checked, there are only 12 achievements
 That's 10 times less than Geo-Dash- No more updates- Just the square to play as

This game is great
 :DControls are easy to learn (it's literally one button) yet the game offers a challenge through its levelsCommunity levels give the game more replayabilityLevels have great soundtrack and fun gameplay Level editor is easy to learn, but hard to master

Amazing game
 I'd played on mobile before the Steam version came out and loved it
 Highlights of the game:+ Many levels to choose from
 When you finish all of the main levels, you can do custom levels as well
+ Amazing soundtrack
+ Very smooth gameplay
+ Beautiful graphics
+ A mix of very easy and very hard levels
+ Tons of colors and icons to choose from
+ You can link your mobile account and get all of your icons and colors in PC
+ Has two exclusive Steam icons
+ Level editor allows you to create your own levels
- No control configuration
 You can't choose your own controls (yet)
- Time Machine
All in all, Geometry Dash is a great game with the exception of Time Machine being a thing no control configuration

Early Access Review
Invisible, Inc
is a roguelike, turn-based, strategy stealth game
 Moving past the buzzwords, it's a game where you move your units through randomized levels by observing the patterns of enemy movement and then avoiding them on your way to the exit point of the level
 If you're lucky, you'll find some items or cash along the way
 As you go further in the game, you face more and more dangerous enemies
 Eventually you get spotted, die, and have to start again from the beginning
 You do that last bit a lot, actually
 I've noticed a lot people assuming that the game is similar to Shadowrun Returns or XCom due to the isometric perspective
 It really isn't, and if you go in trying to play it that way you will end up being frustrated
 Invisible, Inc
 is a stealth game and a roguelike
 Combat is difficult and usually not an effective way to deal with enemies
 Also, it is a roguelike, to the extent that word still means anything, and you will most likely fail a lot as you learn how to play, and sometimes just because the random number generator screwed you over
 How much you enjoy it will depend on your tolerance for that sort of thing
Also, this being early access, there's always the question of whether the creators are going to actually finish the game
 Klei is a pretty well established company at this point, and they previously did a public beta similar to early access with their game Don't Starve
 Personally, I think they're trustworthy based on that track record
 Not that I'm an expert or anything
Posted: 10 July, 2015
All right, so I do recommend the game, but I'll say right away that it's easily not for everyone
 In short, if you're expecting a well-pieced together story, you won't find it here, but if you're after a rogue-like turn-based dungeon crawler, then this game will be right up your alley
The presentation is probably the game's biggest strength
 It's put together well in shiny visuals, clean UI, and a fun gameplay concept that takes isometric turn-based combat and makes it stealth-oriented, where you're better off avoiding the enemies rather than engaging in fights
 The game is fun, if you enjoy turn-based tactics that let you plan your every ally's move
The gameplay concept is solid, but some of its execution was a fair bit annoying to me personally
 A lot of the challenge presented felt simply artificial and unfair
 The raising security level each and every turn forces you to rush each mission
 Exploration is simply not rewarded under this system, because the longer you stay on your mission, the more security measures will be added after every few turns, which will eventually put you in a tight spot
 I never came across any way for me to freeze or reduce the security level
 It's just a rush against time, but on turn-based basis
I was also not fond of the fact that I couldn't buy any equipment for my party in between missions
 The only time I could do it was if I happened to find an automated shop during missions, when I had virtually no money to spend
 Of 4 agents I had in my missions, 2 were running about without weapons and just being used to sit on the guards
 This brings me to another annoyance
 If you don't have a weapon, you have no way to deal with the guards
 No idea what sort of agents these are who can't even take out a guard from behind unless they have a tazer
 Things start to get more complex when you meet enemies in armour, who are invulnerable to most weapons, and your only chance is to play a cat and mouse game where you're constantly running away
But, I really did like being able to improve my agents in between missions by upgrading their stats, even if stats themselves did feel a bit unbalanced
 Speed felt like the most useful stat by far, since it gave you more action points, with hacking being a close second, since everything requires hacking
 But strength and anarchy felt next to useless
 Strength only lets you carry more items, and anarchy makes you steal slightly more money from the guards
And lastly the story, well, it was mostly on the background
 The most of it you'll see is in the opening and ending cutscenes
 But the rest of the game you're just dungeon-crawling really
 It was pretty neat to get to pick which mission to do from a wide selection
 It's very non-linear and each mission simply increases your assets - either you rescue an extra agent to add to the team, or you find some new shiny gear to use
 Though because of that, it also meant that there were no story-related reasons to do any mission
 You could expect the same approach in each one and merely doing as many as you can to pass 72 hours in-game before having to do the final one with what you've got
I was also hoping there'd be some more character development
 All the agents in your team were just mute puppets for you to control
 They never showed any personality or had anything to say aside from a witty one-liner at the start of each mission
Having said this, if you are a dungeon-crawl fanatic and like challenge, you should enjoy this game very much
 It has higher difficulty modes, as well as an endless mode too where you have to survive for as long as you can
 Overall, it's a worthy game to try and I have had my fair share of fun with it, even though the main campaign is rather on the short side
Posted: 9 December, 2016
Despite the high positive review % this game is criminally underplayed and I believe I can provide some insight that isn't covered in the other reviews and also address some points from the negative reviews because they may deter people that would otherwise enjoy this game and get their money's worth
 That said I will be as objective as possible
First thing, this is pure turn based strategy gameplay
 The campaign and storyline is there but you need to enjoy the raw gameplay in order to appreciate this game
 Despite what you've been told the 'stealth' part is completely optional; it can be as disgustingly brutal as you want it to be
 My preferred end-game is to kill everything and I've found the right setup to make it extremely effective
 Winning isn't about figuring out what strategy works; they all 'work' even on the 'Expert' difficulty
 The reason Expert is considered by Klei to be the intended difficulty is because it's the hardest preset that doesn't limit your options
 Specifically 'Expert Plus' only discourages knocking out guards until you get EMP access but I don't expect anyone who hasn't played the game to know what I'm talking about here; just know that even the "hardest" difficulty still only limits your strategical options temporarily
I can accept most negative opinions of some features but my major gripe is their point about the RNG
 Take it from me; you do not lose because of RNG when playing on a preset difficulty (not custom settings)
 In most cases blaming RNG on your loss is a clear case of the Dunning-Kruger effect
 You lose because you made strategical or tactical mistakes
 Of course everyone makes careless mistakes from time to time and Invisible Inc acknowledges and embraces that with a number of "rewinds" that essentially legitimises save-scumming
There is an alarm system that increments every turn, adding difficulty over time throughout each mission
 Some opinions express distaste for it but I think it's great
 Historically most stealth games are very easy; you can be as patient as you'd like and often killing or incapacitating people has no repercussions
 If that's the requirement for stealth games then this isn't one
 It's a strategy game first and foremost, and a very unique one
Overall this game isn't easy at the higher difficulties
 Beginner exists for a reason so it's ok if you can't brain
 If you let it this game will teach you how to brain
 Not recommended under the influence of alcohol or sleep deprived, or try anyway, whatever
 Fight me in the comments, on the forums, or real life
Posted: 16 May, 2015
What people need to understand about Invisible, Inc
 is that it has a rogue-like/lite format
Complaints about the campaign being 'short' or the story not being very elaborate completely miss the mark
Would you consider those things as negatives for games like FTL or Binding of Isaac
No
The campaign is simply half a dozen or so levels strung together with an endearing B-movie cyberpunk spy narrative
It adds charm and atmosphere but is hardly necessary for the enjoyment of the game's mechanics
Like Klei's other games, Don't Starve and Mark of the Ninja, the emphasis is on the core gameplay and not the needless fluff you find in most AAA games today
The levels are randomly generated so you won't get bored challenging yourself on higher difficulties or endless mode to see how long you can survive
There's also the right mix of characters, abilities, items, and hacking powers to keep things interesting when you customize your squad
Additionally you are able to tweak various difficulty settings to tailor an experience that's the right mix of fun and frustration
If you are a fan of turned based tactical squad strategy games that deliver a high amount of replay via randomization then you'll love Invisible, Inc
Posted: 12 May, 2015
This is like XCOM except it won't waste your time with huge maps and long drawn-out firefights across a ravine
 It feels a lot more like dancing, as your squad scampers around guards and rooms, trading places / items / roles
 Very emergent qualities to the mechanics too -- you might make some noise to bait a guard outside, and he'll open a door and wander into your melee overwatch ambush
 but then he left the door open, which means a hacked turret has line of sight to another guard in that room, and so the turret kills him -- the noise alerts other guards and raises the global alarm level, which shuts down your turret and spawns 2 more guards, etc
 Things happen because of things, and almost every situation is avoidable if only you had planned ahead a bit better
Anyway, this is an exceptionally well-done game
 Highly recommended
 (DISCLOSURE: I completed the campaign on all 3 base difficulty levels
 I didn't pay for my copy of the game
 I know one of the developers
)

Nobody does stealth like Klei
If you enjoyed playing Tenchu: Stealth Assassin on PS1, you need this game
If you enjoy XCOM (the original or the reboot), you need this game
If you've ever seen an episode of Mission:Impossible, you need this game
If you enjoy "Rogue-likes", you need this game
Invisible, Inc
 puts you in a dangerous, near-future, 1984-esque big brother world of mega-corporations gone bad, with nothing to survive on but your wits and the specialized abilities of your hand-picked team of professional spies
The game plays like a "run and hide" XCOM
The goal here is not to storm the battlements, mow down the guards, and plant a flag over their corpses
You're outnumbered, outgunned, and certain death waits around every blind corner
In true espionage fashion, if your team has to pull their guns, it means you've screwed the pooch, your team is compromised, and now you're in a desperate firefight to sprint to the exit before the corporate army seals off the building
At the beginning, you pick two team members, whose special abilities will dictate your play style through an increasingly punishing randomly-generated corporate maze
You can bring a sniper, sure
But maybe a computer expert would be less noticeable than gunshots ringing through the halls
Or you can bring a stealthy lockpicker, but then who's going to judo chop the guards when they show up wearing body armor
 Along the way, you may have the opportunity to rescue captured agents and increase your team's size
The agents available to be rescued are randomized, creating a different play experience each time
The graphics and sound create an inviting, futuristic pulp-fiction atmosphere
The music is appropriately dangerous, and fitting to the Mission: Impossible play style
There are a ton of options to make the game easier or harder in whatever way you choose, so you can pick your own challenge level, from a casual romp through a save-scumming corp beatdown to hardcore, ironman, no going back, the-T-1000-is-after-you mode
Get it
You'll be happy you did

A corporate pacification squad prepares to break down the door and rush in assault rifles blazing
 Your escape route is clear, but Banks still needs one turn to hack the brain of the Plastech CEO you were sent to interrogate
 What do you do
After being beamed to the mission site, you are faced with two doors leading to the opposite sides of the building - one is watched by a guard and the other is clear
 Send your team through the unguarded route and you risk being trapped at side opposite to the escape elevator when your intrusion is noticed
 Have Nika knock out the guard so you can split up and he'll wake up in a few short turns, starting a facility-wide manhunt
 What do you do
While ransacking a Sankaku tech office, Dr
 Xu has been caught alone by an armed security drone, programmed to kill
 The rest of the team, too far away to help, will be sighted by a patrolling camera drone next turn, revealing their location to every Sankaku security personnel within six city blocks
 You only have enough power to hack one of the drones
 What do you do
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=495237730I don't think there's ever been a game more consistently suspenseful as Invisible Inc
 Even when you dance around guards and fill your accounts with corporate capital uncontested you aren't allowed to forget for a minute that it only takes one miscalculation to launch you into a freefall
 The biggest credit for this goes to the alarm mechanic
 Invisible makes detection a matter of unavoidable, gradually advancing doom rather than a fail state or an excuse to turn itself into an inferior action game
The alarm level creeps upwards with your every turn and every mistake, introducing new security measures and guards into the level, and not a single one of the many gadgets and programs available to your agents can do so much as slow it down
 It will only stop when the sirens are blaring, private military troops are flooding the building and your agents are darting frantically from room to room, burning through every item and augmentation they have in order to stave off death for just a little while longer
Invisible isn't a game about avoiding detection, it's about surviving it
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=495237777The core of the game, sneaking from cover to cover and ambushing guards, is immediately intuitive
 Instead of of deriving false depth from superfluous mechanics it sets up complex situations and tough choices with just a few precision-designed rules
 Things are mixed up by the equipment salvaged from the field, ranging from movement-boosting stimulants to electric door traps
 Customization isn't the right word here, though - your resources are always scarce so you must take whatever you can find and build your strategy around that
 Plans only last minutes before being replaced by mad improvisation
Let's go back Dr
 Xu and his predicament
 Maybe he found a rudimentary invisibility rig in the previous mission, not powerful enough to get him out of the drone's field of view but allowing him to run up to it and temporarily disable it with his EMP tool, an augment only he has access to
 Or perhaps Decker can use a stimulant to gain just enough action points to reach the room and gun the drone down
 Or maybe there's no way out, but Xu survives his injuries and can be recovered from a detention center later on
Oh, and the corporations aren't short of tricks either
 The reason Xu got caught
 He opened a safe after you triggered a countermeasure program that sets an alarm to all containers on the level
 And what if the program was activated by you stunning that same drone that's now threatening Xu so he could sneak to the safes undetected
 This is where Invisible Inc
 really shines - being a host to a multitude of tactical causes and effects without ever being overwhelming, and never letting you settle into a comfortable routine like many of its peers, even classics, do
http://steamcommunity
com/sharedfiles/filedetails/
id=495237816The soundtrack punctuates the action with surprising vigour and demonstrates some of the best use of reactive music since Proteus
 When the tension rises, so does the tempo, making sure your heart will pump faster and faster as the alarm tracker keeps filling up
 Likewise the art design is just as slick as one can hope for, taking a good step forward from Mark of the Ninja's and Don't Starve's Saturday morning look while still staying recognizably within Klei's house style
As cool as its presentation is, in terms of UI design Invisible does stumble into an occasional tripwire
 Finding the correct button to hack that pesky camera instead of a nearby server computer requires a bit too much fiddling with the camera than I'd like, and the times I've found myself unwittingly knocking out a guard with a conciousness monitor suggests that the varying abilities of guards and drones could be more clearly communicated
 These are very minor gripes though, and would be hardly noticed if the rest of the game wasn't so well-crafted
It is tempting to call Invisible an almost-perfect clockwork of a game but that would hardly do justice to the terror and triumph it evokes each mission and each turn
 Every drop of sweat and tears I shed over it makes me more convinced that I'm looking at a future classic
 It is the kind of a game that will creep into your mind and steal your heart
Posted: 12 June
"Invisible, Inc
" is a one-of-a-kind and an instant classic
 As a turn-based strategy game, it requires a high level of planning and strategy to succeed
 This is compounded by the "rouguelike" aspect of the game, meaning that you are not allowed to reload a previous save if you screw up
 Depending on the difficulty level you choose, you may either have the ability to retry the level, use a limited number of "rewinds" which bring you back to the beginning of the previous turn, or, on "ironman mode," have no safety net at all, meaning if you lose your team it is time to start a new game
This unforgiving style is compounded by the seemingly unfairness of the fight
 You are outnumbered and outgunned, infiltrating unknown enemy territory (levels are randomly generated), and you must rely on your stealth and cunning to make it through
 Still, there are a number of tools at your disposal: distraction techniques, lethal and non-lethal attacks, a wide variety of powers and gadgets that range from traps to cloaking devices, and a hacking system that targets the various devices found in the level allowing you to access, disable, or remotely command them
While there are some random elements to the game that vary the way each run plays out (such as which types of missions are available, the layouts of each level, and items/powers you find on the way), the rest of the game is very deterministic
 If you are very careful and diligent, you can play the enemy like a fiddle, pulling them this way and that so that your other agents can reach the mission objective (and/or rob the corporations blind)
 However, screw-ups do happen, and when they do, the situation can plunge from "astounding success" to "catastrophic failure" very quickly
 There is no HP meter for your agents
 If they are shot, they are permanently downed until another agent either drags them to the exit (leaving them vulnerable in the process) or revives them with Med Gel (which you may have inconveintly left behind to make room for that fantastic new gadget)
 It is possible to go on without them, but later missions are only going to be harder and it may be next-to-impossible to succeed with an under-manned team
Hacking is a vital part of the game in order to get past cameras and drones - and to access the various "shops" that come in the form of firewalled terminals found inside the levels
 The hacking system is, in some ways, a game within a game
 You can switch between the "real world" and the "virtual world" of your A
I
, Incognita
 Everything she does requires power
 Power can be generated by programs within Incognita, or through the actions of your agents (such as using their cybernetic augments or ordering them to hack consoles)
 This adds yet another layer of complexity to the game
 If you are being hunted by guards and barely staying afloat, the last thing you want is to run out of power and get spotted on camera because you couldn't hack it
 It leads to situations where you are running risky maneuvers in order to get to consoles, just so you can proceed unhindered through the rest of the level
 The number of hazards, and their respective firewall levels, is increased each turn, so careful planning and efficient power usage is essential
In the end, the beauty of "Invisible, Inc
" is its balance and the choices it forces you to make
 It is both ruthlessly hard and extremely satisfying when you make it through a level without a hitch
 You must choose between dodging past enemies, knocking them out for a couple turns, or killing them, each of which has its own concequences
 You have to choose between that awesome gadget or a new hacking program that will help you with the increasingly difficult firewalls
 You may have to choose to end your campaign or limp along with an under-manned team because your agent was seperated from the rest of the team and shot
 This, and the huge variety of strategies available, make it a wildly satisifying experience
 I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys strategy games

It's like XCOM and FTL got drunk and started making out, and then Mark of the Ninja walked in on them, but everyone was cool about it
Posted: 23 May, 2015
If you're the kind of gamer who is interested in turn-based stealth, just stop reading and buy Invisible Inc
 right now
If you're still on the fence, I'll explain
 Invisible Inc
's closest relative is gaming is probably Bionic Dues
 Don't feel bad if you've never played or heard of Bionic Dues, because there's only like 3 of us who have
 For everyone else, Invisible Inc
 is a lot like FTL or Desktop Dungeons, if those games were turn-based stealth games
 You spend the vast majority of your time inside missions, sneaking around, trying to hit objectives and robbing safes you come across
 You manage several different resources as you do this
 Power can be found in consoles, and you can also generate it on your own using different programs
 You spend it to disable or turn enemy infrastructure and drones into yours
 Alarms build up over time, and also increase when you are spotted or trigger certain things
 Cooldowns are another resource to manage, as you can disable guards, but only short periods of time and only every few turns or so
 Your items with cooldowns can also do other things
 Finally, you have to manage your positioning
 That's a bit more abstract than most, but you have to decide whether to split up and cover more ground, or stick together, minimize your visibility profile, and give your agents the ability to support each other
 Once you've been through the game a couple times, it will feel like second nature
At the beginning of each game, you choose your 2 starting agents (who each have predetermined unique augments, and some starter gear), a power generating program, and a hacking program
 Each of these choices affects your overall strategy within missions
 It's much like choosing your starting ship in FTL
As you rob safes and recover objectives in the game, you get credits to buy your agents weapons, items, and cybernetic augments that they carry with them for the rest of the campaign (or until you sell them)
 You strategically choose your missions based on the rewards you'll get from them, and have limited opportunities between missions to buy and sell items from a fence
 Between missions you can also upgrade your agents' stats directly
Enemies consist of drones, guards, cameras, daemons, and a handful of other things
 Guards are self-explanatory
 Drones are like guards, but you can hack them
 Cameras are also fairly easily understood
 Daemons are things that lurk inside of cameras, drones, and other hackable infrastructure that are essentially one-shot traps that trigger when you fully hack their hosts
 The mix of these things you encounter are dictated in part by which corporation you're infiltrating
 Each corporation has its own specialties and strengths
Each campaign lasts for 3 in-game days, with missions taking between 5 or 6 and 12 hours
 That means you're running 8 missions, plus the final mission
 Each campaign therefore lasts for about 5 or 6 hours of real time
This is a poorly written review I did in a few minutes, so try not to mind my jumping around too much
 All I'm trying to poorly communicate is that it scratches the same itch as FTL, with procedurally generated everything, big elements of both luck and skill, highly variable starting conditions, and the ability to pursue several strategies, as well as that roguelike sense of getting handed the dumbest stuff and still trying to make it work somehow

Been playing this in closed BETA and would like to recommend this game
 GORN is bloody, so if you don't mind violence, get this game because:- The fighting mechanics are very polished and fun to play- There are many unlockables (weapons/champions)- To unlock them you need to do challenges, which are diverse- This combination will keep you entertained for hours even in early accessBe mindful though that you NEED space to play or you will hurt yourself or the things around you
Here's a mixed reality video I made of GORN in closed BETA which shows what you can do in the game:https://www

had gorn for 2 days now and heres how those 2 days have gone:Day 1: Booted up the game excited for my first taste of a gladiator type vr experience
 Went through the first few waves of unarmed opponents with little trouble, even grabbing my opponents and ripping their heads from their still living bodies all to please the crowd of omnipotent floating heads around me quoting Gladiator the whole way through
 The night ended with my eyes burning from the profuse sweat i had started producing and I decide even the best gladiators need sleep so i proceeded to get some rest
Day2: After the intense combat of day 1 i felt like i had been hit by a train, but the arena called to me
 I started carving my way through the meat sacks once again, facing harder and harder rounds each time
 Instead of trying to please the crowd, i now have a deep seeded hatred for them and their "king" and i use that hatred and anger to fuel my berserk fighting rampages
 once again i have ended the night drenched in sweat and will likely be unable to move tomorrow
Overall this has to be one of the best vr games in existence
 I have never hated a floating head that doesnt speak/barely speaks as much as i have in this game but that anger just makes it that much better when i rip the head from their "champions" shoulders then throw the remains at them
 If you have any exercise equipment you wont need it anymore
 YOU WILL SWEAT and YOU WILL EXPERIENCE BLOODLUST
 10/10 best vr game ever

I played VR for the first time ever the other night at a buddies place and played this game
 This game alone made me go out and buy a VR system
 Awesome game, can't wait for more bosses and new gameplay to come out
Posted: 9 June
This game's greatest strength is its replayability and sustaining value
 It may be one of the highest hour-to-dollar ratios in single-player gaming
If you are the kind of gamer who reacts to a difficult challenge with a determination to conquer it, you will love the way this game continues to challenge, and challenge, and challenge further
 If you are the kind of gamer who goes into a game looking for suprises and discovery, you will be continuously pleased every time you find a cool new room, a game-changing item, crazy synergies between those items, and the games plaethora of well hidden secrets
 If you are the kind of gamer who loves to hunt achievements, this game will not only please you with the gargantuan number of achievements on display, but also in how the game integrates them with the core gameplay, rewarding you with in-game unlocks for almost every single achievement
If you are the kind of gamer who just wants a game they can turn on whenever, wherever, and enjoy a short but enjoyable gaming session, this game is perfect
 If you are in this category,
buy it on the Switch if you have one
If you are the kind of gamer that likes more casual experiences, that becomes very disheartened by dying or losing, is squeamish around gross imagery, or who doesn't want to have to look things up online, then you might find this game doesn't suit your tastes
 One feature common amoung content rich games like this, Don't Starve or Minecraft is that they are often very hard to penetrate due to their emphasis on experimentation and unexplained features, requiring wiki usage, and other McMillen games like Super Meat Boy often deter those that justifiably claim "This game is too hard" or "This game is gross
" While very fun and rewarding to the kinds of gamers listed above, and highly recommended, do beware that if you are in this category, I do not recommend this game

This is everything a remake should be: More items, more characters, more challenges, more bosses
 More everything
 My computer is old and chugs with games like Minecraft and Team Fortress 2, but Isaac: Rebirth runs silky smooth
 Three words:Buy
 This
 Game
Posted: 25 June
My first attempts at The Binding of Isaac resulted in me repeated dying in the first room I entered
 Almost 2000 hours later in game I can now sometimes survive as the lost
 Despite the frustration of dying A LOT, the challenge of getting further and further in game was what kept me returning day after day
 Two years later it is still my most commonly played game
With this many hours of enjoyment I feel like a review is long overdue
 Music - 5/5I absolutely love the soundtrack for this game and it complements the theme of the game
 Each floor has it's own unique tracks and ambient sounds which give a great atmosphere
 Standout tracks:
Delirum, Diptera Sonata & Ascension (Chest Fight)Graphics - 3/5This is very much down to personal taste - I originally played the flash version of Binding of Isaac and once Rebirth came out with the pixel graphics I immediately hated it
 It felt like a lot of the charm was gone
 The art style has grown on me over time but I do still miss the old graphics
 Playability - 5/5Giving this game any less than a 10 for me is impossible
 In about 2000 hours I've run into a couple of bugs but rarely have they caused me to lose a run
 The only memorable on is when using Dead Cat on a Sacrifice room it caused the game to crash but I've not had that occur in quite some time
 The controls were initally hard for me to get used to but they are simple and you do get used to them fairly quickly
 I use a keyboard but have attempted the game with a controller but I found it a bit odd after having played so much of the game with the keyboard
 Some friends have found it easier with controller when starting but I suppose that comes down to personal preference
 TOTAL: 13/15The Binding of Isaac is fun (albeit, hard at times) game with a lot of charm
 It's given me quite literally thousands of hours of enjoyment
Posted: 11 December, 2016
After 2000 hours played (with a few hundred on the original Flash version) I guess I should write a review
This is a good game
 I think you should buy it
Posted: 4 November, 2014
+ The amount of stuff to grab and to do, insane+ New engine blows the old Isaac out of the water (fire effects, shadows, etc
)+ Game is amazingly smooth and clean+ Too many achievements to count for+ Too many hours spent in perspective+ Best poop simulator EVER
- Incompatible with social life outside the PC
- UPDATE: Had the music on the "+" but moved it here
 Sounded incredible on the first run but on the long run it's kinda grating
 Makes me miss Danny's amazing soundtrack
Posted: 9 January, 2015
If you get into this game you will no longer find it weird when people say things like'I hope I'll get proptosis''Cancer
 Great
''I'm not sure if I wanna pick up dead cat''Headless baby, it's an okay pickup''I should be able to kill mom'there's like 350 items, lots of bosses, enemies, synergies,characters,challenges and it has a lot of replay value, all that cool stuff you want in a video game the soundtrack is nice too

Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a remake of Binding of Isaac with new graphics, new mechanics, new monsters, new items and every aspect of the game has been enhanced
 New content has been added everywhere possible, the game feels infinitely smoother, is so much nicer to play, and has many more hours of content to keep you satisfied for longer
 If you enjoyed the original Binding of Isaac, Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is going to be infinitely better and I can promise instant satisfaction
 This review will consist of comparisons between the original and Rebirth, what’s good, what’s bad, possible changes and just an overall look at various aspects of the game including everything that comes to mind
 It is often a bit rambly, because I talk extensively about every detail I like and every component that irks me
 For a full recommendation of the game and a continuation of the review, visit the last paragraph
A basic introduction to Binding of Isaac overall is an attempt to run away from your Mother who is trying to kill you
 You run into the basement, where you find various items which can be beneficial, harmful or simply useless to your overall goal of surviving
 You shoot the enemies with your tears to kill them while running away from them and their tears to avoid taking damage
 Once you die, that run is over
 The game is perma-death, so you have to start again from scratch
 The game is also absolutely disgusting
 There isn’t too much blood, but knowing that these monsters have lived in your dusty old basement, been transformed into ugly mutilated creatures and that this is what becomes of you as you take pills and pick up items is gross
 Once you get past the horrid enemies, the game is pretty simple and is extremely fun to all who like the challenge of a game like this
 This game has a bunch of different characters, all of which have different unique aspects
 Some characters are easier to play than others, which in the eyes of many people, makes those characters more fun
 I wish the characters were more balanced, but it’s very rarely possible to have 10 different characters you can play as that all play with equal difficulty
 There are bound to be some easier, more fun and more interesting characters, and that’s what makes them unique
 Something that’s missing from the classes however, is all the characters being unique
 Some of the playstyles of the characters feel too similar, and some of the things that made characters unique in the original Binding of Isaac have disappeared in Rebirth
Samson no longer starts with a soul heart along with 1 red heart, an interesting aspect of Samson that made him a challenge in the original game
 Rather, he starts with 3 red hearts, probably to accompany the change in the item of Bloody Lust making it a damage output increase relative to the amount of damage taken for the entire floor
 This is an interesting change, but it makes Samson more of a tanky character, similar to Magdalene, rather than the weaker character with more potential
 I believe a better change would have been to give Samson a spacebar item and keep his stats the same as they are in the original, and the effect of Bloody Lust relative to the amount of kills you get while still maintaining it’s effect over the floor
Lucky Foot, the item that made Cain a fun character to play in the original, has been significantly nerfed, making Cain a character that lacks a truly unique aspect
 While Lucky Foot is still a luck up, a single luck increase does not have much of an effect as most items that use luck to work require a lot of it to work extremely well
 If the Lucky Foot could still make the Fortune Machine work all the time, or at least most of the time, and increase the luck stat by multiple points rather than just one, Cain would be a much more interesting character to play and much more unique
A good addition to Rebirth is that all the stats are finally given good use and are recorded
 The luck stat is used in everything it should, with a bunch of items now using the luck stat to perform more efficiently, all methods of gambling in the game being affected by luck and it now being shown on the pause screen when you press escape
 They’ve also shown all the stats, including shot speed and luck as previously mentioned, on the pause screen, which were not there in the original game
There are some enemies in the game that have been made impossible to fight
 Bloat is a boss that shoots brimstone like lasers out of his eyes, which wasn’t too bad in the original but in this game there is no ‘tell’ (something that means he’s going to do a certain attack) for when he is going to shoot it, and before you can move out of the way, there is a laser and you’ve been hit
 The same thing applies to the Lumps in the womb and the Mom eyes in the red champion Mom fight, which shoot instantly upon popping up and you have no time to react to the high speed shot
 There are a lot of enemies that do similar things, and still a lot of rooms remain where it’s almost impossible to leave without taking damage
Something I noticed that’s new in Rebirth is that everything from the original now has an equivalent
 Every form of fly-related enemy now has a spider version that does the same thing, and a lot of similar aspects like that
 It makes the game more uniform, because now there are a lot more interesting spiders which were missing from the original game and a lot of new versions of both flies and spiders which add a lot to the challenge of learning new elements of the game
Easily one of the best new additions in Rebirth is the ability to save your progress in a run
 You can stop it at any time, close the game, and start again from where you left off at a later point
 You can’t start another run while in the middle of a previous one without overriding the previous run’s data, but it’s still an extremely useful feature, since in the previous game we had to leave the game running to continue a round of BoI
One of the more fun new additions is rooms of varying sizes
 They aren’t anything like a random size, but they can now be a single normal room, as all the rooms were in the original BoI, they can be double rooms extended either horizontally or vertically, and they can even be quadruple rooms that extend in both directions
 The animation for travelling through such rooms can apparently cause motion sickness, and it can be turned off by changing something in one of the files (I’m not quite sure what)
 Personally, I quite like the animation, and it makes moving around large rooms extremely fun
Overall, this game is easily worth the $15 if you liked the original Binding of Isaac, and at the time of the making of this review there was no DLC released (if there ever will be any), so that might be added in the future
 This is an action packed perma-death roguelike with infinite replayability and hundreds of hours of gameplay to unlock all the achievements and secrets

1 And it came to pass after these things, that Edmund McMillen did tempt gamers, and said unto them, gamers: and he said, Behold, here I am
2 And he said, Take now thy cash, thine only cash till next pay period, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Steam or Sony; and offer it there for 10 to 15 USD (dependent upon loyalty discount), offering upon one of the consoles which I will tell thee of
3 And the gamers rose up early in the morning, and saddled their Honda Civics, and took two new Taco Bell Breakfast Crunchwraps, and their cash, and rose up, and went unto the place of which Edmund had told them
4 Then on what felt like the billionth day the gamers lifted up their eyes, and saw the place afar off
5 And
they said unto their Crunchwraps, Abide ye here with the Honda Civics; and I and the cash will go yonder and worship, and come again to you
6 And the gamers took their cash; and they went both of them together
7 And the cash spake unto the gamers, their owners, and said, My owners: and they said, Here am I, my cash
 And he said, Behold the cart, full: but where is the cash for offering
8 And the gamers said, My cash, Edmund McMillen will provide himself cash for an offering: so they went both of them together, because mediums of exchange are incapable of
critical thinking
9 And they came to the place which Edmund had told them of; and the gamers chilled there, and placed the order, and bound their cash and laid him on the altar of purchase
10 And the gamers stretched forth their hands, and inched their cursors towards confirmation
11 And Tyrone Rodriguez called unto gamers out of Nicalis, and said, gamers, gamers: and he said, Here am I
12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the cash, neither do thou any thing unto it: for now I know that thou fearest cancellation; seeing thou hast not withheld thy cash, thine only cash for this pay period
13 And
the gamers lifted up their eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a northern lion: and the gamers went and took the northern lion, and criticized him for taking Mom's Knife, in stead of their cash
14 And the gamers called that game Rebirth: as it is said to this day, In the mount of
Indie it shall be seen
The Binding of Isaac, released back in 2011, is a rogue-like indie darling that wears its Zelda influences on its sleeves
 You play as Isaac, a young boy living with his mother
 His mother, convinced she is being spoken to by God, must offer Isaac up to prove her love and devotion to Him
 Isaac, in an understandable act of defiant self-interest, descends into the basement to escape
 It's there that the game begins
 You fight all manner of monstrosities down below, ranging from hideous pin worms, cleft-lipped disembodied heads, physical manifestations of the Seven Deadly Sins, and the Horsemen of the Apocalypse
 You start fighting the denizens of your basement with your tears – yes, this game is a strange one – but as you progress you'll find unlockables (in stores, treasure rooms, arcades, etc
) that change your tear effects, sometimes drastically (and sometimes your appearance)
 To win you have to juggle health, bombs, keys, and money
 You'll have to find secret rooms (and secreter rooms
)
And of course, you'll have to fight
 well, I won't spoil THAT
 Suffice it to say you'll have some options
 As you play, succeed, and succumb, you'll unlock items and characters for each subsequent playthrough
 On top of that, items you find and unlock, enemies you encounter, and floor layouts all change with each descent – effectively making every run unique
 The Binding of Isaac is one of the most highly replayable games around, with many players logging in hundreds if not thousands of hours
It's a troubling trend lately that games have been getting the HD rerelease treatment so quickly after initial launch
 The Last of Us, Tomb Raider, Sleeping Dogs, Metro – all have come out recently, all have had rereleases in fairly quick succession
 It's no secret that gamers are suckers for a good dose of nostalgia, and that we're willing to pay top dollar for games we loved years ago that haven't necessarily weathered the passing of time so well
 Now publishers are testing gaming goodwill with the constant stream of HD ports, definitive editions, remasters, and remakes
It's been three years since Isaac's first appearance, and now he's back in The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth
 And just like way back in 2011 when he first burst onto the scene, he's stolen the show yet again
 I've explained the core mechanics and features of the game in a previous paragraph, so I won't get all redundant on you
 Instead I'll tell you what's new in Rebirth
 New enemies, regular and boss types
 New floor layouts
 Bigger floors
 New items
 New trinkets (items you carry with you that result in an effect – Pink Eye gives you poison shots, Cancer increases number of tears, etc
)
 New challenge runs
 More item synergies
 More characters to play as
 “Seeds” that allow you to choose a particular run
 Hard mode for you masochists
 Couch drop in/drop out co-op, ingeniously designed where a second player can take health from the first player and becomes a unique familiar, providing backup until death (as long as you have health to spare, you can respawn)
 Controller support
 New soundtrack from Matthias Bossi and Jon Evans
 More secrets
 The ability to save
Posted: 13 February, 2015
I love this game, alot
 It completely blows the original out of the water
 Here's some pros/cons:Pros:-More Playable characters
-More Bosses-More Items-8 Billion seeded runs
-Better mechanics-A whole load of bug fixes
-A massive amount of playtime
-New Challenges-Boss rush-16 Endings
-Easier to break >:)Cons:-The Keeper
In all seriousness, this is one of my favourite games of all time
 Fantastic, active and passionate community, Northernlion's videos are what keeps me warm at night
 Incredible fun, highly recommended

Early Access Review
Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher
I'm about one
 maybe two good jump scares away from being institutionalized
 Playing as an Indonesian schoolgirl with a magic phone, an archeologist with amnesia, and a toddler with diapers full to the brim has had an ill effect on me
 My heart just can't take it – my mind just can't take it
 The filaments that hold my fragile psyche aloft are pulled taut, straining as each frayed fiber falters and my sanity slips closer towards the cold, dark depths of derangement
 Which isn't super great, really
 But I'll gladly surrender my faculties for a game as fun as “Darkwood
”“Darkwood” isn't a “Slender” or “Amnesia” clone
 This is a game in the vein of old school horror where atmosphere was king – you'll hear lots of comparisons to the “Silent Hill” series
 The key to good horror is cultivating a crushing, foreboding world environment
 one that fosters paranoia and unease the whole way through
 Sure, jumpscares are necessary to finally break the tension, but the best horror games are dripping and oozing in atmosphere
 The whole world should FEEL hostile, not just the denizens that inhabit it
 This game doesn't want you playing it, no
 It wants to play you
Here's what you can expect playing “Darkwood:” your hands should be clammy with an itch you can't scratch, not now
 Your face should be inches from your monitor, blinking only when necessary, scanning wildly back and forth for something, ANYTHING, to betray the game's ill intent
 As you talk with each bizarre NPC you should feel nervous, wondering when the conversation will go from benignly creepy to malignantly violent
 And when you finally encounter an unspeakable horror, you'll have to make that gut decision whether to run or stand your ground
 I recommend running
 Like with all survivor horrors, you are at a notable disadvantage
 You'll also be able to set up hasty barricades
 rocking back and forth as claws scratch and jaws click outside, tearing your defenses down piece by piece
There are a lot of cool things happening with this game
 Your vision is funneled, forcing the aforementioned wild scanning
 You can see the world generally in your “peripheral vision,” but you have to be looking relatively dead-on to see any actual threats
 They'll be effectively invisible otherwise
 You'll inject yourself with concoctions extracted from fauna and flora that provide mutations
 They will grant a boost in one way and a hindrance in another
 There's a crafting aspect that's pretty basic right now but feels natural
 rough and raw
 Besides health you have a stamina meter, one you'll have to keep an eye on when deciding whether to fight or fly
 Graphically speaking, “Darkwood” isn't exactly next gen, but it is highly stylized and creepy
 It's a beautiful, dark, Gothic painting – like the ones where the eyes follow you wherever you go and it talks smack about your mother
 And the music will chill you to the bone
 If the environment and enemies start to give you a little break, don't worry
 The music will swell and put you right back on edge, or the heavy creaks and sudden cracks of the sound design
Like any good horror this is a challenging game
 I do recommend playing with permadeath on
 Adds to the spook factor
 Anticipate shedding lots of your own pixelated blood
 My biggest gripes
 It's hard to determine sometimes (between how dark the game is and how
 generally dark the colors are) what
I can search and interact with and what's just a creepy thingy
 The controls also take some getting used to, but that seems appropriate considering the genre
 Now seeing that this is an Early Access title my recommendation is tentative and subject to change
 But at the moment there is nothing out on Steam quite like this
 Every day you hear people bemoan the death of “true survival horror,” myself being one of them
 Well folks, it wasn't dead
 Just waiting for the right moment to sing its siren song
 and draw us in at least once more, into those dark and dreary woods where light dares not penetrate and your screams can't quite escape
Posted: 26 July, 2014
Early Access Review
<Subject to change>My first few hours in Darkwood were certainly very interesting, after the impressive prologue I decided to go speak to an NPC i was advised to find
 After I did this I realised daylight was running out, and here's what happened next:-Returned to my safehouse and pushed a wardrobe up against a gaping hole in the wall
-Panicked because I didn't bother to collect the tools necessary to barricade the house
-Everything is now pitch black, my cone of vision is
tiny -I weep as I slowly walk myself to the 'front lobby' room because it has no windows to reduce the chance of being spotted
-I hear the moans of some unknown ethereal horror-Check both the exterior and interior door to ensure they are closed-The moaning gets louder-The action prompt for the front door now says 'close door', meaning it has been
opened -My cone of vision is still 2-3ft btw-I quickly close the door-The prompt changed to 'close door' again-I close the door again-Moaning is still extremely loud-Continue in this pattern for 60 seconds in sheer terror before the door finally stays closed for a while
-I sigh a breath of relief-Something swiftly moves past the far edge of my cone of vision-* very loud moaning continues
*-The monster was in the lobby with me for the whole night-I'm sure i'm going to die-Suddenly Daybreak-*Day 2*
Posted: 20 August
Wow, what a journey
 A top down actual survival horror game that actually has an intriguing storyline
 Categories typically get a base score, followed by pros and cons
 Graphics: 9/10==========Many will question why I give this game a 9
 I don't believe graphics have to have 1000000000 polygons to be good
 This game chose a more pixel style of graphics with what I believe to be some hand drawn environments
 Whatever it is, the composition comes together so damn well
 The Depth of field on trees that are high up in the air way above your character, to the animations of enemies and your character, to the fire and flames and 3D buildings
 It all looks great and has fantastic polish
 Well done
 +9Story: 8/10========This is a game where I can't really give a synopsis to what is going on
 You will just have to play the game
 +8Some major/minor character questlines have unexplained and unforetold consequences to the story and your surrounding environment
 This isn't necessarily a bad thing but it has a chance of frustrating you since you probably won't be able to go back and change it (unless you reset very quickly)
 As someone who always tries to achieve the best ending possible, this affected my "try not to die" playthrough
 +/- 0Sound/Music: 10/10==============10 out of freaking 10
 This is a game where you will constantly be saying to yourself "wtf was that noise
" From the subtle footsteps you'll occasionally hear of someone walking around in your hideout that isn't you, to the creepy eerie music that confronts you upon approaching a critical point in the storyline
 It's all brilliant
 +9No jumpscares
 +1Gameplay: 9/10===========Gameplay revolves around scouraging for supplies and progressing the storyline in the daytime, to surviving the nighttime in your house against the perils of the forest
 +2Crafting system is easy to understand, works great, and is implemented without frustration (besides missing a needed supply)
 +1Fair difficulty settings ranging from Normal (infinite lives), to Hard (limited lives), to Nightmare (one life)
 +1Enemies are varied in difficulty as the game progresses and all have unique abilities that might just end your 1 life playthrough
 They are however readable, learnable, and aren't frustrating to deal with
 You get the hard mode without the headache
 +2Again, no jumpscares
 +1Events that take place directly at the hideout at nighttime are brilliant and creepy
 One night you may not encounter a single enemy, but instead will find someone knocking on your door to leave you supplies
 Another night you'll face against 10 Huge Dogs
 Good luck
 +2Unique category, Lighting and Vision: 10/10================================Darkwood gets its own category of how it handles the lighting and the vision in this game
 It takes into account not only the visual perspective of your character's eyes, but also of electricity, and fire, and whatever the hell those things are later in the game that emit light
 Sometimes an enemy will temporarily destroy all electrical sources of light
 Lets hope you have some torches or a flare
 Even things such as getting poisoned, or drunk on alcohol will affect your given vision, typically narrowing it for a period
 And there are abilities that give you greater vision
 Some enemies simply require that you don't look directly at them, no matter how close you may be to them, and they can't do a damn thing to you
It's these things that I feel needed to be accounted for, for how brilliantly they're used
 Well done
 +10Overall: 9
2/10 (46/50 = 0
92)=====================It's not often I buy a game that I am just so utterly excited to play again the next day
 I'm sure I'm not the only one
 For what Darkwood is, it nails just about every aspect of its intended presentation
 Well done developers

Early Access Review
Dear Journal: I keep coming back to life, despite my best efforts
 I thought death would be a release, but it's only a continuation of the torment
 In what I'm sure is a futile effort to keep my sanity, I will try to catalogue my various deaths
Death 1:No weapons in sight and night is falling rapidly
 In a misguided attempt to make the animals friendlier towards me, I've brewed a strange concoction from the local mycological flora and injected myself with it
 The only effect I've seen towards my original intention was that the rabbits have stopped gnashing their teeth when I approach and have opted for a more subtle, indignant sideways glance
 Night fell and I drank the well water as I was told by the nonchalant wolfman (nonchalant in that he seemed to have no compunctions that he was a freak of nature) that woke me up
 The generator has failed and my only light is the mocking phosphorescent glow of my last flare
 I hear things approaching
 Hungry things
 I've pushed my wardrobe in front of the window in the hopes that it would stop them
 It did not, and a howling naked man has bashed my skull in and, presumably, eaten me
Death 2:Woken up by the wolfman again
 He doesn't seem to remember me
 I show him the dogtag as before and, as before, he tells me to seek out the chicken lady
 My travels this time have been more fruitful
 I've discovered several nonfunctional vehicles nearby, each containing a substantial amount of fuel
 Hopefully this will help me keep the generator running this time
 I've also found enough material to fashion a crude weapon for my inevitable self-defense
 On top of that, I've found a bear trap with which to lay a trap for any more au naturel forest men that want to avail themselves of my sweetmeats
 Once again, night falls and I drink from the well
 I'm somewhat prepared this time
 Again they come
 I catch one in the bear trap and proceed to beat him into submission
 Shortly after, another bursts in behind me, catching me by surprise
 A pitched battle erupts, with me barely surviving to fell my opponent
 I'm bleeding badly, but have enough rags to fashion a welcome, if somewhat unsanitary, bandage
 Eventually morning arives and I stride wrecklessly back out into the forest, perchance to happen upon more provisions and survive another night in this hellish place
 I happen upon a corpse, seemingly hidden under a jagged thicket
 Immediately upon poking it, it explodes and I'm slain by its cadaverous stench
Death 3:Again the wolfman comes
 I think he's mocking me
 Is it a he
 It sounds male
 I have little luck in finding anything useful in my wanderings
 The woods are crawling with wolves (the normal kind
 I didn't think to stop and check their gender), and I have to skirt around them constantly
 I find some alcohol, rags, and a lighter, but little else
 At least I can keep warm with this, one way or another
 Night falls and I drink the water
 I'm beginning to wonder if I should be following the wolfman's advice at this point
 For all I know, it's the well water that's keeping me here
 I can do nothing but sit in my dark house, hoping they don't find me and tear me limb from limb
 My hopes are completely unfounded
 Having no other weapons, I quickly fashion a crude Molotov cocktail and hold it at the ready for when something crashes through the window in front of me
 Alas, one crashes in behind me
 Panicking, I drop the freshly lit incendiary at my feet, immediately catching myself and the wildman ablaze
 I'm not sure which of us died first
 I can now officially say that immolation has been my least favorite way to go
Death 4:Banshee
 or witch
 I'm unsure at this point
Death 5:Pack of wolves
 Gender unknown
Death 6:%$@&ing CORPSE BOMB
Death 7: Ok, this is getting a little ridiculous
 I'm just going to sit in my house and pretend I'm dead
 Maybe the universe, or whatever cruel deity placed me here, will forget that I exist and move on to torment some other poor soul
 Nope
Ten out of ten
 Would die again

This games makes a great impression in the prologue and in your first night out of the tutorial
Mine went like this
-I was able to gather a bit of resources and boarded up a door and a window-I turned on the generator since I moved a lamp into a room I thought would be perfect-I moved the lamp to the window which was boarded up so I could see outside as well as inside-As the night got darker I see creatures outside through the small cracks within the boarded up window-Moans closing in and sounds of furniture moving in the room next to mine-The generator dies and everything is now pitch black-I sit for a while in the darkness-When the door opens and this THING enters-I was luckily able to kill it with my plank with nails in it-Close the door and hold out-Day 2 starts and I leave the room I was in-I check the house to see how it got in-NOTHING was moved from its original spot and no windows or doors were brokenSo
how did it get in

I abstained from writing this review until Darkwood was publicly released
 That being said, I've owned this game well over two years, so I've got quite a bit to say
 To compare this game to others would be a crime, but if I had to, I'd say that Darkwood feels like playing Hotline Miami, if HM were inside of the Blair Witch Project
 The top-down perspective may seem like an odd choice for a survival horror, but it ends up working very well in Darkwood, since your cone of vision is small, and the added challenge of having to mouse over areas to see underneath tree cover adds to a perfectly executed sense of claustrophobia
The primary gameplay loop of Darkwood is fairly simple: Explore, scavenge, and arm yourself during the day, then gas up your generator and wait out the night
 If you fail to make it back to your safehouse and power on the lights before dark, Bad Things® will happen
 What makes nighttime truly terrifying in Darkwood is the lack of a sleep mechanic: You are awake at all times and constantly afraid that your pitiful house defenses will be breached and you'll suffer Even More Bad Things®
 The sound design also adds so much to that tension of waiting out the night
 You'll hear footsteps outside your door
 You'r door will be beaten upon
 Things will go bump in the night, and you'll be cowering in the corner waiting, praying, for that music to start and your screen to go red, signifying the successful survival of another night
Setting and plot wise, Darkwood has the most compelling location and premise of any horror game I've ever played
 I won't spoil much, just remember to respect the trees
Controls and game feel are 100% spot-on
 Graphics look very good, especially if you like little details (Just look at how the grass moves
) Buy the game
 Door code couldn't be simpler

Early Access Review
got to The Old Forest, found my new home and had all the supplies to move in
 fixed up the well, was able to blocked up all the windows and fortify the doors i needed to, moved the furnature into one main room to cover the doors and windows at night (extra protection from the locals, just in case) and got all of my supplies put away and prepared for the great night i would have in my new home
and what a night it was
after about 30 seconds after getting my late night drink from the well, walking back inside and pushing the wardrobe over the door again, the fun began
 they started with the windows
 i watched in horror as almost all at once, my window barriers started to explode in showers of splinters in the rooms surrounding mine
 i could hear the abominations
climbing in, roaming the halls, smashing my doors off their frames, and hunting for my flesh while they screamed out in anger

Early Access Review
So, I invested 31 days (in game time) to one world, thinking I could go through it and get some of the many endings this game provides
 On the 30th day I go into a hellish pigshed and find a monstrosity that no words can describe, the only way of ending said creature (besides being insane and fighting it directly) was to electricute it
In order to do this I needed a particular cable that was sold by a good buddy of mine called Piotrek, whom I had just given all the items to for the rocket he was building
At the time he was really excited about this and told me that by tomorrow he was going to fly to the moon or something of that sort
What was unknown to him was that I had allowed the Wolfman to see one of the components to his rocket (I had no clue that this would cause the ship to explode, sadly
) So the very next day I walk to
Piotrek's house only to see him dead on the ground, skewered by the many pieces of shrapnel that came out of the exploding pile of junk
In a flood of sadness and fury, I head over back to the wolf camp and began talking to my partner in crime, whom was sh*tting himself in laughter after seeing the explosion
Once I realized that I wasn't able to finish off the monstrosity, I stride behind the Wolfman, brought out my pistol and put a bullet into the back of his head
I then promptly loot the dead man's body and walk out into the middle of the meadow as I waited for the time to tick away
As the sun set I felt my body begin to corrode away until my heart stopped, and I fell to the ground dead
I'm sorry, Piotrek

WHEW
 A much rougher game toward the last few chapters than I expected
 But I was glad I did this with someone as I could see it becoming tedious playing solo story mode
 The humor was great though
 A very well-constructed and entertaining game to share with others
 :)Rating: 9/10If you like co-op and love platformers, you must save Hatty

Unlike all the "Buckle yo pants" Reviews that are funny but useless to a guy who dont know this gameThis review will be different and aim for the game itself hopefully you'll read First i wanted to say i considered myself so lucky because i was able to join the beta test, honestly i wouldnt have been able to wait the games full release
This is a 4 Player online platformer that has a great mechanism in controls and really addictive and easy to pick up on
The game has 2 Player Co-op Adventure mode, Or 4 In Arena mode
Adventure mode can either be normal or INSANE ( insane mode, is one death mode basically)The game can be pretty brutal in some stages with insane mode
Arena mode Targets 2v2 team and has a lot of great endless fun modesCapture the Fla
 Horse 
 its called capture the horse which is same as CTF but a horse that looks like a piece of walking candy, and even more funOr Basketball which is my personal favorite and its something you wont play just once : )And a lot more Modes from soul catcher ( Kill and get their souls) To "Grab the gold"
9 Different fun modes
The mechanism of the game makes it possible to do a great teamwork in adventure mode
You can pick up your friend and throw him or he just simply jumps on your head to reach a high place and then lifts you up to join him, or use a weapon to blast your friend to a certain places, and just be creative with what you wanna do :)
A huge selection of weapons and faces, ( You can make your own face and put it in game folder for everyone to see)the game is basically Get the (Certain number) of Gems in each level and reach the end in the best time ( And the hidden yarn ball ) Gems buys you Faces, Yarn balls buys Weapons
WITH
 the ability to Trade them in-game or in steam trading system, or even sell them on steam market
Which is a good feature because you cant buy a certain thing you just buy and the outcome is random
Each weapon is different and has a different use and great ways to make combos with
You can either play good to finish, play dirty team killing, or see who can reach the end first
Some levels however relies on teamwork cant afford to be selfish there
With this ADORABLE looking graphics and soundtracks fun can never end, They made it even more fun by making Level Editor to make your own levels/playlists of levels, arenas or whatever the hell you want to make
Steam workshop was definitely a great feature for the steam version
THIS Game has the FUNNIEST STORY I have ever seen in a video game, Every Cut scene you will be a FOOL to skip it because its just 
 too 
 funny and perfect with that amazing narrator
its sad that they asked that no one posts a review or livestream or a video while on beta, but everyone did anyway 
 and so i tried to make this review as resourceful as possible, so people would actually get a clue of what this game is if they never heard of it before or was wondering about it
This game is worth every penny, watch some youtube commentary videos on its gameplay and decide for yourself :)A Few updates
they keep adding some special faces you can get by finishing every once and a while so its cooland for summer sales people are wondering if the game is worth playing just for singleplayer yes , i have maybe 20 hours stored only singleplayer playing this wonderful game alone is also fun and the levels changes when you play singleplayer to be set to solo mode ( Makes it possible to do everything solo ) and in multiplayer they are set for double so you need someone else to help you finish the level or you can also use the weapons to do it alone if you're good enough with them
So yeah its pretty much fun singleplayer grinding for faces and achievements is always fun : )hopefully you'll make the right choice and buy this and make sure you have friends to play with its more fun that way

You know that point when you are mentally exhausted or slaphappy or a teenager
That's usually when you want shut your brain off and play something amusing and stupid
If you can find a buddy in a similar state, play this game together
The trick to enjoying this game is to not take it seriously
Learn to enjoy killing and being killed
If you can pull that off, you will laugh until you cry
Play for about an hour or so and then quit
Come back another day when you both are out of it again
Then just repeat this cycle
If you don't enjoy poop jokes, stay away
If blowing youself up again and again makes you smile, this is the game for you

Once upon a time, in the land of Colorado,I was very bored, in fact I was just staring at my own shadow
That was until, my friend named DT,Said he had found the perfect game for me
"It's called BattleBlock Theater" he said as if he was the creatorAnd I replied, "Eh, I'll look at it later
"Soon later came, and I said with a sigh,"Let's get this over with so I can finish my pie
"After watching the two trailers, my mind was blown
Buying this game, I shall not postpone
I clicked the "Buy Game" button on the internet,and I zoomed through the PayPal process which is actually quite intricate
I waited for nothing and immediately installed,An adventure that assured I would soon be enthralled
Soon enough it was done, and I double-clicked on its name,Waiting impatiently for my brand new game
And just like that I was playing away
Staring deeply into my monitor's display
I was jumping, punching, and boating through any kind of weather,And best of all, me and DT were doing it together
So, I urge you to get out your money,And pay for this game whose humor is funny
I promise you, if you buy this you will not be disappointAs this game is amazing to no defined point

Amazing game
 I honestly wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was, despite being a good fan of Castle Crashers
The videos of it didn't look too terribly interesting, but lemme tell ya
 This is definitely a game worth picking up
 This game actually has much smoother framerate than the previous The Behemoth release on steam, Castle Crashers
 It runs without a hitch, and without a framerate cap
I thought the voice acting of one of my personal vocal heroes was top-notch
 (Definitely left a "stamp"
 Dohohohoho
) The jokes were often corny, but it was tightly written in kind of a "I know this writing is bad, so I might as well go all out" kind of way
Posted: 24 May, 2015
This game made me realize that my friend is incredibly stupid
Posted: 23 June
Product received for free
This game has some of the best comedy that I've heard all vocalized by Stamper
 The gameplay is exhilarating as you run through these obstacle courses set up by devious cats
 The thing that makes this game the most fun is playing on hard mode where the most will come out of you as a player and even though it can be annoying or tough, it's what makes the BattleBlock Theater experience better
 Also, I would like to add, even though I have little time played on steam, I have owned this game on the Xbox 360 for years, and I could still come back to it and play it again

Loved this game, got all the ships and most of the achievements, but after beating it on highest difficulty in Advanced mode, can't bring myself to replay it for one reason alone: I will never get a win against the boss like that again
 All but one crew member had died, my ship was boarded by the enemy, my last crew member was mind controlled, every room had a breach, oxygen was gone, and all remaining power was diverted to the single weapon firing on automatic that was being destroyed by my last, dying crewmember, which would also be enough to finish my ship off
 Just before it broke, my crew member came back under my control, long enough to allow the weapon to fire one last time
 My missle hit half a second before the rebel flagship salvo slammed into my ship
 It was enough
 My ship and the rebel flag both exploded simultaneously as the credits of victory started up
 I can't top that
 Ever

There's nothing like the feeling when a game which wasn't even on your radar comes along, completely blows you away and reminds you why you love this hobby very dearly
 And that's paramount
 Even the best of us lose our faith sometimes
 Faster Than Light is one of those games that comes out of nowhere and makes you a believer again
 It is a testament to the brilliance of design over budget and as such is a shining beacon of this medium
In Faster Than Light, the player takes on the role of a starship captain whose singular goal is to defend the Federation from a rebel threat
 The concept is simple, you have to make it through seven grueling sectors to face the mammoth rebel flagship which will mercilessly put your nerves and skill to the test
 It employs tough but fair school of design in which you will dearly pay for every single mistake you make, no matter how small
 You may not even realize your mistake until it is too late
You start with a barebones crew and equipment which you'll want to heavily upgrade by the time you reach the end
 You'll achieve that by travelling through the galaxy, doing quests, fighting or aiding other ships or just buying whatever you can afford
 This is a roguelike so every playthrough is completely different with randomized quests and loot drops
 Sometimes you may feel slighted by the item drops or the difficult situations you find yourself in, but almost every piece of equipment is useful in some way and there's almost always a way out of a sticky situation
 Being a roguelike also means that if you die, you have to start all over again
 The sense of urgency is further heightened by the oncoming rebel fleet which won't allow you to roam the galaxy however you wish
 Absolutely everything in Faster Than Light is subject to careful forethought and planning, otherwise you might just back yourself into a corner
As the ship's captain, it is your duty to take care of absolutely everything that goes on your ship, the design is meticulously detailed
 You have absolute control over a variety of systems including engines, shields, weapons, medbay, oxygen supply, helm, sensors, even doors
 You also control every single crewmember
 There are different races in the game and each specializes in a certain trait (except for humans)
 For example, Engis repair damaged systems faster, the Rock are immune to fire whereas the Mantis are great for ship intruders
This all might sound overwhelming and there's actually a lot more various nuances to talk about here, but the tutorial is fantastic and you'll get the hang of the game quickly
 This is a classic case of easy to learn, difficult to master
The universe in Faster Than Light is pretty basic, it borrows liberally from various other sci-fi sources
 Nevertheless, it is expertly put together
 It is a very believable universe in which you'll learn about what's going on mostly through direct gameplay when interacting with other races and factions
The Advanced Edition adds more content to the game most notably a new race with a new ship, fantastic new weapons and new upgrades such as mind control, cloning bay and hacking
 The completely free expansion fleshes out the universe even further, but much more importantly it adds a myriad of new combinations of tactics that are at your disposal
Faster Than Light is an exceptional work of game design
 Its biggest accomplishment, which so few games manage to pull off, is that it draws you in, hooks you and never lets go
 It is extremely addictive, even when you lose horribly and quit the game, all it takes is a few seconds and you're thinking about what you could've done differently and what tactics you will use next time you fire it up
 And then you click play
 Again

Dark Souls came home drunk again
 It was the third time this week
 By now The Oregon Trail had grown used to such tumultuous behavior, even on a nightly basis
 He stumbled through the doorway hollering about some curse of the undead
 The Oregon Trail, keen on diffusing such situations, offered Dark Souls a place on the bed and a glass of estus
 "Would you like something to eat
" she asked
 "We took down a bison today
" He shook his head and took her hand
 "You are so beautiful
 Did you know that
" The Oregon Trail blushed
 After all these years he still had his charms about him
 "The first flame may be dying, but I want you to know that your flame is always lit in my heart
" She caressed his face
 There was no denying that he was a one-of-a-kind gaming experience
 His atmosphere, striking; his storytelling, excellent; not to mention his combat, addictive and unique
 The Oregon Trail blew out the candle and pressed SPACE BAR to continue
 Nine months later FTL was born
Posted: 25 November, 2013
An amazing spectacle for the avid strategy gamer
 FTL: Faster Than Light is a beautifully crafted, well-written space strategy game that consistently builds on it's gameplay, and writing
 It constantly gives you a feel of tension and suspense as you fight off rebel reinforcements with your last missile while opening your airlock to extinguish fires, then sending your alien mantis-like crew members to attack oncoming pirate boarders
 It gets you thinking and on your toes all the time and I would definitely recommend this awesome space strategy to anyone

One of the most fun little games I have played in a long time
 Frustrating in places, and yet always an entertaining journey
The game has a massive random element to it, and even on normal difficulty can be frustratingly hard
 You will need to play well AND get lucky, but the feeling you get when you finally beat the game with each cruiser is hard to describe 
 relief and epic joy would be the best way to sum it up
Worth every penny, but be warned: This game can be addictive and you may lose a few nights sleep as you lose track of time and say 'Just one more sector'

Do you like
Brutally slaughtering your friends to get a kiss
 Making people explode
 Poop jokes
 General hilarity
 Sandwiches that not only taste great, but also are packed with steriods
If you answered yes to any of these questions then this game is for you In short
castle crashers is a medieval hack and slash adventure which you can play by yourself or with up to 3 friends (Four player Co-op)
 It possesses an amazing cast of unlockable characters, enough stupid moments to last a decade, and cartoony graphics which will never get old
Have Fun
9/10

There is a deer propelled by its own feces in this game
 Strongly recommended
Posted: 26 November, 2013
Introduction:Castle Crashers was my personal favorite Xbox Live Arcade game when it was first released back in 2008
 The Behemoth continued to give this game more life with it's DLC of character's that had unique abilities, animal orbs that would accompany you throughout the game, and weapons that would improve your character's growth (or vice versa if you are looking for a challenge)
 The game was later ported to the Playstation Network with exclusive mini-games in 2010
 Castle Crashers eventually was ported onto Steam, but was ported badly onto PC on launch; however, the game was redeemed to be fun and playable again after The Behemoth made necessary updates
 Verdict:This title is a hack and slash RPG, and has been widely recieved by many gamers who appreciate the genre (even those who don't)
 The game can feel a bit tedious at times, but as you level your character(s) the gameplay will feel slightly different before it tends to get repetitive once again
 However, the game keeps the game fresh upon every level with unique scenary, opponents, and even jokes
 If you plan on purchasing this title it's obviously more fun to play it with friends then it is with complete strangers, so try to convince your friends (and if they've convinced you to buy it listen to them)
 Completing the title will be a mission, but personally I think that's half the fun of trying to unlock every single character, find every animal orb and weapons
 Give this game a try by downloading the demo
 If you find the game a bit pricey than wait for a discount (or a Humble Indie Bundle that has this game packaged with it)
Posted: 17 August, 2015
Summary (TL;DR)This is by far one of the best purchases I've ever made on Steam
I'm very pleased with this game, the gameplay is fun, and this game makes you want to play with others
It's about 6-8 hours of gameplay per character, and there are plenty of characters to choose from
If this game is on sale, be sure to grab it
You will not be dissapointed
Pros DLC goes to charity Fun co-operative play Decent sized storyline Original graphic style Many unlockable characters Large selection of weapons Many pets which give different advantages Controller Support Steam Trading Cards Fun soundtrack Pays homage to The Behemoth's "Alien Hominid" and "Battle Block Theater" Very well pricedCons Very difficult solo No drop in/out system for online games Online games occasionally have connection issues
Rating10/10
Posted: 25 November, 2013
A great game to play with a room full of friends, a pizza, and some drinks
 The game is decent by itself, but with friends in a local coop setting, it's wonderful
 The game is mostly you verses monsters, but occasionally you have to duke it out amongst yourselves for the hand of a lovely maiden
 It has wonderful items, and challenging gameplay
 I'd highly recommend picking up a 4-pack on sale to play with your buddies some time

Played it on the Xbox, played it on PC and still love it
Best played with friends

// Castle Crashers a 2D Platform Indie Beat 'em Up : //// Schuitje82 - Extended Review //About this game:=============I really enjoy this game from the beginning when it came out on another platform
It has a super great and funny story line that makes this one great adventure
Graphics looks amazing and the themes are well through of
You play through the levels to save the 4 princesses from the evil kings
This may sound a bit boring 
 but on the contrary, the game has a very nice story
You bash and shoot your way through levels and woop everything in your way
Discover new land, animals, weapons and much much more
 Core Gameplay:============You can choose in the beginning the 4 basic characters from the game
These are Fire, Toxic, Ice and Electric Castle Crashers
All of these have there own special powers you can throw at your enemies
You have a level up system so that makes it extra addicting to play this game
And you can choice how you like to upgrade you character as you wish
You give more points to magic you will unlock new skills
Or try to be strong as the hulk and
place the points on strength
You can discover new animals they will give you more power health, XP or just
find things for you
After all these finding animals and leveling your character
You can also find new weapons and give this a extra twist to your character
What is cool about every weapon is that it haves his own stats that will give you sometime extra like, speed, strength or magic powers so an extra advantage to you character so it’s not about the weapons looks it’s what stats you will need because of the play style you choose
Overall:======This games has some amazing soundtracks and levels

Castle Crashers is a 2D beat 'em up with some RPG elements
 I'd heard a lot of people talk it up and even tried the demo before deciding to get this bad boy when it was on sale for Halloween
 You get four characters to choose from, so you can potentially play a 1-4 player game right out of the gate
 Each character has their own starting weapon, magical element, and appearance
 You go through levels beating up bad guys and trying to save princesses
 Along the way, you'll find some cool weapons and animal orbs that give you special perks, You can switch between them between levels by visiting the blacksmith
 I don't typically enjoy beat 'em ups
 They tend to get stale and boring, despite how many combos or different weapons the game wants to throw my way
 But Castle Crashers adds in some RPG elements to keep it interesting
 Sure, the different weapons, different characters with their magic, and different animal buddies all add some customization, but the leveling system is what truly gives this game replayability and a sense of progression
 Upon leveling up, you'll gain points that can be put into any of the four stats you have, strength, defense, magic, and agility
 Depending on what kind of playstyle you want to use or what role you have on the team, you can build accordingly
 Do you want to focus on one or two stats
 Or would you rather be more well rounded
 How will you compliment your teammates
 Or what is best for solo play
 It gives some complexity to the otherwise simple concept, which is great
 The ability to play locally, cooperatively, or solo is nice for varied options and experiences
 Essentially, each character you use equals one campaign
 And there are a lot of unlockable characters, so this game does have a lot of replayability and lifespan
 I also like the simple cartoony art style and some of the music is pretty cool
 The main game with single and multiplayer, insane mode, two mini games, achievements, there's a lot of hours to be had with this title
 However, I DO need to point out a few flaws in the game
 Castle Crashers is a game of diminishing returns
 When you start, there's lots of new and exciting things to keep you hooked
 New characters, new weapons, new animal buddies, new secondary items, new levels, and a blank slate to upgrage how you see fit
 But after a while
 it loses its luster
 There are only so many characters, items, animal buddies, weapons, and levels in the game
 Your upgrades get harder and harder to improve as the game goes on and you will start to gain less points per level
 You max out at 78 and from then on it's very little change between levels
 Insane mode, aside from a few exceptions, is basically the same as the normal game
 excpet enemies take longer to kill and can kill you faster
 More frustrating and time consuming than an increase in challenge
 Also, the online isn't always the best
 It depends on game settings, connection speeds, and the locations of the players for sure, but laggy games can be tough to get through, especially in crucial moments the requre precision
 Not to mention that when the game literally has to stop and wait for the other players, it can get very annoying and tiresome
 So I'd recommend finding people close enough for online, or simply doing local play if you're going to do multiplayer
I like Castle Crashers
 Sure, it has diminishing returns, and if you want to complete it with everyone at maximum everything
 you'll be playing longer than you enjoy
 But playing in moderation, trying to win rather than max everything, playing with other people
 all of this can easily extend the playtime of the game while keeping it fun
 Is it worth $15
 Well
 it really depends
 If you like beat 'em ups a lot, then probably
 Try out the demo and gauge your excitement
 I'd say this game is probably worth about $10 generally, and when it goes on sale it tends to be cheaper anyway, so definitely go for it
 I'd give Castle Crashers a solid 7/10
 A good game, great for fans of beat 'em ups, but still alright for people who don't much care for them as well
 I'm sure I'll get lots of hours in this game over the years, and you might too

Go ahead and try to find something to criticize about this game
 Maybe graphics scalability
 Can you even be offended at that
 The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail
 Don't quote me on that one
 Most systems out there can run this game no problem
 If they are Windows systems
Maybe the friend requirement
 Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience
 The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people
 How many games are like that
Lack of voice chat feature
 The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue
Lack of netcode
 The design of the game makes this irrelevant
 You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game
Frustration
 You can pick up or close the game at any time
 Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health
 It's far less frustrating or "cheap" than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2
 Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort
 In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game
Brevity
 This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place
 Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2
9 * 10^11) variations
 It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation
Cost
 It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket
 I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference
Keep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game
 Even if you're never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example
 After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment
 Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15
 Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation
 If you said yes, it's time to buy

-I get in a skype call with a friend
-Tell him I need help defusing a bomb
-Friend instantly says: "Lets go
"-We start solving through each module
-We got stuck on a maze
-Finished the maze
-10 seconds left until utter doom
-Randomly cut a red wire
-Bomb defused
-We feel like heros
-My inner Counter-Strike has been released
 10/10 But on a more serious note,
this game is a blast to play with a friend or two, and is quite an adrenaline rush

THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1
3 Starbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy
 From playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy
 Pros + Unique art style + Infinite procedurally generated universe + Creative alien races that are completely customizable + Pets unique to each race + A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero + Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials + Mining and harvesting isn't a grind + Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator + Devs constantly working to update and add new features + Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization + Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race + An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable
 Exploration is necessary to advance upon it, is unique to each race, and customizable to each player + Crew members can be added to your ship, but I'll say more later + Your own space station can be created for players and NPCs to visit + You can create and fully cutomize a mech to fly through space and stomp along the ground + You can visit and trade inside of other space stations full of NPCs / other players + You can create colonies for NPCs to live in + Treasures can be discovered pretty much anywhere + Tech can give you powers like dashing, jumping, and morphing into a ball + The bosses get harder and are all quite cleverly created + The quests link into the web of connections that advance your tech, systems, and story + Moddable in any way you like, from the intro scene to Robbie Rotten's clothes + Vehicles such as hover bikes and boats are available
 + Port forwarding isn't required to host games, your friends can join you through Steam at any time + Tiny easter eggs and hints from the devs can be found throughout the game + It's fairly cheap price-wise, I mean it's a fourth of No Man's Sky and four hundred times better + The soundtrack is beautiful and has brought tears to my eyes more times than I'd like to admit + So many possibilities that can lead to my 700 plus hours on this game Neutralities ~ The universe doesn't feel losslessly empty and gigantic, it's fairly easy to get from star to star ~ Life is extremely abundant ~ 2D and pixelated; the graphics aren't 'next gen' Cons - You can't customize the exterior of your ship - Crew members are a little dumb AI-wise and not extremely useful - It's a bit slow paced, which a lot people don't like
because they all are stupid and get bored way too fast and don't have the drive to actually work for anything
but I love it
 TL;DR * It's a great space exporation game with a web of slow-ish paced advancement that's extremeley wide in possibilites and customization
* Much of the game is unique, including the races, planets, stars, and generated structures
 * If you don't like it, you probably don't like space games :p

For people who like story, or fast, reaction-based gameplay, this game isnt for you
With over 200 hours on this game, i have come to a conclusion
 You don't play this game for the end goal of saving the universe
 you play this game for the journey it takes you on
 I realised this when I was playing with friends, and we where doing nothing but sitting around a campfire on logs playing music on our instruments that this was my favroite game
 If a game can make sitting around a campfire an experience that is memorable, it has to be doing something right
10/10, hands down
Posted: 24 May
More Than Just Terraria In SpaceI was initially attracted to Starbound because it looked like Terraria in space
 This was appealing to me because I love Terraria – I presently have over 290 hours in that game – and I love science fiction
 After 100 hours of playing Starbound, I came to the realization that despite their surface similarities, Starbound and Terraria have subtle and not-so-subtle differences which distinguish between the two games
Starbound focuses more on completing quests and uses procedural generation more extensively
 It also is more of a survival game than Terraria is – on survival and hardcore difficulties, your character must eat to survive
 While both games have exploration and combat mechanics, Starbound tends to be more focused on exploration and less on combat, as most weapons are found in chests distributed across the surfaces and caverns of planets rather than dropped by enemies
PositiveThe boss fights are enjoyable
 Furthermore, after you complete the campaign, you gain access to a repeatable dungeon with a procedurally-generated boss, Building is easier in Starbound than Terraria due to the ability to place back walls without having to craft them from blocks – instead, you simply right click while holding a block to place a background wall
 There are also a wide variety of block types and objects to build with, allowing the construction of interesting towns and villages
Multiplayer games are exceptionally easy to set up
 Starbound supports Steam’s “join game” feature
 Furthermore, the multiplayer games are very stable – I have accumulated most of my 100 hours in multiplayer, and only noticed one significant bug, namely a villager side quest which could only be accepted by one player (With the introduction of 1
3, I have noticed an uptick in the number of bugs in my multiplayer game
 The bugs don't seem to be multiplayer specific and appear to be limited to a handful of players, but I thought them worthy of mention)
Starbound features Steam Workshop support and a massive array of mods - over 2,600 workshop items are available for the game at present
The pixel art is good
 While aesthetic is highly subjective, I find Starbound to be a better-looking game than Terraria
Starbound’s soundtrack is, to my untrained ear, quite good
 It is also fairly extensive – there are several hours of music to enjoy
 In the endgame, it is possible to upgrade lower tier legendary weapons (a group of weapons which were designed by hand rather than randomly generated) to tier 6, the highest tier of weapons available
 If you particularly enjoy using one of the lower-tier legendary weapons, you don’t have to permanently relegate it to the shelf when more powerful equipment comes along
NegativeMovement in Starbound is less satisfying than in Terraria due to the lack of an equivalent to the later game's wings
 This is an issue given that a large portion of the game consists of travesing alien landscapes in search of a village or dungeon
 I often wished that I could simply fly over a pool of lava rather than building a bridge over it
 While this is the only major omission in the movement catagory, it is a rather glaring one
 Starbound has some of the worst side quests I’ve ever seen, and I played the original Mass Effect
 While the handful of handcrafted side quests in the game are fine, the quests given by villagers and colonists are awful
 The quests are randomly generated and fall into only a handful of preset mission types
 The messenger quests are especially annoying, requiring the player to carry notes between two NPCs standing 5 feet apart
 The other quests aren’t quite as bad, but the lack of quest variety quickly leads to them becoming repetitive
Crewmembers seem like an afterthought
 In my experience, medics and chemists give their respective bonuses so rarely when outside the ship that they are mostly only useful as combat support
 Furthermore, engineers and mechanics are hilariously broken
 Mechanics can increase fuel capacity infinitely, while engineers can increase fuel efficiency to the point that you can fly across the galaxy on zero fuel, behavior that was presumably unintended (fixed in update 1
3)
Some of the achievements require an insane amount of grinding
 The worst offender is the Destroyer of Worlds achievement, which would take tens of hours of nonstop mining to achieve legitimately
 Neutral“Serviceable” is the best way to describe Starbound’s story
 The game has a hackneyed “collect ancient artifacts to save the world” plot, the characters are memorable, but don’t get much character development, and the campaign consists of only 8 missions including the tutorial
 This is forgivable given that the story isn’t Starbound’s focus
 Ultimately, Starbound is a sandbox game, not a JRPG
The cost of randomly generating ordinary weapons is that they are far less interesting than some of the insane weapons found in Terraria
 The inclusion of secondary attacks helps somewhat in differentiating between weapons, but I still found myself deciding which weapon to use by calculating DPS
 Fortunately, there are a fairly large number of handcrafted legendary weapons
If you somehow didn’t like Terraria, you probably won’t enjoy Starbound
 While Starbound tries to differentiate itself with its focus on questing and sci fi setting, its gameplay is like that of the game that inspired it
 However, if you enjoyed Terraria and are looking for a similar game with just enough alterations to the formula to justify its existence, Starbound is the game for you

Starbound, short and sweet it's a great game
 But here are the very long reasons why: (
Paragraphs in order: Storyline, Gameplay, Graphics, Setting and mods
) STORYLINE In starbound, you play as a character of any of the six races about to graduate to a protector
 This is stopped by a violent and mysterious force, which coerces you to escape in the first ship you find
 As you look to repair your ship you are pulled into a rope of interesting and exciting quests to see what parts of the universe you can salvage before the same violent force rips it apart, just like it did to your home planet
 PROS:
Allows you to get a sandbox experience without feeling forced to do the story (there are ways to skip it) Feels complete when you're done, main story line may end, but there are always tonnes of sidequests
 Easy to follow along if you don't take long breaks
CONS:
Low curve, would appreciate more action spread through the scavenging of artifacts
 My ideal would be adding more minibosses
GAMEPLAY Although it may seem daunting with all the crafting and vague mission information at first, it is not
 A general idea is to get your ship furnished before doing the missions
 Get some understanding of the crafting and the traveling
 Generally, looking at the
starbound
wikia
com
helps you with missions and obtaining items
 The gameplay can shift between serene and action filled based completely on what the player wants
 The serenity and action are respectively accompanied by multiple factors such as the music or dialogue
 For the calmer experience, there is farming, cooking, building spectacular monuments, fishing and looking for easter eggs and pop culture references (which are spread out very frequently)
 As soon as you want action, you could do some hunting, exploring or doing missions in both the main storyline and ones you find in the settlements on the planets
 The quests are also rewarding, with some giving gift bags and others offering to join your crew on your ship
 The boss battles in this game are exciting and suits both casual and hardcore players, depending on how fast you decide to go through the story
 The combat is smooth and is changeable depending on the players choice of weapons and armour
the most important part, however
is the free and easy multiplayer
 You can play with friends through dedicated servers or through the steam overlay
join game feature PROS:
Everything is fun, there is really not a whole lot of grinding for items or currency
 during mining, for instance, the game throws dungeons and new underground biomes at you to keep it interesting
 Everything is a way to progress
 After some calm farming you could sell the crops to progress, if you want, you can make food with the ingredients that can help you with different effects
Combat is very good and easily fits any player
CONS:
Some derpy issues such as settlement guards attacking you because their houses get striked by meteors
 GRAPHICS
"pixely" graphics remind many of terraria, but the graphics designers have really done well, seeing as there are so many branches of weapons and clothes from all races and all different weapons, magical, firearms, spears, chakrams, you name it
 Everything is very varied and all the mobs are very visually adapted to their biomes and planets
 The bosses do a good job of showing their origins and the attacks fit their visuals
 PROS:
Modern but nostalgic Well varied Items and furniture convey their origins and use
CONS:
Not a whole lot of underwhelming weapons that allow the legendaries to stand out
 They took away the feature of mobs having different colors depending on their planets to give slight notability to a seemingly average poptop or gleap
SETTING
The setting can change depending on choice
 Staying on a planet is accompanied by one of twelve songs by day and sixteen by night
 Many who play this game, including me, love the music and it fits to different parts of everyday life
 My personal favorite way to listen is through the title screen, but I know I should already have bought the OST on steam
 In the game, during bossfights, there are nostalgic feeling battle-music that really sets you into the idea that your character is in danger
 PROS:
Amazing music that fits a serene or action-filled gameplay
 The immersion is helped so much by music
 CONS:
It's hard to get around to buying a five euro soundtrack
MODS When you feel like you have completed everything you wish to have completed in starbound but crave more, fear not
 There are hundreds of free mods to enrich your experience, post main-missions and during them
 A noteable one is called
"
frackin universe
" The megamod is generally the biggest mod in all of starbound and adds dozens of new biomes and monsters along with hundreds of weapons, armors, tools, items and microdungeons
 It also adds a whole new quest hub and a massive eldritch dungeon to explore
 There are also things to help you collect things
you would normally have to work a bit harder for and very much more content
 It feels like an entirely new game
 Oh and did I mention
 the mods are free
SUMMARY
Addictive game with smooth combat, interchangeable setting, easy multiplayer, cute graphics and free mods, some of which completely renew the game, to multiply the replay value tenfold
 I have over two hundred (I know, casual hours) in this game and I don't plan on stopping, seeing as I have only slightly dipped my toes into the "frackin' universe" mod
 9
5/10
Would definately recommend if you are willing to get past a slightly slow early game

Early Access Review
You don't have to wear pants in this game
11/10
Posted: 24 July, 2016
See my hours
 I know this game, and i know that i say it's by no reach a perfect game or a horrible one
Congrats Chucklefish, if i could give a neutral review i would, consider this a close passmark of a release and even though this review is positive i'm still going to lay it down on you
After spending years in early access most people assumed it would never be released and that the devs abandoned, they didn't and in fact were actively working on it throughout the time it was in early access
 Their only major falter was the lack of finalized updates
 I would by lying if i said i didn't at least once or twice feel angry or ripped off by Chucklefish
 After all its not the money we paid, but the promises we paid for
 Development is slow, very slow
PROS:+You will probably spend at least 100> hours exploring and getting your gameplays worth
+Can capture any monster you find on a planet and use it as a pet (yes, its like Pokemon, but in space)
+Procedurally generated weapons, very good ones too, you will be surprised at the variety of attacks and designs
+Building is easy, wiring is easy, painting is easy and there are hundreds upon hundreds of different blocks and decorations
+7 Starter races that are diverse and unique
+Modding support for this game is well maintained
+(near) Infinite planets that never have the same two types of monster or buildings
+Multiplayer through steam, easy to connect via the client (can be very laggy)
+Professions are chosen by the player, you can play how you want HOWEVER some professions are blatantly more fun or better than others
 The Farmer will never have that awesome shotgun the explorer does or the armor the miner has
+OST is amazing +Active devs, who also listen a fair bit to the community
 Might even find them in the Discord or IIRC
+Customizability is insane, akin to Terraria's system (including dyes and social slots)
+Liquid and Light dynamics are "realistic"+Supports 
ABC Files (You can play actual music in game from websites such as LOTRO)+Boss fights are unique-ishSEMICONS: (Things that the devs are likely to fix soon, or will fix eventually, or may not be encountered by everyone)+/- Can feel a bit solitary, especially in singleplayer+/- Game is unoptimized and crashes on startup occasionally+/- Mods are sometimes undetected by the game alltogether and you might have to restart multiple times to get them working+/- Obligatory semicon about the bugs and rush to 1
0CONS:- AI can be pretty stupid- The story is average, and cuts off pretty quickly with very little relevance late game
- Some significant unbalance in both the bosses and weapons
 (For their level, some are incredibly weak or easy, or very hard/OP)- The tutorial explains gameplay fundamentals but lacks out some smaller things that people might miss- APPLIES MAINLY TO BETA PLAYERS: If you played in beta, you will notice that a lot of content is totally gone or inconsistent, especially in tiered species weapons and the story bosses
Posted: 5 June
Although it gets boring fast if you're alone,add in a few mods like Frackin' Universe,get a friend or two to play with you and you're really going to enjoy the game,I'd give it a 9/10
Posted: 23 January
EDIT: damn, top of the list
 i hope this changes something
EDIT2: got sick of people misinterpreting the reference to No Man's Sky, so i removed it
 sorry
1
3 edit: basically only modified the lategame, base gameplay is still mechanically brokenDon't let the negative rating fool you - I don't hate this game, I just don't like what it's become
TL;DR Loved Koala, don't like Giraffe
 Generic environments with generic dungeons and towns, repetitive and boring combat, shoehorned and unengaging story gates your progress constantly
Let me start this review off with a little nostalgia from my first experiences with the game
 I played - and loved - the Koala builds
 Every planet was different, with different creatures and different landscapes and colours
 It was nice
 I didn't know what I was going into, and that was great because each experience was a new one
However, I feel the direction the game's taken is downwards
 Planets are now segregated into different types, and each one has essentially the same thing to expect
A lush planet has a mine and some ruins
 A forest planet has a swamp and some frogs, maybe a few Avians
 A snow planet has llamas and some monkeys
This happens again and again and again, and while the terrain is varied and gives a hint of adventure to the "exploration", seeing the same rebel camp or monster-filled mine or generic temple over and over again gets boring, fast
 Seriously, on every planet, you'll be sure to find the same thing in a different shape
This is a weakness that demonstrates itself in spades when you begin to actually explore the universe
Additionally, there's the problem of the combat system
 Throughout the course of your exploration, you're constantly thrown the same preset enemy with the same preset fly-towards-you-and-do-damage-on-contact tactic
 (I'm exaggerating here, but still, there is a shameless amount of monsters which simply run, hop or fly at you and deal damage as soon as they touch you
)More creatures with mechanics like the Poptop, who come at you slow but do a lot of damage when they charge, would be a lot more fun, and would make the fighting more engaging than "this creature runs at you and mobs you until you die, kill it"
There is so much more that could be done with the system, and it shows with the complexity and variety of weaponry in the game, but the way that every monster attacks you is insultingly and unfittingly simplistic
 It's also annoying to get cheap-killed on a regular basis, and degrades the gameplay significantly when it literally starts punishing you for daring to venture from your house on your starting planet
Finally, there's the problem of the story being shoehorned into everything you do
 I don't know about you, but I play Starbound to build pretty things and venture out into the unknown
 Unfortunately, the game forces you into the shoes of a superhero, and it constantly rubs me the wrong way
I couldn't give half a damn about the fate of the universe
 I play this game to build and chill out
 Maybe that's an incredibly shallow way to play a game, but it's just the way I play
 Unfortunately, the way the devs have implemented the story is annoying and broken, disallowing you to actually explore, instead holding your hand like a gameplay-long tutorial level
I don't care for the story because it's inconvenient and slow to work through, gating your progress while never bothering to actually engage you outside of "save the universe from Cthulu"
I don't think there's any more that I can say other than please, for the love of God, Chucklefish
 Make the worlds more wild and varied
 Add more building configurations
 Make some biomes NOT spawn buildings as often - people don't need to live everywhere
 Reduce the spawn rates of your preset creatures and work on the combat - it's boring and it starts to grate after a while
And, please, make the story optional
 It's so painfully linear and shallow that it feels like I'm trying to read a children's book than play a game
Please make this game fun again
 I'm starting to get sick of installing mods and turning off monster spawning just to have a nice time
ADDENDUM:About two weeks of experience with the game later, and my opinion hasn't changed - though I can certainly list out some good aspects of the game:BASE BUILDINGThe wide range of blocks and items, and the option to have NPCs inhabit things you create, makes for a fun and relaxing to play
 My only gripe is that the interactions are far too shallow, and the radiant quests have a very, very limited range
MODDINGModding is absolutely amazing in this game, and is exactly as advertised
 While confusing and frustrating occasionally, modding is incredibly flexible and often instantaneously satisfying
Also, the ability to add mods to the game to flesh out your experience is rather pleasant
Unfortunately, it's the most fun I've had with the game thus far
If something passes my mind, I'll add it to this addendum
 I would have written something on the community but I currently don't know what I'd say on it

Starbound is everything that No Man's Sky isn't
Posted: 3 September, 2016
Playtime and Time/money I'd say about 60 hours of gameplay maximum for the state it's in now
 Thats what I spent on it while playing with 2 other friends doing absolutely everything
So even in that regard it's 25 cents an hour, which is absolutely fantastic
 Exactly what is this game
The good: This is starbound
 The game that it currently is, is a space themed, construction and survival exploration game
 Comparable to terraria, it has improved upon a lot of things from that such as the ability to use one block as a back wall and a forewall, there are more space related things like atmospheres (1) space creatures (2) space ships, a space story line etc
 There are planets to discover (3), theres progress to be made through building a colony and adventuring through planets (4), Plenty of fun to be had with interesting tech mechanics (5) a very large assortment of vanity goods, and a nice multiplayer experience
 The inventory feels not too full all the time as it is now catagorized into everything you need (such as an ore bag and a building materials bag etc), and it comes with a complete story which you'd have a hard time finding with such creative games (6)
 The Bad: The game is rather short with only 6 tiers of progression
You run around on planets and can easily move on to the next section by scraping the surface alone
The armor balance for players is slightly higher than the game seems to want, it's so mind numbingly easy that a toddler could sit around with a stimpack and a med kit and outheal any damage coming at them
It's so incredibly easy for other players to ruin the efforts of a server because the protection isnt in the game by default, in any way
The game will get extremely laggy for many players when there are too many entities in one area of a world
 (which should be something obvious, however I'm saying that it's taxing on higher end systems even)It will consume many of your hours doing simple things like building, or gathering a crew/upgrading your ship/mining
 (ok, this one isnt really bad, unless you hate that sort of thing
) The Unforgivable: this entire "the unforgivable" section will be gripes about features removed from the game, they will not impact you if you do not know about what was in the past
 I advise you to keep clear if you are fresh and have never had your hopes high for the game
As much as I don't want to say this, I feel as though it has to be said, the game has been stripped of features
 The justification for this is improved framerate, when honestly it is worse now
 So I cannot and will not let it go
 Lets start off with the numbers 1
 They removed the heating system, and the complexity of atmospheres from the game
 you now craft a survival pack that allows you to eventually traverse all territories, instead of how it was before, which was harsh and based on your selections
 While this choice for sure makes the game easier, it takes out the fun survival part of the difficulty
1a
 They also oversimplified the hazardous environments, so it doesnt matter if you take cover, or build a fire to stay warm, you will always be suffering the consequences of a planet, no matter where you are, if you don't have the correct survival pack
2
 They drastically reduced the randomness of creatures that spawn on planets, there are now a total of 3 major variants of creatures, large, small, and flying and are trash monsters who have no meaningful attacks
 There are now many pre generated creatures that inhabit every single planet in the game, and they are very common
 I hope you enjoy going to the same 20 planets over and over again
3
 unrelated to the creatures but stemming from the random generation, planets now are even genned the same, and the color of planets is only based on the planet you're going to, which you will find out are very limited in number, it's not a mystery of what you're getting anymore, you go to an ocean planet, you've seen them all, you go to a starter planet, you've seen them all etc
 the only thing that remains are the random dungeons generated in the planets themselves
4
 Adventuring is blindly easy, everything has been simplified down to looting all the surface boxes of a planet for "EXTREMELY RARE" matter manipulator upgrades and the ore the planet has that you want, along with tech tokens which allow you to buy whatever tech you want, never forcing you to try something out because it's your only option
 shrug5
 Techs
 oh my god techs
 They removed all the fun ones, removed all the flying ones, removed the mechs the cards and the interesting ones, and of course replaced the hazard protection ones with the survival pack
 somehow, they took the worst tech of them all (the nearly useless morphball) and made it worse AND a focus at the same time (they removed the bomb feature and gave it trashy mobility options) (also I say this as a fan and a person who tried implementing 2 high tunnels in my bases for fun
)The current state of techs involves head techs, body techs, and feet techs
 They are painful
 5a
 The morph ball is the head tech

Ok
 the game
 oh gosh, my tears, I can't hold it
 Because THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
 Here are the pros and cons (or not) for this game
The pros:+ Well-written and touching story about love, forgiveness and sacrifice
+ Beautifully hand-drawing, from characters to every detail of the environments
 (Too much clear water :)) )
+ Ahhh, musics to my ears
 It made me cry
+ Responsive control
 Nice
+ The platforming section is really well-executed, tricky gameplay
+ As the upgrade version of the original game, with more contents, more balance, more secrets,
 more grinding for the ability poinits
+ Now it has 4 difficulties, from Easy to One-life
 I hate one-life mode :))
+ A huge map with lots of exploration
+ There are parts of the game when it requires you to escape from certain death
 Well, It's time to ultilize your skills to get you through danger
+ This game reminded me of the game named "Cat Mario", the game which makes you suffer from falling, dying, danger at every corners
 RAGE
 :))
+ The game now is more compatible than the original one
+ The game is best example of Unity Engine Games that can run smoothly on low-end pc
+ No FPS drops
+ First playthrough with 340 deaths for finding EVERY SINGLE SECRET in hard mode, how bad could it be
 :))
 I bet that i will die even more if the game were bigger
+ Can you make a speed run from beginning to the end without using ability points, no death, under 3 hours in one-life mode
How long you guys can endure it
 :))
A MUST-HAVE GAME for anyone who want solid (with some trolling and surprise moments :)) ) and challenging gameplay with pure story-telling
 And I am still waiting for the sequel "Will of the Wisps"
 Oh boy, I cried even more when i watched the sequel trailer
 Amazing game to the end
_Epic Final Score: 10/10

Every now and then there's a game that changes the way you look at all types of games in the same genre
Take Witcher 3 for example, good RPGs are now bad because we now know that is possible to do better, MUCH better
For many of you this game will fly under your radar, many of you might even ended up here by mistake
 Whatever the reason i don't care just BUY this game
This is a masterpiece, this is the Witcher 3 of metroidvania 2D plataformers
The story is beyond good, is beautiful, it'll break your heart and make you smile, it wont bore you and it has enough to keep you engaged
The MUSIC
 The music in this game has life, it tells a story in it self, without a word you can understand the world around you, it whispers in your ear, never yells, it tells you a secret for you to keep
The art style is stuff of dreams, the color palette is vybrant but also dull when it needs to be
 The hand drawn vistas and landscapes are worth the games price, just so you can bathe in how good this games looks
The controls are just good, and they have to be, because this game is HARD, it rewards acuracy and quick reflexes, have you got those
I died 422 times on my first playthrough and let me tell you, i'd die 422 more just hoping this game would be biggerThis IS the 2D plataformer to beat, this is more than a game is an EXPERIENCE
Posted: 12 June
This is an action platformer in the Metroid style
 As you explore areas you gain new abilities that allow access to previously unpassable ones
It plays as good as it looks - which, considering it looks phenomenally gorgeous, is no small feat
The controls are responsive, and the platforming gets nicely tricky (though not too frustrating)
 It also has several really cool "escape" setpieces that are just right for being challenging, and making great use of your skills
 You get the ability to slingshot yourself off of certain objects, which includes enemy projectiles, and these sequences make crazy use of that
 Mixed up also with various jumping / gliding / wall jumping bits that make them very exciting to do
 For a 2d platformer it really is quite thrilling when these setpieces kick off
It's an exceptional game mechanically, and hugely enjoyable - plus its also surprisingly hard on the highest difficulty, so represents a fairly big time to complete
There is a downside depending on your tastes - the story and music are pretty twee stuff, and the "voice acting" is just kiddyish gobbledygook
 But other than that its a very engaging, artistically stunning game, and I highly recommend it

If anyone ever told me a video game cannot be a piece of art, I would show them Ori and the Blind Forest (soon to be the Ori franchise)
Ori and the Blind Forest is one of few games that recieves very little negative attention (only notable negativity come from those complaining about the Definite Edition release)
 There is very little wrong with the game itself in terms of gameplay, glitches, and music
 The story itself is known for making even the toughest of men cry as well
 Everything in the game itself seems to come together and forge a masterpiece
The main gameplay of Ori and the Blind Forest is the platforming
 It features a unique respawn system I have not seen in any other game (though someone else may be able to name one), utilizing an ability to create a respawn point anywhere at the cost of energy
 This energy can also be used for a blast charge that can break some walls
 Respawning by itself needs strategy, deciding whether the energy could be used for a better cause or not
 Platforming itself isn't frame perfect like many say, the game was very responsive with the jumping and was never frustrating at any time
 This is one of few games where I had not one issue with the movement and controls
As for glitches in Ori and the Blind Forest, they are so few that you are highly unlikely to experience any in the entire thing
 You aren't going to be coming across a Spore: Galactic Adventures experience here, where you have to be purposefully avoiding things in order to prevent glitches
 The lack of game-breaking glitches is actually rather impressive
 Yes, there are some, though it appeared to me you have to be purposefully trying to cause them to occur
The art and music in Ori and the Blind Forest is the most notable thing in the whole game
 The music score by Gareth is incredible
 Once you hear the songs, with how emotional and fitting they are for the game, you could easily see as to why they recieved such praise
 The art design is incredibly unique compared to similar games as well
 It is a 2D game that looks and feels as gorgeous as a 3D game
 The backgrounds and foregrounds are utilized to their greatest potential, being able to see the antagonist, Kuro, flying at you from a distance to Gumo hiding in the foreground behind tall grass
 The two combined, art and music, end up creating a visual masterpiece that is incredibly pleasing to look at
 Despite how simple Ori's sprite appears to be, it is at the same time very detailed with the animation and look
 Everything in the game looks and moves like something that is alive
The final part of the game, the story, is known to make grown men cry
 While it isn't the most unique story when you first start, with Naru perishing and Ori going on a quest for 3 elements, it ends up becoming apparent as to why it is unique later on
 Gumo, Kuro, and even Naru end up making the story incredibly unique for many, many reasons
 Each character has a lot of backstory, and it is incredible how it is told without words
 Gumo, Naru, and Kuro are incredibly detailed and interesting to learn about despite how simplistic they appear to be
 We learn all about Ori throught the whole game, similar to Kuro
 Every character, even the dead ones, have so much thought and effort put into them that it shows what Moon Studios is capable of
Gameplay: 8/10 - It could do with better combat, but since the platforming was nailed incredibly well with the platforming being the main focus as well, the combat can easily be looked over
Soundtrack: 10/10 - This is the only soundtrack I can say I have never enjoyed more in my entire life
 Every song fits the scenario and changes the mood drastically
 Without the work Gareth did, Ori and the Blind Forest would not be so amazing
Art Design: 9/10 - The game looks and feels exactly like you are playing a painting
 The characters move and look like they are alive as well
 There is very little I could say bad about the art of Ori and the Blind Forest
Story: 8/10 - Every single character has a massive amount of thought put into them and has their entire story told without the need of text
 Even the least interesting character, Sein, is still incredibly interesting to think of
 Every character in the game has incredible amounts of story put into them and the game tells it without saying it directly
 What happens to Kuro, you have to piece together
 Why the ending is sad, you have to tell yourself as to why
 The character's stories are incredible, and the game might have been even better if it was even more focused on them as opposed to the elements Ori and Sein were searching for
Bugs/Glitches: 9/10 - While there will always be bugs, I did not experience a single one during my entire time playing the game
 I thought this was incredible, considering how buggy many games are today
 The game still has some glitches as expected, but the lack of any glitches that occur during the playthrough of it is astonishing
 They seemingly have to be activated purposefully
Overall: 9/10 - Ori and the Blind Forest is perhaps one of the greatest games I have ever had the chance to play
 I highly urge anyone who hasn't play Ori and the Blind Forest to do so
 With Will of the Wisps coming out soon, now would be the time to play the original masterpiece that began my new favorite franchise
 
Posted: 27 April, 2016
(Already played the original game
 => skip the first few paragraphs)Ori and the Blind Forest is a very beautiful metroidvania platformer
 It has won several awards for it's art and music
 The entire world is handcrafted and every area has a unique feel to it
 You play as Ori, a tiny being in a huge forest
 Your task is to restore the elements and restore balance in the forest of Nibel
 During your adventure, you will gain abilities and skills that give you access to previously unaccesible locations
The game has a unique save-system where you can place a checkpoint ("Soul Link") almost everywhere
 Are you stuck
 Create more savepoints
 Forget to save and die
 -- Too bad, you're going to have to do that all over again
 Besides that, the game allows you to pick skills from a skill tree that give you more freedom in how you want to play
 Want to explore, pick some of the exploration skills
 Need more fire power, pick a damage increasing skill
This game is an extended and improved version of Ori and the Blind Forest and is a stand-alone experience
 You do not need to play the original game first (the core game is the same)
Why buy this if you already own Ori and the Blind Forest
- New abilities that both change how you move around and change combat in a new way
- A large, optional, beautifully crafted and varied new area which tells Naru's backstory
 You need to backtrack to find it
- No more closed-off areas; Spirit Wells can be used to warp across the map and you will have access to every location, even after you finish the main storyline
- Difficulty scaling
 Was the original game too hard (or too easy)
 Try the new 'Easy', 'Hard' and 'Single Life' modes, each with their own leaderboards
- Behind the scenes content and concept art
- 7 new achievements to get
Like the original; probably best played with a Xbox 360/One controller, although not impossible to play on kb/m

Ori and the Blind Forest is one of the most visually stunning games out there right now
 Not only that, the storyline touches the heart and makes you feel the want to keep on playing
 Though the game may be tricky at some points and you may have to use your brains to figure it out, the game is a masterful piece of art
Posted: 3 December, 2016
I'm not a platformer fan but this is something else
Ori and the Blind Forest is what you call a masterpiece
 Every essential aspect of this game is perfect or at least close to that
Posted: 27 April, 2016
This game was already good
 Insanely good
 Unbelievably good in fact
 But now it's perfectLet me try to explain how the new areas look, if i even can
 The new areas are definitive (heh) proof that video games are indeed art
 This isn't even a game anymore
 This is a painting
 You are literally playing a painting
 Seriously,
Moon Studios went to WORK on this game
 If you walk over a leaf, the leaf moves
 If you step on a single blade of grass, it waves along back
 If you run across the ground, it glows in response
 The environment, the atmosphere, it's all perfect
 You could set steam to take a screenshot every 10 seconds
 The soundtrack to this game is hands down the best soundtrack for any game i will ever play
 Gareth Coker, you take a bow
 Even if you don't play video games, or don't have a computer, or anything you owe it to youself to listen to the soundtrack at least
 The Definitive edition expansion to the soundtrack is name your price
 GO DOWNLOAD IT
 Listen bud, you had better go download this game
 Yes, you
 Right now
 You're missing what will likely be one of the best game's you'll ever play if you dont
 
Posted: 2 July
I just finished my fist playthrough of this game, and I think it's become my favorite ever
I generally play action RPGs or just RPGs (souls series, witcher, elder scrolls, fallout etc
) and I've found some phenominal titles
But I've felt that every game I played up until now has been lacking something, for example, The Witcher 3's story and quests are fantastic, but the combat is sometimes clunky
The mechanics of the souls games are great, but you have to go out of your way and do research to figure out the story, which I've done, and still the stories haven't really grabbed me
Ori and the Blind Forest is as close to a perfect game as I have ever played
It has some really unique mechanics that all work beautifully, the story is bittersweet and wonderful, the music and artstyle are perfect for the game and its environments
In summary, this game is a work of art
I had one problem during the entirety of my 11 hour playthrough, which went through almost 100 percent of the map: I got stuck under a rock and had to quit out
That's it, that's the only thing approaching a glitch or a mistake I found
If this game is on sale, it's criminal not to buy it
If it's not on sale, it's still criminal not to buy it
This is the first game I've written a review for, because these developers deserve more attention for this masterpiece
Posted: 17 June
Early Access Review
So, Besiege
 This is a really unique game, and I'd really recommend it to a lot of people
 If you're deciding whether or not to buy this game, just spend 5 minutes on reading this review
Who should buy this game People, who look forward to playing a very fun physics-based sandbox game Gamers, who are interested in some kind of technic and war contraptions The creative ones, people who can find a thousand solutions to one taskWhy should I buy Besiege
 It's growing very quickly and is not abandoned, unlike a lot of Early Access games Very cheap as for the content that it gives you Enjoyable gameplay and graphics A ton of space for creativity The developers promised to add a multiplayer mode and a multiplayer level editor in late 2017
Below is a more detailed breakdown
GameplayGameplay is the main point of Besiege
 Just to list a few things off, this game provides you with a nice campaign (even though there are not so many levels yet, but every level has a ton of replayability potential)
 There are also a couple of sandbox maps
 The player is equipped with infinite amounts of different varieties of building blocks and elements
 There is literally everything, starting with a simple cube and going right to holders, pistons, different versions of cannons, bombs, wings and a lot of other stuff
 The best thing is that anything you will build will work and people have already came up with some really crazy ideas
 Ever wanted to create a huge flying carrier
 Or a machine that swings a giant hammer around itself, smashing everything to pieces
 You can basically do that
 Also, slow-motion is epic
GraphicsI like the graphics
 There is not much to say, but the visual style is pretty unique and is just enjoyable
 Fire, water, explosions, the machines themselves look great and organic
SoundThere is some nice ambient music that I really enjoy listening to
 The sounds produced by machines and structures are simply great
Sanbox-inessThis is not some kind of an official criteria, but I just wanted to mention how flexible Besiege really is
 First off, in any level (including the campaign ones), you are able to disable the small building box that limits you and build anything
 The sky is the limit (and your computers hardware, of course)
 There are quite a few cheats on the options panel, that can give you something like zero gravity or infinite ammo (most of the weapons fire only once or just can be held on for around 10 seconds)
 There are 3 large sandbox levels
 And, as I've already mentioned, a level editor and a full multiplayer system are coming in 2017 (well, hopefully in 2017
 The devs promised at least
)VerdictAs for a sandbox fan, it's pretty much a 10/10
 I would rate is as the best "wait, did this just really work
" simulator

So I gotta be completely honest here
This game is freaking beautiful
 The animation quality, texturing, modeling, and even the music are all fantastic
Even the menu for the levels is addictive in a way
 I'm actually HOPING they get around to finishing this because the framework of it is really astonishing
My only complaint is the lack of a tutorial; it kind of sets you out in the middle of the first level with the VERY basic blocks and such and doesn't tell you about certain mechanics
For instance: You can add steering devices for wheels
 STEERING DEVICES FOR WHEELS
 I'VE LITERALLY NEVER SEEN ANY OTHER GAME DO THIS BEFORE
Truthfully, I feel this is going to be one of those great games once (or if
 though I hope not if
) the devs finish it
Really I think I'm going to play more, because this game is something special

I've only played the first 4 or 5 levels, but I would say the game is worth the $7 for early access already
 My favorite part about Kerbal Space Program was unexpected and hilarious explosions, and my favorite part of playing with LEGO was thinking up weird death machines
 Besiege has begun to combine those interests, and I'm excited to see where development takes it
Hopefully there will be many more blocks, weapons, etc to build with
 Right now we only have the basics

Early Access Review
This is the BEST game I've EVER played with my two boys, aged 7 and 9
 A+++++ 11/10, best ever
 Together we've learned about physics, gravity, centre of mass, flight, ballast, geometery, engineering, problem solving, and other great topics
 As a bonus is it probably the first game my wife has shown any interest in too
 It's also sparked more interest in the kids toward real-life building, and they've dusted off their lego and are often inspired to build in real life after playing
In the course of 'beating' the first island we built a number of tanks with progressively better steering and durabily, a couple flying machines including a kamakazee model, a crane, a couple cars, and a number of mostly useless but fun "prototypes
" Awsome
I've found many games like this have been too complicated or been burdened by a cumbersome UI
 This game perfectly strikes the balance between simplicity and complexity
 The game mechanics are deep enough to stay very interesting for a long time, and simple enough that we've never been frustrated
 I really hope the devs stick to this winning formula they have here and just work on content, refinements, and more building pieces

This game surprised me
Every time my bridge fails I giggle like a little girl
 There's a lot of humor in these failures
 There's also a lot of satisfaction to getting the little car to its destination even as the bridge under its wheels falls apart
 What sort of hair-brained solution can you come up with that fits the budget
I don't normally play games like this, but this is a good one
Bridge building is an interesting metaphor
 For civilization
 For software development
 For folly of man
It's also hysterical just how fragile those things are
 One wrong push and the whole card house disintegrates
So why is it fun
 This sounds like entropy, right
 A very depressing affair
It's physical humor
 1
 Your bridge has a budget
2
 When you finally succeed, you will be graded based on how much money you spent
3
 There's a leaderboard for every level
 4
 Can you make it cheaper
5
 Can you make it more flimsy
6
 Can you make it so pathetic that it crumbles the moment the car passes over it
What follows is a series of ramps and accidents on a shoestring (literally) budget
 Instead of a bridge, you make a swing with a ramp that grabs the car and flings it to the other side of the river, backflipping the entire time and landing on the goal post flag on its roof
 Because all that matters is that it got there
 Never mind the dents on the roof or the bumpers
Happy fishing
But wait
 Let's grade this on my 3 star scale
1
 Does it have elves
 Nope
2
 Does it have swords
 Nope
3
 Does it have pvp
 Yes
Those leaderboards totally count as pvp
 Let the cheapest contractor win
 1 out of 3 is not bad
P
S
 You may never cross a bridge in real life again

 This game is an educational game
 Sneakily, under the hood, it teaches you sound principles of engineering
 And being a cheapskate
 Those are vital life skills in today's economy

I bought this game for my son, its a wonderfuly educational but fun way to learn about applied physics, you build the bridge/ramp/lift what ever and run the simulation to see if it works, couple that with the leveling up part of the game and its rather intriguing, or if your more of a free spirit you can do the sand box mode and make problems for yourself to solve, not only do you see if the bridge works but you can also see the stress points and work on and improve upon your design, and remember as my seven year old now says "triangles are your friends" lol

Early Access Review
EDIT: After talking with the devs here on Steam about bugs and suggestions, I now feel that this game has one of the best, most friendly developing teams around
 It's so great to see the developers take a real interest in what the players have to say, and it makes me feel like I'm being a part of the development myself
 Definitely worth supporting to help an awesome team make a great game
---Original Review---Though it's still Early Access, Poly Bridge offers a fun and unique enough experience to make up for the bugs
 And yes, there are quite a few bugs
 Here's a nice pros/cons list to look at:ProsNice cartoonish graphicsFun gameplayFairly realistic physicsGif sharingLevel creatorConsBugs in level creatorGifs get cut off in longer levelsA few minor glitches in campaignThe gameplay is very fun, and I love the fact that there is no single "correct" solution
 This game not only allows creativity, but it actually requires creativity because there are no guidelines at all, just some materials that you can use and a budget you can't go over
 Overall, I would say that Poly Bridge is definitely a game that's worth supporting, and it's one to look out for once it gets fully released
 As an Early Access game, I recommend it with a warning that you will be dealing with some bugs and glitches, mostly in the sandbox mode (level creator)
 The gameplay is very fun and extremely addicting, and there are already quite a few player-made maps available on the Steam workshop that add to the fun
 The level creator itself is fairly easy to use, but the bugs make it very difficult to actually make a complete level
 To be honest, I've spent most of my time in-game fighting with the level creator because it's just so damn fun to use, but it frequently locks up and I have to restart the game, and sometimes it won't save the level I'm working on
 So if you can deal with a few bugs and want to support a really fun game, go ahead and grab it, but if you want a fully polished game with no glitches, skip the Early Access and wait until it's fully released
 PS - the one thing that drew me to this game the most is the integrated 
gif creator
 After every level, you have the option of sharing a 
gif replay, which is a ton of fun
 The only problem with the 
gif creator is that it has an undisclosed time limit on your replays, so it will frequently cut off the early section of the replay
 To fix that, just hit "try again" and then finish the level on a higher speed

If you're interested in the game after seeing the video and pictures then your interest is true and safe as it is, at least to me, the best and most fun and relaxing bridge construction simulatory (and kind of fun arcade) game I've ever played
The look is like nothing I've seen in the genre, beautifully simple, the gameplay in terms of building is simple and enjoyable, and the physics is fun to watch and get excited about seeing it in motion after constructing your bridge
The price is fair for what it is, and you will never go low on content because aside tons of levels to play in the campaign, you can make your own levels and download community made ones
 So yes, it's definitely worth the purchase

“Do you realize crew members suffocated on the lower decks because you routed power from life support to play stupid video games
” Space Pirates and Zombies 2 (SPAZ 2) is a hybrid 3-D space simulation crossed with a real-time strategy game developed by the company MinMax Games with emphasis on combat mechanics and customization
Pro & contra: ++ Customization
 Fully customizable ship systems with modular elements facilitates the creation of unique configurations
 Broad spectrum of weapons allow for various tactics
 The mass added to a ship influences its inertia und mobility; bigger is not always better, especially when several photon torpedoes are headed your way
+ Gameplay
 Fluent and satisfying combat
 Each part on an enemy ship can be destroyed, weakening the combat effectiveness of the opponent
+ Atmosphere
 The developers managed to deliver a believable space world around the resource REZ
 Exploration and interactions with the different factions were actually enjoyable
 The power balance between them can be influenced and shifted by your actions
o Music
 Average space soundtracks
 - Story
 The campaign is rather short with a simple and predictable plot
 If you played the first part, you will know what is coming for you
 It also lacks the humouring side quests, which the predecessor offered
 However, I have enjoyed most of the characters presented
 Furthermore, solid voice acting
Summary: With the innovative modular ship building system, mixed with the tactical combat, SPAZ 2 is worthwhile investment for fans of space simulations
 Especially the faction system provides enough long-term motivation, in order to subdue the galaxy under a unified command
Recommended for space enthusiasts with masochistic tendencies for zombie outbreaks and interstellar power play
Achievements: Estimated time for 100 % completion: +30 hoursSingleplayer achievements: 42Multiplayer achievements: none

Early Access Review
I can't describe how much I love this game
 There is an amazing amount of polish and balance, from the visuals and the strategic depth, all the way to the raw and dirty visceral depths that combat can descend to
Let me tell you about the combat; It is good
 My most memerable battle so far was a 2v2 where I aided a weaker captain vs a bandit, only for a high level bandit to join in
Bandit capital ships are weaker but they have an insane number and reserve of strike craft, which increases by level (not fighters, those are different)
 My ally engaged the motherships while I thinned the swarm but he was being overwhelmed, so I rammed the strongest enemy and kept thrusting to push him away (ramming is a big mechanic, more on it later)
 Freed to 1v1, my ally succeeded in destroying the first pirate, but at high cost; his shields down, his nose and two wing modules torn off and floating free, a core destroyed and his health but a sliver
 Sensing blood, the swarm of strike craft pounced
 There was nothing I could do to save him
 He exploded magnificently, destroying many of his attackers who were too slow to flee
The remaining pirate and I circled while exchanging broadsides, each deadly piroette bringing us closer to a field of asteroids
 His strongest weapons were on his nose and he fought to bring them to bear
 I, meanwhile, was slightly more manoeuverable and clung on the the relative safety of his rear, while picking of the remaining swarm
 Our shields failed at the same time
Shields, armour and hull are not just 3 interchangeable stats in SPAZ2
 Shields are the most familiar, a flat, regenerating, protective field
 Armour is different
 Every single non core piece of the motherships have their own armour, some of which is shared to the core
 If a part loses all its armour, it is torn off, and sometimes destroyed
 Hull, or health is only relevent to the cores of the ship and when that is gone; boom
 So unlike other games, it isn't destroy shields>armour>hull with various piercing weapons, it is shields>tear them to pieces or shoot straight for the core
We tore each other to pieces
 I took his right wings out but clipped an asteroid at speed, destroying my left
 Caught against it, he was able to bring his nose to bear, shreading off my remaining wings and one of my engines
 Now he was more manoeuverable
In despairation, I boosted, smaller asteroids tearing into my hull until I placed a large one between us
 Frustrated momentarily, he stopped and reloaded
 Seizing this last opportunity, I came out of hiding behind him, my last weapons pounding his engine, trying to even the score
 But it wasn't enough
 He began to turn and rained fire on my last engine
 Before I could be left helpless, I once more boosted, this time straight at his exposed engine, knocking it into the void while my nose crumpled and exploded
Both helpless now, no engines, but still he had weapons and he slowly, ever so slowly, turned to bring that hateful nose to bear
 With nothing left, I had a moment of inspiration and grabbed the astreroid chunks with my tractor beam
 In space, surrounded by the refuse of awesome technology, I beat him to death with a rock
A narrow victory, I collected the refuse of our 4 ships to just bearly rebuild 1, and then jumped to the void
All actions described above REALLY ARE IN THE GAME
 If two things collide, they do armour type damage (very weak vs shields, weak vs hull) to eachother based on their mass and speed
 If you can get an enemies shields down while yours are still up, boost at him/her, smash their bits off
 Beware of ramming with your shields down, as you can wreck yourself
 Finally, you can rebuild your mothership WHILE IN COMBAT
 A wing came off
 Try and grab it before it goes to far, and reattach it
 Enemies powerful weapon came off
 Remove your own and replace it
Did I mention I love this game
Also, there are so many viable ways of building your mothership, and none are perfect for all situations
 I keep parts in storage to swap forms when dealing with different kinds of threats (General flying, starbases, pirates, mining) but my general form is the ION shield ram: Huge shields/thrust and some ION weapons or lasers to take down shields so I can ram them
 It is weak to strike craft and starbases however, and is hard to mine with

Early Access Review
All in all I have to give the game a recommendation
 It was fun, and I played through it to the end, which is "good enough" for me
 But much of what else I have to say about the game is going to be a critique
People aren't kidding when they say the game isn't really SPAZ
 The top-down arcade action, the desperate resource harvesting, and the panicked tactical withdrawals are all missing
 The combat system is totally re-worked, and all the nifty ship designs from the last game come into play as highly disposable fighter craft
Which is all fair enough, but the elements that replaced the old SPAZ could use a LOT of work
 Nearly everything falls short of its potential
The meat and bones of the game, its combat, is very straightforward when applied to bulky motherships
 The player who warps in with the best mix of weapons, stats, and/or backup wins
 There's very little room for tactical nuance, although a clumsy player can easily ruin their battle by failing to get close enough for some of the shorter-ranged weapons
 There are obstacles scattered around the battle void, including the inexplicable exploding canisters from SPAZ 1, but they're very easy to avoid even in the heat of battle and didn't once contribute to a win or loss during my run
 Fighting ships is fun, but fails to stay fresh and exciting the way it did in SPAZ by slowly introducing new models of bigger ships
The second most important component is building and maintaining the mothership, and this is where I think the developers really dropped the ball
 Assembling a ship out of boring same-y blocks is dull, and combing the galaxy for pieces that have the right weapon, look, or quality is tedious
 Rather than giving the mothership turret or weapon slots, like the strike craft, weapons are built into the wings, nose, and engine pieces
 There are no utility or equipment slots
 The game incentivizes you heavily to maintain a big, blocky craft, and cores are all one size with no weapons, They could have done some very impressive things with the mothership construction, and instead it's mostly a matter of sifting through starbases to find the wing turret you want (ideally in the right faction too, because otherwise it just looks ugly)
One aspect I did like was the presence of numerous other starship captains, all with their own allegiances and numerous options
 Character portraits were colorful, and their AI behavior generally made sense
 The only complaint I have about this system is that a battlefield with four players is quickly exploited by the player to fight frequent 3-on-1 battles, especially when the zombies show up
 Ganging up on extremely powerful captains is a fine way to take them down, but since tactical combat is stunted (as noted previously) ganging up on enemies soon becomes the "main" tactic
 You search out a zombie ship and try to catch them alone or while their friends are occupied
 Friendly ships jump in and fill up the battlefield in your favor, and the enemy's fate is sealed
 I would prefer to outfight opponents like I did in the original SPAZ, but alas, that's not feasible
Finally, the writing is good
 I found it bizarre at first that the characters had synthesized voices, but the charming bickering and the random tidbits of humor did a lot to keep my interest going until the end

Early Access Review
I felt the need to expand the review, since there was a lot of complaining going on all over the place, from people that have barely played through a tutorial but presenting themselves as able to properly judge the game
 There is also a lot of complaining that it's not SPAZ 1
5
 If you've played SPAZ 1, this part is for you, otherwise you can skip it entirely:1
 All resource collecting is done on strategic map now, without pointless grind and a waste of time
 There is also no limit on resources you can carry, which is great news
 Having to watch how ships mine for ten minutes straight was a chore of SPAZ 1 and I never liked it even 1 bit
All that resource micromanagement never added to the game, since after you've lost a battle or it was hard and led to loss of resources, game STOPPED and you would spend next half an hour collecting resources
2
 Skill trees are gone and replaced with three random skills per level
Some will say, that skill trees in SPAZ1 were great, when they were actually not
You had to upgrade a skill to be able to use better tech, and once you knew a cookie cutter build you could easily blast through the game, or got gimped for a looong time if you didn't
 Because of this you could never upgrade everything or try everything in one play (and that is an extremely long time)
 Game could actually punish you for trying wrong and it did
Skills in SPAZ 2 are extremely helpful and relevant to the player actually making you stronger, and unpredictable pattern doesn't allow a winning level up in each gameplay
 With new content, there can be more skills added leading to more variety, without the need to lock them to a path
3
 Blueprints are gone
 Finally, for the best
That was another grinding aspect in SPAZ 1
There were barely two viable strategies: blow up the station (if you can, huh) to get all blueprints inside, or spend goons to impove relationship and then REZ to buy it (and then get back grinding goons/REZ back)
With ship blueprints, you had to destroy a ship a number of times to get all parts of blueprint to unlock that ship
 Incredible chore, cause you either had to be lucky, or repeat a mission to get those blueprints
In SPAZ 2 an ingame economy and leveling up gets you better and bigger parts
 You protect transporters in order to get better tech, and upgrade bases
 And of course you loot enemies for it as well, even on the battlefield, which is great
4
 Combat is deeper however you disagree with it
 Instead of basically an energy regeneration for everything in the game, you now have separate sources to manage
Energy battery can protect your shields from getting down with a boost under heavy fire until enemy need to reload
Boost engines allow you to ram through the enemy or get further away
Energy battery allows you to keep firing and once depleted you have to reload, which also makes it impossible to boost up shields or regenerate them if they are gone
Asteroids protects you from heavy bombs and enemy fire, while can also be used with a tractor beam to damage the enemy
 There are powerups on the field, REZ "balls" that might spawn some zombies and barrels to blow up
Battle wagon mode allows to pass weapon controls to AI, which is incredibly useful against small strike crafts, but it uses battery ineffectively which leads to more reloads and decreases survival chances
5
 Mothership is not smaller ships from previous game, those are still here and they're recognizable
How can one describe SPAZ 2
Have you played Mount and Blade
 Good, cause the idea behind strategical map, factions, captains and other stuff is basically the same
Economy is real, bases produce stuff, ships transfer stuff, captains trade and fight, zombies infect, bandits mess up
 Diplomacy allows for alliances, friendship, bounties and so on
 You can even share parts and resources if you need to
You can start a proper faction and take over eventually, but it's NOT easy even one bit since there are lots of threats that needs your attention
In combat you manage a number of ship resources to increase performance, and survive as long as possible until you catch an enemy on reload phase when they are most vulnerable, strip off their shields and ram them to death
 :) You won't see it in low level fights, but then it gets important
Ship building is difficult, since parts are hard to find and there's always more you want to install than you can with different strategy involved
 In 7 hours I have barely seen any tech at all with 16 level
 You can't slap random crap on a ship and win, nope, only in the tutorial
There is nothing in the game that MAKES you waste time on routine stuff anymore and it's awesome
You can attach to you ship a torn apart enemy part on the battlefield any time, or reattach something you've lost yourself
 You can even throw it in the enemy with a tractor beam
The game is incredible already, since it has solid well planned foundation and it can only get even better in time with the help of developers and mods
 I mentioned it before, that there is only one feature needed - LARGER battles with more ships involved
 That is one thing I want to see, something like 10-15 motherships in one intense battle
For the 18$ it's one of the best purchases I've made, besides the
 M&B
*Some small fixes

Early Access Review
Okay so what can be said about SPAZ 2
 Tl;DR: SPAZ 2 is worth every penny
 Holy crap it's fun and awesome for anyone looking for a neat new take on a great series
 The game is great in every area as far as I'm concerned, and I was a huge SPAZ fan from the start
 Sadly this account doesn't reflect the years of college that I was playing the game during my down time but trust me when I say I've got plenty of hours invested
Here's a quick warning:
THE GAMEPLAY IS NOTHING LIKE SPAZ 1
Take it or leave it, it's not SPAZ in any format except some concepts and characters you'll remember
 You aren't flying around constantly trying to scavenge REZ so you can have a surplus for purchases, you don't fly one vessel or another and have a hearty upgrade system that allows for full blown customization/focus, and you can't BS spam support-craft every time one of them blows up
 Okay so there, that's my big warning
 If you want SPAZ 1 in your SPAZ 2 you're a touch out of luck
 The game is still perfect and worth your money, it's just don't come in here expecting SPAZ 1 because you won't find it
 I consider this game the successful sequel that used SPAZ as a stepping stone
So you start off pretty straight forward, welcome to sometime in the future after SPAZ 1's story
 You are now floating on a tactical battlemap with a crap ton of other motherships floating around doing whatevery they want
 Unlike SPAZ you aren't the only player getting stuff done, the AI is also going from point to point, harvesting resources you probably want, picking fights left and right, and just causing some general issues in the grand scheme
 Mothership
 You don't have this giant beast of a ship from the first one, you start off in a crappy clunker that can be upgraded/fixed on the fly
 I'm not even joking, the whole gimmick for motherships is everything snaps off and can be attached to random ports on your ship
 Got a wing piece that shoots saw-blades
 Welp just going to clip off my other wing that's in the way and snap that bad boy on
Economy is something this game has
 Want to buy something
 Hope you have the scrap (the new rez in terms of currency), want to get from point A to point B on the map
 Girl I hope you had luck stockpiling a small bit of REZ because REZ is a huge pain in the butt to harvest enough but oh jeez it's so worth it
 Goons are back as well, but they really don't impact too much
 I often found myself floating with a surplus of Goons and that's not good for your REZ usage but after a while you either stop caring or get half of them killed doing ship repairs
So, as one can tell by my hours right out the gate, I was a tester for SPAZ 2
 The devs have been incredibly understanding and willing to work around the advice I had given on gameplay and it opened the door for a lot of great additions or changes to gameplay
 Try to keep this in mind, if you have an idea or want to push for some fixes be civil and post about it in the community forum here on Steam
 They check and they pay attention
 I'm not paid to say any of this, they are just some really great guys who want everyone to be happy for the most part
That's my review right there folks
 You love SPAZ like me so you're eyeballin' SPAZ 2 after a long wait or you're new to the game at which point I'm recommending you play the first SPAZ and try to pick up a copy of SPAZ 2 after you beat it
 There is some story that's good to know but you won't get the right footing story wise if you start solely with SPAZ 2
Some advice for players:1: Build your ship length wise
 Believe it or not building more DAKKA (firepower) is important over all things
 DPS is key
2: Sell everything you don't particularly need
 Trust me, you'll get way more crap than you'll need parts wise and it'll slow you down
3: If you're playing as a pirate make sure you understand your ship's limits in combat
4: THIS GAME IS A BROADSIDE BATTLER
 One side of your ship should be missiles or support, the other side cannons
5: Does the enemy have a sexy weapon you want
 Carve it off their ship
 Your weapons can damage individual components on ships now and they blow off if they take too much damage
6: Yes, you can literally scrap pieces off enemy ships, even when in combat

Early Access Review
I want to preface this review by saying that not only am I a big fan of the original SPAZ, I also respect and admire MINMAX for experimenting with their original model and stepping outside the box for their sequel
That being said, I think they stepped out of one box and into another
SPAZ 2 retains the charmingly witty-yet-stupid writing and dialogue of the original game that reminds of a Saturday-morning cartoon
 The aesthetics have also remained the same; blurry textures composed of screamingly high contrast colors that bore into your retinas
 On top of that, the from-scratch gameplay is also retained from the original game, where you start with practically nothing and build your empire on top of that
 Aside from the actual space combat, these things define SPAZ pretty well, and if that's all you're looking for, you won't be disappointed
This is all SPAZ 2 has in common with the original, however
 In the transition to 3d, much has changed
 You now get to fly and build the mothership, you are now the biggest fish in the sea
 Right Hooks and Tugs are tiny compared to the hulking, glorious piece of junk that is your ship
 You start off with a scaffold looking like it was built entirely out of old bicycles by an inpatient from a mental hospital
 Over the course of the entire game, from start to finish, you will upgrade from bicycles to smashed car-shaped objects
This modular mothership, along with the ability to establish and govern starbases, seems to be giving us what we didn't have, and wanted in the original SPAZ
 An interstellar empire
 Flying the Clockwork
 AI that don't run face-first into the enemy's largest ship and die instantly, wasting thousands of Rez
 Actually, that's still a thing, but they only waste small amounts of scrap instead because they're only piloting small fighter ships
This lends a much more strategic feel to the game
 And I'd call that an advantage
 However, much was lost in the transition:First of all, everything feels like it's about the same size
 Gone are the days of warping into a battlefield and attempting to take down a ship 20 times your size with bombing runs
 The smallest mothership is maybe 1/4 the size of the largest
 Heck, even space stations just look like circular, spinning motherships that can't move
Next, ship design doesn't matter as much
 In the original, when you were restricted to chassis with a set number of module slots and module types, you knew exactly how your own ships worked, and their strengths and weaknesses
 When you looked at an enemy ship, you could distinctly see what modules were attached to it (unless it was cloaked), and you knew how those weapons would affect your fleet
 What weapons a ship had often determined whether you'd try to take it down for its blueprints, or flee with your tail between your legs
Now, you pretty much slap whatever module will fit on your mothership and has the most stars
 Because of the randomness of parts, both in terms of their perks (the bonuses they confer to your ship, like shield strength, speed, health, etc
), and in terms of the weaponry on them (cannons, beams, the works), both when you're scavenging, and when you're shopping at space stations, it's very unlikely that you're going to find exactly the part you're looking for
I get what they were going for here; you're a scavenger among scavengers
 It's not about what you want, it's about what works
 But, that being said, it isn't very compelling
 The chances of me finding a part that: a) looks the way I want it to look, b) has a weapon that I want on it, and c) has the bonuses that I want (which I don't even keep track of anyways), is almost null
 The chances of me finding *multiple parts* that I actually want are nonexistant
This results in your mothership EITHER looking like a piece of trash, that has EITHER nice weapons OR nice stats, OR a mothership that looks nice and is completely worthless in terms of battlefield effectiveness
 Yes, that was a nested either-or statement
 And, usually, what ends up happening is you get a muddy mix of all of these things
The end result is that you don't feel like the ship you're flying is *your* mothership, even though you built it piece-by-piece
 It feels like you just cobbled together what the game gave you and now you're flying it around
And, all of these things would be fine if they took advantage of the things they gained; We're in 3d now
 There's a lot to explore, right
Not
 Really
 You still fly your ship in 2d, while asteroids hover tantalizingly over and under you
 You still effectively fight in 2d; you can't go over or under an enemy ship
 The battles are more bland than the original game
 Explosive barrels don't matter as much, and neither do asteroids
 They feel much more staged, 2-4 ships warp in, 1-3 ships warp out
 The outcome is largely determined by your stats, and who warps in with you
 Positioning can matter, but ships are so random and cobbled together that it's hard to tell when you're facing directly into an enemy's broadside, or if the other side is even worse
 You can't "get used to" an enemy faction
 You can't take advantage of a ship's slow turning speed and its blind spots
 You really can't dodge missiles anymore
 There is no longer a cloaking system (except for in the star map, where it doesn't really matter), and "big" weapons like Mass Bombs don't feel as significant
That's what it is
 A lot of elements have lost their character
 Rez is no longer the rainbow-colored candy it was, now it's just a generic purple blob that you pick up
 Finding a new color of Rez stone felt like moving to a different level
 Things are worth more now
 Ships are bigger
 Now it's just numbers on a screen
Goons have gotten even less important
 You no longer scavenge for rescue pods, or steal from hotels; just numbers on a screen
 You need to maintain a minimum number of goons, and you shouldn't have too manygoons
 Finding the last blueprint to a weapon you really want is no longer a thing
 Sometimes you stumble across a part that has a unique weapon on it, and you get to use that one part, and you will never find that same weapon ever again
 And if you do, it's going to be on a worthless part
The game feels smaller
 You can cross the whole starmap in a matter of minutes, faster towards the start of the game and slower towards the end (the opposite of the original game), and you probably won't be attacked
It's not a bad game
 I just don't see why I would play it over the original SPAZ, which has much more crisp, interesting RPG gameplay and gunplay
 Or Istrolid, which offers the modularity and customizability of SPAZ 2 with much faster, more satisfying top-down gameplay
 Or why I would play it over Dreadnought, or Fractured Space, which are full-blown third person space shooters with interesting tactical gameplay and the advantage of other players
SPAZ 2 seems to be a mashup of various genres, and sadly, it doesn't work, at least not for me

Early Access Review
After 45 hours I won the game, such a blast to play
 Different than SPAZ1 but funny like SPAZ1, a good mix of arcade space battles along with a great story
 I finished the story and I have not even played the Sandbox yet
 I could say alot about the game but I do not want to give alot away, just that it is deeper than one would think
 Story has some fun twists and turns
 It was fantastic to build my ship up, earning experience points to make it strong
 I am so glad I played it, great hours spent for me

Early Access Review
Quick noteThe mixed rating is because the devs could not add multiplayer into the game due to major issues
The devs made a fairly long detailled post about this, but it was removed
 So here's the short version for wy it was cancelled :After updating the game engine (Unity),the devs realised that unity completely changed how multiplayer works, thus all work done on multiplayer before that was lost
 They wanted to upgrade to the newer engine to improve performance and the long term compatibility with the new systems coming in the next few years
 (Performance was indeed much better after the upgrade
)They then tried to start over the multiplayer work but had several issues doing so
 After trying to work around the problems for over a month, they made no progress at all with multiplayer
Eventually, the devs took feedback form the players about that issue
 Most agreed to scrap multiplayer in favor of adding more content to the single player experience istend
At that point multiplayer was scrapped
That's about it
 Some details are missing here but this is what hapened in a nut shell
Anyway, on to the actual review
IntroThis is one of a kind game that should NOT be left under the radar
Space Pirates and Zombies 2 (Or spaz 2),Is a game with many different gameplay elements in one game
If you played the original spaz, this game is quite different form that game
In this game, you control a fully customizable mothership with Elsa has her captain trying to earn a place of power in the galaxy
Homever you are not the only one
There are other 199 captains roaming around
They follow the same rules that the player does, with few exceptions
The game is also very well polished, more so that you expect
Go to the ---TLDR--- if you just want to see pro/cons of the game
The meatThe major gameplay element is the starmap screen, where you can plan your destination and interact with several things like other captains, resources zones, starbases and other events
 All traveling/resource gathering is also done on the star map, greatly reducing the grind you usually find in X4 games
Starbases is where you can use scrap (in game currency) to buy much needed resources like Rez (Think of rez like Gas) or buy parts for your mothership
You can also battle in the arena with preset ships for rewards and improve relations with other captains
 (More onthat later)Ship customizationYou can fully customize your own mothership using the loot you find or buy them at shops
You want have lot of projectiles weapons
 You can
You want be a carrier type mothership with lots of drones
 You can
You want go nuts with a lot of missiles
 You can
You prefer using beam weapons
 You can
The way your ship handle in combat depends entirely on how you build it
 Want to go fast
Use more engines
Want a better turn rate
Use more wings
Want to have more shields
Use more noses
Finding the parts you want may be hard, but there is a VERY helpful catalog system where you can order parts form and getting them delivered to you directly
The Captains and FactionsYour actions can cause a captain to like or hate your guts
If a captain likes you, he/she is more likely to help you in battles and gives you better prizes when shopping at his/her station
 This also work in reverse, of course
 If a rich captain really hates you, you can expect a bounty on your head
 While captains that are friends with you will not try to collect the bounty, the others will
You can also put a bounty on someone else if you want
There is 5 main factions in the game that you can join after building relations with other captains of that faction
At that point you can have your own starbase in the faction you joined if you spend time gathering resources and build a station for your faction
Stations is like a bank where you can drop resources and parts for later use, also a good source of passive income
Each factions specialize in something, giving a specific bonus for parts they sell
 (like Speed/armor/shields and power
) Some weapons type can only be found in a specific faction
You unlock the ability to form your own faction and build your own empire of imbeciles and simpletons with you has the leader later on
Space Pirates and Zombies
Now you may wonder, what the heck the *zombies* in thetitle mean
At some point in the game, the zombies will make a appearance
 How they show up depend if you play the campaign or the sandbox mode
They do what you expect them to do, no much else to say
Oh and try not to get infected, wash your hands often
CombatsFights will usually happen vs
 bandits, captains, starbases
and Zombies of course
The combat is done in a 3D Arcade shooter style with the option of a top view or behind your mothership with the ability to switch at anytime
Up to 4 captains/zombies/bandits can participate in a battle, ending in 1 vs
 1, 2 vs
 2 and 1 vs
 3
Combats are fairly fast,with lots of effects form fired weaponand usually quite hectic
You and other captains can also have smaller ships (Called Strikecrafts) to aid in battle
And yes, those are also customizable
You can unlock more type of strikecrafts by collecting blueprints in battle
 Collecting more for a already unlocked ship will eventually make it more powerful
If a mothership gets damaged eneuf, the ship may lose parts of itself
Attacking a specific part of a ship for a while will eventually break it, this is userfull for 2 reasons : weakening the enemy ship and extra loot after a battle
 Some weapons are better that other to break parts
TLDR (Pros and Cons)Again, most downvotes for the game is because multiplayer got scraped
Even so it still got it's perks, the game do not deserve to be brushed aside just for that reason alone
Ok, starting with cons because i prefer a good end
Cons :1
Lack of diplomacy options for factions
 The core is here and it works, but is missing things like trading/no-agression and a few others
 2
The story leaves something to be desired
3
Modding is not possible
 Offset by using the various sliders in sandbox mode that changes how the game plays
4
Too easy/quick to become the *Biggest fish* in the galaxy
5
I wish you could build more that starbases in the galaxy map
 (Like building on resources zones to speed up the gathering rate for example
)6
Can be confusing to play for the first time
 (Don't Skip the tutorials the first time you play
)Pros :1
 Good customizations option for your mothership and your fleet
2
Devs being very informative,you always knows what's hapening and are constant to fix minor/major bugs really quickly
3
Great replay value, thanks to many sliders(Or mutators) in sandbox mode
 Over 50 new options was added in 0
9
1, for a total of 73 different tweak possible so even more changes is possible now
)4
The grind is minimal, making the game fun form the very start to the end
5
 A Fairly deep Captain relation system
6
 Be free to play YOUR way, even in story mode
7
 There's no games comparable to this
 Closest being the mount and blade games
 But it's still a completely different game
8
The galaxy feels alive, thanks to the many other captains roaming around
 (200 including you)9
Early access done right
 No really, it's one of the best early access progress i seen, check the *Major Update Stockpile
* in the forums to have an idea on how much it progressed
If you like space battles with tons of customizations options with great replay value, you will love this game

SPAZ was a good game but we wanted more
 more of
 EVERYTHING
SPAZ 2 delivers
 - more customization- more explosions- more D's (3D instead of 2D)- more voice - more sounds- more quests- more space- and much more more

I am 68 years old
and I love this game
It is a real-time isometric strategy game that allows multiple ways to solve the puzzles to reach the end goal
Been looking for a game like this for a long time
The graphics are superb
An elegantly designed environment
A joy to just wander around in and explore
I hope they add modules to keep this genre going
Posted: 17 June
Shadow Tactics harkens back to the glorious days of realtime tactical strategy games like Commandos
 Instead of gathering supplies to build forces, the genre had you control a small set of heroes
 As you use a combination of stealth, clever timing and frequent use fo F5/F8 to make your way across the map filled with enemies to complete various objectivies
 Being outnumbered by a 100 to 1 at times, players had to use the map, the heroes and create a synergy amoung them to even the odds
The game takes place during the Feudal times in Japan
 You control a group of heroes with different motives, come together for a common goal
 The plot does an okay job to keep things going forward with a predictable twist in the end
The game introduces you to the basic controls and key abilities of the heroes with time
 However, that is not enough for the players to complete the missions
 Once the players understand the abilities, the map and start to combine them in clever ways, this is when the game really opens up
 The game has pretty straight forward abilities, however as you play on you will learn clever ways to make use of those abilities for some really fantastic combos
 There is also a tactical mode called Shadowmode which let you queue up 1 command per hero at a time and execute it instantly with a press of a button - this can open up to a lot of tactical opportunities when you have a very slim opening to do a number of things
 You cannot queue up more than one action at a time which might be sad news for some
 According to the developer the reason behind this is so the players play the game more in real-time as opposed to simply queue up every few steps along the way
 Also bear in mind that you will be saving and reloading A LOT
 This infact encouraged by the developers and part of the game to the point you see a handy timer which shows how long it has been since you last saved
 So don't be be afraid to constantly F5 and F8
There is no clear way of using the abilities, you can use it as well as
manipulate the game world the way you see fit
 This sense of self-discovery is one of the reasons I enjoyed playing this game and reminded me a lot of the childhood days of me playing through Commandos for the first time
I had a number of frustrating moments with the game however
 It is not always very clear when enemies can see you behind an object
 Sometimes you feel like you are hidden behind a prop, only to be spotted instantly
 The game has also pathfinding problems: I died a number of times trying to navigate my character to a certain point closeby, however the character ends up taking a really terrible way to get there by going through a different, lengthier path altogether
 This can be very frustrating when you have a very small window to do a number of things, you do everything right but die because the pathfinding decides to break momentarily
Overall I enjoyed this game, reminded me how much I missed this genre
 The voice acting is pretty good to for the main characters, although I find some npcs sound too british for my taste
 It is not perfect as mentioned, but it is more towards fun than frustration
 I really hope more developers start to make games like this
7 /10 - GOOD

Before you bomb the forums with your complaints about the base price at launch please read this
It's not just the game you are paying for
 You are paying for a time machine that will take you to an era of game development in which the released games were bug-free at launch, in which there were free demos to try out and in which tactical real time strategy was a popular genre
 The pricing scheme was also different back then
 Nowadays you figure out what the market is ready to pay either through pre-order or crowd funding
 Then you make the game with the funds you received and release it once the money are spent
 The result is a game in which the devs made cuts and compromises on some crucial aspects of the game such as graphics and artwork (just decrease the texture resolution and call it retro), level design (use algorithms to automatically generate level and call it procedural), or game play design (just make it overall hard and call it rogue or just don't introduce any game play and call it sandbox), proper testing (release it with bugs and expect the mods to fix these, call it AAA) or without sufficient content (make and release the content once the sales from the launched product hit in, call it DLC)
Mimimi, the developer of Shadow Tactics did something different
 They developed and released a finished product
 They then calculated their development costs, made their sales projections and based on these they calculated the price of single copy of the game, such that the projected sales cover their costs and perhaps create some profit
 If the base launch price is too high for you, wait for a sale or wait a couple of months until the price drops
 In the meantime you can play the demo or (re)play its genre ancestors Commandos or Desperados
 If you like the genre, consider buying this game at the full price - make it a success and show all game devs that we want more of these "time machines"
Posted: 9 December, 2016
What to say, where to begin
I am a huge Commandos fan and seeing this game's announcement was a dream come true after so many years of stalemate in this genre
 And I have to be honest, seeing the first couple of trailers and screenshots I was not that hyped
 It looked low budget to me but I still wanted to give it a chance
 And then, out of the blue
A DEMO
 Yes, a demo, believe it or not that thing still exists
 I downloaded it not expecting that much
Boy, was I wrong
 Demo got me hooked, a perfect sample that made me buy this game at launch
 But my surprise did not end there
Not going to spend half of the review telling you about Commandos, because it is obvious that this was heavily inspired by those games (let's not forget legendary Desperados)
 This game is a mix between the first games in the genre and the awesome Commandos 2
 Not too complex with inventory management and indoor sections, but still complicated in it's own way
Graphics really surprised me, those first trailers and SS's do not give this game justice
 In motion it looks beautiful, animations are amazing and attention to detail is stunning (like weaker characters pulling bodies instead of carying them, different styles of execution depending on the size of the character and their personality (Yuki-chan takedown FTW) and plenty more)
Sound is also amazing with
different sounding footsteps, depending on the surface, together with weapon and ambient sounds it creates a great atmosphere
 Also, voices (with a neat feature of being able to turn on Japanese VO)
 Every character's voice actor fits perfectly IMO
Gameplay is something familiar to the fans of the genre, but it is not a simple 1:1 copy
 Game takes a lot from the legends of the genre but also adds plenty of new things to the table
 What the game does great is combining all these characters in going through amazingly designed levels and with the use of all characters equally
 While in Commandos 2 I would mostly focus on one character and kill an entire map with it (Tiny was responsible for the death of thousands of Third Reich soldiers :D ) that's not the case here
 Every character was interesting and could be used to deal with a certain situation
 The levels are amazingly designed and even if you think there is no way out, there is always a way out
 And this is where game encourages you to use a combination of character (with a great Shadow Mode feature that let's you queue up actions of a couple of characters and make them execute orders at the same time)
 Amazing stuff
The game also has a story, nothing too complicated but still interesting enough to make you question what will happen next
 All this with well written characters that have plenty of developement through cutscenes and during gameplay
 Certain actions will promt interactions between characters that tells us more about their personas
 Plenty of humor too :)I also have to praise the amazing polish this game has
 Devs thought about almost everything, from the Japanese VO option, to the neat LAST SAVE reminder, even allowing us to choose if the dialogue will advance automaticaly or on click, choosing the highlight option for the characters that are talking during gameplay etc
 Something that plenty of AAA titles add post launch or not at all
 Plenty of quality of life features, I have to give it to the devs
 Haven't seen any bugs so far
 Amazing state for a modern game
The review is already too long, but I had to :D I rarely write reviews but I simply had to for this one
 An amazing game with a reasonable price, with a demo and with Devs that are very active in the forums, giving advice and supporting their game and the players
 You can feel and see the hard work they invested in creating this little gem
 Try out the demo and decide for yourself, but I know you will not be dissapointed
 The game opens up later on an surprises with every level
 Almost every level introduces new tactics or features
 It gets more complicated as you progress
 In short :D : A must buy for fans of tactical stealth games :)

This is the game I never knew I needed to play
It brings back memories of playing the old Commando games
The game is basically an isometric stealth game set in Edo-period Japan so most of the enemies you face will have guns
 The first mission alone took me 1-2 hours to complete (that was from restarting it 5 times) so you'll probably get your money's worth once you finish the game
Definitely a great game and I hope to see many more 'Shadow Tactics' games whether they be Japan or a different era
 I'd love to see a Medieval England one
The soundtrack is really nice comprising of traditional Japanese instruments
 The voice acting is pretty good (at least the Japanese one)
 That's right, there's both English and Japanese voices to choose from
 I have chosen Japanese voices due to authenticity
The story of the game is mainly fictional
 There's a few fictional outfits on certain NPC's for example
 Guns tend to fire faster than they actually could
 There's also no mention of the Tokugawa shogunate despite it being Edo themed
 The story is purely made up, but that doesn't mean it's bad
Overall, it's a great game
 A nice little gem among all these early access games, anime visual novels and poorly made games
The price is debatable in honesty, but I'm finding it worth what I paid so far

Too good to be true in 2016:- game is thrilling fun for many hours- beautiful look- nice English or Japanese voice-acting- all texts are translated in many different languages- superb soundtrack- still works on small PCs, Macs and Linux-Systems without bugs- offers you a demo where you can play 1
5 hours for free- costs only under 40€ (a no-brainer or me after playing the demo on my Mac and PC)Well, my late highlight in 2016 
 Good job, Mimimi and Daedalic

This is my first review ever, and I am a member of Steam from 2006
 This game is absolutely amazing
 The only reason why I am writing this because the developers are not that well known (guess they will be after this game), but anyway deserve all the money they can get in order to support their further developments
 Really brings back memories from Commandos and Desperados
Posted: 6 December, 2016
An excellent game and I love the gameplay
 This game is based on a game called Desperados
 The game is also a very much like the Commandos series and also a game called Robin Hood
 I have been waiting for a game like this for a long time
 Plays beautifully
 Excellent art style with crisp visuals
 If you like tactical stealth games this game is an absolute must

TL;DR: Read the last paragraph
 Although I am giving this game a positive review, I must say that it comes with a massive disclaimer
 If you just play Brawlhalla with your friends and never take it seriously, you will likely enjoy yourself
 However, if you ever get good at this game and play at a decently high level, Brawlhalla's glaring failures as a fighting game will become so unignorable that your desire to play it will steadily decline till you're on the subreddit crying about the passive float meta like everyone else
 All of the reviews - including the negative ones - are ignoring the real problems with this game, and it's something I have thought about for a long time
 So, I'll try to explain my reasoning as best as I can and briefly include the reasons why I still consider it worth downloading despite its enormous flaws
 On the surface, Brawlhalla is an entertaining party game, provided you have some friends to play it with
 So, if the only thing you're looking for is a simple game to kill some time (read: 1500 hours) with, download it
 It is very easy to play and you are practically guaranteed to pick it up quickly regardless of your fighting game experience
 Aside from being easy to play, it is also free to play and only cosmetic items cost money, so it is easy to get into as well
 There are a good number of modes for you to play with your friends to prevent it from getting stale
 You can level up your characters and unlock new colors for each few levels, so there is some degree of progression and playing a lot of one character can feel slightly rewarding
 It also helps that a potato could likely run this game
 While I do consider this game's positives enough to make it worth downloading, that’s just about all the positivity I have to share
 As someone who has played and seen this game played at a very high level for many hours, I can confidently say that Brawlhalla is a fundamentally flawed mess
 I'm not going to complain about the toxic community, or the netcode, or matchmaking, or any of the stuff you see other reviews complaining about
 I'm only going to talk about the game's core mechanics and why it fails competitively
 Brawlhalla has a dodge mechanic that grants virtually instant invincibility and makes you unhittable for nearly half a second
 Dodging has very low risk because it has only 0
97 seconds of downtime and it is difficult to punish unless your opponent can predict exactly where you will dodge
 You can dodge in 8 directions at any given time, and if you are running you can dodge twice in succession
 When the iframes from the dodge end, you are able to jump or attack almost immediately, which is one of the main reasons why it’s so ridiculously safe
 You can also jump in any direction 3 times, and once you're in the air you can quickly fall to the ground to get all your jumps back and continue hopping around
 This combination of instant invincibility on a 1 second cooldown and an insane amount of aerial freedom results in a passive, floaty meta where playing optimally means avoiding making any approaches
 Usually, making the first attack means risking being punished, whereas dodging or floating away is safe and can potentially put you in a position to punish a whiffed attack
 Because of this, it often feels like you’re chasing your opponent rather than fighting them
 Seriously, playing this game feels like you're in space with how effortlessly you can float around and avoid your opponent
 Constantly approaching will get you killed faster than a lone cripple in a collapsing, burning building
 Sometimes, salty players will run away from you in ranked just to troll you and you will have a very hard time catching them
 Yes, this is a problem with the community, but it shouldn’t be possible in the first place
 A key reason this happens is because dodging is a stupidly easy way to escape pressure
 Any time you get hit you can just dodge in one of eight directions and reset the match to the neutral phase
 Brawlhalla’s neutral phase is reminiscent of two kids hopping around on a jungle gym endlessly until one kid falls and hurts themselves (in this case, hurting yourself would be equivalent to approaching)
 Another issue that ties into dodging and movement is wall camping
 It’s possible to wall camp almost endlessly and force your opponent into a disadvantage if they want to approach
 Players have won tournament matches by abusing this
 A mechanic was introduced that stops you from getting your jumps back after touching the wall too many times, but it's rather forgiving and you only need to touch the stage for a few frames before you can resume wall camping
 Once you get comfortable with movement in this game, it’s incredibly easy to dance around on the wall for as long as you want
 If you’re reading this and you don’t play Brawlhalla, you might be thinking that all the problems I’ve listed thus far could be addressed by nerfing dodge in some capacity
 Unfortunately, the entirety of Brawlhalla has already been crafted and balanced around this awful mechanic
 Certain weapons are better at punishing dodges than others, with some weapons capable of dealing massive damage on a precise dodge read
 A considerable dodge nerf would mean that these weapons would benefit immensely and quickly become meta
 The only way I can imagine this game’s passivity problem being fixed would be a colossal rework of dodging, jumping, and probably every weapon in the game as well
 Understandably, the developers don’t know what that rework should be and how to conduct it
 They’re trying to fix the game’s passive float meta by applying band aid fixes that ultimately do very little to address the huge, overarching passivity problem Brawlhalla has always had
The other day, I told myself I was going to play ranked with the only intention being to win, which meant playing fully passive and not caring what people thought of me
 I quickly reached top 50 in the world doing this
 Almost nobody gged me and plenty of people complained about my playstyle in post game chat
 Admittedly, although I am never toxic to anyone regardless of how they play, I don't blame a single one of those people for their anger
 Brawlhalla, when played at a high level, is legitimately one of the most frustrating fighting games to play in existence
 Just imagine losing to someone after they avoided approaching you, wall camped, or outright ran away from you for the entire game
 Considering this, it’s no wonder why Brawlhalla’s community is a cesspool of toxicity and noxious, salty fumes
 As much as I want to give this game a negative review, I cannot justifiably do so
 Most people who play this game will stay at a basic, casual level and never even notice or be forced to encounter the serious passivity problem this game has
 So, despite my frustration with Brawlhalla, I am giving it a positive review
 My recommendation would be to play with your friends and avoid taking this game too seriously
 However, the prevalence of the passive float meta is noticeable as early as high platinum/low diamond, so be very forewarned and prepared to deal with it if you intend to play this game for many hours
 As for myself, unless this game takes a drastically different direction, it is unlikely that I will be playing it for much longer
EDIT: Yes, a lot of the information in this guide is outdated, but the gameplay at a high level is still very oriented around passivity
 The addition of a grounded dash didn't fix the issue, nor did removing grounded dodging
 Watch tournaments and you will see that the game certainly still has the same issues as before

BAD REVIEWS DEBUNKED
“ --INSTERT CHARACTER-- IS OP”: All characters in the game are balance every 2 weeks by Devs
 If the character is so powerful why don’t you use them
 “THERE ARE LOADS OF HACKERS”: Usually said by people who haven’t played the game enough to learn it
 I have yet to come across a single hacker in 200+ hours
“ --GAME MECHANIC-- IS BROKEN”: Once again nearly always said by people who haven't bothered to actually learn the game before they critique it
“IT’S JUST A SMASH CLONE”: Yes, yes it is
 I love SSB
 That’s why I play this
“YOU HAVE TO PAY MONEY FOR IN-GAME STUFF”: The game is entirely free to play
 The only thing you can buy is skins
 People who whine about not getting everything in this already entierly free game are clearly spoilt
"IT'S PAY2WIN": Once again, every single legend in the game can be bought with the money you earn in game, along side the 5 legend rotation every month
 It is also very very easy to earn enough to buy a nre character unlike other F2P games
This game is the best F2P available
 It has addictive gameplay,a huge roster of characters and has been one of the few games ive played for a while now
 PLAY IT
(Aso if anyone wants to learn how to play this game so you dont become one of these people, add me and ill teach you
)

Posted: 17 October
I have played this game to death, and I love and I hate it
 That said, there isn't a game on steam I could recommend to you more
I've been with the game for almost two years competing at a pro level, participating in tournaments and attending LAN events
 During this time the game has seen it's ups, and its downs
 Ultimately, due to its amateur but dedicated and communicative dev team "BMG", it has come out on top
There's definitely two sides to Brawlhalla: The casual, and the competitive
The former I don't have much experience with but I know that if I hop into some custom games with friends I can still have a great laugh even after all this time
 The latter, oh man
 The competitive community is fresh, young and enthusiastic
 It's everything someone looking to get into competitive gaming / self-improvement could want
 -The game is easy to jump right into, but has a well rounded set of fighting game dynamics
 -It doesn't look too pretty, but it plays very cleanly (with some of the best netcode I've EVER SEEN), as well as supporting a huge variety of characters and weapons
-It is a young game and the meta progresses slowly, but there is more room for you as an individual to make an impact
 It is NOT EVEN CLOSE to too late to get into the game
-L A N, the community that gathers at our offline events is one of the best, hands down
 I've had some of my best experiences IN MY LIFE at these events
With a cosmetic-only business model (and a sweet art team), there is no reason not to at least TRY this game
 If you're a competitive person but haven't found the right game for you, hop on the ranked ladder and if it doesn't get your blood boiling, doesn't do it for you, well it was free anyway
Now I'm going back to practice more Brawlhalla because, in case you didn't know, the world championship is on November 3rd, and has a $100,000 prize pool

I like how most of the reviews are about how you can't win unless you're playing a super fast character with no end lag
Here i am, top ranked in SEA, maining teros, one of the slowest characters in the game
This game is great, and not to mention the fact that its free with absolutely NO pay to win aspects
 You only have to pay for skins which are cosmetic and completely unrequired
With that being said, why are you still reading this review

Visually the game is beyond stunning, hands down the prettiest game I've ever seen
Storytelling is amazingly done through game mechanics and not just "passive" cutscenes

Truly one of the most gorgeous games ever
DISCLAIMER:- I bought this game on a whim after seeing it in the Steam Store for the first time
 I watched the promotional videos and was immediately interested in it
- I love this game, therefore this review is biased
 I am not some professional games journalist who makes a living off of reviewing games and tries to provide an objective and totally unbiased point of view on the subject material
 If you were expecting such a review from the average Steam user, then your standards might be a bit high
 No offense, high standards aren't really a bad thing
 My intention with this review is to convince others who might be interested in the game to take the leap and drop $20 on it
 That's all
- At the time of this review, I only had about two hours of playtime invested
 Overall the game isn't terribly complex, and the gameplay is what you'd expect from the average Metroidvania title (with more focus on platforming than combat)
 It's polished, the art is beautiful, and the story is engaging while not getting in the way of playing the game
 After two hours, I felt that I could wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who might show interest in it
REVIEW:If I had to briefly describe the game, I would say it's a very artistically-driven 2D platformer with common elements from both the Metroid and Castlevania series
 But that merely scratches the surface
I won't go in to excruciating detail regarding the gameplay
 It's a branching world with areas you can't access without certain abilities
 You progress naturally until you unlock a new ability, then more options open up and you can progressively explore more freely
 Naturally, the world is littered with hidden goodies like health and energy powerups (like energy tanks and missiles from Metroid)
 Platforming does become rather challenging, and the fact that the movement is very responsive and feels polished makes platforming a blast despite the difficulty
 However, a certain ability you are given right from the start can detract from the challenge by essentially removing the consequences of dying
 Combat is pretty simplistic (you basically just spam the attack button and it auto-locks to the nearest target), but it is clearly not the focal point of the gameplay
 The majority of the abilities you unlock cater towards more efficient and complex platforming maneuvers
 There is a simple experience system which rewards you with skill points that allow you to unlock an assortment of abilities that are split off in to three different skill trees
 These abilities are either unique passives, or augment the main abilities that you acquire through progression in the game
As far as visuals go, this game is in my humble opinion at the very apex of gorgeous
 The art style is surreal and brimming with color and personality
 I'm not exaggerating when I say you could take a screenshot anywhere in the game and it would make for a great picture
 There are certain areas in the game where you just have to stop and marvel at how downright beautiful the art is
 Not many games these days are capable of that (the last one that comes to mind is probably The Vanishing of Ethan Carter)
 People might say that gameplay is all that matters, but this game is a prime example of why that's simply just not true anymore
 I believe that in regards to modern games, visuals will always play an important role in making the game what it is
 Games are a from of art now, not just pure entertainment
 Anyone who plays this game and says otherwise is probably insane
The musical score is just as good as the visuals
 There's heavy use of woodwind instruments and a touch of harmonic female vocals that really set the mood
 There are overaching themes throughout the score that gives the whole soundtrack real cohesion
 The best part is that the music doesn't overplay itself during cutscenes to create a sappy, melodramatic mood
 During general gameplay, the music is calmer and more relaxed
 In turn, it helps to keep the player feeling the same even during the tougher platforming areas
The story, while somewhat simple in nature, does a great job of presenting the game's gorgeous world and giving you a solid sense of pace
 It's not a really big RPG story with tons of lore or anything, but you can still easily be enveloped by its provocative and charming nature
 The game can even be surprisingly emotional and deep when you least expect it
 Think of the art as a painting and the story as a frame
 The frame may be simplistic, but it just goes great with the painting
Moon Studios have made a strong debut with this game, and I can't wait to see what else they have in store for us in the future
 If you have the money to spare, I highly recommend you pick this up; or wait until the next big sales event and maybe you will find it for cheap
 Either way, it's worth every penny
Posted: 26 December, 2015
Everyone should play this game
I've never written a review of a Steam game, so take the existence of this one as a testament to the impact it had on me
The gameplay is fantastic, sort of like Metroid, sort of like Donkey Kong, sort of like so many other classics
 And yet Ori stands on its own
 Ori is intuitive; it's inventive; it's surprisingly challenging (I died over 200 times in the 10 hours it took me to complete it
) But damn, is it fun
 Everything is seamless
 And I mean everything
 From the minimalist interface, to the controls, to the microsecond load time between dying and respawning - the latter of which you, like me, will come to know well
 And equally well the fact that you can save, more or less, wherever you want
Power ups and ability trees keep things fresh, and like a good piece of Zelda equipment, every addition to your platforming repertoire opens up a whole new mechanic to the gameplay
The story is as flawless as the game
 (And the opening is as memorable as the ending
 Have ready a bucket for your tears
)Few action platformers have a decent story to accompany it
 Ori is different
 No, the game doesn’t play itself; it isn’t one of those
 Rather, like a player to respawn points (see: this game), gameplay and narrative are intimately connected; character actions are justified, and power ups serve the story and the player
 The result is that each accomplishment you make is both rewarding and intensely satisfying
I testify to what others have said: the game looks beautiful, sounds beautiful, plays beautifully
 Everything about it is stunning
 But don't be fooled: it's beautiful *and* hard
 If you aren't a skilled platformer now, play Ori and the Blind Forest
 You will be
10/10
Posted: 13 March, 2015
This game
it's damn near perfect
 The art direction and animation are really tight and well executed, the controls are something to be envied and are incredibly well done, the music is captivating and remains in my head well after I've put the controller down
I am completely and utterly head over heels for this game
 I look forward to exploring more in this game
 The sense of accomplishment you feel from gaining a new ability to reach a part of the map that was previously unavailable is particularly satisfying
 I wish I had more time for this amazing experience
I can't recommend this game enough
 Anyone considering this game, don't consider
 Just buy
 Install
 Play
 You won't be sorry
Posted: 24 March, 2015
TL;DR --> vmdflgnsdjgnvk lkdfj gvbjk 11/10---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------From time to time a game appears that gives a lesson to every developer and company about how to make games properly
 Well, Ori is one of those games
Even though perfection will never exist in videogames IMO, I find it really hard to search for cons into this game
 Just notice that I was very hyped about Hotline Miami 2 for almost a year and I honestly admit that this hype banished once I purchased Ori
 Ori and the Blind Forest brings something new, something fresh, something NEEDED
 I can't imagine the amount of work required to build a game like this but trust me people, devs can be hugely proud of it
 Visuals are the closest to perfection I've ever seen in a videogame
 Just see it for yourselves and get stunned about what a 2D platformer can give you
 Seriously, you don't need to go to an art museum anymore
 This game is well enough
 From beginning to end it'll be impossible for you not to stare at every single detail, every singe hand-made background
The tag "Great Soundtrack" is not one of the most voted without a reason
 Such a great visuals strongly need a great soundtrack too, and that's what you'll find
 Tracks add so much feeling and emotion into this game that together with the visuals it becomes one of the greatest combinations of the WHOLE industry
Controls are tight and super fair
 Mind this words: the game is challenging and every single death will be of your fault
 This is the regular metroidvania where you get more movement skills as soon as you progress into the story
 I found quite some similarities to the experience I got with Guacamelee (in terms of gameplay)
The story
 OMG
 Just when I thought I saw everything a 2D platformer could give (mostly soft and simple plots), this game appears
 20 minutes were enough for me to start clapping in front of the screen
 This game has one of the strongest prologues I've ever played
 AND IT'S IN 2D
 SO MANY LIMITATIONS, YET SUCH AN INCREDIBLE EXECUTION
 The length is also good enough
 Not too long, but not too short either
 Map is extremely well planned, together with collectibles and secrets
 Getting everything can perfectly give you 8-10h, which is more than the average platformer can offer
Finally, achievements are very well written too
 This sounds stupid but it's sad to see some nice games where the achievements are completely senseless or wrongly directed
 This game has every kind of achievement I like: storyline achievements, collectible achievements, movement achievements, and hardcore achievements
 I think that the only con I can find to this game is that sometimes there are so many glowing things together that you can't really distinguish the friendly ones against the enemy bullets
 But this mainly applies to one particular enemy and I'm partially colorblind so I can't say it's a con at all
Overall, just stop buying mediocre bundles nor triple A games
 Do yourself a favor and pay 20€ for this game
 We're in front of one of the best games of the year, and we're still on March
 But seriously, this game is something I've never seen before (and I've played more games than I can count) and probably no one will dislike this game (aside from fake haters and people pretending to be funny)
 Final Mark: 9
75/10 this is one of the best 2D platformers you'll play in a very long time

So I was skeptical about this game but I kept hearing good things so I picked it up one steam sale and forgot about it
A year and a half later I see it in my unplayed favorties list and decide what the hey lets give it a shot
OMG from the intro I was hooked it really punches you right in the feels im a grown man and I had tears in my eyes during several parts of this game
The Visuals are amazing
The Game play is fun but can be old NES hudsons adventure island dont mess up once difficulty but remained fun and a challange
Those escape sequiences good lord I was on edge and of course yelled at the monitor a few times
 ok more the a few times
The soundtrack well it was so good I bought it which is rare
If this is any indication I have never seriously NEVER reviewed a game before on steam and I felt compelled to write up on this one
Truely one of the best games I have played in years
Posted: 27 November, 2015
-Bought it on sale-Refunded it-Waited until sale ended-Bought it for fullprice
Posted: 2 April, 2015
I very, very rarely review games, so I'm doing this out of sheer respect and thankfulness for the developer, Moon Studios
Ori is easily
one of the best games
I have bought on a whim (in 8 years of Steam), and had I had any idea of that
 well, it wouldn't have been on a whim
 The art is probably what stands out the most, but that's only because the controls are so well implemented, they never really took me out of this immersive - and touching - story
 Not for a second, honestly
It was sufficiently challenging for me as a seasoned gamer, but I'm more than sure it shouldn't be frustrating for any casual gamer who doesn't possess a really, really short temper
 In fact, I cannot think of another game that made me care so little about dying and having to repeat the same difficult scenes
 To the opposite: I was so excited by them (in no small part thanks to the amazing soundtrack and artwork that surely accompanied), that I sometimes died on purpose at the end of a tough part to try to play it again more perfectly
 I feel like this is a really big deal and I hope you believe me
I can honestly think of only one con: you cannot (as of yet at least) continue playing your save after you finish the game
 I wish I had known this before, because I truly wanted to go back and finish it 100% - something I'm not at all used to - but I'm sure I'll play through it again
 By the way, I makes me happy that the Ori has TEN different slots for you and your family/friends to start a game on
 I don't understand why so many games lack that
In short, I HIGHLY recommend playing Ori, and I can see no contraindications to warn buyers of
 Gameplay, art and soundtrack are truly remarkable, and the story is surprising and nothing short of beautiful
 This is a game that stands out, and one to remember for a long, long time
 Thank you and congratulations to the developers for making such a brilliant game, and selling it for such fair price
Things Ori reminded me of, while playing: Studio Ghibli, Rayman, Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons, Guacamelee, Disney, The Lion King
I'll finish by quoting another reviewer: "Oh how I wish there were more games like this one, especially when they come out of nowhere like this one did
" One of the best things I've played
Posted: 10 March, 2015
I have been waiting for this game since E3 2014 and boy does it deliver
 Absolutely breathtaking visuals, wonderful ambient soundtrack, and an emotional story that brought me to tears less than 5 minutes into the game
 It's also a pretty challenging platformer with some light RPG elements, so there's plenty to like about it
Do yourself a favor and buy this game
 You won't regret it

Early Access Review
Sigmar's Garden is a fun cross between solitaire and chinese checkers, with a couple dorks providing color commentary every so completions
 The rules are puzzling at first, but the elements of strategy and forward thinking gradually develop through play
 It's relaxing to map out your pathing strategy around the quicksilver and metal marbles, or to find ways to cut through bunched up lanes
 Overall, a great complement with absentminded YouTube watching
 The attached game, Opus Magnum, is a pretty neat programming puzzler too
In all seriousness, the main thing to mention is that Opus Magnum is the most beginner-friendly Zachtronics game yet
 For instance, you get a luxurious unlimited scrolling canvas for you to make incredibly inefficient contraptions
This makes the game so much less frustrating to work through, as you won't be constrained by space was you were in SHENZHEN I/O, more so in TIS-100, and infuriatingly so in SpaceChem
 For all the discussion about the game being easier, the real difficulty lies in defeating your friends' histograms, as Zach has somehow realized that friends do a much better job at motivating better solutions than a difficulty wall
And really, there's something a lot more intuitive about clockwork arms passing around marbles, as opposed to trying to grok how XBUS works or avoiding message collisions between TIS-100 nodes
As such, this is probably the most friendly game to start with for a newbie Zach-like player
 That the solutions often move like beautiful clockwork and can be easily exported as animated gifs also helps with the feeling of recreational accomplishment
Update 10-26-2017: (Finished the main story campaign, and ordered the iron-on patch)Wow golly this game could use a way to speed up to later breakpoints, or to skip state to a program location
 And divine architect help you if you need to insert more steps near the beginning of a long work-in-progress instruction chain, where you need to delay the rest of the concurrent multi-page instruction sequences in all the other components
Still, it's very doable to beat this game, but the last few levels involve some very intricate bonding patterns, and can take a ton of instructions to complete
 In the end, I was satisfied with how the plot wraps up, though the level design was a grind for me at the end
I'm not sure if the depth of the systems and puzzle design lives up to those of SHENZHEN I/O, but the relative simplicity may be a strong reason to recommend this game as a first Zachtronics game
 For more theoretical players, I'm not sure if the systems here are Turing Complete, and I can't imagine how you would implement NAND (perhaps the needed components can be introduced in a later update
)
That said, one could argue that it is elegance, not systems design, that shines in high skill play here
 Along those lines, I'm looking forward to seeing some really elegant animated solutions from others
 Just seeing Notch's solutions on Twitter just proves how messy my problem solving style was
In the end, this setting and story is easily my favorite out of all the other Zachtronics games, being strongly evocative as a mashup of The Diamond Age and The Baroque Cycle
 This is an incredible remake of The Codex Of Alchemical Engineering, and suggesting the latter flash game as a demo doesn't do justice to the massive improvements since the last decade
If Opus Magnum was this much of an improvement, I'm kind of curious what a remake of Bureau of Steam Engineering could be like
 Come on Zach, you know you've thought about rebooting the universe of Ironclad Tactics
 ;)

Did you enjoy SpaceChem even a little
 Buy this, as it's an upgrade in most departments
Did you skip previous Zachtronics games because they were too real-world oriented and resembled actual programming of components and hardware more than you would like
 Buy this, as it's the most gamey puzzle game of the bunch
Do you have any interest in open-ended puzzles with no fixed solution that allow you to work with all their components in any way you please, presented with brilliant production values, clarity and elegance
 Buy this
I was a SpaceChem religious fanatic but this might be my new favorite Zachtronics game

Be warned, there are some big issues with UI/Scaling/Resolution on this game that Zachtronics have confirmed on a recent Gamasutra podcast/stream (broadcast Nov 1st, 3pm Eastern Time - go to 15:34 of the video on youtube, search 'gamasutra opus magnum') that they have NO intention of fixing at any point during this game
 It is an issue they don't hope to tackle until their NEXT game
This has never been an issue on any other Zachtronics game 
 but it is a big issue now
 It goes like this, it appears they designed this aesthetically simple 2d puzzle game with 1080 resolution in mind, and nothing else
 I am running 1366x768 
 and at this resolution, the game elements are HUGE 
 the UI panels are HUGE 
 and the gaming area you can see at any one time is TINY, likewise for the instruction lane that you need to input instructions is SHORT
 You can only see 24 instructions at any one time, and this issue is compounded by the fact your view of the instruction pane won't scroll when you are trying to select a larger sequence of instructions, or when you're trying to paste a sequence you just selected (fingers crossed super firmly that at the very least that can be solved, otherwise consider this game a total write off if you want to play anything but the simplest of levels)
this is a big problem for more than just one reason 
 1st of all, the later puzzles of the game you will be asked to produce products that take up the entire visible gaming area (if you're on less than 1080) 
 just imagine all the scrolling around you're going to have to do to manufacture the product, you will never have an over-view of the entire solution you are working on, and furthermore you will never completely see your solution in action unless you render it to gif and view it in a gif viewer 
 what the actual feck
the 2nd reason this is a significant problem, as if that really wasn't bad enough, is that the game is the most 'accessible' (i
e easiest, and I include optimisations in that summation) zachtronics game yet 
 so to get a decent challenge going, you're going to be relying on those levels with larger products 
 and if you're using a monitor that is less than 1080 the biggest challenge won't be in solving the puzzles, it will be in enduring the tedium of mousing around the gaming area of a 2d puzzler that absolutely should not be having this scaling problem
people with 4k monitors seem to be having an inverse issue to this
 But between people on the lower end of the resolution spectrum and the higher end of the resolution spectrum, this has been a frequently made feature request - to FIX this issue
So, while I have not seen the issue addressed directly on Opus Magnum's Steam discussion area (where it should be addressed, I would have thought), I instead learn that Zachtronics have absolutely NO intention of fixing it via a Gamasutra podcast 
 wtf 
 
 Not only that, there is a brazen streak of arrogance in their manner of addressing the problem on that podcast 
 basically anyone suffering with this problem has a 'terrible, dank, old laptop that's 5 years old' 
 This laptop isn't 5 years old, it is a midrange toshiba 2
5+ years ago
 Their attitude to 4k users isn't so toxic, but it is no more considerate
 Basically if you're monitor isn't 1080, either larger or smaller, you're the problem 
 Well, I put it to you that if a developer working on an aesthetically simple 2d puzzler is having these issues, to such degree that he can't solve it without 'rewriting the game' 
 it is the visual programmer, or the game designer, who is the problem 
 I am honestly not sure where the buck stops on that one, but I am really shocked that this is an issue
 and an issue that won't be resolved
to add insult to injury, not only have they not addressed this on steam, but they haven't even made a note of it in the minimum tech requirements to play the game on the store page 
 how can they in good conscious speak about this problem as brazenly and dismissively as they do on gaming podcasts, acknowledging that it won't be fixed, but still refuse to alert potential customers of this problem 
 that seems to be bordering on willfull deceit, imo
this game is good in other ways 
 but just past the midway point and the UI/scaling problem is already causing serious interface issues where enjoyment is taking a hit, and more time is being spent trying to compensate for the programmer's failings
 this will only get worse as the products you are asked to produce get bigger, and the instruction sequences get longer
So if your monitor is not 1080 
 beware
 I can not reccommend this game for anyone playing at monitor resolutions other than that 
 even if it would be at a 50% discount, I would say be prepared for a very awkward gaming experience if you're running a 'terrible computer' with a 'dank' 1366 x768 resolution monitor 
 like, get real man, don't expect the developer to do something crazy like make his 2d puzzler scalable or develop it in such a way that it wouldn't need to be scaled

Posted: 20 October
Early Access Review
Another great Zachtronics game
Great puzzles which gameplay is an evolution from "The Codex of Alchemical Engineering", a free Zachtronics flash game available on their website if you want to try it as a "demo" before buying
What I would like to remark is the stunning art and presentation, I feel they keep improving in this regard game after game
 The story is compelling enough to keep you interested in solving puzzles besides their inherent challenge
As they keep proving, Zachtronics is one of the few developers that I can trust to deliver an excellent game on day 1
Posted: 23 October
Early Access Review
SummaryI've played every game by Zachtronics except for TIS-100 and this is definitely my favorite one
 Shenzhen was great but I prefer a more fantasy settings of Opus Magnum; and especially when compared to SpaceChem I love how it offers you much more freedom - you choose the location of both input and output which may make it easier, but lets you get a lot more creative
 Graphics are much improved and feel fresh compared to CAD-like Shenzhen
 The story lets you feel like a powerful alchemist and while perhaps a bit cliched is really fun to explore and I would love to see expansion packs that explore the world a bit more
 Overall, I can't recommend this game enough
 If you like puzzles then this is definitely one of the best games on the market, if not THE best one
 I really love it that what I do really means something - you're not just solving one puzzle after another to solve some mystery, but you get a lot of opportunities to produce something that will be of importance - like fuel for an airship, waterproof sealants for ships, or a device that will let the surplus lead be turned into gold
 Solving every puzzle, however, lets you advance and explore the story so your price is twofold, at least for me
 The price is low for the amount of fun, and the game, though Early Access, is not buggy and seems very polished
 It's truly a staple of quality
What works1
 The setting
 I like it much more than the previous ones, and would really love to see it explored a bit more
 2
 The graphics - they are definitely a huge improvement over previous ones and are, simply put, gorgeous
 The world is colorful, elements symbols are clear, and the way machinery works made me simply keep staring at the working machines for a long time - they are very elegant, yet simple, something that a person that loves engineering can truly appreciate
 3
 Steam Workshop - you can easily download and solve hundreds of different puzzles available online and easily make your own, which allows for an almost endless replayability
 4
 Sigmar's Garden - a rather simply minigame, but really addictive
 5
 And finally puzzles themselves - the difficulty progression curve is handled very smoothly, and you get a really well-planned tutorial that explains pretty much everything in a very simple way; the graphs that show how effective your design is compared to those of other players makes you feel really competitive, striving for the utmost perfection; and they're no longer too constrained due to the predefined inputs and outputs like in the previous games
 Overall, solving them was much more fun than in any other puzzle game 
What doesn't work1
 There are not that many metals available - just six, but that's a nitpick
 2
 I would love it if there were some storage containers for what you make - like vials and flasks, but then again, there are no liquid ingredients

Summary : A lot easier than other Zachtronics titles, but a worthwhile purchase for Zachtronics fans and beginners with an addictive solitaire game
Compared to SpaceChem and TIS-100, Opus Magnum has an infinitely scrolling board on which to build and plan your mechanisms
 This allows for a lot more leniancy in design of your solutions which, while making the game "easier" to create a functional solution, also creates a lot of potenital for optimization and faster running solutions
 There are a few hidden features which should be more advertized (control drag to copy instructions or components, A/D to rotate selections while dragging) but it's pretty mninor
 The story mode also feels a lot shorter than the other titles (It took this reviewer ~8 hours to complete, with fairly average solutions for someone not completely dedicated in finding optimal solutions)
 This isn't neccisairly a bad thing, with the promised additonal puzzles from community puzzles and the wealth of options in the Steam Workshop
 The story is also quite charming, if a tad cliched
 The artwork is wonderfully vibrant and colourful, and complements the story and gameplay well
The solitaire mode, a Mahjong-solitaire like puzzle, is also very fun (and maybe even a little more addicitive than the main game
), set up so that every game is winnable from the start, which ensures the only frustration you get from a failed attempt is your own fault
 (It also doesn't tell you when you've failed, which is a lot more satisfying than a pop-up exclaiming that you've lost
)Overall a great game, if a little more forgiving than fans of Zachtronics' unique brand of puzzle might have come to expect, but for the price, (for this user) a definate buy

Opus Magnum is OK, but it lacks complexity compared to Zach's previous games
 There is no state feedback element in this game (e
g
 sensors) or means of varying the operations performed based on the state of the system
 This makes for a more accessible experience, however for Zachlike veterans this open-loop limitation makes for a noticably simplified experienced
 Perfectly good game, but manage your expectations - this is not SpaceChem's second coming

Let me say something before anything else
 This game was honestly amazing and mind blowing
 I love playing games like this and this is a great example why
 The story is very deep and in a way, you really do care about it
 I dont want to write a whole review about the game because you simply need to just play it
 If you really want, you could refund the game and get your money back, but in my eyes, this game went above and beyond and it stays in my library so I can play it again
Posted: 23 June
This is one of those games that is filled with artistic value and an intriguing story
 I found myself drawn in quite quickly and even though it was a very short game, it didnt feel that way as I progressed
 I believe it was created by people who truly love storytelling and the industry arts
 You move through a house full of secrets and memories while enjoying varied gameplay mechanics and pieces of the story behind the Finch family
 + Fully narrated with voice over which I love in a game like this
+ Beautiful art design
 + A story that makes you think deeply
+ I felt the value was present from start to finish
+ Game mechanics are fun and intuitive
 There was no hassle or break in immersion
- A little short- A little pricey (I felt it was worth it by the end though)I would highly recommend this to my friends
 Well done devs
Posted: 10 June
It's hard to find words to describe this game
 It's gobsmacking
 There are very few games that make me stop just to put a hand to my mouth and ssay "Oh my God"
 But this is one of them
 The story was incredible, and I found myself playing it all in one sitting
 It's quite short, but don't let that put you off
 It's the perfect length for what it is, any longer, it would have dragged on, any shorter, it would have seem rushed
 It's perfect, and I have nothing negative to say
 Just play it

What the hell is this game, you may ask
Let me try to answer this the following way
 It is something special, so it deserves an unusual approach:-	First person exploration, story driven, surreal and weird… -	Brilliant alternative gameplay concept and ideas… (play an interactive comic, control several animals, etc
)-	Breathtakingly beautiful, detailed setting/graphics… (exception: the sky isn’t done well)-	Excellent music, sound, narration and story
-	Duration: 3 hours to get 100% (…couldn’t stop playing till I got 100%
)Impressions: It is so creative, intense, disturbing, touching and wonderful how you experience things in this game
 You will be confronted with death, a lot
 Each of the deaths are done interestingly, and often take you by surprise, and it's a game about loss, heartache, and happiness
 It's a rollercoaster, but well handled
Never experienced something like this before
 10/10 (personal opinion, as this is my favorite genre)
Posted: 19 July
An interesting game- This game is like a set of stories in a main history , the main character is Edith Finch
 A girl who comes back to her old house in the state of Washington in the US
to try to research the strange histories that happened in the house to her family members 
- As i said it
is like a set of stories because every bedroom has an interesting history that catches you
about what happened with the the owner of the bedroom as
main character of the small history
 - The gameplay is easy and simple , walk Interact with the environment
and explore 
 - The graphics are really beautiful and same is
the soundtrack 
 - The only bad is this game is short but it
is worth 
- I recommend this game
Posted: 10 May
Life is shortLove your family more10/10
Posted: 1 May
What Remains of Edith Finch tells the story of Finch family
 You play as Edith returning to her old house and finding out what exactly happened to everyone
 The game tells the stories in a beautifully fantastic way and I'd say it is a piece of art
 Playing this gave me quite a lot of feels, because it is sad and heartbreaking as you slowly learn more of the family
Finishing it doesn't take very long, from 2h+ depending on the player
 All you mostly do is walk around and exploring objects, aka one of those "walking simulators"
 Those who love story rich experiences I recommend to play this and see what remains of Edith, but for some the price might be too high considering that it's not a very long game and might not have much replay value (again depends on each player)
 I think though, that it doesn't matter because WRoEF is such a good game
Posted: 24 May
What Remains Of Edith Finch is a fantastic game
 Yes, it's one of those walking simulators
 But it is also one of those games, that will keep you thinking afterwards about what you just experienced for quite a while
 It is unique, creative, beautiful
 I see it easily at the very top of the genre together with games like Firewatch, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and others
 At times it is sad, at others it is delightful
 Often it's both at the same time
 When it is at its peak, it very effectively mixes the strong, melancholic narrative with gameplay in a way, that at its core reminds me of Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons
 It's these moments that are the strongest ones
 It may just be a linear walking simulator, but the fact that you are in control, that you have to execute the motions of the character right before fate takes its course, shows how effective games can be be in transmitting emotions to the player
 Maybe in some cases more so than movies
9/10
Posted: 16 May
I'm writing this in tears right now
The entire game is a slow-motion up and down of emotions
The writing and the narration delivery are some of the best in a game
By the end, I was so spent, I cried, and I'm not afraid to admit that
This is a very beautiful game
The house is so perfect
 I literally felt as if I was in a house well-lived in by many generations
The amount of interactions with objects was perfect, and mouse motion needed to interact with and move things was intuitive
The small details of people's lives left in a house were perfectly done
Every story of a family member was done differently, and they immersed me in each one
You become invested in this family's history and touching stories which bring a smile, a laugh, or a tear
This is well worth the money
You can't judge this one on length, rather evaluate it on content

It's a well polished game where the loot is actually viable to use
 You are not just selling everything to the vendor but you find stuff that you can use and come up with different combinations for your characters like maybe an embermage that carries a gun and a shield or a traditional weapon like a staff or even two wands
 Simple put: the itemization in the game is enormous
 There are skill trees available that offer numerous different builds
 For example, I started with an embermage and went all +Ice damage
 But then I added some fire gear and spells and now I have a completely unique spell build that just makes me want to create another embermage to try out different combinations
The only thing that I am not a big fan of is the art work and bright color scheme of the game
 At first it wasn't my cup of tea per say but it actually does work well for the style of story they are presenting the customers/gamers
It's extremely well done
 There is no Auction House or Real Money Auction House
 It is the standard for an ARPG and what a game should be

TL;DR
 See ConclusionNOTE: Related ContentAlso see my:Torchlight (1) ReviewINTRODUCTION:Torchlight II is an isometric action Role-Playing Game developed and published by Runic Games who's composed of developers from popular titles such as Fate and the Diablo (1 and 2)
 This game was designed to resurrect the old school dungeon crawler genre adding to it a fresh coat of paint and an attempt to quench the thirst for the classical isometric experience
 True to the formula on what made the first Torchlight great, Torchlight 2 is one of the better Dungeon Crawler / Top-Down Action RPG available in the market
PLOT (No Spoilers):The game takes place several years after the first game
 The Alchemist, one of the three original heroes, gets corrupted by the Heart of Odrak, the monster that was the source of evil that plagued the small town of Torchlight
 The Alchemist, wearing new power armor and wielding the Heart of Odrak, destroys the town and sets out on a mysterious quest that would, if not stopped, eventually disrupt the flow of nature and interrupt the delicate balance of power in the world
 PROS:+ Classic gameplay with nice little tweaks to fit the modern age of gaming+ Colorful Graphics+ Good level variation and environment design+ New classes and a much more varied choices for pets+ Much more complex skill tree: This is a good new addition from the first game
 More complex and more specialized player builds are sure to come up
+ Good re-playability: Lots of characters, lots of builds and lots of loot
+ Multiplayer option that was absent in the first game+ Better end game content+ PC hardware friendly+ Steam Workshop Support+ Does not require 24 hour internet connection to play
 CONS:- Inferior voice acting: -Unlike Diablo II who had very good dialogue and memorable quotes
- Inconsistent volume levels on dialogue: -background music can sometimes drown NPC voices
- Confusing Story: -The story isn't immersive enough to keep you interested
 Story is also very difficult to comprehend without paying close attention and references
- Inconsistent Difficulty: -Normal is extremely easy that you will probably get bored the moment you get some of your more powerful skills/spells
 Hard and Elite however are extremely difficult that it would make a frustrating experience to the casual gamer
 I would recommend playing at Hard since I believe that getting a better challenge is much more acceptable than getting bored
- Connecting to multiplayer can sometimes be difficultCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME, GREAT BUY and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
WORTH IT
:Whether this game is at full price or on a sale, this game is worth your money
FINAL NOTES:Torchlight 2 is a great spiritual successor to the classic Diablo games that provides a good alternative to the Always-Online Diablo 3 experience (specially if you're only looking for a Singleplayer or Local play
) WORTH IT
:This is a MUST BUY and MUST TRY title for both fans of the classic isometric RPG games and new players alike

I didn't buy this for a long time, despite wanting to try it, because in my opinion, once you'd played one Diablo clone, you'd played them all
 And I still hold this opinion to be very true in a lot of ways - for example, Titan Quest, while initally intriguing, became a hellish repetitive single-player slog through to the end that, after 20-something hours of playtime, left me exhasted and scarred
 Torchlight, however, surpised me
 Perhaps it has something to do with the well-designed classes that aren't quite as derivative as many Diablo-clones, or the deep levelling system that allows so much variation within the same class, or the well-honed difficulty scaling that makes you feel like you're always growing, or perhaps it's all these features combined that make this game stand out
 The controls are intuitive and the mechanics of the game are well-implimented
 The enemies are numerous and varied, and there's always surprises to be found in every corner of the randomly-generated maps
 The champions and bosses are similarly frequent in appearance, a factor which helps to eliminate that feeling that you're just grinding a way, wasting time until you fight a boss battle
 In saying that, playing this game on single player, I did feel like I was taking part in the occasional grind through enemies and loot and levels, which bordered on tedious at time, but playing with a friend and sharing that burden eliminated that feeling entirely
 On the topic of multiplayer, I felt that it could have been slightly better implimented, in that, for one, it took forever for my friend and I to find each other in the server screen, and there was a bug that occasionally stopped us from adding one another without a full game restart
 Also, unlike the Borderlands games (the pinnacle of intuitive multiplayer connectivity in my opinion), you cannot see what missions your partner has to do, so you're contantly relying on them telling you what they're up to (via text chat, if you don't have steam chat), and if you're more advanced than your partner, then any enemies that you've killed won't reappear for your partner, regardless of who is hosting the server
 Although I'm sure there's a reason for these issues, they seem like really bizarre features to omit from the game
 I mean, sure, you may get a tad overpowered if you're allowed to kill creatures a second time round, but is that really worse than your partner being forced to wade through a sea of emptiness, constantly underpowered due to lack of combat
 In any case, all I can recommend is that you start multiplayer games at exactly the same time
Torchlight 2 is a well-made, deep and enjoyable experience, especially with friends, that separates itself enough from other Diablo clones to really stand at the top of the pile

Torchlight II does some things very well
 It does other things very poorly
 Whether you like the game will come down directly to what type of RPG you like
Comparable game: Titan Quest
You will like Torchlight if:1) You enjoy character building
 Torchlight II has 4 distinct character types that each have at least 2 clear build paths
 The replayability is there- From a run-an-gun shotgunner to a life sucking mage
2) You enjoy the intracacies of finding and equipping the best armor/weapons and grinding/searching for more
 3) You enjoy doing multiple playthroughs
You will not like Torchlight II if:1) You want a story driven RPG
2) You want an RPG with battle mechanics that are more then button smashing
3) You cant stand 'guns' in a classic RPG
4) You want a 'deep' RPG
 Beyond character building TLII is pretty shallow

I am a 50+ year old man who is fascinated by ecomomy, simulation, strategy, type games and much to my chagrin, I am absolutely horrible at them
 But I keep buying them, have a blast for like an hour or two until my economies or strategies start failing as they always do because I have a really hard time getting a grasp for all the intricacies of these type of games
 Frankly, they make me feel stupid because I don't understand all the mechanics enough to play a decent game
When this game came along it was pretty much the same thing for me
 But this game was a bit different
 It was so beautiful and the trains and vehicles were breathtakingly fresh compared to most games
 Zooming in on horse drawn carts moving around and gorgeous old European buildings was like being on a European vacation
 Seeing people move around in the city made them seem alive
 I was desperate to learn this game
 So I went to Youtube and watched a video series about this game by a guy named Skye Storme
 He basically started from scratch on a large map and just played for like 15 youtube sessions while explaining what he was doing in each session
 It was amazing
 I did not follow his plan but used many of his tips and tricks and suddenly some of my transportation lines were making profit
 My cities started to grow
 I would get 4 linked cities operating so well that I could move on to other cities and try to work these as well
 I would spend entire weekends playing completely focused on the game, losing all track of time, whooping and hollering each time I had a profitable year, marvelling at the effiiciency of my transportation systems
 I got better and better
 Soon just having great transportation wasn't enough
 Most of my cities were still poor
 I began to expand my skills into building them up through commerce
 Skye Storme's videos helped me through while allowing me to still maintain my own original plans
 I began to experiment and it was so much fun
even when I would sometimes fail on some particular task
The game is amazing
 You
can open windows to every vehicle running in the game, click a button and watch them as they travel and work
 You can form terrain
 As the years go by, you update to newer types of transportation and each new model that comes out is absolutely gorgeous
 Old trains covered with brass that shines and shows reflections, neat looking automobiles that have character, Incredible ships and planes that you just want to follow around and stare at, Hundreds of mods for so many awesome trains and vehicles, I could go on and on
You get announcements every few years in game of new vehicles and it's so exciting to buy them and watch them come out of depots or warehouses just to see what they look like and I'm never disappointed
The game isn't easy
it's challenging, but it's not "beat your head against the table" challenging
it's a fun challenge because you know
can usually spot your mistakes and you don't have to quit if you make one
you just suck up the losses for that year and try to get better and this aspect is one of the
most rewarding aspects
 Even on easy mode, you risk losing money in any given year if your ideas don't work out like you thought, but you can always try to turn it around and
that's such a great aspect of this game
 You never feel cheated or like the game is unfair
 Usually you can spot your mistake and correct it by the following ingame year and cheer mightily as you start to see profits on thet failure of a hub the year before
 You'll find yourself short of cash at times and have to borrow money
 I've been five million in debt at times and it's a glorious feeling when the gamble you took on loans begins to pay off and you start paying back your debt
 If you've ever been interested in this kind of game, buy it
 Like I said
I'm terrible at these games normally, but this one is accessible if you study some youtube videos first or if you already have skills at this type of game
 I hear the difficulty ramps up tremendoudly at hard and even medium mode for those who seek a challenge
I love this game
 It's so well made and I feel like some mogul tycoon when everything is working properly and I'm seeing 100 people milling about at one of my train stations or see a beautiful new tanker I just purchased sailing out of port filled with resources or a wagon piled high with brick being pulled by two prancing horses, or seeing one of my farms so filled with grain that I decide to open a new line, or seeing some rare German plane from the 1930's soaring in the sky filled with passengers
 I can't wait to play today
Update: Still learning the game every day
 One important factor I mess up on sometimes is that you must be certain to complete the path of products you are producing in order for your transportation lines to run properly
 For instance: Train line to oil fields > send that line to a station at an oil refinery > send that line to either a city that uses fuel or a factory that uses oil > if you send it to a factory that uses oil to make products you must then add a line to a place that uses that product,
> You must then take the finished product to the town of your choosing
 Skipping any of these stations will cause one of your producers to quit producing and you will lose money until you add the proper line
Another tip: Watch how many people you have at train stations and monitor how many are left after a train leaves filled with passengers
 If the station consistently draws more passengers than you can carry, consider buying another train for extra profit
 You can either install a second track (expensive) or use waypoints and signals to make two trains run efficiently on one track
 (Much cheaper)
Ships are awesome
 I've had some profitable ship lines delivering products to cities that border rivers or lakes since you don;t need additional trucking routes to deliver them into the city
 I usually put one truck depot near the dock and one near the business and industrial heart of the city and can usually turn a profit
Second update: After about a week of playing an hour or two every evening, I have built a very successful (for me) transportation system and I'm having a blast
 My cities are filled with people
 Cranes are constantly constructing new buildings and you never know what they will be until built which to me is way more exciting than actually choosing what to build
 After all, I'm building the transportation lines not the housing and industrial complexes
 It is so cool though to see a building come up and see it turn into a store or hotel
 I'm into the 1900's now so I have early types of automobiles and trucks
 They are so incredibly detailed and above all so neat looking
 I also have awesome looking trains and they are getting really fast
 Best of all for the first time I was able to quit borrowing money
 I paid off my loans and actually accumulated 2 million dollars
 In the next day or so I'm going to link my grain fields to a plastics factory and also my oil wells to a refinery and then also to the plastics factoryso I can manufacture plastics to deliver to my city to boost the economy even more
 This game is just awesome once you get the hang of it

If you're interested in economic simulator management games such as Cities Skylines or Transport Tycoon, then you should really check this out
 The visuals are great, the economic system robust (if not a little finicky at times), and the UI is good
 The game lacks some explanation and the tutorials leave a bit to be desired (specifically on how the supply chains work as they are very different than Transport Tycoon but the same as their previous game, Train Fever which I never played)
 I had to rely on community guides and video tutorials to figure out some of these aspects
 But it's a testament to how fun it is to simply build track and trains that I stuck with it and figured it out
 There is simply a great sense of satisfaction in getting a rail line up and running
 Setting up successful supply chains and building a train empire is great fun
The campaign is good, albeit a bit wonky and cheesy at times in a good way
 I enjoyed playing through it and it helped to slowly introduce game concepts and new vehicles gradually
 There are no AI opponents, which would have made for a fun additional game mode but I do not miss them all that much
 Building up your own train/transport empire is the star of this game here and seeing the technological progress over time is very fun too
 Did I mention how great the vehicles and visuals look, especially for an economic sim
 The vehicles truly stand out, as they should
 Some folks have complained that there is a lack of vehicle options, but there are a lot of mods you can use to fill in this gap
 I'm 80 hours in and I've still not used all the base game vehicles so I don't feel this way
Overall, I feel that this game is a bit underrated
 I've also been disappointed at the lack of media attention it's received
 Furthermore, the developers have released some key patches that have fixed some of the slowdown issues and improved the UI so it's only gotten better since released
 It's not perfect but it's the closest thing to a Tranport Tycoon 2 that we have and it stands well on its own
 I highly recommend it

I consider Transport Fever to be an unpolished gem
 On one hand, I really enjoy playing it, as it does the important things very well
 On the other hand, though, it has plenty of problems
 The result, for me, felt kind of like taking a shower on a cold day with a faulty water heater, so the temperature of the water keeps flactuating between too cold and too hot
 Having played for over 250 hours (at the time of writing this review), it's evident I chose to keep playing despite the problems
The good side of the game, in my opinion, consists of the main gameplay mechanics
 Much like in previous games of this genre, including Transport Fever's own predecessor, Train Fever, the purpose is to build and manage your own network of transportation routes
 You build roads, railway tracks, sea ports and airports, plan routes, buy vehicles and manage your fleet and infrastructure
 While I have some serious reservations about some aspects of the economy (some of which I'll list and describe later on), the system does feel balanced well, in general, and is definitely complex and interesting enough to carry the whole game on its shoulders
 Also, the models of the vehicles look really well, and from what I understand from others, are also realistic
As for the negatives - while the game is fun to play, sometimes to the degree of being addictive, some issues take much of the fun out of the experience
 The most significant of those issues, in my opinion, are the user interface and the performance issues
 The game barely uses more than one CPU core, which practically means really low FPS values even on the best of hardware, especially when playing on advanced stages of the game
 This issue has been addressed and improved on one of the recent patches to the game, but the game still stutters and lags like crazy - enough to sometimes cause me to quit in frustration, even though I'm playing on a relatively fast computer (Intel i7 2
9Ghz, Quad-Core with 16GB RAM)
 As for the user interface - well, sometimes it feels like the developers of the game just didn't think things through before making decisions
 Some of the problems have already been addressed and fixed on a recent patch, but many still remain:1) When you upgrade a train station (adding platforms or upgrading tracks to high-speed, for example), all the passenger or cargo items which either wait at the station to be picked up, or on their way to that station - will vanish as if never existed
 This problem has much to do with the game's AI as with the user inteface, and perhaps the closest to the definition of "game breaking", as if it happens mid or late game, it can easily lead you to bancrupcy - all by a mere few clicks of the mouse, without any warnings
 Another effect of upgrading a station is that trains on the affected route will sometimes change direction for no apparent reason, and end up halting the entire traffic on the network (causing more losses, as maintenance costs keep accumulating as the time goes by, but since the trains can't move, no passengers or cargo get transported, so you don't get paid)
2) The cargo system is awkward and unrealistic
 I won't get into it too deeply, as this is not a guide, but I will say that despite being interesting and challenging when done right, transporting cargo in this game takes a lot of trial and error, as the game simply doesn't bother to give you all the information you need
 You'll start having fun with it only when you grasp the concepts it's based on (complete chains and demand base)
 3) Replacing vehicles (when they get older and need to be replaced) usually means loss of money, as the 'Auto-Replace' feature will in many cases have at least some of the cargo or the passengers on board the vehicle vanish into thin air (without paying you for the transportation), and sending vehicles to their depots manually will usually mean having to pay their maintenance costs for a long while, without being able to use them to transport anyone or anything during that time
4) Different scales - maybe the only problem on the list which also has something to do with the game-design
 As everything is obviously scaled down, there's a significant and obvious difference between the scale of the maps (including the cities) and the scale of the vehicles and stations
 This was most likely designed like this for the eye-candy effect of the moving vehicles, but I believe it has a major negative impact on the gameplay - specifically the acceleration rates of trains and airplanes, and the volume of traffic (especially trains)
Although it seems like most of this review is made up of the negatives of the game, I do recommend it, with all its flaws and problems, to anyone who likes this genre
 The game is fun to play - as long as you don't let yourself get too frustrated with the problems
